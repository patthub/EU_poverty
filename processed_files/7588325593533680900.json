        "EN 2 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. The objective of the proposal for a new financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights is to provide a legal basis for the successor programme to the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which is based on two regulations that expire end 2006 1 . 2. The new instrument, like EIDHR, will have the specific mission to assist in meeting EU policy objectives regarding the promotion of human rights and democracy in external relations, as indicated in Treaty mandates 2 and articulated in Commission communications, European Parliament resolutions and Council conclusions over the years. These objectives are of a global nature, reflected in EU Guidelines on Human Rights issues 3 and echoed in different ways in the Stabilisation and Association process 4 , the European Neighbourhood policy 5 , and in the European Consensus on Development 6 , as well as in new regional initiatives such the EU Strategy for Africa 7 and EU strategic partnership with Latin America 8 and the EU policy towards Asia 9 . The main policy framework for the EIDHR has been set by the 2000 and 2001 Commission communications 10 . 3. The new instrument, will, like EIDHR, be designed to complement the various other tools for implementation of EU policies on democracy and human rights, which range from political dialogue and diplomatic demarches to various instruments of financial and technical cooperation, including both geographic and thematic 1 Council Regulation (EC) No 975/1999, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003, Regulation (EC) No 2240/2004, and Regulation (EC) 2110/2005; Council Regulation (EC) No 976/1999, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 907/2003, Regulation (EC) No 2242/2004, and Regulation (EC) 2112/2005 2 Article 11(1) TEU; Articles 177(2), 181a(1) TEC. 3 Guidelines to EU policy towards third countries on the death penalty , June 1998; Guidelines to EU policy towards third countries on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , April 2001; EU Guidelines on children and armed conflict , December 2003; EU Guidelines on human rights defenders , June 2004. 4 Cf.

Whilst democracy and human rights objectives are increasingly \u201cmainstreamed\u201d in these various instruments, the new financing instrument will have a specific complementary role by virtue of its global nature and its independence of action. As with EIDHR, this makes possible cooperation with civil society on sensitive human rights and democracy issues, providing the flexibility to respond to changing circumstances or to support innovation, contrasting with the long term programming approach of the geographic programmes. It also provides an EC capacity to articulate and support specific objectives and measures at international level, which are neither geographically linked nor crisis related, which may require a transnational approach or involve operations both within the EU and in a range of partner countries. It provides the necessary framework for operations such as EU election observation requiring policy coherence, a unified management system and common operating standards. 5. Given the planned radical simplification of the regulatory architecture governing external assistance, the original intention of the Commission was to propose that the future framework for its specific activity on democracy and human rights, following on from the EIDHR, take the form of a Thematic Programme, using the four proposed regulations on external assistance as a legal base 11 . A Communication on a thematic programme for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide under the future Financial Perspectives (2007-2013) was thus published by the Commission in January 12 which had been prepared following consultations in the later part of 2005 13 . Consultations have continued since with a view to preparing the programming documents. 6. Given the special character of EU action on democracy and human rights, being linked to a specific Treaty mandate, the need for a separate Regulation, as opposed to a Thematic Programme, has been long been argued in particular by the European Parliament, which was at the origin of the EIDHR. Although the Commission has been aware of the concerns of the Parliament, it has wished first to ensure an inter- institutional consensus on the overarching plan for the simplification of the regulatory architecture governing external assistance. Now that this seems secure, the Commission considers it is now appropriate to propose a separate Regulation. 7. The proposal mirrors the main ideas developed in the Communication for a Thematic programme for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide under the future Financial Perspectives (2007-2013), and thus takes account of the consultations carried out in that context. No further consultations have been carried out with regard to the proposed regulation, for reasons of urgency, given the need for the Regulation to be adopted in time for operations to take place as from 2007. 11 Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on External Actions through Thematic Programmes under the Future Financial Perspectives 2007 \u2013 2013 , COM(2005) 324 final of 3 August 2005. 12 COM(2006) 23 final of 25 January 2006 13 see http://europa.eu.int/comm/external_relations/consultations/er.htm ",
        "EN 4 EN 8. The proposed instrument is based both on Article 179 (1) TEC , which covers measures in the field of development cooperation with developing countries, and on Article 181a (2) TEC , which covers measures in the field of economic, financial and technical cooperation with third countries other than developing countries. This legal basis secures a global outreach of the instrument. The Regulation in its entirety is subject to the co-decision procedure under Article 251 TEC. 9. The structure of the Regulation follows closely that of the other newly proposed financing instruments for external assistance which all are to operate within the framework of the Financial Perspectives 2007-2013 14 . The Regulation is divided into three Titles which cover the objectives and scope of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (Title I \u2013 Articles 1 to 3), general rules for the implementation of the instrument (Title II \u2013 Articles 4 to 15), and final provisions (Title III \u2013 Article 16 to 20). 10. The provision of Article 1 of Title I reflects the strategic objectives for the instrument as developed and presented in the Commission\u2019s Communication on a Thematic Programme for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide under the future Financial Perspectives (2007-2013) 15 . Article 2 refers to the fields for assistance under the instrument in pursuit of the objectives as elaborated under Article 1. The list of specific activities within each field is non-exhaustive and may be complemented in delivering assistance in response to specific needs. Article 2(3) provides for the possibility to implement Community assistance within the European Union provided the supported activity is directly related to situations arising in third countries. This particularly applies to rehabilitation centres for victims of torture based within the European Union and actions which can only be implemented outside the targeted third country. 11. Article 3 of Title I lays down general principles for the implementation of the Regulation, namely that \u2022 assistance under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights shall complement assistance provided for under other financing instruments referred to in the provision, \u2022 assistant is consistent with the relevant EU policies in the field, \u2022 coordination is ensured with respective assistance programmes of Member States, \u2022 exchanges of information are sought with the European Parliament and civil society. 12. Articles 4 to 6 of Title II describe the general procedural framework for delivering external Community assistance. This conforms to the guidelines laid down in the reform of the management of the Community\u2019s external assistance 16 , and considers the experience and innovations made since then. Article 5 lays down the procedure 14 European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument (DCECI), Instrument for Stability (IfS) 15 COM(2006) 23 final of 25 January 2006 16 On the Reform of the Management of External Assistance , SEC (2000) 814 of 16 May 2000 ",

Strategy papers are drawn up in line with the Common Framework and Procedure for Strategy Papers for the Thematic Programmes 2007-2013 17 . The strategy papers are adopted by the Commission in the form of a Commission decision after obtaining a favourable opinion by a management committee made up of representatives of the Member States and chaired by a Commission representative (Article 16). To ensure adequate complementarity of Community assistance with Member States\u2019 assistance and that of other donors and actors, consultations including with representatives of civil society, shall take place during the programming process. 13. Article 6 provides that financing decisions under the instrument generally are taken by the Commission in the form of Annual Action Programmes. based on the Strategy Papers and their revisions. The Annual Action Programme includes all types of financing in terms of Article 8 and Article 12 of this Regulation, and in particular comprises the Annual Work Programme on the basis of Article 110(1) of the Financial Regulation 18 . Amendments to the Annual Action Programme are adopted by the Commission after a favourable opinion by the management committee. In cases where amendments do not exceed 20% of the global amount allocated to the Annual Action Programme the Commission informs the management committee and the European Parliament. In exceptional cases (Article 7) and for financing Support Measures (Article 8), the Commission may take financing decisions not covered by the Strategy Papers. 14. Article 7 on Special Measures increases the Community\u2019s capacity to respond to unforeseen situations and developments and introduces a particular flexibility for the effective implementation of the Community\u2019s complementary external assistance in the field of promoting democracy and human rights. Thus, the Commission may decide on assistance measures originally not covered by Strategy Papers. As the Commission decisions are taken outside the scope of Strategy Papers as approved by the management committee, financing decisions on measures exceeding \u20ac 5 million have been made subject to a favourable opinion by the management committee. In cases where the specific assistance measure remains below \u20ac 5 million the Commission informs the management committee and the European Parliament within one month of the adoption. 15. Article 8 allows the Community to finance with operational and administrative expenditure credits Support Measures necessary for the implementation of the Regulation and for achieving its objectives. Where Support Measures are financed outside the scope of Strategy Papers, Article 8(3) provides for them to be adopted in the same manner as Special Measures. 16. Article 9 lists the entities, bodies and institutions eligible for receiving grants under this Regulation. In line with current practice and the respective provisions in other external assistance instruments, Article 9(1) provides for a broad-based eligibility, 17 Commission Working Paper approved by the Inter-service Quality Support Group on [date to be inserted] 18 Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities, OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1 ",

Article 10 allows the Commission to manage the measures financed under this Regulation using management methods provided for in the Financial Regulation (centralised management or joint management with international organisations). In accordance with Article 54 of the Financial Regulation, Article 10(2) establishes the criteria for delegating budget implementation tasks to national public-sector bodies or bodies governed by private law with a public-service mission. 18. Article 11 and 12 of Title II list the forms of budget commitments and types of financing on the basis of Commission decisions on Strategy Papers (Article 5), Annual Action Programmes (Article 6), Special Measures (Article 7) and Support Measures (Article 8). On the basis of Article 108(1)(b) of the Financial Regulation, Article 12 (c) identifies the European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation (EIUC) as a potential recipient of grants under this Regulation for securing the continuation of the European Master\u2019s Degree Programme in Human Rights and Democratisation and the EU-UN Fellowship Programme. The legal basis for the present financing of the European Inter-University Centre expires by end 2006 19 . Article 12 also opens up the possibility of cofinancing with Member States, other donor countries, international and regional organisations, and other entities. 19. Article 13 of Title II sets out the rules for participation in the award of grants and public contracts financed under this Regulation. Article 13 allows in particular natural and legal persons of third countries which open their own grant procedures and public procurement to EU Member States to take part in grant award and procurement procedures under this Regulation. The provisions comply with the abrogated Regulations on access to Community external assistance 20 . 20. Article 15 of Title II binds the Commission to monitor and review, and regularly to evaluate the effectiveness of its programming under this Regulation. Member States and the European Parliament shall receive the respective reports for their information and discussion. 21. Articles 16 to 20 of Title III comprise final provisions pertaining to the establishment of a management committee of Member States\u2019 representatives (Article 16) in accordance with the comitology decision of the Council 21 , an annual report by the Commission on the implementation of assistance measures under this Regulation (Article 17), the financial reference amount for the implementation of the Regulation (Article 18), and a review of this Regulation after four years of implementation on the basis of a Commission proposal (Article 19). 19 Decision No 791/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 establishing a Community action Programme to promote bodies active at European level and support specific activities in the field of education and training, OJ L 138, 30.4.2004, p. 31 20 OJ L 344, 27.12.2005, p. 1, OJ L 344, 27.12.2005, p. 23 21 Council Decision 1999/468/EC, OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23 ",

CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES 5.1. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy The justification for a separate thematic programme for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide common to all four new instruments derives from the fact that the promotion of democracy and human rights figures among the proposed objectives and eligible measures of all three geographic instruments (ENPI, DCECI and IPA) as well as the Instrument for Stability. Opportunities for specific interventions will arise in the context of geographic programmes. However, democracy and human rights are par excellence issues of global concern and relevance. Hence the need for an EC capacity to articulate and support specific objectives and measures at international level, which are neither geographically linked nor crisis related. Furthermore, global campaigns relating to human rights and democracy require a trans-national approach and may involve operations both within the EU and in a range of partner countries. For operations such as EU election observation, a single thematic programme is required to ensure policy coherence, a unified management system and common operating standards. 5 See points 19 and 24 of the Interinstitutional agreement.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION 6.1. Monitoring system Monitoring and evaluation of the assistance provided under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) in the past took place at four levels. First, an EC task manager follows each project and if possible visits the project during its implementation and makes a final assessment after completion. Second, EIDHR projects are included in the results based monitoring system (ROM) through which additional monitoring missions are undertaken by external consultants. Third, specific EIDHR evaluations are carried out every year covering projects in the area of a particular EIDHR objective. Finally, EIDHR projects are included in broader evaluations carried out by the RELEX family Evaluation Unit covering either a specific geographic area or a sector. This monitoring and evaluation system will continue under the proposed Regulation for a European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. 6.2. Evaluation In 2005, two EIDHR specific evaluations were completed. A general impact study on a sample of 48 completed EIDHR projects. After combining results from the different evaluation criteria, including relevance and implementation aspects, the study shows that 70% of the individual projects score excellent or good in the assessment. However, the study suggests that many organizations implementing projects have a limited understanding of the EIDHR as a global programme. Furthermore, beneficiaries and target groups should be more involved in needs ",
        "EN 29 EN assessment and formulation of projects proposals as well as in the follow-up and evaluation. Potential links and synergies with other EC or non-EC funded activities in related areas are not enough explored. A general picture of the EC emerged as not the most flexible donor but once funding is obtained there are major advantages for the beneficiary organizations. The EU is seen as a major player in the field of democracy and human rights promotion in the world and EU funding is often substantial and implies political backing for the organizations. Another evaluation covered completed projects in the area of fighting racism and xenophobia as well as promotion of rights of minorities and demonstrated that EIDHR funding in this area reached some of the most vulnerable communities in the most challenging environments in the world. Although the study did not explore the projects that were not funded, it is clear that important initiatives are being undertaken ranging from those that were usefully spending European funds on providing services of a fixed duration to mitigate the effects of racism and xenophobia, to those that were outstanding, working in the most difficult circumstances and yet applying cutting edge programming that was potentially sustainable with local ownership. EIDHR funds have given some NGOs strategic freedom to implement innovative major projects that would have been impossible without EU support and which could become models for future practice by central and local government, domestically and internationally, who have the primary long term responsibility for their people. Furthermore NGOs were able to pioneer projects and challenge policies, with their participative methodology and human rights principles adding real value and promoting trust across ethnic divides, where bureaucracies may not be trusted and conversely where governments may be constrained and do not have the confidence to take risks on unpopular minority rights issues. Through the EIDHR the EU has been able to demonstrate in practice the principles of human rights and interethnic cooperation for which it stands, while showing its commitment to civil society and support to a diversity of approaches to protect fundamental rights. In addition, a specific study \u201cGenerating impact indicators for the EIDHR\u201d was delivered. It includes proposed impact indicators at programme and project level as well as a guide for EIDHR partners on how to generate good indicators for their project. The guide is available on the EIDHR website. The result of this study served as a basis for the proposed projects impact indicators that are included in the EIDHR 2005-2006 calls for proposals to select projects under the global campaigns. Two evaluation reports have been received in 2006 covering the EC training project on civilian aspects of crises management and an Andean Programme on Human Rights. It is foreseen to undertake an additional two EIDHR specific evaluations during the year. Based on Article 15 of the proposed Regulation, monitoring and evaluation of the assistance provided under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights will continue as in previous years. 6.3.
