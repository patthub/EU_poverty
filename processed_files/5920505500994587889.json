        "Editorial In the words of Karmenu Vella, the new European Commissioner for the Envi\u00ad ronment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, \u201cgrowing numbers of businesses realise that protecting the environment is vital for maintaining Europe\u2019s com\u00ad petitiveness\u201d. So this 55 th issue of Environment for Europeans turns the spot\u00ad light to links between business and environmental protection. Commissioner Vella was speaking at the European Business Awards for the Environment on 1 December, where he highlighted the vital role that individual companies play as innovators for the benefit of our environment. A similar message emerged from the EU\u2019s Business and Biodiversity Platform, which features in this issue. EU environment ministers recently agreed to re \u00ad affirm the environmental dimension of the Europe 2020 strategy for growth and jobs, making the link between sustainability and competitiveness explicit for EU and national policy\u00admaking. The new Climate Economy Report, also covered in this issue, finds yet more evidence that economic growth can be improved and greenhouse gas emis\u00ad sions can be cut at the same time. According to the latest figures, three quarters of the public think environmen\u00ad tal issues have a similar impact on their quality of life as the economy, and almost 60 % believe that environmental factors should be as important in measuring progress as economic criteria such as GDP. For more details, see the article on attitudes of European citizens towards the environment.

        "\u00bb NATURE AND BIODIVERSITY Alien invasion! When animals, plants or micro-organisms are introduced into a natural environment where they are not normally found, they can disturb native fauna and flora, causing damage costing millions of euros. A new EU Regulation to combat the problem of \u2018invasive alien species\u2019 comes into force in January 2015. Invasive alien species have caused serious damage all over the world, reducing biodiversity, disrupting ecosystems and impacting human health and the economy. Rabbits dev\u00ad astated Australian landscapes, where they had no natu\u00ad ral predators. Red swamp crayfish, or \u2018Louisiana crayfish\u2019, disrupt European river systems by out\u00adcompeting native species and spreading diseases. European hot list The new Regulation lays down rules to tackle the problem, the most important aspect being prevention. The Commis\u00ad sion will prepare a list of \u2018invasive alien species of European Union concern\u2019, based on risk assessments. The list will be approved \u2013 with some species added or removed \u2013 by the EU Member States, and will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis. Species on this list will be banned from the EU \u2013 with no import, transport, breeding, sale, keeping or release permit\u00ad ted, apart from a very few exceptions under strictly con\u00ad trolled circumstances. Invasive alien species need EU action because they can cross national frontiers. Giant hogweed, for example, can burn human skin and eyes and costs \u20ac1 million in health\u00ad care every year in Germany alone. But an eradication pro\u00ad gramme would be undone if the plant then spread across the border from a different country not having taken similar action. The new Regulation fills a long\u00adrecognised gap in EU bio\u00ad diversity protection. It is carefully targeted, focusing on the most serious threats from invasive species. The aim is to work together within the EU to tackle a problem estimated to cost \u20ac12 billion every year. If successful, that would also be a decisive step towards meeting the EU's objective of halting the loss of biodiversity in the EU by 2020. Early-warning system The Regulation establishes a surveillance system for early detection of listed invasive alien species. The faster coun\u00ad tries react, the more effectively they will be able to eradi\u00ad cate an invasion before it spreads and becomes permanent. Member States must inform the Commission as soon as a listed species is detected so that countermeasures can be coordinated. If a listed species is already widespread, Mem\u00ad ber States have to manage it to limit any further damage, and they can choose which steps to take. The Regulation leaves room for additional national prior\u00ad ities and regional cooperation, allowing Member States to maintain their own national lists of invasive alien species. And if control of some of those species requires cooperation between countries, the Commission can facilitate this at a regional level. Citizens also have a role to play: as well as avoiding bringing alien species into the EU, there will be opportunities to par\u00ad ticipate in surveillance and early\u00adwarning systems. Speaking on behalf of the EU Presidency in autumn 2014, Italian Minister for the Environment Gian Luca Galletti said that the agreement \u201crepresents an important step in affirm\u00ad ing the value of biodiversity in Europe, which is a key factor for the development of our economy\u201d.

        "\u00bb ECONOMICS, STRATEGY AND INFORMATION Greening the economy Building a more sustainable economy will drive growth and create jobs. European environment ministers have adopted conclusions to strengthen the environmental dimension of future growth plans. The European Union\u2019s Environment Council, comprising the environment ministers of the EU Member States, agreed that \u201cthe environmental dimension of the Europe 2020 strategy should be strongly reaffirmed\u201d. In particular, the Council\u2019s con\u00ad clusions highlight the instruments that can make the economy greener and more circular, such as environmental taxation, green public procurement, eco\u00addesign and eco\u00adinnovation. This is the first time the Environment Council has adopted formal conclusions on the European Semester, the annual economic governance process through which the EU makes policy recommendations on Member States\u2019 reform pro\u00ad grammes. The Conclusions also address the greening of Europe 2020 \u2013 the EU\u2019s 10\u00adyear growth strategy to overcome the economic crisis and create jobs through smart, inclusive and sustainable growth, which is due for review in 2015. Environment gets a seat \u201cThe Council has achieved a very important political object\u00ad ive: all EU environment ministers are now demanding a strong focus on sustainability and efficient use of resources by integrating them into the 2020 strategy and therefore adding a new environmental dimension to it,\u201d said Italian Minister for the Environment Gian Luca Galletti, President of the Council. In addition, the Council called for the governance of the Europe 2020 strategy to be improved \u201cby providing for a strengthened role of the environment ministers in the Euro\u00ad pean Semester\u201d. This is to ensure that growth and jobs are built on a strong foundation of sustainability and resource efficiency \u2013 including a wider definition of \u201cgreen jobs\u201d that includes not only those directly involved in renewables and recycling, but also reflects the greening of processes, tech\u00ad nology and occupations. Finding the target Although the Council did not formally endorse a resource efficiency target, it called on the Commission \"to explore how to better integrate resource efficiency in the EU 2020 strategy, including through the introduction of an EU non\u00adbinding aspirational target\u201d. In a world where demand and competition for resources will continue to increase \u2013 already leading to resource deple\u00ad tion and a steep rise in prices for raw materials \u2013 the EU can benefit economically and environmentally from greater resource efficiency. The Commission has proposed a tar\u00ad get based on \u2018resource productivity\u2019 \u2013 GDP divided by raw material consumption. This followed calls in the 7 th Environ\u00ad ment Action Programme (agreed by the European Council and Parliament), as well as from stakeholders, to develop a resource efficiency target. The long\u00adterm objective is to decouple growth from resource use and its impacts \u2013 meaning real economic benefits. According to the Commission, improving the EU\u2019s resource productivity by 30 % by 2030 would increase GDP by up to 3 % and create around 2 million jobs, compared to a \u2018base\u00ad line\u2019 15 % improvement. The decision on including a resource efficiency target in the Europe 2020 strategy will be taken in the context of the strategy\u2019s mid\u00adterm review in 2015, taking into account con\u00ad tributions from the ongoing public consultation and the rec\u00ad ommendations of the European Resource Efficiency Platform.

        "\u00bb INDUSTRY AND TECHNOLOGY Business for biodiversity Business success can go hand in hand with protecting the environment. The European Business and Biodiversity (B@B) Platform held its first annual conference in November on the links between business and biodiversity. If you use the right business model, protecting biodiversity is good for business and good for the environment. This is the message delivered by the B@B Platform, an EU\u00adlevel forum bringing together over 170 organisations from a var\u00ad iety of sectors to develop tools and approaches that inte\u00ad grate biodiversity considerations into business practice. \u201cProtecting biodiversity creates jobs, stimulates investment and gives our European industry a competitive edge,\u201d said Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, opening the conference. \u201cFor genuine green growth we now need a paradigm shift. Europe deserves a financial and an economical triple\u00adA rat\u00ad ing. But we also want a triple\u00adA rating in our environment.\u201d Business taking the lead The conference saw businesses showcase success stories, best practices and new business models, in a programme that included sessions on the Platform\u2019s three main work streams. The first \u2013 on natural capital accounting \u2013 is based on the idea that natural resources should be regarded as capital assets in our accounting systems. Two companies \u2013 Hei\u00ad delbergCement, in Germany, and Codorn\u00edu, from Spain \u2013 revealed how tools developed by the Platform helped them choose their approach to natural capital accounting. The second work stream focused on how innovation can contribute to nature protection while creating business opportunities. ECNC, an NGO based in the Netherlands, pre\u00ad sented their \u2018waste to wear\u2019 business model, where fish\u00ad ing nets recovered from the sea are turned into textiles for making socks, carpets and swimwear. The session also featured presentations from Royal Dutch Shell on a green infrastructure project, Tractebel Engineering's \u2018temporary nature\u2019 business model, and on natural capital accounting from Landmarc Support Services. In the third session, on innovative financing for business and biodiversity, Greek Bank Group Pireus explained how they co\u00adfinance biodiversity projects with support from the Euro\u00ad pean Commission's LIFE funding programme. The Nether\u00ad lands Enterprise Agency showed how they have engaged 14 financial institutions \u2013 including venture capital and pension funds \u2013 in taking action to protect natural capital. Green infrastructure consultants Green4Cities showcased a num\u00ad ber of new business opportunities. Other sessions included presentations about actions in Ger\u00ad many and the UK, and the NGOs Global Nature Fund, the Nature Conservancy, CEEWeb and the Union for Ethical Bio\u00ad trade spoke about their experiences. Moderated by Tony Juniper, a senior environmental cam\u00ad paigner, the main discussion panel featured Commis\u00ad sioner Vella and three business leaders: Guy Sidos, CEO of the international cement company Group Vicat; Laurent Piermont, CEO of CDC Biodiversit\u00e9; and Tim Haywood, CFO and Head of Sustainability at Interserve PLC, a support ser\u00ad vice and construction company. Most of the day's presentations are available via the link below. As a next step, companies will vote to decide which topics will become the focus under each of the three work streams. The Platform also presented plans to expand membership to include more sectors \u2013 such as insurance, financial institutions, consumer goods and retail \u2013 and more national platforms.

        "\u00bb NATURE AND BIODIVERSITY Delivering for biodiversity To protect the world\u2019s natural resources, countries need to work together. Representatives from all over the world used the recent 12 th Conference of the Parties ('COP 12') meeting to assess progress. In October 2014, thousands of people representing parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, as well as NGOs, indigenous peoples, scientists and the private sector met in Pyeongchang, Korea for the 12 th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 12). Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme, underlined the economic risk to society of failing to protect biodiversity, warning that inaction would cost the world \u20ac11.3 trillion each year by 2050. He also noted the link with sustainable development, reminding the conference that \u201cbiodiversity is a powerful engine that underpins the delivery of current and future sustainable development objectives\u201d. Four years ago, COP 10 adopted the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, an overarching framework to protect global bio\u00ad diversity by 2020. The Pyeongchang meeting saw wide\u00ad spread acknowledgement of the need for more action to reach those targets, and commitments to act more urgently. With the new Gangwon Declaration, ministers made a for\u00ad mal commitment to ensuring that biodiversity would have a prominent place in the Sustainable Development Goals that are set to replace the Millennium Development Goals agreed earlier. The meeting took place against the backdrop of the UN\u2019s Global Biodiversity Outlook 4 report, which presented a mixed picture regarding progress towards the targets agreed in 2010. While nearly a quarter of countries have already surpassed one of the targets (protecting 17 % of their land for biodiversity), more action will be needed to keep the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity on track. Reaching other targets, such as halving the rate of natural habitat loss and reducing pollution, will require better monitoring and implementation, as well as improved incentives for landowners. Doubling international biodiversity funding There were some notable successes at the conference. Par\u00ad ties reiterated a previous commitment made in Hyderabad to double by 2015 the total flow of biodiversity\u00adrelated international financial resources to developing countries, in particular the least\u00addeveloped countries and Small Island Developing States, as well as countries with economies in transition, and to at least maintain support at that level until 2020. The EU is already delivering substantial funds in these areas. By 2012, annual European biodiversity\u00adrelated finance to developing countries had increased to \u20ac289 million, com\u00ad pared to the average of \u20ac190 million during 2006\u00ad10. Gov\u00ad ernments also agreed to make greater efforts to integrate biodiversity into other policy frameworks and to increase domestic funding for biodiversity, identifying ways to mobil\u00ad ise more financial resources from other sources. COP 12 hosted the first meeting of the parties to the Nagoya Protocol, which covers access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilisation, which came into force in October 2014. The Protocol aims to conserve biological diversity by ensuring the sustainable use of its components. This initial meeting took the decisions necessary to get the Protocol up and run\u00ad ning, agreeing on how an Access and Benefit\u00adsharing Clear\u00ad ing\u00adhouse would operate, for example.

        "\u00bb CLIMATE ACTION City mayors prepare for climate change More than 100 cities \u2013 from Albertslund in Denmark and Cork in Ireland, to Veria in Greece \u2013 have signed up to the European Commission\u2019s \u2018Mayors Adapt\u2019 initiative on climate change adaptation. The consequences of climate change are already being felt in Europe. And the impact of climate change will increase in the coming decades because of the delayed impacts of past and current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. By signing up to Mayors Adapt, each city commits to devel\u00ad oping a comprehensive climate adaptation strategy and/or integrating adaptation into existing plans \u2013 and this within two years. This commitment has to be followed up by pro\u00ad gress reports every two years. Cities are crucial The ability of cities to adapt to climate change is crucial to our future prosperity. According to the International Energy Agency, the world\u2019s cities account for around 70 % of global energy demand and GHG emissions. Mayors Adapt builds on the success of the Covenant of Mayors, whereby Euro\u00ad pean cities committed to ambitious efforts to reduce their emissions. Mayors Adapt is part of the first priority (Promoting action by Member States) in the European Commission\u2019s climate adaptation strategy. The other two are the promotion of better\u00adinformed decision\u00admaking about adaptation, and climate\u00adproofing EU action by promoting adaptation in key vulnerable sectors, such as agriculture, fisheries or infrastructure. There is a political commitment to spend at least 20 % of the EU budget for 2014\u00ad2020 on climate action through the European Structural and Investment Funds, including the Regional Development Fund, among others. Cities will also be able to tap into funds from the Commission\u2019s new \u20ac864\u00admillion LIFE Climate Action programme, which sup\u00ad ports both adaptation and mitigation. Mayors Adapt puts emphasis on practical support for cities that sign up to the initiative. A web\u00adbased helpdesk shares information on operational questions, as well as guidance materials and tools for planning and measuring adaptation initiatives. Cities can exchange data and experiences, and benchmark their performance against others participating in the initiative. The Commission plans to organise an annual signature ceremony to honour the leadership shown by Mayors Adapt cities and help them build capacity for adaptation.

Parts of central Prague were submerged, resulting in billions of euros of damage to the historic city centre. Bratislava also witnessed very high water levels, but was largely spared due to flood\u00adprotection measures it had taken previously. After the 2002 floods, tens of millions of euros were spent on additional flood\u00adprevention measures in both cities. So, when floods hit again in late May and early June 2013, the damage in Prague was much reduced. Emergency preparations and flood defences in Bratislava helped avoid substantial damage, despite the highest flow rate ever recorded. Such measures can be very effective. Estimates say that for each euro spent on flood protection, we could avoid six euros of damage costs.

        "\u00bb CLIMATE ACTION EU leads on climate action EU Member States agreed in October to reduce their domestic greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 by at least 40 % compared to their 1990 emission levels. EU leaders also agreed to an EU-wide binding target for renewable energy \u2013 and an indicative one for energy efficiency \u2013 of at least 27 %. The ambitious climate and energy targets for 2030 agreed by EU leaders have injected new momentum into the global climate negotiations. The target of at least 40 % emissions reduction will be used as input for the EU\u2019s contribution to the global climate agreement to be concluded in Paris in December 2015. The EU was the first major economy to declare its position, followed by announcements from the US and China on their future targets. \u201c With our new 2030 climate and energy package we have reconfirmed our confidence in a more energy- efficient, low-carbon economy, which is a cornerstone of the energy union. \u201d Only emission reductions achieved within the EU will count towards its target. Previously, companies could fund pol\u00ad lution\u00adreduction projects abroad as an inexpensive way to meet their emission reduction requirements. Vice\u00adPresident for the Energy Union, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, empha\u00ad sised that: \u201cWith our new 2030 climate and energy package we have reconfirmed our confidence in a more energy\u00ad efficient, low\u00adcarbon economy, which is a cornerstone of the energy union.\u201d Emissions trading \u2013 a crucial tool The EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) will be a crucial tool for the EU to achieve its greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal cost\u00adeffectively. The ETS is a \u2018cap\u00adand\u00adtrade\u2019 system that sets a cap on the level of emissions allowed from more than 12 000 major industrial installations across Europe. The cap is subsequently reduced over time to ensure total emissions fall. To meet the new 2030 emissions reduction target, those industrial installations will have to reduce their collective emissions by 43 % compared to 2005. The EU ETS has been the cornerstone of the EU climate pol\u00ad icy since its introduction, and emissions from installations covered in the scheme have been falling. However, during the economic downturn, emissions from Europe\u2019s industries fell more than anticipated. This built up a surplus of emis\u00ad sion allowances on the market, repressing the economic incentive for industries to invest in emissions reduction. To avoid a repeat of the problems caused by surplus allow\u00ad ances, EU leaders confirmed at their October meeting that a well\u00adfunctioning and reformed ETS with an instrument to stabilise the market is essential to achieve the 2030 tar\u00ad get. The instrument proposed by the Commission \u2013 a mar\u00ad ket stability reserve \u2013 will hold back allowances from the market when surplus is large and release them when the number of allowances in circulation is low, according to a clear set of pre\u00addefined rules. Sectors outside the scope of the EU ETS, such as transport, agriculture and buildings, will need to lower emissions by 30 % compared to 2005. This will be translated into binding national targets. Meeting the investment challenge EU leaders have agreed on using EU ETS allowances to help address the investment challenge in meeting the 2030 tar\u00ad gets. Under the EU ETS, some 400 million allowances will be reserved to finance low\u00adcarbon innovations through an innovation fund. This enlarges the previous innovation fund, NER300, by increasing the number of reserved allow\u00ad ances and extending the fund\u2019s reach to include innovations in industrial sectors as well as demonstration projects in renewable energy sources and carbon capture and storage. 8 KH-AD-14-055-EN-C.indd 8 11/02/15 11:54 ",
        "During the period 2021\u00ad30, 2 % of EU ETS allowances will be reserved for a modernisation fund that will be used to fund energy\u00adefficiency improvements and modernisation of the energy system in low\u00adincome EU countries, where investment needs are higher relative to GDP compared to the EU average. The existing mechanism foreseen in the EU ETS, which allows some Member States to hand out free allowances to power plants to promote investments towards modernising the energy sector, will also be continued after 2020.

        "\u00bb CLIMATE ACTION Climate report: it is time to act In November, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the Synthesis Report of its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5): the most comprehensive analysis of climate change ever undertaken, combining the work of hundreds of scientists around the world. The assessment of the scientific literature leaves no room for doubt: climate change is happening and the time to act is now. Global greenhouse gas emissions are higher than at any time in the last 800 000 years, bringing unprecedented changes to the climate system. There is no longer any ques\u00ad tion that human activities make a major contribution. Both the atmosphere and seas have warmed, with oceans \u2013 the largest carbon sink in the world \u2013 also becoming more acidic as they absorb increasing amounts of CO 2 . Amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea levels have risen. Extreme weather and climate events have increased, affecting the lives of thousands of people, especially in less\u00ad developed countries, as well as natural ecosystems. But the report also shows that it is not too late for humanity to react. Warming can be kept below the dangerous \u2018tipping point\u2019 of 2 \u00b0C, but only if the world unites to cut emissions. Otherwise, scientists predict temperatures could rise by more than 4 \u00b0C within this century. \u201cScience has once again made the case clear,\u201d said EU Cli\u00ad mate Action and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete. \u201cThe spotlight is now on us as policy\u00admakers. That's why in Europe we have done our homework by adopting ambi\u00ad tious 2030 targets. Now our global partners must follow suit and step up to the plate.\u201d In October, the EU agreed new climate and energy targets for 2030, including reducing domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 % below the 1990 level. Delay will be costly It is possible to move to a low\u00adcarbon economy, says the IPCC report. Many options already exist for mitigating cli\u00ad mate change through substantial cuts in emissions over the next few decades. However, delaying action beyond 2030 would increase the technological, economic, social and insti\u00ad tutional challenges. Cost estimates vary, but the report concludes that ambi\u00ad tious measures to mitigate climate change would probably cut global economic growth by only about 0.06 percent\u00ad age points, without taking account of the many health and social benefits. Today, the cost is manageable, whereas tomorrow, dealing with the impact of irreversible climate change due to a failure to act would be much more diffi\u00ad cult and expensive. The IPCC calls not only for cuts in emissions, but also meas\u00ad ures to adapt to those impacts of climate change that cannot now be avoided. Both approaches require effective governance, investment in green technologies and infra\u00ad structure, and changes in lifestyle. The AR5 is the work of hundreds of scientists, with over 830 authors and editors from more than 80 countries, and draws on tens of thousands of scientific papers covering a range of scientific, technical and socio\u00adeconomic issues. According to the IPCC, humanity has a brief window of opportunity to keep warming below 2 \u00b0C.

        "\u00bb INDUSTRY AND TECHNOLOGY Green business: the best of the best From sustainable fish and chips in compostable packaging to building insulation made from recycled waste paper \u2013 16 companies from 10 EU and candidate countries were shortlisted for one of this year\u2019s European Business Awards for the Environment. Europe\u2019s businesses have a huge part to play in delivering a cleaner environment and a sustainable future \u2013 using their innovative skills to protect the environment while creating jobs and improving competitiveness. The European Commis\u00ad sion has been recognising the efforts of companies, big and small, with the European Business Awards for the Environ\u00ad ment every two years since 1987. The Awards are for companies whose eco\u00adinnovation suc\u00ad cessfully combines vision, innovation, competitiveness and outstanding environmental performance. To ensure the win\u00ad ners are the best of the best, the jury selected a shortlist of 16 from 152 submissions, originating from 22 EU Mem\u00ad ber States and candidate countries. All entries had to have been entered in a national award scheme to be eligible to compete at the European level \u2013 much like a \u2018Champions League\u2019 of eco\u00adinnovation. \u201cThe companies shortlisted for the European Business Awards for the Environment have a proven track record in combining business success and respect for the environ\u00ad ment,\u201d said former European Commissioner for the Environ\u00ad ment Janez Poto\u010dnik. \u201cThey showcase real\u00adworld experience of the fruits of eco\u00adinnovation.\u201d A green \u2018Champions League\u2019 There are five Award categories: \u2022 Products and Services , with three entries shortlisted from 50 entries; \u2022 Processes , with three finalists from 49 entries; \u2022 Management , with a shortlist of four narrowed down from 38; \u2022 International Business Cooperation \u2013 a final three selected from 15 submissions; and \u2022 Business and Biodiversity for one of three finalists from 33 entries. This year featured some intriguing entries. In the Manage\u00ad ment award category, for example, the Bay Fish & Chips shop, near Aberdeen in the United Kingdom, uses sustaina\u00ad ble fish, energy\u00adefficient cookers and renewable energy, as well as recycling all food waste and sending waste oil to be up\u00adscaled to biofuel. The shop also uses fully compostable, plant\u00adbased packaging supplied by Vegware, a UK nominee for the Product award, which makes a range of disposable plates, cups, trays, cutlery and boxes from renewable or recycled materials that can be further recycled along with food waste. The Business and Biodiversity shortlist included entries such as Androm\u00e8de Oc\u00e9anologie of France, with a smartphone app providing location\u00adbased anchoring information to pro\u00ad tect seagrass on the Mediterranean sea floor, and Red El\u00e9c\u00ad trica in Spain which has designed electrical distribution and grounding cables to lower the electrocution risk for birds. Other nominees in various categories included AusDesign\u2019s UpShirt, a T\u00adshirt produced entirely from production left\u00ad overs, and Werro Wool\u2019s recyclable cellulose building insu\u00ad lation made from recycled waste paper, both from Estonia. And in the Netherlands, Interface was shortlisted for mak\u00ad ing \u2018Net\u00adWorks\u2019 carpet tiles from netting recovered from beaches \u2013 an economic opportunity for coastal villagers in developing countries.

        "\u00bb ECONOMICS, STRATEGY AND INFORMATION Strong support for green policies More than 95 % of Europeans say that protecting the environment is important to them. Green sectors of the economy continue to grow despite the economic crisis \u2013 showing that protecting the environment and maintaining competitiveness go hand in hand. A new Eurobarometer survey confirms the overwhelming public support for environmental protection \u2013 with just 5 % saying it was not important. The new survey, \u2018Attitudes of European citizens towards the environment\u2019, found that three\u00adquarters of EU citizens think environmental issues have a similar impact on their quality of life as the economy. In particular, more than half of the population worry about air and water pollution, with waste and depletion of natural resources also ranking as top concerns. An increasing number \u2013 now almost three in five \u2013 believe that environmental factors should be as important in meas\u00ad uring progress as economic criteria such as GDP. The same number also think that public spending decisions by their national authorities should favour environmental consider\u00ad ations over cost. Pitching in for the environment The survey \u2013 the first of its kind since 2011 on attitudes towards the environment \u2013 found that 85 % of Europeans believe they can play a role in protecting the environment. Three\u00adquarters of the public are now ready to buy greener products even if they cost more \u2013 an increase over the last three years. And Europeans are being more sustainable in their everyday activities, such as sorting waste for recycling (72 %), or cutting their energy (52 %) and water (37 %) con\u00ad sumption. \u201cPeople are particularly concerned about air and water pollution, the amount of waste and the health impact of chemicals used in their everyday life,\u201d said former European Commissioner for the Environment, Janez Poto\u010dnik, \u201cand they feel that more must be done by everyone to protect the environment.\u201d Better environment, better economy The survey interviewed almost 28 000 EU citizens across all 28 Member States in April and May 2014, finding that three\u00adquarters of Europeans think environmental protection and resource efficiency is good for growth and the economy \u2013 with a majority feeling that more can be done by citizens, national governments and industry. More than 90 % agree that polluters should pay for the damage they cause. In particular, the role of the EU receives strong support \u2013 with over half of Europeans wanting the Union to do more. Three\u00adquarters of citizens see the need for European legis\u00ad lation to protect the environment in their country and agree that the EU should be able to check that environmental laws are applied correctly. Meanwhile, six out of ten think that environmental decisions should be taken jointly at the EU level, and 84 % want more EU funding to support environmentally friendly actions. \u201cIt is good to see such solid and widespread support for the protection of the environment, even in difficult times,\u201d said former Commissioner Poto\u010dnik.

        "\u00bb INTERNATIONAL ISSUES Setting Sustainable Development Goals The European Union and United Nations are working to establish Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a new framework to address global poverty and sustainable development for all in the years ahead. Projections show the global population will exceed 9 billion by 2050. The challenge facing the world is how to recon\u00ad cile economic development and improvements in people\u2019s well\u00adbeing with sustainability and the needs of the envir\u00ad onment. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) reach their deadline in 2015 and have seen progress and success on many fronts: child and maternal mortality rates have dropped, deaths from malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis have been cut, and the target of halving the percentage of people going hungry is reachable. Setting the agenda As the world\u2019s largest aid donor, the EU has a key role to play in setting the international development agenda. \u2018A Decent Life for All: from vision to collective action\u2019 \u2013 a paper adopted by the Commission in June 2014 \u2013 sets out a framework that covers poverty, inequality, health, food security, education, gender equality, access to water, sanitation and sustainable energy. It goes notably further than the MDGs in areas such as decent work, inclusive and sustainable growth, sustainable consumption and produc\u00ad tion, biodiversity, land degradation and protecting the seas and oceans. The paper puts particular emphasis on the importance of good governance, peaceful societies and the rule of law, proposing a \u201crights\u00adbased approach\u201d that promotes justice, equality, democracy, the empowerment of women and gen\u00ad der equality. In terms of implementation, it insists on accountability, transparency and effective review of progress towards the SDGs. And these new goals should be evidence\u00adbased, spe\u00ad cific, measurable, achievable, relevant and \u2018time bound\u2019. Summing it up, former EU Environment Commissioner Janez Poto\u010dnik noted that a new framework was needed to rally the international community, \"to tackle the intertwined chal\u00ad lenges of eliminating poverty and improving well\u00adbeing, while ensuring that progress is sustainable within planetary boundaries\". The UN post\u00ad2015 agenda should be universal and provide a comprehensive response for all, he said. The road beyond 2015 The Commission continues to contribute to the UN\u2019s Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, whose July conclusions were discussed at the UN General Assem\u00ad bly in September. Many of the conclusions are in line with the approach recommended by the Commission, with a sim\u00ad ilar range of policy areas and targets. A synthesis report by the UN Secretary\u00adGeneral adopted in December 2014 will form the basis of intergovernmental negotiations on the SDGs during 2015.

        "\u00bb CLIMATE ACTION Opportunities in emissions reductions According to the 2014 New Climate Economy Report, the fight against climate change will create new opportunities to grow the economy. It is not a case of either emissions reduction or growth \u2013 they can be achieved side by side. The Report, entitled \u2018Better growth, better climate\u2019, was pub\u00ad lished recently by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, a group of business, science and former gov\u00ad ernment leaders, advised by renowned economists. According to the authors, for example, more compact and connected cities \u2013 needed to lower greenhouse gas emis\u00ad sions \u2013 could also reduce urban infrastructure capital requirements over the next 15 years by over US$3 trillion (\u20ac2.4 trillion). Nonetheless, around US$90 trillion (\u20ac71.2 trillion) is likely to be invested in infrastructure in the world\u2019s urban, land\u00aduse and energy systems by 2030. This will help to drive low\u00ad carbon growth and create jobs, as well as improve health and the quality of life, the authors suggest. Global Action Plan The Report puts forward a 10\u00adpoint Global Action Plan (see box) aimed at accelerating the transition to a low\u00adcarbon future. The first six points focus on the conditions necessary to foster low\u00adcarbon and climate\u00adresilient investment and growth. The final four highlight opportunities to drive growth and lower climate risk. The EU is already working on putting the recommendations into action in virtually all areas. For example, the Report highlights the role of carbon pricing as a key tool in realising the transition to low\u00adcarbon economies. Here, the EU Emis\u00ad sions Trading Scheme has been a global pioneer in putting a price on carbon. The Commission is integrating climate goals across all its policies. And it promotes many cross\u00adcutting initiatives in sectors such as land use and city planning. Lead-up to 2020 \u201cLeading economic experts conclude in this report that we can achieve both better growth and better climate at the same time,\u201d commented the former European Commis\u00ad sioner for Climate Action, Connie Hedegaard. \u201cThe political choice should not be that difficult.\u201d Pursuing low\u00adcost, high\u00adimpact opportunities now, to reduce carbon emissions leading up to 2020, will help smooth the way for an international agreement on emissions reduction in Paris in 2015.
