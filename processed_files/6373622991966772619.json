European Parliament resolution on the period of reflection: the structure, subjects and context for an assessment of the debate on the European Union. References: European Parliament resolution on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe: OJ C 247 E, 6.10.2005; Bull. 1/2-2005, point 1.1.1 Commission communication \u2014 \u2018The Commis- sion\u2019s contribution to the period of reflection and beyond: Plan D for democracy, dialogue and debate\u2019 \u2014 Bull. 10-2005, point 1.1.3 Committee of the Regions opinion: Bull. 10- 2005, point 1.1.4 European Economic and Social Committee opin- ion: Bull. 10-2005, point 1.1.5 Adopted on 19 January. The European Parliament has declared it its duty and that of the national parliaments, to contribute to the period of reflec- tion on the constitutional future of Europe. Con- vinced that the Treaty of Nice is not a viable basis for the continuation of the European integration process, it confirms its determination to achieve a constitutional settlement which strengthens par- liamentary democracy, transparency and the rule of law, anchors fundamental rights, develops cit- izenship, and enhances the capacity of the Union to act effectively both at the internal level and on the international scene. It thus proposes that the conclusions of the period of reflection be formu- lated during the second half of 2007 and all pos- sible efforts be made to guarantee that the Con- stitution will enter into force in 2009. In addition, it believes that a positive outcome of the period of reflection would be that the current text be maintained, although this would only be possible if accompanied by significant measures to reas- sure and convince public opinion.

Reference: Special Report No 5/2005 of the Court of Auditors: Bull. 9-2005, point 1.9.6 Adopted on 14 February. The Council welcomed the Court\u2019s special report on interpretation expen- diture incurred by three institutions and consid- ered it very useful as the audit covers the period of the accession of 10 new Member States, increasing the number of official and working languages to 21. It noted with satisfaction that the institutions have been successful in containing interpretation expenditure, but regretted that a sub- stantial amount has been spent for interpretation services requested but not used because of late meeting cancellations. The Council recommended that efforts be made to reduce these cancellations, underlining that further savings are possible. The Council stressed the need to maintain the high quality of interpretation provided in the institu- tions, as well as the availability of interpretation services in all languages, while controlling costs. It agreed that procedures to avoid the provision of interpretation services exceeding real require- ments are an absolute necessity for all institutions. Finally, the Council asked for an independent evaluation concerning the possible costs and ben- efits of the creation of one single interinstitutional office providing interpretation services to all EU institutions, compared with those achieved by increased interinstitutional cooperation.

The Commission submit- ted its annual report on the Lisbon strategy which is devoted to achieving increased growth and employment. There are three main elements in the progress report. The Commission analysed the 25 new national reform programmes submitted by Member States in October 2005, and noted the strong points in each national programs with a view to promoting the exchange of good ideas between Member States. The report highlights the sectors in which there are shortcomings and proposes con- crete actions in the hope of remedying them, at both the European Union and national levels. In addi- tion, the Commission defines four priority action areas: investing more in knowledge and innovation; unlocking the business potential, particularly of small and medium-sized enterprises; delivering more and better jobs in the face of globalisation and ageing; moving towards an efficient and integrated EU energy policy. For each of these areas, the Com- mission\u2019s report makes clear proposals for Euro- pean leaders to commit to when they next meet. COM(2006) 30 1.2.6.

In the hope that commu- nication becomes a real European Union informa- tion policy, the Commission proposed to reform its own communication activities, in order to get closer to citizens and to be more responsive to their concerns. The main purpose of the White Paper is to mobilise all key actors (EU institutions and bodies, Member States, regional and local author- ities, political parties and civil society). This White Paper proposes five areas where joint action should be taken: defining common principles for com- munication on European issues, empowering citi- zens, working with the media and new technolo- gies, understanding public opinion, and doing the job together. At the end of the six-month consul- tation period, the Commission will summarise the replies and draw conclusions, with a view to pro- posing plans of action for each working area. The proposals to create a European press agency with the modernisation of what already exists, and a European Institute for Teacher Training, are both included in this document, which moreover sug- gests appointing goodwill ambassadors from the cultural, academic and sporting elite of Europe.

References: Council Directive 2000/43/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irre- spective of racial or ethnic origin: OJ L 180, 19.7.2000; Bull. 6-2000, point 1.3.19 Council Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employ- ment and occupation: OJ L 303, 2.12.2000; Bull. 11-2000, point 1.3.19 Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union: OJ C 364, 18.12.2000; Bull. 12-2000, point 1.2.2 Adopted on 18 January. Parliament called for action at EU and national levels to eradicate homo- phobia and promote a culture of freedom, tolerance and equality among citizens and in legal systems. It condemned any discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and recommends to step up the fight against homophobia through education as well as through administrative, judicial and legislative means. Parliament also called on Member States to ensure that lesbian, homosexual, bisexual and trans- gender (LGBT) persons are protected from homo- phobic hate speech and violence and to ensure that same-sex partners enjoy the same respect, dignity and protection as the rest of society. 1.4.3. European Parliament decision setting up a temporary committee on the alleged use of Euro- pean countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners. Reference: European Parliament resolution on the presumed use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of pris- oners: Bull. 12-2005, point 1.2.7 Adopted on 18 January. Parliament decided to set up a temporary committee to accompany the enquiry pending at the Council of Europe on the presumed use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of pris- oners. The committee will collect and analyse information to find out whether the CIA or other US agents or intelligence services of other third countries have carried out abductions, \u2018extraordi- nary rendition\u2019, detention at secret sites, deten- tion incommunicado or torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners on the territory of the European Union, including accession and candidate countries, or have used that territory to those ends, for example through flights. The committee will also attempt to deter- mine whether Member States, public officials, persons acting in an official capacity or European Union institutions have been involved or com- plicit in the alleged offences. Parliament asked the committee to submit any recommendations to the plenary and to present an interim report to Parliament within four months after it has started its work. 1.4.4.

        "Human rights 12 Bull. EU 1/2-2006 Adopted on 2 February. Parliament called for men\u2019s violence against women to be regarded as the main impediment to efforts to overcome inequality between women and men and as a vio- lation of human rights, reflecting unequal gender power relations. The Parliament asked the Com- mission and Member States to adopt an all- encompassing policy approach to combat vio- lence against women, including effective methods of prevention and punishment. It called on Mem- ber States to establish partnership schemes between law-enforcement authorities, NGOs, refuges for victims and other appropriate author- ities, to intensify cooperation to ensure the effec- tive implementation of existing laws, and to raise the awareness of issues relating to men\u2019s violence against women. 1.4.5. Proposal for a European Parliament and Council recommendation on the protection of minors and human dignity and the right of reply in relation to the competitiveness of the European audiovisual and information services industry ( \u2192 point 1.13.9). 1.4.6.

General 1.4.7. Proposal for a Council regulation estab- lishing a European Union Agency for Funda- mental Rights; proposal for a Council decision empowering the agency to pursue its activities in areas referred to in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union . Regulation to be repealed: Council Regulation (EC) No 1035/97 establishing a European Moni- toring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia: OJ L 151, 10.6.1997; Bull. 6-1997, point 1.2.3 Commission proposal: COM(2005) 280; Bull. 6- 2005, point 1.2.2 European Economic and Social Committee opin- ion delivered on 14 February. The Committee congratulated the European Council on its deci- sion to create a European Agency for Funda- mental Rights. It was nevertheless concerned by the fact that the proposal does not favour a large representation of civil society within the agency\u2019s board of management and its forum of funda- mental rights. The Committee recommended that one of the agency\u2019s main objectives be to formu- late recommendations which the institutions, organs, offices and agencies could use to adopt measures and formulate actions in the area of fundamental rights. It also underlined that the agency should be encouraged by the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission to determine the compatibility between the Charter of Fundamental Rights and all new legislative proposals or community policy. It also high- lighted that the agency\u2019s thematic action areas, in the context of the multi-annual programme, should always include issues such as the fight against racism and xenophobia. The Committee also stressed the importance for the agency to remain independent from European institutions and Member States. Actions outside the European Union 1.4.8.

        "Human rights Bull. EU 1/2-2006 13 Adopted on 17 January. Parliament called for the EU to set visible and credible targets to drasti- cally reduce the number of victims of trafficking over the next 10 years. It noted that the penalties for the sexual exploitation of women and chil- dren in Member States have still not been har- monised, despite the adoption of Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA on combating trafficking in human beings, and that trafficking is the fastest-growing criminal activity in comparison with other forms of organised crime. Parliament advocated the building of effective prevention strategies and the development of a coherent action among international organisations and countries, including the review of visa policies in Member States in order to prevent abuse and pro- vide protection against exploitation. It called for measures to be taken to raise awareness amongst vulnerable groups and to combat the use of the Internet to disseminate illegal information. Par- liament also called for the launch of an EU-wide anti-trafficking day and recommended the setting- up of international helplines. 1.4.9.

Parliament called for the human rights and democracy clause in the agreements of the European Union with third countries to be improved and for it to be gener- ally extended to all countries and all kinds of agreements, including trade and sector-specific agreements. Parliament believes this move would contribute to the eradication of poverty and pro- mote democracy and human rights, ensure reci- procity of the clause, prevent the practice of a double standards policy depending on the impor- tance of the partner and allow Parliament to play its role fully in the implementation of the clause. Parliament pledged to no longer give its assent to agreements that do not comprise the clause on human rights and democracy. It also considered that, with countries covered by EU neighbour- hood policy, the EU should sign agreements going further, based on the sharing of institutions and common values. 1.4.11. European Parliament resolution on the right to freedom of expression and respect for religious beliefs. Adopted on 16 February. In the aftermath of the violence resulting from the publication of car- toons of the prophet Mohammed in the European media, Parliament underlined that freedom of expression is a fundamental value of the EU. It also pointed out that freedom of expression must be exercised within the limits of the law and should coexist with personal responsibility and be based on respect for others\u2019 rights and sensi- bilities. It acknowledged that balancing these con- cerns should stimulate an ongoing democratic debate and it strongly condemned the recent vio- lent protests in certain Muslim countries. Belarus 1.4.12.

Parliament highlighted concerns at recent arrests and legal proceedings in Cambodia, concerned that such incidents fall foul of the government\u2019s pledges to donors and local people to build a more open, democratic and fair society. The constant arrests of opposition leaders, trade union leaders, journalists and rep- resentatives of NGOs send an unfortunate mes- sage to donors, Parliament explained, calling on the EU to continue its financial support to help improve the human rights situation. Parliament called on the country to respect its international obligations, including the cooperation agreement with the EU, and repeated its desire for a special Parliament delegation to be sent to Cambodia.

Council conclusions on the quality of pub- lic finances. Adopted on 24 January . The Council welcomed the report prepared by the Economic Policy Committee (EPC) on challenges and progress made in improving the quality of public expen- diture. While underlining that the composition of public finances, budgetary laws, fiscal frame- works and institutions are issues of national responsibility, the Council acknowledged the increasing importance of the quality of public finances in national and EU economic policy- making. The Council also stressed the importance of further improving efficiency and effectiveness of public spending in order to enhance the qual- ity of public finances. It called on the EPC to fur- ther develop the measurement of public expendi- ture efficiency by assisting Member States in improving the information content of budgets and exchanging of best practices in the evaluation of public spending. Finally, the Council agreed to come back to these issues in the autumn of 2006. 1.5.2.

In the current context of persistently weak growth affecting the euro area and faced with the chal- lenges of globalisation and demographic changes, the Committee underlined the necessity to set up a coordinated macropolicy. It believes, as does the Commission, that Member States should adopt a budget policy which is concurrent to their commitments so as to mitigate the confidence cri- sis affecting the larger euro area economies. The Committee also supported the Commission when it called for the modernisation of the social secu- rity systems, in order to ensure their viability and to make it possible for social partners and for the governments of Member States to reach a balance between flexibility and safety which is favourable to innovation. It believed that a macroeconomic policy is just as important as microeconomic reforms are necessary in order to increase growth potential, keeping in mind that the maximum degree of market integration does not correspond in all cases to the optimal level of integration. Lastly, regarding the knowledge society, the Committee considered that it is extremely impor- tant to establish suitable orientations in the fields of education and lifelong training, equal oppor- tunities, aid for the family, education, and research and innovation. Moreover, the Commit- tee underlined the need to pay particular atten- tion to promote entrepreneurship. Stability and Growth Pact General 1.5.3.

Adopted at its sesssion of 15 and 16 February. Concerned by the impasse in European economic governance, the Committee noted that the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact remains incom- plete. Although this pact played a fundamental part in ensuring European economic growth in the context of monetary stability, it did not pro- vide sufficient coordination in economic gover- nance at a time when international economical ",
        "Economic and monetary policy Bull. EU 1/2-2006 17 tensions are strong. The Committee also men- tioned the need to evaluate the process of reform which the pact had recently undergone and to outline a new course which would strengthen European economic governance. Excessive deficit procedure Italy 1.5.4. Communication from the Commission to the Council on the action taken by Italy in response to the Council recommendations under the excessive deficit procedure.

The Commission is of the opinion that the Italian government has taken action consistent with Council recommendations: the 2005 deficit target appears to have been achieved; the 2006 Budget Law, if fully imple- mented, and assuming GDP growth develops as expected, will deliver the structural adjustment required by the Council; the deficit target for 2007 has been set below 3% of GDP; the debt is planned to return on a declining path; and, sta- tistics have improved. While no further steps under the excessive deficit procedure appear needed at present, the significant uncertainties surrounding budgetary outcomes will require a close monitoring of budgetary developments in the coming months.

Although not a participant in the third stage of economic and monetary union, the United King- dom is obliged, under Article 116(4) of the EC Treaty, to \u2018endeavour to avoid excessive deficits\u2019. In the light of both the assessment contained in its report concerning the United Kingdom (Arti- cle 104(3) of the EC Treaty) and of the opinion given by the Council\u2019s economic and financial committee, the Commission considered that the government deficit is neither temporary nor exceptional and exceeds the reference value of 3% of gross domestic product (GDP). The Com- mission therefore advised the Council of the exis- tence of an excessive deficit. In a first recommendation, the Commission invited the Council to adopt, in accordance with Article 104(6) of the EC Treaty, a decision estab- lishing the existence of an excessive deficit in the United Kingdom. In a second recommendation, the Commission suggested that the Council should adopt a rec- ommendation addressed to national authorities (in application of Article 104(7) of the EC Treaty), urging them to put an end to the present excessive deficit situation as rapidly as possible, from the 2006/07 financial year at the latest, and to improve the structural balance by at least 0.5% of GDP between the 2005/06 and 2006/07 financial years.

The Commission has assessed that the United Kingdom\u2019s deficit exceeded the maximum reference value provided for by the European Union Treaty since the 2003/04 financial year, and will continue to exceed 3% of gross domestic product in 2006/07, despite fiscal measures announced in December 2005. In such circumstances, the excess can no longer be considered as exceptional or temporary. The Council has given the UK six months to present corrective action. It requires the excessive deficit to be brought to an end by the 2006/07 financial year at the latest, with at least a 0.5% of GDP improvement in structural balance between the 2005/06 and 2006/07 financial years.

SEC(2006) 108 Adopted by the Council on 14 February. The Council considered the updated stability pro- gramme of Belgium, covering the period from 2005 to 2009, to be broadly in line with the requirements of the revised code of conduct on the content and format of stability and conver- gence programmes. Based on a plausible macro- economic scenario, the programme aims at keep- ing the general government budget in balance until 2006 and in growing surplus thereafter. It largely confirms the budgetary strategy outlined in the previous programme. The Belgian author- ities have set the medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position at a surplus of 0.5% of GDP in structural terms (i.e. cyclically adjusted and net of one-off and temporary meas- ures). While the budgetary outcomes could be worse than targeted in the programme, the Bel- gian authorities have demonstrated a strong com- mitment to achieving their balanced budget tar- gets in the past. The budgetary stance may not be sufficient to reach the MTO by 2007 (as planned) but ensures an appropriate structural position as well as a safety margin against breaching the 3% of GDP deficit threshold with normal macroeconomic fluctuations in each year. The adjustment path can be considered as broadly appropriate in view of the ambitious MTO, except in 2006 when the structural bal- ance is planned to deteriorate. The debt ratio is planned to decline from 94% of GDP in 2005 to less than 80% in 2009 and approaches the 60% reference value at a rapid pace. As regards long- term sustainability, Belgium is at medium risk on grounds of the projected budgetary costs of ageing populations. The Council called on Bel- gium to consider taking measures in order to avoid deteriorating the structural balance in 2006 and to implement measures necessary in order to achieve ambitious budgetary objectives in the following years.

SEC(2006) 25 Adopted by the Council on 24 January. The Council considered that the Czech Republic\u2019s updated convergence programme for 2005\u201308 complied broadly with the requirements of the revised code of conduct on the content and format of stability and convergence programmes. Based on a plausible macroeconomic scenario that becomes somewhat favourable in the final year of the programme period, the programme aims at correcting the excessive deficit by 2008, relying mainly on expenditure restraint. The budgetary targets are unchanged compared with the previous update of the programme. The medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position set in the programme is a deficit of \u2018around 1%\u2019 of GDP in cyclically adjusted terms and net of one- off and temporary measures, which is in line with the pact but which is targeted to be reached only beyond the programme horizon, namely by 2012. Given that the risks attached to the budgetary tar- gets are broadly balanced, the fiscal stance in the programme seems consistent with a correction of the excessive deficit by 2008. While the debt ratio is targeted to remain broadly constant at a rela- tively low level of 37\u201338% of GDP, the budget- ary costs of an ageing population are projected to be very significant so that the Czech Republic is at high risk as regards the long-term sustainabil- ity of its public finances. The Council recom- mends the Czech Republic to strengthen the fiscal adjustment effort, to enhance the quality of bud- getary planning by analysing causes of significant expenditure carryovers and reinforcing the expen- diture ceilings and to improve the long-term sustainability of public finances through pension and healthcare reforms. Denmark 1.5.9. Council opinion in accordance with Arti- cle 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated convergence pro- gramme of Denmark, 2005\u201310.

SEC(2006) 22 Adopted by the Council on 24 January. The Council considered that as a non-member of the euro area Denmark\u2019s updated convergence pro- gramme for 2005\u201310 complied broadly with the requirements of the revised code of conduct on the content and format of stability and conver- gence programmes. Based on a cautious macro- economic scenario, with technically assumed low GDP growth rates in 2007 and 2008, the update foresees a general government surplus of 3.6% in 2005, 3.1% in 2006, 3.2% in 2007, 2.7% in 2008 and 2.9% in the final year, 2010. Both expenditure and revenue ratios are on a gradually declining trend over the projection period. The programme does not explicitly identify a medium-term objective (MTO) but aims at a structural surplus of 1.5\u20132.5% of GDP on aver- age over the programme period, which can be considered as the programme\u2019s ambitious MTO. This fulfils the aim of providing a safety margin and is significantly more demanding than required by the Stability and Growth Pact. The programme explains that the MTO is set at a more demanding level than required by the pact to set a sound basis for long-term fiscal sustain- ability through a rapid debt reduction. Given the cautious growth assumptions, the risks to the budgetary projections in the programme are on the positive side. However, a negative risk may be compliance with the strict target of limiting the growth of real public consumption, where the track record is mixed. Overall, the budgetary position is sound and the budgetary strategy pro- vides a good example of fiscal policies run in ",
        "Economic and monetary policy 20 Bull. EU 1/2-2006 compliance with the pact. The gross debt ratio is projected to continue to decline markedly and reach 21.5% of GDP in 2010. With regard to the sustainability of public finances, Denmark appears to be at low risk on grounds of the pro- jected budgetary costs of ageing populations. The consolidation in line with the MTO throughout the programme period contributes to improve sustainability. Estonia 1.5.10. Council opinion in accordance with Arti- cle 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated stability pro- gramme of Estonia, 2005\u201309. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97, on the updated stability programme of Estonia, 2004\u201308: OJ C 136, 3.6.2005; Bull. 1/2-2005, point 1.3.15 Recommendation adopted by the Commission on 1 February. SEC(2006) 109 Adopted by the Council on 14 February. The Council considered the updated stability pro- gramme of Estonia, covering the period from 2005 to 2009, to be broadly in line with the requirements of the revised code of conduct on the content and format of stability and conver- gence programmes. Based on a cautious macro- economic scenario with relatively optimistic inflation projections for 2006, the programme aims at general government accounts in small surplus or balance over the entire programme period, with both expenditure and revenue ratios gradually declining and a decrease in the tax bur- den. The budgetary targets for 2005 and 2006 are slightly higher than in the previous update. More- over, the surplus in 2005 has probably turned out significantly higher than foreseen in the pro- gramme. The medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position set in the programme is 0.0% over the entire programme period, which is more demanding than the minimum benchmark and provides a sufficient safety margin against breaching the 3% of GDP deficit ceiling with normal macroeconomic fluctuations. The budget- ary stance in the programme is deemed sufficient to meet the programme\u2019s MTO and indeed exceed the budgetary targets, given Estonia\u2019s strong track record. Estonia\u2019s gross debt ratio is the lowest in the EU and projected to decline fur- ther. With regard to the sustainability of public finances, Estonia appears to be at low risk on grounds of the projected budgetary costs of age- ing populations. Overall, the budgetary position is sound and the fiscal strategy provides a good example of fiscal policy conducted in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. Based on this evaluation, the Council invited Estonia to aim for a higher budgetary surplus in 2006 and beyond in order to continue supporting the correction of the external balance. Greece 1.5.11. Commission recommendation for a Council opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated stability programme of Greece, 2005\u201308. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the updated stability programme of Greece, 2004\u201307: OJ C 189, 3.8.2005; Bull. 4- 2005, point 1.3.3 Adopted on 22 February. The Commission\u2019s rec- ommendation to the Council was that Greece\u2019s stability programme for the period 2005\u201308 broadly complied with the requirements of the code of conduct on the content and format of sta- bility and convergence programmes. Based on a favourable macroeconomic scenario, the update aims at correcting the excessive deficit by 2006, relying on both higher revenues and expenditure restraint. The budgetary targets are better than those set in the previous programme within a more favourable growth scenario, and including additional measures. The medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position set in the pro- gramme is of a balanced budget in cyclically adjusted terms and net of one-off and temporary measures, which is in line with the pact, although it will not be reached within the programme period. The risks attached to the budgetary tar- gets appear to be on the negative side, although the fiscal stance in the programme seems consis- tent with a correction of the excessive deficit by 2006. The debt ratio is projected on a diminish- ing path, but still remaining well above the 60% of GDP by 2008, while Greece is at high risk as regards the long-term sustainability of its public ",

The Commission\u2019s rec- ommendation to the Council was that Spain\u2019s sta- bility programme for the period 2005\u201308 broadly complied with the requirements of the code of conduct on the content and format of stability and convergence programmes. Based on a plausible macroeconomic scenario, the update aims at maintaining high budgetary surpluses over the programme period. The budgetary targets are more ambitious than in the previous update of the programme. The medium-term objective (MTO) set in the programme is a balanced general gov- ernment budget in cyclically adjusted terms and net of one-off and temporary measures, which is more demanding than required by the pact. The programme\u2019s MTO is planned to be maintained throughout the programme period. Given that the risks attached to the budgetary targets are broadly balanced, the fiscal targets set out in the pro- gramme appear attainable. While the debt ratio is targeted to follow a steady downward path well below the 60% of GDP, the budgetary costs of an ageing population are projected to be very sig- nificant so that Spain is at medium risk as regards the long-term sustainability of its public finances. However, the currently favourable budgetary position, including the debt position and accu- mulation of assets in the Social Security Reserve Fund, contribute to limit somewhat the projected increase of pension expenditures. In view of the above assessment, the budgetary position of Spain can be considered as sound and the budget- ary strategy provides a good example of fiscal policies conducted in compliance with the pact. SEC(2006) 228 France 1.5.13. Commission recommendation for a Coun- cil opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated stability programme of France, 2005\u201309. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/ 97 on the updated stability programme of France, 2004\u201308: OJ C 136, 3.6.2005; Bull. 1/2-2005, point 1.3.17 Adopted on 22 February. The Commission\u2019s rec- ommendation to the Council was that France\u2019s stability programme for the period 2005\u201309 broadly complied with the requirements of the code of conduct on the content and format of sta- bility and convergence programmes. Based on a plausible macroeconomic scenario, although somewhat favourable for 2006, the programme aims at bringing the public accounts back to bal- ance and reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio below the 60% EC Treaty reference value by 2010. It also confirms that the deficit should be brought back to the 3% EC Treaty reference value in 2005 and below it from 2006 onwards, mainly relying on expenditure restraint. The budgetary targets are somewhat worse compared with those of the previous update, notably due to a weaker economic environment in 2005. The inferred medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position is a balanced deficit in cyclically adjusted terms and net of one-off and temporary measures, which is in line with the pact. It is tar- geted to be reached only in 2010, beyond the pro- gramme horizon. Given that the risks attached to the budgetary targets are on the downside, a per- manent and sustainable correction of the exces- sive deficit would require additional measures beyond 2005. While the debt ratio is targeted to progressively decrease from a relatively high ",
        "Economic and monetary policy 22 Bull. EU 1/2-2006 level (66% of GDP), the budgetary costs of an ageing population are projected to be significant so that France is at medium risk as regards the long-term sustainability of its public finances. Based on this evaluation, the recommendation foresees the following policy invitations to be addressed to France: secure without delay a fall in the general government deficit below 3% of GDP in 2006 in a credible and sustainable man- ner, reinforce the expenditure ceiling framework, and identify and implement the necessary meas- ures to ensure fiscal consolidation towards the MTO and improve long-term sustainability. SEC(2006) 234 Ireland 1.5.14. Recommendation for a Council opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Reg- ulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated stability programme of Ireland, 2005\u201308. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/ 97 on the updated stability programme of Ireland, 2004\u201307: OJ C 136, 3.6.2005; Bull. 1/2-2005, point 1.3.18 Adopted on 22 February. The Commission\u2019s rec- ommendation to the Council was that Ireland\u2019s stability programme for the period 2005\u201308 broadly complied with the requirements of the code of conduct on the content and format of sta- bility and convergence programmes. Based on a plausible macroeconomic scenario, the pro- gramme targets a general government deficit of 0.6% in 2006 and 0.8% of GDP in 2007/08, after a surplus of 0.25% in 2005. The revenue ratio is on a declining trend, while the expenditure ratio initially increases and falls back to its 2005 level only towards the end of the programme period. The update sets the medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position at a structural position of close to balance, which is more demanding than required by the Stability and Growth Pact. Taking into account that the risks attached to the budgetary targets appear on bal- ance on the positive side, the budgetary stance in the programme seems sufficient to maintain the programme\u2019s MTO throughout the programme period and to provide also a sufficient safety mar- gin against breaching the 3% of GDP deficit threshold with normal macroeconomic fluctua- tions in each year. The debt ratio is projected in the programme to stabilise at around 28% of GDP in 2005, well below the 60% of GDP EC Treaty reference value. With regard to the sus- tainability of public finances, Ireland appears to be at medium risk on grounds of the projected budgetary costs of an ageing population. Based on this evaluation, the fiscal position can be con- sidered as sound and the budgetary strategy pro- vides a good example of fiscal policies conducted in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. The recommendation foresees a policy invitation to be addressed to Ireland, namely to continue to implement measures to address the long-term budgetary implications of an ageing population. SEC(2006) 230 Italy 1.5.15. Commission recommendation for a Coun- cil opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated stability programme of Italy, 2005\u201309. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/ 97 on the updated stability programme of Italy, 2004\u201308: OJ C 136, 3.6.2005; Bull. 1/2-2005, point 1.3.19 Adopted on 22 February. The Commission\u2019s rec- ommendation to the Council was that Italy\u2019s sta- bility programme for the period 2005\u201309 broadly complied with the requirements of the code of conduct on the content and format of stability and convergence programmes. The programme, which is based on a plausible macroeconomic scenario, aims at reducing the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2007 and at pursuing further fiscal consolidation towards the medium-term objective (MTO) of a balanced budget in cyclically adjusted terms and net of one-off and temporary measures. The MTO, however, is not projected to be attained by the end of the programme\u2019s period. Taking into account the balance of risks, the cor- rection of the excessive deficit by the 2007 dead- line set by the Council crucially relies upon a full and effective implementation of the 2006 budget and the specification and implementation of sub- stantial correction measures for 2007. The achievement of the safety margin in 2009 also hinges on these risks and on the specification and implementation of corrective measures for the ",
        "Economic and monetary policy Bull. EU 1/2-2006 23 years beyond 2007. The debt ratio is not suffi- ciently diminishing towards the reference value, and there are risks to its planned reduction from 108.5% of GDP in 2005 to 102% in 2009. Italy is at medium risk as regards the long-term sus- tainability of its public finances. Based on this evaluation, the attached recommendation foresees some policy invitations to be addressed to Italy, which can be summarised as follows: achieve the structural efforts envisaged in the programme for 2006 and 2007; spell out the broad measures underlying the adjustment path in the outer years of the programme and strengthen the adjustment towards the MTO; ensure that the debt-to-GDP ratio declines to 60% at a more rapid pace; and improve the budgetary process, by increasing its transparency and by an effective implementation of the mechanisms to monitor, control and report expenditure. SEC(2006) 235 Cyprus 1.5.16. Recommendation for a Council opinion in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated convergence programme of Cyprus, 2005\u201309. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/ 97 on the updated convergence programme of Cyprus, 2004\u201308: OJ C 177, 19.7.2005; Bull. 3- 2005, point 1.3.6 Adopted on 22 February. The Commission\u2019s rec- ommendation to the Council was that Cyprus\u2019s convergence programme for the period 2005\u201309 broadly complied with the requirements of the code of conduct on the content and format of sta- bility and convergence programmes. Based on a plausible macroeconomic scenario (which is slightly favourable towards the end of the pro- gramme period), the programme aims at further consolidation the public finances after the reduc- tion of the deficit to below the 3% of GDP ref- erence value in 2005. In particular, the deficit is planned to gradually narrow to 0.6% of GDP by 2009 through structural expenditure cuts and a combination of structural and one-off revenue measures. The medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position set in the programme is a deficit of around 0.5% of GDP in structural terms (i.e. in cyclically adjusted terms and net of one- off and temporary measures), which is in line with the pact. Based on the estimated outturn for 2005 and given that the risks attached to the bud- getary targets are broadly balanced, the fiscal stance in the programme seems consistent with a correction of the excessive deficit by 2005, as recommended by the Council. It also seems suf- ficient to ensure that the MTO is nearly reached by 2009 (as planned in the programme) through an annual average adjustment of the structural balance of just above 0.5% of GDP, which is in line with the pact. The debt-to-GDP ratio, which is targeted to decline from 70.5% in 2005 to 53.5% in 2009, seems to be diminishing suffi- ciently towards the 60% of GDP reference value. With regard to the sustainability of public finances, Cyprus appears to be at high risk due to the projected budgetary costs of ageing popula- tions. Based on this evaluation, the attached rec- ommendation foresees some policy invitations to be addressed to the Republic of Cyprus, namely to implement with rigour the envisaged measures and to improve the long-term sustainability of public finances. SEC(2006) 227 Latvia 1.5.17. Council opinion in accordance with Arti- cle 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated stability pro- gramme of Latvia, 2005\u201309. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/ 97, on the updated stability programme of Latvia, 2005\u201307: OJ C 177, 19.7.2005; Bull. 1/2-2005, point 1.3.21 Recommendation adopted by the Commission on 1 February. SEC(2006) 110 Adopted by the Council on 14 February. The Council considered the updated stability pro- gramme of Latvia, covering the period from 2005 to 2009, to be broadly in line with the require- ments of the revised code of conduct on the con- tent and format of stability and convergence pro- grammes. Based on a plausible macroeconomic scenario, the programme aims at a modest reduc- tion of the general government deficit, from 1.5% ",
        "Economic and monetary policy 24 Bull. EU 1/2-2006 of GDP in 2005 to 1.3% in 2008. The 2005 start- ing position is nevertheless likely to be much bet- ter than foreseen in the programme. The budget- ary targets are unchanged compared with the previous update of the programme, although the growth outlook is stronger. The medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position set in the programme is a deficit of around 1% of GDP in structural terms, which it aims to achieve in 2008. The programme\u2019s MTO is in line with the pact although, given the risks to sustainable con- vergence, a more ambitious medium-term objec- tive would be desirable. Given risks to achieving the budgetary targets and that the pace of adjust- ment towards the programme\u2019s MTO is in line neither with the pact\u2019s \u2018benchmark\u2019 nor with the requirement that the adjustment should be higher in good economic times, a more demanding con- solidation strategy would be appropriate. The debt ratio is targeted to remain below 15% of GDP and the budgetary costs of an ageing popu- lation appear sustainable, so Latvia appears to be at low risk as regards the long-term sustainabil- ity of its public finances. Based on this evaluation and in order to ensure sustainable convergence, the Council invited Latvia to avoid fiscal easing in 2006 and to consider the achievement of more ambitious budgetary positions than currently planned, notably by bringing forward the attain- ment of the MTO. Lithuania 1.5.18. Commission recommendation for a Coun- cil opinion in accordance with Article 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated convergence programme of Lithuania, 2005\u201308. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/ 97 on the convergence programme of Lithuania for the period 2004\u201307: OJ C 177, 19.7.2005; Bull. 3- 2005, point 1.3.8 Adopted on 22 February. The Commission\u2019s rec- ommendation to the Council was that Lithuania\u2019s convergence programme for the period 2005\u201308 broadly complied with the requirements of the code of conduct on the content and format of sta- bility and convergence programmes. Based on an overall plausible macroeconomic scenario, the programme\u2019s main objective is to reduce the gen- eral government structural deficit (i.e. cyclically adjusted and net of one-off measures) to or below 1% of GDP by the end of the programme period. The programme\u2019s medium-term objective (MTO) is a structural deficit of 1% of GDP, in line with the pact. Risks to the budgetary targets are broadly balanced and using Commission calcu- lations of the structural balance, the MTO may not be reached within the programme\u2019s period. The programme motivates a temporary deviation from the adjustment path towards the MTO with the implementation of \u2018major structural reforms\u2019. If the budgetary costs of the pension reform, which clearly have a beneficial impact on long- term sustainability, are taken into account, the planned average annual structural adjustment towards the MTO is in line with the 0.5% of GDP \u2018benchmark\u2019 for euro area and ERM II Member States. The temporary deviation is admissible under the Stability and Growth Pact if a safety margin against breaching the 3% of GDP deficit threshold with normal macroeco- nomic fluctuations is provided from 2006. Lithuania is at low risk as regards the long-term sustainability of its public finances. Based on this evaluation, the recommendation foresees a pol- icy invitation to be addressed to Lithuania, sum- marised as follows: strengthen, in the context of strong growth prospects, the effort in the struc- tural budgetary adjustment in order to speed up the attainment of the MTO and avoid fiscal eas- ing between 2005 and 2006. SEC(2006) 231 Luxembourg 1.5.19. Council opinion in accordance with Arti- cle 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated stability pro- gramme of Luxembourg, 2005\u201308. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/ 97, on the updated stability programme of Luxem- bourg, 2004\u201307: OJ C 79, 1.4.2005; Bull. 1/2- 2005, point 1.3.23 Recommendation adopted by the Commission on 1 February. SEC(2006) 111 Adopted by the Council on 14 February. The Council considered the updated stability pro- gramme of Luxembourg, covering the period from 2005 to 2008, to be broadly in line with the ",
        "Economic and monetary policy Bull. EU 1/2-2006 25 requirements of the revised code of conduct on the content and format of stability and conver- gence programmes. Based on a plausible macro- economic scenario (though slightly optimistic in the outer years of the programme), the pro- gramme aims at reducing the general government deficit from a level of 2.3% of GDP estimated for 2005 to 0.2% in 2008, relying exclusively on expenditure restraint. The medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position set in the pro- gramme is a deficit of 0.8% of GDP in cyclically adjusted terms and net of one-off and temporary measures, which is planned to be reached in 2008 and is in line with the pact. Given the risks attached to the budgetary targets, especially the fact that expenditure reduction measures for 2007 and 2008 are announced by the programme but not further specified, the fiscal stance in the pro- gramme seems consistent with the achievement of this objective on the condition that these meas- ures are specified and properly implemented. While the debt ratio is projected to remain around the very low level of 10% of GDP, the budgetary costs of an ageing population are projected to be non-negligible, especially due to the large future increase in the number of pensioners implied by the very strong employment growth recorded in the last 20 years so that Luxembourg is at medium risk as regards the long-term sustain- ability of its public finances. The Council con- sidered that the global strategy of deficit reduc- tion through expenditure restraint, presented by the programme, is commendable. It recom- mended the Luxembourg authorities strengthen the effort of budgetary adjustment in 2006 and identify and implement the necessary measures for 2007 and 2008, and also increase the long- term sustainability of public finances while con- taining an increase in expenditure by introducing a reform of pension systems. Hungary 1.5.20. Council opinion in accordance with Arti- cle 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated convergence pro- gramme of Hungary, 2005\u201308. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/ 97 on the convergence programme of Hungary, 2004\u201308: OJ C 177, 19.7.2005; Bull. 3-2005, point 1.3.9 Recommendation adopted by the Commission on 11 January. SEC(2006) 24 Adopted by the Council on 24 January. The Council took into consideration the requirements of the revised code of conduct on the content and format of stability and convergence programmes when judging Hungary\u2019s updated convergence programme for 2005\u201308. Based on a large plau- sible macroeconomic scenario that becomes somewhat favourable towards the end of the pro- gramme period, the programme aims at correct- ing the excessive deficit by 2008, relying on expenditure restraint that should overcompensate the reduction in the revenue-to-GDP ratio as a result of tax cuts implemented from 2006. The budgetary targets are revised compared with the previous update of the programme. The update does not provide a medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position as required by the code of conduct. Given that the programme lacks the necessary specifications and quantifica- tions of the structural measures necessary to achieve the expenditure reduction, and that the budgetary outcome could be much worse than projected in the programme, the fiscal stance in the programme seems inconsistent with a correc- tion of the excessive deficit by 2008. The debt ratio, targeted to remain slightly below 60% and to decline by 1.5 percentage points of GDP, is subject to similar risks as the deficit targets. With regard to the sustainability of public finances, Hungary appears to be at high risk on grounds of the projected budgetary costs of ageing popula- tions. Based on this evaluation, the Council calls on Hungary to present by 1 September 2006 at the latest a revised convergence programme update that identifies concrete and structural measures that are fully consistent with its medium-term adjustment path, and in the mean- time does the necessary to achieve its budgetary objectives. Malta 1.5.21.

EU 1/2-2006 No 1466/97 on the convergence programme of Malta for the period 2004\u201307: OJ C 136, 3.6.2005; Bull. 1/2-2005, point 1.3.25 Adopted on 22 February. The Commission\u2019s rec- ommendation to the Council was that Malta\u2019s convergence programme for the period 2005\u201308 broadly complied with the requirements of the code of conduct on the content and format of sta- bility and convergence programmes. The pro- gramme aims at correcting the excessive deficit by 2006 against a macroeconomic scenario, which, albeit plausible, appears favourable in 2006. The budgetary targets are less ambitious compared with the previous update of the pro- gramme, but remain consistent with the require- ments of the pact. The programme clearly sets the medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position of a balanced budget in cyclically adjusted terms and net of one-off and temporary measures. According to the programme, the MTO is envisaged to be broadly reached in 2008. On current information, the correction of the exces- sive deficit by 2006 is on track, but the budgetary outcome could be slightly worse than projected. The debt ratio is targeted to start declining in 2006 and attain around 67.25% of GDP by 2008, from 76.75% in 2005. Population ageing will put pressure on the pension system, so that Malta is at medium risk with regard to the long-term sus- tainability of its public finances. In view of this assessment, the recommendation proposes that some policy invitations be addressed to Malta, these can be summarised as follows: implement with rigour the 2006 budget measures and ensure the correction of the excessive deficit this year; ensure that the debt ratio is declining towards the 60% of GDP reference value at a satisfactory pace from 2006 onwards; and improve the long- term sustainability of the public finances by mak- ing further progress in the design and implemen- tation of the pension and healthcare reforms. SEC(2006) 236 Netherlands 1.5.22. Commission recommendation for a Coun- cil opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated stability programme of the Netherlands, 2005\u201308. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the updated stability programme of the Nether- lands, 2004\u201307: OJ C 79, 1.4.2005; Bull. 1/2-2005, point 1.3.26 Adopted on 22 February. The Commission\u2019s rec- ommendation to the Council was that the Nether- lands\u2019s stability programme for the period 2005\u201308 broadly complied with the requirements of the code of conduct on the content and format of stability and convergence programmes. Based on a plausible macroeconomic scenario, though maybe slightly favourable in 2006, the pro- gramme projects the general government deficit to rise from 1.2% of GDP in 2005 to 1.5% in 2006 before decreasing again to 1.1% in 2008. The medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position set in the programme is a deficit between 0.5% and 1.0% of GDP in cyclically adjusted terms and net of one-off and temporary measures. This objective has already been reached in 2005. Given the broadly balanced risks attached to the budgetary targets, the budgetary strategy outlined in the programme seems sufficient to ensure that this MTO is maintained throughout the pro- gramme period and that a sufficient safety margin against the risk of breaching the 3% of GDP ref- erence value exists in every year. Nevertheless, despite the strong economic recovery, there is a deterioration of 0.75% of GDP in the structural balance in 2006, although this is partly due to exceptional factors. If the better-than-expected outcome in 2005 is confirmed, this deterioration could even be larger, unless the authorities take measures to contain it. With regard to the sus- tainability of public finances, the Netherlands appears to be at low risk on grounds of the pro- jected budgetary costs of ageing populations as the government debt is under 60% of GDP, the budgetary situation has recently improved and recent reforms of the disability scheme have been implemented, although further budgetary consol- idation may therefore be necessary. Based on this evaluation, the attached recommen- dation foresees a policy invitation to be addressed to the Netherlands, namely to maintain a strong budgetary position in 2006 and thereafter, also in view of better-than-expected results in 2005.

SEC(2006) 107 Adopted by the Council on 14 February. The Council considered the updated stability pro- gramme of Austria, covering the period from 2005 to 2008, to be broadly in line with the requirements of the revised code of conduct on the content and format of stability and conver- gence programmes. Based on a plausible macro- economic scenario, the budgetary targets are unchanged compared with the previous update of the programme. The medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position set in the pro- gramme is a balanced budget in cyclically adjusted terms and net of one-off and temporary measures by 2008, which is in line with the pact and is more demanding than implied by the debt ratio and average potential output growth in the long term. Even though there are downside risks attached to the budgetary targets and the MTO may not be achieved by the update horizon, the strategy seems sufficient to achieve a budgetary position in structural terms that can be consid- ered as appropriate under the pact, on the condi- tion the measures specified in the programme are properly implemented. The debt ratio is estimated to have reached 63.4% of GDP in 2005, but seems to be sufficiently diminishing towards the reference value. With regard to the sustainability of public finances, Austria appears to be at low risk on grounds of the projected budgetary costs of ageing populations as the recent pension reform is contributing significantly towards con- taining future increases in public expenditure. Based on this evaluation, the Council invited Aus- tria to make sure that the programme\u2019s MTO is achieved by the end of the update period by fur- ther specifying and implementing measures that will contribute to the budgetary consolidation planned for the two final years of the programme. Portugal 1.5.24. Commission recommendation for a Coun- cil opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated stability programme of Por- tugal, 2005\u201309. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the updated stability programme of Portugal, 2004\u201309: OJ C 228, 17.9.2005; Bull. 7/8- 2005, point 1.3.5 Adopted on 22 February. The Commission\u2019s rec- ommendation to the Council was that Portugal\u2019s stability programme for the period 2005\u201309 broadly complied with the requirements of the code of conduct on the content and format of stability and convergence programmes. Based on favourable growth assumptions, especially in the outer years of the programme, the programme aims at correcting the excessive deficit by 2008 on the basis of structural measures with sub- stantial steps in each year. Compared with the previous update, the December 2005 update largely confirms the planned adjustment path against a weaker growth scenario. The medium- term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position set in the programme is a balance of at least 0.5% of GDP in cyclically adjusted terms and net of one-off and temporary measures, which is in line with the pact, but which is not targeted to be reached within the programme period. Tak- ing into account the balance of risks, the cor- rection of the excessive deficit by the 2008 dead- line set by the Council hinges upon a full implementation of all the measures announced therein and the adoption of further measures still necessary to underpin the fiscal strategy. With regard to the sustainability of public finances, Portugal appears to be at high risk. The high level of gross debt and the projected increases in age-related expenditures clearly indicate the necessity of a comprehensive strategy in dealing with the challenge posed by ageing populations. Based on this evaluation, the recommendation foresees some policy invitations to be addressed to Portugal, which can be summarised as fol- lows: adopt and implement the structural meas- ures envisaged in the programme in order to ensure the correction of the excessive deficit by 2008; control expenditure and improve the bud- getary process; strengthen the long-term sus- tainability of public finances; bring the govern- ment gross debt ratio onto a firm downward path.

Council opinion in accordance with Arti- cle 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated stability pro- gramme of Slovenia, 2005\u201308. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/ 97, on the updated stability programme of Slove- nia, 2004\u201307: OJ C 177, 19.7.2005; Bull. 3-2005, point 1.3.10 Recommendation adopted by the Commission on 1 February. SEC(2006) 112 Adopted by the Council on 14 February. The Council considered the updated stability pro- gramme of Slovenia, covering the period from 2005 to 2008, to be broadly in line with the requirements of the revised code of conduct on the content and format of stability and conver- gence programmes. Based on a plausible macro- economic scenario, the programme aims at achieving the medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position by 2008. While risks to the budgetary projections are broadly balanced, the fiscal strategy in the programme seems suffi- cient to provide a safety margin against the occur- rence of an excessive deficit with normal macro- economic fluctuations in each year and ensure that the MTO is reached in 2008. However, the adjustment path towards the programme\u2019s MTO is not fully in line with the pact as the envisaged structural improvement is just 0.25% of GDP over the programme period. The programme invokes a temporary deviation from the adjust- ment path on grounds of \u2018major structural reforms\u2019, aiming at enhancing the competitive- ness of the Slovene economy. This deviation, however, should not be allowed. The programme fails to provide evidence of reforms having a sig- nificant positive impact on potential growth and the long-term sustainability of public finances, which should justify the deviation. Although debt is below 30% of GDP, the budgetary costs of an ageing population are projected to rise signifi- cantly after 2020 and Slovenia is at high risk as regards the long-term sustainability of its public finances. Based on this evaluation, the Council invited Slovenia to make more rapid progress towards achieving the MTO, especially by front- loading the adjustment effort and to undertake further measures to improve the long-term sus- tainability of public finances. Slovakia 1.5.26. Council opinion in accordance with Arti- cle 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated convergence pro- gramme of Slovakia, 2005\u201308. Reference: Council opinion in accordance withArti- cle 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the convergence programme of Slovakia, 2004\u201307: OJ C 136, 3.6.2005; Bull. 1/2-2005, point 1.3.30 Recommendation adopted by the Commission on 11 January. SEC(2006) 26 Adopted by the Council on 24 January. The Council considered that Slovakia\u2019s updated convergence programme for 2005\u201308 complied broadly with the requirements of the revised code of conduct on the content and format of stability and convergence programmes. Based on a plau- sible macroeconomic scenario the program- me aims at correcting the excessive deficit by 2007, relying mainly on expenditure restraint. The new update broadly confirms the planned adjustment in the previous programme against a more favourable macroeconomic scenario. The medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position set in the programme is a deficit of 0.9% of GDP in cyclically adjusted terms and net of one-off and temporary measures, which is in line with the pact but which is targeted to be reached only beyond the programme horizon, namely by 2010. Given that the risks attached to the budget- ary targets are broadly balanced, the fiscal stance in the programme seems consistent with a cor- rection of the excessive deficit by 2007. With regard to the sustainability of public finances, Slovakia appears to be at medium risk on grounds of the projected budgetary costs of ageing popu- lations. The level of debt is significantly under the 60% reference value and should remain so under the assumption of unchanged policies for the coming two decades. Implementing rigor- ously the planned consolidation of public finances over the medium term is necessary in order to reduce risks to long-term sustainability. Based on this evaluation, the Council recommends the Slo- vak Republic to strengthen the fiscal adjustment effort and reinforce the expenditure ceiling frame- work. ",

Council opinion in accordance with Arti- cle 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated stability pro- gramme of Finland, 2004\u201308. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/ 97, on the updated stability programme of Finland, 2004\u201308: OJ C 136, 3.6.2005; Bull. 1/2-2005, point 1.3.31 Recommendation adopted by the Commission on 11 January. SEC(2006) 23 Adopted by the Council on 24 January. The Council considered the updated stability pro- gramme of Finland, covering the period from 2004 to 2008, to be broadly in line with the requirements of the revised code of conduct on the content and format of stability and conver- gence programmes. Based on Finland\u2019s updated stability programme covering the period 2005\u201309, the Council adopted a prudent macroeconomic scenario. The programme foresees the general government will remain in comfortable surplus, albeit declining slightly to 1.5% of GDP by the 2009 horizon. Compared with the previous update, the expected annual surpluses have been revised downwards by 0.5% of GDP, reflecting the phased introduction of tax cuts. The pro- gramme does not explicitly present its medium- term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position. However, it projects the structural surplus at around 1.5% of GDP by the end of the pro- gramme period, which can be regarded as the pro- gramme\u2019s MTO. The budgetary stance in the programme seems sufficient to maintain the pro- gramme\u2019s MTO throughout the programme period. In addition, it provides a sufficient safety margin against breaching the 3% of GDP deficit ceiling with normal macroeconomic fluctuations for the entire period. Overall, the budgetary posi- tion is sound and the budgetary strategy provides a good example of fiscal policies run in compli- ance with the pact. The debt ratio is estimated to decline by 2.5 percentage points to reach 40% of GDP by 2009. With regard to the sustainability of public finances, Finland appears to be at low risk, given the significant assets in public pension schemes and the currently favourable budgetary position. However, sustainability may come under strain in the long term from rising old-age-related expenditure. Sweden 1.5.28. Council opinion in accordance with Arti- cle 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated convergence pro- gramme of Sweden, 2005\u201308. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the convergence programme of Sweden, 2004\u201307: OJ C 79, 1.4.2005; Bull. 1/2-2005, point 1.3.32 Recommendation adopted by the Commission on 11 January. SEC(2006) 27 Adopted by the Council on 24 January. The Council considered that Sweden\u2019s updated con- vergence programme for 2005\u201308 complied broadly with the requirements of the revised code of conduct on the content and format of stability and convergence programmes. Based on a plau- sible macroeconomic scenario with a closing neg- ative output gap in 2006, the update foresees a general government surplus of 1.6% in 2005, 0.9% in 2006, 1.2% in 2007 and 1.7% in the final year, 2008. Both expenditure and revenue to GDP ratios are on a gradually declining trend over the projection period. While the reduction in the rev- enue ratio is front-loaded and based on policy decisions, the reduction in the expenditure ratio is back-loaded and mainly based on improving cyclical conditions. The national surplus objec- tive of 2% of GDP on average over the cycle can be considered as the programme\u2019s ambitious medium-term objective (MTO). This fulfils the aim of providing a safety margin and is signifi- cantly more demanding than required by the Sta- bility and Growth Pact. However, the expansion- ary budget for 2006 puts at risk the achievement of the MTO within the programme period and the strong expansionary fiscal stance in 2006 may not be fully appropriate given the positive cyclical position of the economy (which according to the Stability and Growth Pact may qualify as \u2018good times\u2019). Even so, given that the MTO is signifi- cantly more demanding than required and that the risks to the budgetary projections in the pro- gramme are on the positive side, the budgetary strategy seems appropriate under the pact. The ",
        "Economic and monetary policy 30 Bull. EU 1/2-2006 gross debt ratio is projected to continue to decline and reach 46% of GDP in 2008. With regard to the sustainability of public finances, Sweden appears to be at low risk on grounds of the pro- jected budgetary costs of ageing populations. The planned consolidation towards the 2% MTO at the end of the programme period contributes to improve sustainability. United Kingdom 1.5.29. Commission recommendation for a Coun- cil opinion in accordance with Article 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated convergence programme of the United Kingdom for the period 2005/06 to 2010/11. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97, on the updated convergence pro- gramme of the United Kingdom 2003/04 to 2009/10: OJ C 177, 19.7.2005; Bull. 3-2005, point 1.3.11 Adopted on 22 February. The Commission con- sidered the updated convergence programme of the United Kingdom, covering the period from 2005/06 to 2010/11, to be partly in line with the data requirements of the revised code of conduct on the content and format of stability and con- vergence programmes. Based on a plausible macroeconomic scenario, the update projects a deficit declining from 3.1% of GDP in 2005/06 to 1.5% of GDP by 2010/11. However, there are risks to this budgetary outcome as revenue pro- jections rely on continuing buoyancy in the finan- cial sector while the extent of the projected fall in the expenditure to GDP ratio after 2007/08 will be a challenge to achieve. The programme does not specify a medium-term objective (MTO) for the general government structural balance, but refers to the fiscal objectives under the domestic fiscal rules. The MTO is inferred from the con- vergence programme projections. The budgetary stance in the programme may not be consistent with a correction of the UK\u2019s excessive deficit by 2006/07, while the adjustment path could be strengthened in order to create a sufficient margin against breaching the 3% of GDP reference value. However, while moderately rising, the gross debt ratio remains well below the Treaty reference value of 60% of GDP. Concerning the sustain- ability of public finances, the UK appears to be at medium risk on grounds of the projected budget- ary costs of an ageing population. Based on this evaluation, the attached recommendation foresees policy invitations to be addressed to the United Kingdom, which can be summarised as follows: on the one hand, ensure that the deficit is brought below 3% of GDP by 2006/07 at the latest in a credible and sustainable manner, and pursue bud- getary consolidation thereafter; and on the other hand, clearly identify the medium-term objective, as required by the Stability and Growth Pact.

Regulation to be amended: Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 of 9 October 1990 on the sta- tistical classification of economic activities in the European Community: OJ L 293, 24.10.1990 Adopted on 6 February. NACE is the acronym used to designate the various statistical classifi- cations of economic activities developed since 1970 by the European Union. It is designated to categorise data relating to units of economic activity, and it provides the basis for preparing the large range of statistics (output, inputs to the production process, capital formation and finan- cial transactions) related to such units. The pro- posal aims to reflect the technological develop- ment, structural changes of the economy and major revisions of other international classifica- tions of activities. It is expected to convey, through more comparable and relevant data, a better economic governance at EU and national levels. The proposed regulation establishes the revised classification of NACE Rev.2 economic activities and includes provisions for its imple- mentation in current statistical surveys. It also includes a provision which allows Member States to establish a national statistical classification consistent with NACE, in order to meet the spe- cific needs of their national economy.

The Commission esti- mated that Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 58/97 can benefit from harmonisation, simpli- fication and recodification. Indeed, new statistical needs appeared with the changes in economies in the context of globalisation. The Commission underlined that, in order to evaluate accurately the need and efficiency of Community policies in rela- tion to the business spirit, information on the demography of companies is necessary. Further- more, it recalls that the services sector increases rapidly and its statistical coverage does not match anymore its real economic weight. It notes that the manufacturing industry is covered by 241 distinct activities, while merchant services are only cov- ered by 32 activities.

IP/06/186 Social protection and social security 1.7.4. Council conclusions on the implications of ageing populations for public finances. Adopted by the \u2018Economic and Financial Affairs\u2019 Council on 14 February. The Council endorsed the report on age-related expenditure projections covering pensions, healthcare, long-term care, education and unemployment transfers for the Member States until 2050 prepared by the Eco- nomic Policy Committee and the Commission. These projections provide information for the cal- culation of the long-term overall viability of pub- lic financing. The report indicates that the fiscal impact of ageing will be substantial in almost all Member States, accelerating as of 2010, and that in this context the sustainability of public finance remains a major challenge for many Member States. The absence of decisive countervailing measures to address this phenomenon will act as a drag on potential economic and employment growth. The Council thus called on the Economic Policy Committee to update and further deepen its common projection exercise of age-related expenditure projections by the autumn of 2009 on the basis of the new population projection to be provided by Eurostat, and to undertake a com- prehensive assessment of the sustainability of Member States\u2019 public finances by autumn 2006.

Reference: Council Directive 98/49/EC: OJ L 209, 25.7.1998; Bull. 6-1998, point 1.3.17 Adopted on 26 January . In this report, the Com- mission assesses the application of Directive 98/49/EC, and proposes, where appropriate, amendments that it believes are necessary. In order to obtain an overview which is as complete as possible, a questionnaire was sent to the Mem- ber States\u2019 and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) governments. The Commission also con- sulted the members of the pensions forum. This report is mainly based on the information sup- plied by these respondents. The content of the report reflects the situation in the Member States in September 2005. The Commission points out in the report that none of the governments reported that discrimination still existed in domestic and cross-border cases, or that the exer- cise of the rights relating to postings of workers within the Member State is hampered. This is almost without exception the case regarding the replies from members of the pensions forum. The only disadvantages mentioned are those that result from different fiscal systems and different rules on the acquisition of rights. The latter case refers to the portability of supplementary pension rights, in effect, the possibility of acquiring and keeping pension entitlements in the event of pro- fessional mobility. In other cases, according to the Commission, there might be the problem of claiming rights in practice. However, the Com- mission recalls that the Directive 98/49/CE does not address these obstacles to mobility; it expresses its view that the directive constitutes only a first measure, and just contributes to the removal of obstacles to free movement.

Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Euro- pean Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions concerning a consul- tation on action at European Union level to pro- mote the active inclusion of the people furthest from the labour market. Adopted on 8 February. The Commission reviewed the progress achieved in the context of an enlarged Union towards the aim of fostering labour market access for those who are excluded. It follows from this assessment that Member States, with the active support that European Union (EU) through Council recommendations, the open method of coordination on social inclu- sion, the European employment strategy and the European Social Fund, have made progress both in extending basic assistance mechanisms and in promoting the access of the most vulnerable to the labour market. Nevertheless, the Commission ",
        "Employment and social policy 36 Bull. EU 1/2-2006 stressed that the persistence of large numbers of people at risk of poverty and excluded from the labour force represents an inescapable challenge to the objective of social cohesion enshrined in the EU Treaty. It believes that people outside the labour market should enter or re-enter the labour market if the goal of the Lisbon strategy are to be realised. The Commission is confident that action at the Community level could bring an added value to the efforts made by the Member States. It is on this basis that it has decided to launch a consultation with social partners at the Commu- nity level, with official authorities and with civil society organisations at all levels on possible guidelines at EU level, with a view to promoting the active inclusion of people furthest from the labour market.

Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Euro- pean Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions entitled \u2018Joint report on social protection and social inclusion\u2019.

In this report, the Commission draws on plans and policy statements on political orientation pro- duced by the Member States during 2005 under the policy strands of social inclusion, pensions, and healthcare and long-term care. The Commis- sion is guided by the views of the Member States and stakeholders on the value of the open method of coordination (OMC) and anticipates the struc- ture of the exchanges in a future, more stream- lined process of the OMC. The Commission\u2019s principal conclusions are as follows: a more strategic approach to the formulation of national action plans (NAP), to bring about a more pre- cise; systematic and transparent setting out of policies; the OMC needs to develop a strong focus on poverty among children and their fami- lies, and on the different forms of exclusion faced by young people from ethnic minorities in poor neighbourhoods; the fundamental role of educa- tion and training has to be developed to stop the intergenerational transmission of poverty. The Commission presents, in addition, the principal conclusions of the analyses on pensions, health- care and long-term care, and social welfare sys- tems, and proposes options to improve them. It notes that the challenge of ensuring that the OMC interacts effectively with the revised Lisbon process is vital. COM(2006) 62 Combating discrimination 1.7.10.

The Committee warmly welcomed the communi- cation as an occasion to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the European Year of People with Disabilities 2003, drawing lessons which will help in both the preparation of future European Years, and the monitoring of initiatives launched this year. In particular, the Committee asked that the consid- eration of questions concerning disabilities become standard practice in all European Union policy areas, and that a structured dialogue be established with organisations representing or working with people with disabilities, notably in relation with the development of internal market legislation.

        "Employment and social policy Bull. EU 1/2-2006 37 Committee of the Regions entitled \u2018Report on the functioning of the transitional arrangements set out in the 2003 accession treaty (1 May 2004 to 30 April 2006)\u2019. Reference: Treaty of Accession: Bull. 4-2003, point I.1 Adopted on 8 February. The first phase of the transitional arrangements for the free movement of persons within the European Union of the Treaty of Accession of 2003 is nearing its end, and Member States are required to notify the Commission of their intentions with regard to the second phase of the transitional arrangements. In this report the Commission presented informa- tion to enable the Council to reassess the first phase of the transitional period and the Member States to adopt a position with regard to the sec- ond phase of the transitional arrangements. The report is based on facts and on a thorough con- sultation of stakeholders concerned by the arrangements. Migration flows within the Union since enlargement have been limited and not suf- ficient enough to affect the labour market in gen- eral. The Commission takes the example of the three countries which did not impose restrictions on the entry into their labour markets of workers from the new Member States from 1 May 2004 \u2014 Ireland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom \u2014 where the labour market has in fact become more successful, with a reduction in unemployment and an increase in the rate of employment. The Commission thus urges Member States to take the statistical evidence presented into account, and to carefully consider the need to maintain restrictions, bearing in mind that the freedom of movement of workers is one of the basic free- doms under the Treaty establishing the European Community.

Joint text approved by the Council on 2 February. The regulation is aimed at improving social con- ditions for professional drivers. It builds on the daily driving time limits (nine hours), and fort- nightly driving time limits (not exceeding 90 hours) already provided for in regulation 3820/85 by introducing a maximum weekly driving time of 56 hours. The regulation provides for a regu- lar weekly rest period of 45 hours at least once per two consecutive weeks and sets out provi- sions which prescribe that under no circum- stances should a daily rest period be less than an uninterrupted period of nine hours. The regula- tion also requires that all new vehicles put into service after the 20th day following its publica- tion in the Official Journal of the European Union , must be fitted with a digital tachograph. 1.7.13.

The Parliament approved the agreement obtained with the Council in conciliation com- mittee. During the conciliation committee meeting, the Council agreed to Parliament\u2019s request for legislation to exclude rays from nat- ural sources such as the sun and therefore restrict the directives field of application to arti- ficial sources, such as lasers and infrared lamps. Adopted on 23 February. This directive lays down the minimum health and safety require- ments against the adverse risks to the health and safety of workers, caused by exposure during work to artificial optical radiation to the eyes and to the skin. This directive seeks to do so by relying upon the well accepted guidelines for restrictions on exposure that have been pro- duced by the International Commission for Non- Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). These scientifically based guidelines are designed to prevent the acute and long-term effects to the eyes and the skin. It places a range of obliga- tions on employers, including the requirements to assess risk, reduce exposure, undertake health surveillance and provide information and train- ing to those workers exposed to these risks. This directive stipulates, in addition, that it applies to workers working with lasers and electrical weld- ing equipment, those in the steel and glass industries and those working in artificial tanning businesses.

The Parliament consid- ered it absolutely necessary to realise the pro- ductive potential of the European labour force as a key to achieving the overall Beijing and Lisbon strategy goals. However, it noted that many dis- parities between women and men continue to exist, particularly as regards difference in remu- neration, access to and advancement on the labour market, post-university education and life- long training, and pension rights. It noted though, that the upward trend in women\u2019s participation in the labour market is a result of the increase in non-standard types of work, such as part-time work, flexible hours, shift work and fixed-term work. It affirmed the need to take urgent meas- ures to promote employment, quality of employ- ment and social inclusion of women, and recom- mended better coordination between the policy of an integrated approach to equality between women and men and the Lisbon strategy, with a view to achieving the Lisbon objectives. The Par- liament viewed as regrettable the fact that, up to now, collaboration for the purpose of achieving the Lisbon objectives has essentially been between governments, and stressed that national, regional and local administrations, local authori- ties, businesses, educational and scientific insti- tutions, the social partners and the whole of civil society must become more involved. 1.8.3.

The Parliament under- lined the persistence of gender inequality in the European Union, and proposed a number of measures in the resolution to improve the situa- tion. It stressed the importance of ensuring the application of existing European legislation, and the need to find a balance between professional and family life which would reduce the level of discrimination by employers on the basis of working hours and salary. The Parliament rec- ommended better coordination between the main- streaming policy and the Lisbon strategy in order to take better account of the gender perspective in fulfilling the ambitious objectives set out in Lisbon. 1.8.4.

The Commission out- lined in this report the main developments of the situation of men relative to women in a series of policy fields and provided evidence of the challenges faced in continued promotion of equality policy, a key contribution to the renewed Lisbon strategy. It also confirmed that despite some progress, significant gender gaps persist in several areas. Work\u2013life balance is identified as one key area which needs address- ing in order to respond to both employment and demographic challenges. The Commission indi- cated that the promotion of gender equality must also be supported by effective institutional mechanisms and a commitment at the highest political level. Finally, it recalled the external dimension of gender equality and underlined the need to take gender aspects into account in external relations. COM(2006) 71 ",

According to statistical analysis and the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy, it seems that in the past years the EU has been experiencing difficulties in maintaining its prominent position in the key areas of eco- nomic growth, labour market performance and in research and innovation. This is why Parliament suggested that in order to benefit from the poten- tial gains of globalisation the internal market must: adapt to global economic changes; advance in areas of economic strength such as the medium technology sector; address its shortcomings par- ticularly in the technology sector; and develop new areas of comparative advantage. In order to fulfil these various aims, it considers as a pre- requisite the completion of the internal market. In addition it called on the Member States and the Community institutions to develop strategies that will make it possible to safeguard European values in a competitive global environment and to give effect to those values in the shaping of global policies, also to lay down a genuine indus- trial policy, and increase preferential access to the market for third countries that are respectful of international standards of work and of the envi- ronment. It also called for the Commission and Council to prepare a well balanced foreign policy which will enable the EU to gain more influence at the international level.

The Parliament deemed favourable the deregulation of packaging formats for a very broad range of products consumed in the Euro- pean Union. However, Parliament added the fol- lowing products to the list which the Commission deems as products for which it is necessary to retain the obligatory format: milk, butter, ground coffee and coffee beans, dry pasta, rice and sugar cane. Excluded from the scope of the directive were: pre-packaged bread, and spreads derived from fats and tea, which will remain subject to the national rules regarding nominal quantities. ",
        "The internal market 42 Bull. EU 1/2-2006 Freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment General 1.9.3. Proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on services in the internal market. Commission proposal: OJ C 98, 23.4.2004; COM(2004) 2; Bull. 1/2-2004, point 1.3.48 Committee of the Regions opinion: OJ C 43, 18.2.2005; Bull. 9-2004, point 1.3.14 European Economic and Social Committee opinion: OJ C 221, 8.9.2005; Bull. 1/2-2005, point 1.3.61 Endorsed by Parliament (first reading) on 16 Feb- ruary. Although very favourable to the adoption of this directive, the Parliament\u2019s amendments did not significantly modify the initial Com- mission proposal. The principle of the country of origin is replaced by that of the freedom to provide services. This means, for one, that Member States must respect the right of work- ers to provide a service in another Member State to that in which the worker resides, and that the host destination assures that the worker must be able to freely access and exercise their service activities. Secondly, Member States will have to prove that they do not apply restrictions which go against the principles of non-discrim- ination, proportionality or other obstacles that appear on the list. Finally, Member States will be able to limit the freedom to provide services if it is justified by reasons related to safety and public health, the environment or working con- ditions. A number of services were excluded from the scope of the directive, namely services of general interest, such as: health services, transport services, temporary work agencies, the gambling industry, audiovisual services, the security forces, hospital workers, social ser- vices, legal services and those who work for official authorities. Those included were: ser- vices related to education, cultural services, including the services of collective management of intellectual property rights, funeral services, transport, publicity and storage of dangerous goods. Lastly, among the fundamental amend- ments approved by Parliament, provisions con- cerning the social legislation and private inter- national law were not addressed by the scope of the directive.

Parliament decided to set up a committee of inquiry to investigate alleged contraventions or maladministration in the appli- cation of Community law in relation to the col- lapse of Equitable Life. It decided that the com- mittee of inquiry shall: investigate alleged contraventions or maladministration in the appli- cation of Directive 92/96/EEC, now codified by Directive 2002/83/EC, by the United Kingdom\u2019s competent authorities in relation to Equitable Life and assess the following: whether the Commis- sion has properly fulfilled its duty to monitor the correct and timely transposition of Community law and identify whether systematic weaknesses contributed to the situation that has arisen; whether allegations that the UK regulators con- sistently failed, over a number of years, and at least since 1989, to protect policy-holders by exercising rigorous supervision of accounting and provisioning practices and the financial situation of Equitable Life and examine the status of claims by non-UK European citizens and the ade- quacy of remedies available under UK and/or EU legislation for policy-holders from other Member States. Parliament is expected to make proposals that it deems necessary on this matter.

The Parliament called for the Commission to determine whether it is pos- sible to keep to the 2009 deadline for completion of the internal market in postal services or whether other stages should be defined in light of the conclusions of the study. It called for a def- inition of the scope and appropriate financing of the universal service. In addition it noted the overall good progress made on transposing Euro- pean legislation into national law. Parliament con- siders that developments happening up until now have had positive consequences for the market; even if the efficiency and attention paid to cus- tomers have yet to be analysed. Parliament stresses that the postal services market is in a transitional phase, markets related to communi- cation and publicity as well as the logistics and transport sectors are also likely to be affected by changes relating to communication. It also noted the request from the Commission to the Member States to intensify price control, to carry out sep- arate analytical accounts and to seek the cases of cross subsidies. It is pleased with the progress made independently from regulation authorities. However, it expressed reservations regarding the different rates of value added tax and therefore requested that the Commission submit proposals on how to achieve the necessary legal certainty and non-discrimination among operators. Taxation Direct taxation 1.9.6. Exploratory opinion of the European Eco- nomic and Social Committee on the creation of a common consolidated corporate tax base in the European Union. Adopted by European Economic and Social Com- mittee at the session of 14 and 15 February. According to the Committee, the questions to be raised about the common consolidated corporate tax base concern legal matters, technical matters, taxation and the economy. It therefore invited the Commission and the Member States, despite the considerable differences between countries, to consider the economic advantages that would result from this legislation. Indirect taxation 1.9.7. European Economic and Social Commit- tee opinion on the report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee on the rates of excise duty applied on alcohol and alco- holic beverages (presented pursuant to Article 8 of Council Directive 92/84/EEC on the approxi- mation of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages).

According to the Committee, the system currently in place regularly throws up problems as to how exactly to class certain products within the exist- ing structure. The Committee called for the Commission to propose a single base rate based on alcohol content, which would create an iden- tical classification system not differentiating products on anything other than on alcohol con- tent. It added that such a change could only really be envisioned for the long term. 1.9.8. Report from the Commission to the Coun- cil and the European Parliament on the use on the ",

References: Council Directive 76/308/EEC: OJ L 73, 19.3.1976, as last amended by the Council direc- tive 2001/44/CE: OJ L 175, 28.6.2001; Bull. 6- 2001, point 1.3.43 Council Directive 2002/94/EC laying down detailed rules for implementing certain provisions of Council 76/308/EEC: OJ L 337, 13.12.2002 Adopted on 8 February. The report assesses the subject of mutual assistance in relation to the recovery of claims of certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures. It takes into account statis- tics on mutual assistance for recovery and the enormous increase in the amount of claims recov- ered by means of mutual assistance (258% up from 2003 to 2004). However there remains a considerable gap between the amounts for which requests for assistance in recovery are made and the amounts actually recovered. In 2007 the Commission will make specific proposals to improve mutual assistance for recovery and will address the need to facilitate the practical use of mutual assistance procedures and strengthen and streamline the legislation as much as possible. COM(2006) 43 1.9.9. Proposal for a Council directive on the exemption from valued added tax and excise duty of goods imported by persons travelling from third countries.

The Commission esti- mated that the Community system of exemptions on imports now needs to be updated to take into account of the recent enlargement and of the fact that the Community now shares its external bor- ders with countries such as Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. Thus, the proposal modernises the pro- visions concerning tax exemptions in interna- tional travel mainly by: increasing the current limit thresholds in line with inflation and intro- ducing at the same time a distinction between air travellers and land travellers; introducing a quan- titative limit for beer imports and increasing the quantitative limit for imports of wine; introducing a Community system for reduced quantitative limits for imports of tobacco products; abolishing the quantitative limits for perfume, coffee and tea; bringing them into line with current legal draft- ing requirements.

In order to prolong the plan reducing rates for labour- intensive services, the validity of Annex K in Directive 77/388/EEC will be extended from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2010. All Mem- ber States can opt for Annex K to be applied. Member States wishing to make use of Annex K provisions may apply for such an authorisation until 31 March 2006. A reduced rate may also be applied on urban heating. Furthermore, the Coun- cil asked the Commission to present a report to the Council and Parliament, by the end of June 2007, which would include an overall assessment of the impact of reduced rates applying to locally supplied services, including restaurant services, in terms of job creation, economic growth and the internal market, and based on a study carried out by an independent economic think tank.

The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Coun- cil Directive 78/1035/EEC on the exemption from taxes of imports of small consignments of goods of a non-commercial character from third countries. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amend- ments as are required by the codification exer- cise itself.

Reference: Directive 83/182/ECC on tax exemp- tions within the Community for certain means of transport temporarily imported into one Member State from another: OJ L 105, 23.4.1983 Adopted on 14 February. As a result of the high number of petitions submitted to the European Parliament on the confiscation of motor driven road vehicles by the Greek authorities, as well as a considerable number of official complaints registered by the Commission, the Parliament considered that to apply a special administra- tive penalty and not respecting the conditions of the exemption, laid down in Directive 83/182/EEC, constitutes a violation of the pro- visions of the EC Treaty, particularly concern- ing freedom of movement of goods and persons and the principle of proportionality. Conse- quently it urged the Greek authorities to con- form to the Community legislation without delay, and in particular to Directive 83/182/ EEC, so that the Commission desists from its legal action.

Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the exercise of voting rights by shareholders of companies which have their registered office in a Member State and whose shares are admitted to trading on a regu- lated market and amending Directive 2004/109/ EC. Directive to be amended: Directive 2004/109/ EC of the European Parliament and of the Coun- cil on the harmonisation of transparency require- ments in relation to information about issues whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market and amending Directive 2001/ 34/EC: OJ L 390, 31.12.2004; Bull. 12-2004, point 1.3.38 Adopted by the Commission, on 5 January. This proposal outlines the measures to be taken in order to make it possible for the shareholders of a company to vote without being present at the general meeting and to enable access in good time to any information concerning it. It endeav- ours to ensure that all general meetings are con- vened at least one month in advance; and that all forms of share blocking in the European Union are abolished and replaced by a record date sys- tem. It also states that all legal obstacles to elec- tronic participation in general meetings is removed, that shareholders will be able to put questions forward at the time of the general meet- ing, add points to the agenda and present the res- olutions at the meeting. It also allows non-resi- dent shareholders the means of voting without attending the meeting. COM(2005) 685 Industrial and intellectual property 1.9.14. Draft revised trademark law treaty.

The Parliament gave its support to the Commission\u2019s objective of grant- ing less and better targeted State aid as part of its action plan on State aid reform. It acknowl- edges that aid can create significant market dis- tortions and should be an instrument of last resort. Nonetheless, it still emphasises its useful- ness in the context of research and development, capital investment, environmental protection and regional development. Parliament also suggests that the Commission elaborates a more precise definition of the concept of market failure and to shorten procedures that result from it, as part of application on Article 87 of the EC Treaty. With regard to services of general economic interest, it calls on the Commission to finally and clearly explain, what this means at a legal level, partic- ularly in relation to the interpretation of the cri- teria for the Altmark ruling and the notion of overcompensation. Finally, it also outlines the obligation of Member States to publish a list of beneficiaries and companies that have received subsidies. Individual cases Belgium 1.10.23.

The Com- mission has introduced the following new fea- tures into the rules for participation and financ- ing. The new funding schemes provide more flexibility and are reduced in number compared with the sixth framework programme. The rules for evaluation, selection and award of proposals for indirect actions have been simplified and clar- ified. The financial provisions relating to the Community financial contribution, forms of grant and support rates have been clarified and simpli- fied. The rules do not establish cost models for the calculation of eligible costs. Greater use of lump sums and flat rate financing will be encour- aged in order to simplify administration and accounting both for participants and for Com- mission services. The obligation established in the sixth framework programme for certain par- ticipants to take financial responsibility for their partners in the same consortium will be waived. Finally, the provisions regarding intellectual prop- erty used in the sixth framework programme\u2019s Euratom contracts have been introduced in the Euratom participation rules and have been sim- plified and clarified to ensure consistency and legal certainty.

The Commission recon- sidered the situation of interoperability in digital interactive television services in 2005, and in tak- ing up the \u2018multimedia home platform\u2019 (MHP) market standard. Developments in the market, particularly in Italy, have shown that interoper- ability can be achieved when stakeholders act together with a common aim of implementing a technical standard like MHP, but that this in itself is not sufficient to ensure the emergence and growth of interactive digital television services; further business and technical developments are needed. Considering that its priority is to ensure the successful switchover to digital TV, which is a prerequisite for having interactive digital ser- vices, the Commission considers that the market is best served at the present time by continuing to rely on industry-led voluntary standardisation initiatives.

The Commission also stressed that the framework of electronic communications has helped bring about more consistency, mainly with regard to where and when regulatory remedies are imposed on operators, and that the consultation mechanism has brought improved transparency for all players in the market. The regulatory framework is currently being updated by the Commission in order to review the list of markets susceptible to regulation.

Reference: Commission communication: OJ C 236, 24.9.2005; COM(2005) 229; Bull. 6-2005, point 1.3.74 Adopted on 15 and 16 February. Recognising that access to high flow Internet connections constitutes one of the principal parameters determining the quality of services for citizens, and helps small and medium-sized business to deliver their products, the Committee supported the Commission\u2019s policy. Although supporting the increase in the volume and quality of research undertaken on information and com- munication technologies (ICT) in Europe, the Committee wished that the results obtained would benefit European industry and that progress in the fulfilment of the Lisbon objec- tives would occur in all European regions. Indeed, it is advisable to preserve a balance between the positive economic repercussions of ICT and the possible social, legal and cultural consequences of their introduction into Euro- pean citizens\u2019 life. It is of primary importance to combine the strategies concerning these youth and education policies by developing and guaranteeing access to a fair information soci- ety on social and regional levels. In addition, the Committee stated firmly that it is necessary to ensure the respect of cultural and linguistic diversity. 1.13.6.

The Commission took a snapshot of the situation in the electronic communications sector prior to the review of the framework and coinciding with the 11th report on the implementation of the European elec- tronic communications regulation and markets. The Commission looked at the latest market developments, mainly in broadband, mobile and fixed services, as well as the regulatory envi- ronment and consumer interest, and showed that some Member States have already introduced virtually all national laws and regulatory prac- tices required to implement EU telecom rules, while the remainder have made substantial progress. Although growing competition has increased consumer benefits, the report also stressed the need to cut the cost of using mobile phones abroad (\u2018international roaming\u2019), to raise public awareness for Europe\u2019s single emergency number and to avoid subjecting emerging Internet telephony services to exces- sive regulation.

Reference: Directive 89/552/EEC on the coordi- nation of certain provisions laid down by law, reg- ulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities: OJ L 298, 17.10.1989; Bull. 10-1989, point 2.1.18, as last amended by Directive 97/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council: OJ L 202, 30.7.1997; Bull. 6-1997, point 1.3.278 Previous report: COM(2002) 778; Bull. 1/2-2003, point 1.4.39 Adopted on 10 February. This report, concerning the application of the \u2018television without fron- tiers\u2019 directive in 2003 and 2004, describes and analyses the salient facts during the reference period. It covers, in particular, notifications by Member States; application of the directive in areas like the broadcasting of events which are of major importance for society; protection of minors and public order; or coordination between the national authorities and the Commission. It also addresses a possible review of the directive. The \u2018television without frontiers\u2019 directive con- tinues to function successfully in ensuring the freedom to provide television services in the European Union, and provides effective regula- tion for the European audiovisual sector. The report therefore confirms the validity of the com- mon European approach to audiovisual matters. However in view of market and technological developments, a need to review the current EU regulatory framework has become apparent. COM(2006) 49 ",

Reference: Communication from the Commission on risk and crisis management in agriculture: OJ C 123, 21.5.2005; COM(2005) 74; Bull. 3-2005, point 1.3.59 Adopted on 16 February. The Parliament wel- comed the Commission communication on the establishment of ambitious risk and crisis man- agement measures in the agricultural sector but suggested a number of additions to the text. It is against surrendering Community preference and considers that there is an urgent need for a more detailed examination of the instruments and measures used by the Union and its Member States for preventing risks and dealing with crises. The Parliament believes that measures under common market organisations (CMO) con- tinue to be justified particularly in vulnerable areas, such as fruit and vegetable production. It invited the Commission to introduce safety net provisions in the event of a crisis affecting the CMO in beef, fruit and vegetables, wine, pork and poultry. In addition, it called on the Com- mission to assess the impact of scarce oil sup- plies and possible scenarios for dealing with it, including the option of granting aid for the pur- chase of fuel in times of exceptional oil price rises, and at the same time a substantial rise in aid granted per area of production for energy crops. The Parliament called on the Commission to reflect on the insurance and social security sys- tems, with a view to creating a better policy framework for risk management and crisis pre- vention at the European level.

The Parliament, in agreement with the Commission, considered that the development of Community policies implies greater integration of European forestry strategy in the whole of European policy and cooperation between Member States in this field.

Favourable, subject to certain amendments covering in particular: the need to take into account the requirements of the new common agricultural policy (CAP) and of the repercus- sions of developments arising from the European Union\u2019s (EU) international negotiations within its strategic guidelines; the integration of women into the labour market which should be a hori- zontal priority in the implementation of the strate- gic guidelines; the recognition of the fact that the European agricultural model evolves to meet new social demands, such as for quality products, food safety, green tourism, the enhancement of the nat- ural heritage, and alternative energy sources; the fact that the diversity of situations in the rural areas involves differentiated rural development strategies; the need to apply the cohesion princi- ple in rural areas; the importance of crafts in the countryside which enable job creation, training of young people through apprenticeships, the transmission of traditional skills and the creation of social ties in the most remote areas; support for rural areas should involve the provision of essential funding to the new Member States in order to reduce the gap between them and the EU-15; Member States should have the necessary flexibility to adapt Community priorities in order to tailor them to the particular conditions pre- vailing on their territory; the promotion of the forestry and renewable energy sectors. Adopted on 20 February. This document supple- ments the regulation setting up the new European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EARDF) 2007\u201313. Strategic orientations provide a detailed explanation of the three areas of inter- vention in the new rural development pro- gramme, which are the improvement in compet- itiveness in the agricultural and forestry sectors, the improvement of the environment, the land- scape, and the quality of life in rural zones, and identify important areas for carrying out the Community\u2019s priorities. They also indicate some of the basic principles: agriculture as a deter- mining factor in the quality of the landscape and environment, the European agricultural model which reflects the multifunctional role of agri- culture in the wealth and diversity of the coun- tryside, food products and cultural and natural heritage, as well as the importance of the CAP reforms of 2003 and 2004.

Reference: Special report No 3/2005: OJ C 279, 11.11.2005; Bull. 7/8-2005, point 1.9.12 Adopted on 20 February. The Council noted the submission of the Court of Auditors\u2019 special report No 3/2005 on the verification of agri-envi- ronment expenditure under the rural develop- ment. It indicated that a balance must be found between maintaining control of agri-environment measures and the cost of managing that control and underlined the need to maintain control of the application of the agri-environment measures provided for under the rural development policy.

The purpose of this proposal is to undertake the cod- ification of Council Regulation (EEC) No 845/72 laying down special measures to encourage silk- worm rearing. It is envisaged that this regulation ",
        "Agriculture and rural development Bull. EU 1/2-2006 61 would supersede the various acts incorporated in it; their content is fully preserved, and they are brought together with only such formal amend- ments as are required by the codification exercise itself. This proposal introduces a working method which uses codification as a means of achieving greater clarity and transparency. This method was unanimously agreed on by the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament. In 1987, the Commission instructed its services to codify all legislative acts after no more than 10 amend- ments, and if possible, at even shorter intervals.

The proposed regula- tion aims to simplify marketing rules for eggs. It states that the standards should in principle be applicable to all eggs of hens of the Gallus gal- lus species. Nevertheless, it appears advisable to exempt from the application of those standards certain forms of direct sale from the producer to the final consumer where small quantities are involved. A clear distinction should be drawn between eggs suitable for direct human con- sumption and eggs not suitable for direct human consumption, in particular broken or incubated eggs, which are for use in the food and non-food industry. Therefore it states that two quality classes of eggs, Class A and Class B, should be distinguished. The consumer should be able to distinguish between eggs of different quality and weight grades and should be able to identify the farming method used. This requirement should be met by marking eggs and stamping packs. Finally, the packing centres which have been approved should lay down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin and should grade eggs by quality and weight. COM(2006) 89 Sugar 1.16.10.

        "Agriculture and rural development 62 Bull. EU 1/2-2006 follows: a 30% reduction of sugar prices spread out over four years, compensated for with decoupled aid for sugar farmers of up to 90% of the resulting loss of income; the temporary con- tinuation of the intervention mechanism with the changing of the \u2018everything but arms\u2019 pro- gramme and the introduction of a protection clause whereby the European Commission would be able to suspend sugar imports from developing countries in the event of sharp increase in imports; an increase, in relation to the original proposal, of restructuring aid to those farms that will cease production; increased aid for sugar grown to generate electricity from the current EUR 45 per hectare to EUR 80 per hectare and increasing the maximum surface area eligible for such aid from the current 1.5 million to 2.2 million hectares. The Parlia- ment, in addition, approved an amendment call- ing for EUR 200 million more aid each year for sugar farmers in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP). Adopted on 20 February. The Council formally adopted the three regulations on the reform of the common market organisation for sugar. The reform includes sugar price reductions of 36% in total over the period 2006/07 to 2009/10 and direct aid for compensation to producers for this price reduction up to 60% from 2006/07. To help the restructuring of this sector, aid will be granted to factories that halt production over the four marketing years. A safeguard clause (suspension or temporary withdrawal of trade concessions) will be triggered, if, as from the 2008/09 mar- keting years, sugar imports from a third country beneficiary of the \u2018everything but arms\u2019 initiative increase by more than 25% on the previous year. The Council also adopted the rules for EUR 40 million in aid in 2006 for 18 ACP countries which export sugar to the European Union. OJ L 58, 28.2.2006 Beef and veal, sheepmeat 1.16.12.

Deci- sion 82/530/EEC permits the United Kingdom to allow the government of the Isle of Man to apply a system of special import licences to products of the sheepmeat, beef and veal sectors, which makes it possible to restrict the imports of these meats so as not to disturb domestic production. This decision has been extended several times on a temporary basis since its entry into force in 1982. This report provides an outline of the leg- islative background and agricultural market organisation and evaluates the situation. During the import derogation, the activity in the sheep and cattle sector has been maintained and the sec- tor has remained an important branch of the island\u2019s economy. The Commission highlights its concern that the efficiency of and orientation to the market of the sectors can be questioned as the meat sector experiences monopolistic tendencies that tend to lead to relatively high consumer prices and low producer prices. It fears that this would go against the developments of the com- mon agricultural policy (CAP) and may not be sustainable in the longer term. It is the Commis- sion\u2019s view that the special regime should not be extended indefinitely. Accordingly, the Commis- sion proposes to extend the current temporary ",

The Parliament expressed its concerns at the inactivity of the Council in the Mediterranean Sea which is acknowledged to be one of the most diverse and complex regions bio- logically as well as in environmental, social and economic terms. It also noted that this inactivity, by preventing the adoption of more responsible rules that are better adapted to the general frame- work of the common fisheries policy, is incom- patible with the objective of sustainable develop- ment. The Parliament is worried by the fact that if a decision is not taken quickly, international obli- gations regarding management of fisheries in the European Union are in danger of not being met. 1.17.2.

The Commission has proposed a draft long-term man- agement plan for plaice and sole fisheries in the North Sea which, according to scientists, are fished at unsustainable levels. The plan defines target levels of fishing mortality (measure of fish killed by fishing) of 0.3 for plaice and 0.2 for sole. These are values which will allow high yields in the long term, reduce discarding, and allow a reduced biological risk to the fish stocks. Fishing mortality will be reduced by 10% year- on-year until the target levels have been reached, while annual variations in TACs will be kept within 15% up or down. COM(2005) 714 1.17.4.

The Parliament wel- comed the Commission\u2019s decision to retain the Shetland Box for a further three years, to allow time to evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme. The Shetland Box was created in 1983, and allows restricted access to the zone for boats over 26 metres which fish demersal stocks. Fishing licences are granted only to Belgium, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Parliament took note of the opinion of European scientists that the removal of the box could lead to increased fishing effort in the zone. Scientists also pointed out that German and British authorities were in favour of the retention of the scheme. The Parliament said the Shetland box was important for haddock, whiting and angler fish. It also wel- comed the Commission\u2019s wish to retain the Plaice Box. The Commission was called on to assess the effectiveness of this scheme in the light of future flat fish management measures, including a plan to rebuild plaice stocks. The Plaice Box was cre- ated in 1989 to reduce the numbers of juvenile plaice being thrown back overboard. Beam trawlers of over 300 horsepower were not allowed in the defined zone at certain periods. Since 1995, the box has been closed to boats throughout the year. 1.17.5.

The Council adopted a regulation establishing a multi- annual plan for the sustainable exploitation of the stock of sole in the Bay of Biscay. The objective of the plan is to bring the spawning stock biomass of Bay of Biscay sole above the precautionary level of 13 000 tonnes in 2008 by gradually reducing the fishing mortality rate on the stock. After this date the Council will decide on a long- term target fishing mortality rate and a rate of reduction in the fishing mortality rate. Each year the Council will decide on a total allowable catch (TAC) for the following year for Bay of Biscay sole. In order to limit fishing effort, measured as the sum of the engine power in kilowatt and the number of days fishing in the area, the regulation provides for: either a special sole fishing permit in the Bay of Biscay which will be granted to ves- sels fishing more than 2 000 kg of sole by the Member States, or for a Member State whose quota for sole in this area is less than 10% of the TAC, the level of fishing effort must not exceed the reference level of the fishing effort in 2006.

The Committee expressed its pleasure that the Commission has set about adding substance to the Hague pro- gramme, and its belief that the renewal and modernisation of the European policy on free- dom, security and justice provides an opportu- nity to gain citizens\u2019 support. It notes however an omission of the recognition of the crucial role played by local authorities. The Committee supported and encouraged the development in 2006\u201307 of an action plan in the fields of free- dom, security and justice, and believes that its objectives should include the development and dissemination of best practices in the fields of crisis management, the fight against terrorism, combating radicalisation and organised crime. It also suggested the development of a support network to facilitate knowledge transfer, qual- ity assurance and training programmes. It pointed out that the adaptation of the pro- grammes to the regional and local needs should be accompanied by the provision of adequate financial resources to allow the successful implementation of the action plan.

EU 1/2-2006 exists a lack of balance between the three dimen- sions of freedom, security and justice, with secu- rity accounting for an excessively large propor- tion of the budget. It expresses concern that the proposal fails to respect the principle of sub- sidiarity with not one case mentioned where intervention might be best at the national, regional and/or local level. Regarding fundamen- tal rights, the Committee suggests more con- certed measures against the problem of Islamo- phobia in Europe, and the creation of a separate budget line entitled \u2018Fight against violence\u2019 to cover the problems of violence towards children, adolescents, women and the victims of human trafficking, which would make it easier to fix pri- orities and increase transparency. 1.18.3.

Report from the Commission to the Council on visa waiver reciprocity with certain third countries in accordance with Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 851/2005 amend- ing Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement as regards the reciprocity mechanism. References: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 453/2003: OJ L 69, 13.3.2003; Bull. 3-2003, point 1.4.3 Council Regulation (EC) No 851/2005 amending Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 as regards the reci- procity mechanism: OJ L 141, 4.6.2005; Bull. 6- 2005, point 1.4.7 Adopted on 10 January. The Commission con- siders that the situation as regards reciprocity has significantly improved since the period which immediately followed the last enlargement of the European Union. According to them, 22 of the 33 third countries appearing in Annex II of Coun- cil Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 required visas from one or more new Member States. Altogether there were 112 cases of non-reciprocity towards new Member States on 1 May 2004. In addition, the Commission considers that the notification system introduced within the framework of the new reciprocity mechanism shows that the num- ber of non-reciprocity cases has fallen signifi- cantly since enlargement. Only 13 third countries were notified, five of them were for reasons other than the imposition of a visa requirement. In ref- erence to the 13 third countries, 75 cases were notified and, among these, 18 cases concerned the limitation of the period of stay under the visa waiver and four concerned specific formalities for border crossing or short stay. The improvement of the situation is a result of the diplomatic efforts made by both the Commission and the Member States since 1 May 2004 and confirms the effi- ciency of the method on which the new reci- procity mechanism is based, including the dia- logue and diplomatic contacts with the third countries concerned.

With a view to facilitating the crossing for border residents having legitimate reasons to cross the external border frequently, the Parliament has proposed the issuing of a \u2018local border traffic permit\u2019 in place of the planned \u2018L\u2019 visa, which would incorporate all the required security stan- dards and would therefore not need to be stamped on each crossing of the border. The Parlia- ment defined the term \u2018border residents\u2019 as third- country nationals resident in the border area for at least one year, suggested the border area in the Member State not exceed thirty kilometres for security reasons, and recommended individual Member States be allowed to define a maximum permitted length of stay, which may not exceed three months, through bilateral negotiations. Finally, the Parliament also proposed that no dif- ferentiation be made between different external land borders, as new members are expected to join the area in 2007. The implementation of the proposed amendments would, according to the Parliament, ensure effective controls at the exter- nal border while not negatively disturbing the life of people living on either side. 1.18.8.

This Commission com- munication outlines the features of the thematic programme for cooperation with third countries in the areas of migration and asylum. The general objective of the programme is to bring specific, complementary assistance to third countries to support them in their efforts to ensure better man- agement of migratory flows in all their dimen- sions. It consists of five strands: fostering links between migration and development, promoting well managed labour migration, fighting illegal migration, protecting migrants against exploita- tion and exclusion, and promoting asylum and international protection. It is with the aim of rationalising and simplifying the current legisla- tive framework, that the Commission has also proposed a new set of instruments, including pre- accession assistance, the European neighbour- hood policy, humanitarian aid and economic and development cooperation, under the Financial perspectives 2007 to 2013 to achieve the afore- mentioned objectives of this thematic programme.

The Committee noted that despite the adoption of the Hague pro- gramme in November 2004 on the creation of a common area of freedom, security and justice, a satisfactory common political approach does not yet exist, as Member States continue to apply dif- ferent practices which result in conflicting and antagonistic policies existing within the Commu- nity. In relation to these proposals, the Commit- tee expressed its reservations about the way in which border protection and the integration of migrants are treated under the same initiative, and stressed the need to ensure that both programmes are sufficiently distinct from each other so as to prevent any confusion. It also criticised the inclu- sion of asylum and immigration within the pro- posed framework, and referred to the drawing up of a list of \u2018safe\u2019 third countries as a contentious issue. Despite referring to various confusing ele- ments that undermine the coherence and credi- bility of the proposal, and its disappointment at not seeing the inclusion of its previous opinions on related matters, the Committee expressed its general support for the proposals. 1.18.11.

The Commission has set out how practical cooperation between Mem- ber States can support the realisation of the goals set out in the Hague programme. The Brussels European Council called for the establishment of appropriate structures involving the national asy- lum services of the Member States with a view to facilitating practical collaborative cooperation towards three main objectives: achieving an EU- wide single procedure; the joint compilation, assessment and application of country of origin information; and working closer to address par- ticular pressures on asylum systems resulting from factors such as geographic location. Practi- cal cooperation is expected to enable Member States to become familiar with systems and prac- tices of others and foster closer working relations at the operational level. The main goal of closer convergence in decision-making by Member States within the framework of Community leg- islation will eventually lead to an improvement in quality across all aspects of the management of asylum in Member States.

The objective of this proposal is to simplify, speed up and reduce the costs of litigation in cross-border cases concerning uncontested pecuniary claims and to permit the free circulation of European orders for payment throughout the Member States.

        "Area of freedom, security and justice 74 Bull. EU 1/2-2006 the proposal by the Commission and suggested a number of minor amendments. It was of the opinion that the legal basis is sound, and that the proposal would ensure that all parties have equal rights to fair, expeditious, accessible dispute- settlement procedures in all Member States. The most notable recommendations include the raising of the proposed ceiling of EUR 2 000, which it deems insufficient to cover a substantial number of situations, to at least EUR 5 000, and the removal of arbitration as a form of dis- pute resolution from Article 2. The intention of the Committee\u2019s more specific comments is sim- ply to enhance the proposal and fine-tune some of its mechanisms, so as to maximise its effec- tiveness. 1.18.18.

The Committee expressed a favourable opinion on the Commis- sion proposal which it believes would clarify Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000. It rec- ommended a number of improvements to the pro- posal, notably the clarification of some of the new points which create a degree of confusion as to how its content should be interpreted, further details of arrangements for proof of receipt referred to in Article 14, and the checking of the different language versions because there appear to be a number of discrepancies between them. The Committee also expressed its concern at the lack of consideration given by the Commission to the implementation of the regulation in the new Member States. It concluded by welcoming the use of the European judicial network in the reform procedure which is an instrument created specifically for this purpose. 1.18.19.

The Commission pre- sented a revised report on the application of the Council framework decision on the European arrest warrant and surrender procedures between Member States. The revision only concerns Ital- ian legislation, adopted since the presentation of the original report. Despite an initial delay, which caused temporary difficulties, the arrest warrant has now been implemented by all Member States following the adoption of the Italian law in April 2005 which transposed the framework decision.

The present communi- cation seeks to clarify the concept of disqualifi- cation, to assess the relevant legislation at Euro- pean level and to outline the approach likely to be followed in this regard. Within the same State and across the European Union, the possible range of disqualifications is broad and the nature and methods of these sanctions can vary considerably. They may flow from statutory provisions, court decisions or administrative instruments, and information on them can be very unreliable. Sev- eral steps have already been taken to improve existing information exchange mechanisms, but the lack of harmonisation continues to be an obstacle to mutual recognition.

The Committee expresses a number of concerns relating to the proposal, including the affect on fundamental rights, particularly privacy, and the undermining of citizens\u2019 confidence in electronic communications which may hinder the development of the information society and undermine the Lisbon strategy. It recommends a substantial revision of the proposal so it may respect fundamental rights, rules of access and the use and exchange of data. Adopted by the Council on 21 February. This directive aims to harmonise Member States\u2019 pro- visions concerning the obligations of the providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks with respect to the retention of certain data which are generated or processed by them, in order to ensure that the data are available for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, as defined by each Member State in its national law. 1.18.23.

The Committee expressed its favourable opinion on the Commis- sion proposal to change the legal basis, and stressed the need for a proper consultation with the European Parliament over the proposal, so as to guarantee transparency with respect to public opinion. The new proposal strengthens the role of the Parliament, which has to designate two independent experts in the field of drugs to the centre\u2019s management board: the Committee strongly recommended that they be experts asso- ciated with non-governmental organisations (NGO). Finally, the Committee also recom- mended that the national focal points within Member States collaborate with all national organisations, including NGOs which work in the field of narcotics. ",

Broadly satisfied with the Commission pro- posal relating to transnational mobility in the Community for education and training, the Com- mittee proposed however that detailed attention be given to certain points such as: information on Member States programmes at the national and local level; data provided on equal opportunity between candidates; procedures applied to poten- tial participants which have to be clear, transpar- ent and precise; linguistic preparation of those taking part in a programme, so that they can fully benefit from training. In addition, the Committee called for a precise definition of the field of responsibilities for each actor of the programme, so as to avoid all claims or misunderstandings between organisations. It also recommended a date for the European charter on the quality of mobility to enter into force, in order to incite Member States to act. 1.19.5. Communication from the Commission to the European Council on \u2018Implementing the renewed partnership for growth and jobs \u2014 Developing a knowledge flagship: the European Institute of Technology\u2019.

This institute would con- centrate on the three sides of the knowledge tri- angle: education, research and innovation, which are key to a knowledge society. The EIT will comprise two pillars: a governing board with a small supporting administration, and a set of knowledge communities all over Europe, carrying out strategic and trans-disciplinary activities. Funded by the EU, Member States and the busi- ness community, the EIT\u2019s objectives are to attract the best and most talented students, researchers and staff worldwide, to strengthen opportunities for the commercialisation of research and create a closer two-way exchange between the public and the private sector. The Commission will put forward a formal proposal before the end of 2006. COM(2006) 77 Youth and sport Youth Policy objectives 1.19.6.

Reference: Commission communication: OJ C 236, 24.9.2005; COM(2005) 206; Bull. 5-2005, point 1.4.15 Adopted on 15 and 16 February. Pleased with the Commission\u2019s approach as regards policies for employment and the social inclusion of young people, the Committee however expressed reser- vations on the application of the open method of coordination, which, it said, does not sufficiently develop the role of local and regional authorities and thus does not respect their prerogatives. It recommended that Member States ensure the participation of these authorities in the develop- ment, the application and the follow-up of poli- cies for youth at the national level, and that the Council guarantee their participation on the Euro- pean level. The Committee asked the Commis- sion to promote actions supporting the evolution of knowledge, competencies and all the opera- tional tools contributing to reinforce and improve the work of the communities. Lastly, the Com- mittee noted that communication goes hand in hand with the Community policies of freedom of movement for workers and students, and the mobility of teachers, trainers and people in train- ing, in particular of young people. 1.19.7.

The Council noted that for the first time the implementation of the Euro- pean youth pact, which was adopted last year in order to contribute to the relaunch of the Lisbon strategy, was referred to as part of national reform programmes. The role of youth must be rein- forced within the new and improved Lisbon strat- egy, youth organisations must become more closely involved in making the pact a reality, more must be done to ensure social and socio- cultural integration of young people and the mobility of young people must be promoted. In their recommendations, Members States\u2019 minis- ters called upon the European Council to: pro- mote further progress in provisions pertaining to young people, via the inclusion of the youth pact in the Lisbon strategy; oblige Member States to strengthen the links between policies concerning young people, in order to develop non-sectorial strategies for youth; call upon Member States and the Commission to always and visibly refer to the youth pact in national reform programmes and/or in annual progress reports.

The Committee underlined the need to set up a clear, uniform and simple procedure to determine the representation of European organisations in civil society. This procedure should be based on the principles of transparency, objectivity, non-dis- crimination and on the possibility for European organisations to conduct checks. The Committee also proposed that the procedure comprise qual- itative criteria, the establishment of the organisa- tion in Member States and the provisions of the statutes of the organisation and their enactment.

Mr Figel\u2019 met Ms Spellings, the US Secretary for Education, Ms Hughes, the State Department Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, as well as various education experts and representatives from the World Bank. This visit\u2019s main objective is to reinforce and renew Euro- pean\u2013US cooperation in higher education and vocational training, which since it began in 1995 has involved over 600 institutions and 3 000 stu- dents. In Boston, Mr Figel\u2019 exchanged views with Ms Hockfield, the President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on the new EU initiative to create a European Institute of Technology. In his speech at Georgetown University, Commis- sioner Figel\u2019 focused on European cultural and language issues, in particular the evolving Euro- pean identity. The Commissioner also delivered a speech at Harvard University which focused on the role of the knowledge society as a response to the challenge of globalisation. The Commis- sioner\u2019s visit also provided an occasion to review education policy developments in the United States and in the EU and discuss the opportuni- ties arising from the Bologna process. Finally, Mr Figel\u2019 met Ms Shiner, the State Department Undersecretary for Economic, Business and Agri- cultural Affairs to discuss the preparation of the forthcoming G8 ministerial meeting on education that will be held in Russia.

This communi- cation is part of the EU\u2019s response to the increas- ing global environmental pressures and the fact that two thirds of the planet\u2019s key ecosystem ser- vices are being degraded or used unsustainably, and present an obstacle to achieving the millen- nium development goals. COM(2006) 20 Sustainable development Sustainable development strategy 1.20.4. Own-initiative opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on sustainable development in agriculture, forestry, fishery and the challenges of climate change. Adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee, at the session of 18 and 19 January. The Committee considers climate change to be the biggest challenge facing the European Union (EU) and the entire planet over the coming decades. It believes the EU must significantly step up efforts to combat climate change and begin ",
        "Environment Bull. EU 1/2-2006 81 drawing up adaptation strategies in a consistent way for various policy areas. Therefore it recom- mends that future presidency countries should devote increasing attention to extending climate change policy to include adaptation measures. Moreover, the Committee believes that the EU can contribute to the preparation of sectorial adap- tation strategies by the EU and all Member States by bringing the benefit of good coordination and the support of international agreements. Further- more, the Committee feels it is essential that the Union substantially increase research resources to analyse climate change and adaptation policies and to implement security programmes. Finally, the Committee believes that the production and use of wood resources should be increased and that the role of forests in containing climate change should be taken seriously. Fisheries policy will also have to assess the adjustments the sec- tor needs to make to adapt to changes in water resources and fisheries conditions. 1.20.5.

The Parliament esti- mated that, above all, the majority of guidelines in the new European Union (EU) strategy for sustainable development are insufficient to be able to cope with the challenge, and it noted that sustainable development should be a driving principle in EU policies in all sectors and that the direct consequences of inaction will be con- siderable. Parliament voiced its concern that the European Union would not be able to meet the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s targets for 2012. Nevertheless, it acknowledged the progress that has been made over the past five years, particularly the carbon trading market or reform of agricultural and fish- eries policy. Parliament insists that a boost is required for a more ambitious EU sustainable development strategy in a number of areas, specifically by: transferring a large part of road transport to a more environment-friendly mode of transport; promoting the production and use of biofuels instead of fossil fuels; reducing medium- and long-term waste production at its source; promoting sustainable construction and urbanism; demanding fuller impact analyses for all decisions or legislation proposals from the Commission and by adopting all the thematic strategies by summer 2006 at the latest. Parlia- ment underlined its concern about the rise in air traffic and pollution caused by emissions from aircraft and asked the Commission to respond by introducing a pilot emission trading system for 2008\u201312.

The goal of the draft directive is to help Member States prevent and limit floods and their damag- ing effects on human health, the environment, infrastructure and property.

Where real risks of flood damage exist, Member States shall develop flood risk maps. Finally, flood risk man- agement plans must be drawn up for these zones. The management plans are to include measures to reduce the probability of flooding and its poten- tial consequences. They will address all phases of the flood risk management cycle but focus par- ticularly on prevention (such as preventing dam- age caused by floods by avoiding construction of houses and industries in present and future flood- prone areas or by adapting future developments to the risk of flooding), protection (by taking measures to reduce the likelihood of floods and/or the impact of floods in a specific location such as restoring flood plains and wetlands) and preparedness (for instance through providing instructions to the public on what to do in the event of flooding).

This proposal for a reg- ulation is a recasting of Council Decision 2001/792/EC, which establishes the mechanism. The recast is intended to strengthen the mecha- nism, based upon the lessons learned in past emergencies, and to provide a legal basis for additional support and complementary action at Community level. However, it introduces a lim- ited number of changes in the text of the deci- sion. It incorporates, above all, the concept of civil protection modules in the decision, intro- duces a new approach to the transport of civil protection assistance and mandates the Commis- sion to provide basic logistical support to the experts and teams operating on site. It creates the possibility for the Commission to mobilise additional assistance that cannot be obtained from Member States but which is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of intervention. Finally, the proposal also provides a legal basis for the Commission to contribute to the development of early warning systems. It allows closer coopera- tion with third countries to enhance the effec- tiveness of the mechanism. It clarifies and strengthens the coordination arrangements for civil protection assistance interventions in these countries.

Reference: Commission White Paper \u2018European transport policy for 2010: time to decide\u2019: COM(2001) 370; Bull. 9-2001, point 1.4.43 Adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee at the session of 14 and 15 February. The Committee stated that there should be a broad consultation of the public and of expert opinion on the needs to be met by railway stations, taking into account technological and technical develop- ments. Options for regulatory arrangements must be worked out at regional, Member State and European Union (EU) level, based on actual needs and with due regard to the subsidiarity principle. The Committee indicates that EU legislation must take account of public expectations of international railway stations with regard to general improve- ments in passenger safety and protection from ter- rorist attacks. For the Committee, it is important that railway stations primarily fulfil their basic function as transport interchanges, rather than becoming centres for other activities such as shop- ping and business. It wishes that the maintenance and development, not only of railway stations in large cities and of those serving international traf- fic, but also of railway stations used by people liv- ing in particularly disadvantaged regions, should be made a priority. Railway station development projects are of particular importance, given the role of such projects in helping promote social and eco- nomic cohesion in the new Member States.

The Committee believes that the creation of a level playing field and the reduction of legal uncertainty will help promote public transport. It endorsed the recognition of the specific nature of public aid for the provi- sion of services of economic interest and the def- inition of public service contracts which clarify rights and obligations of each party. It welcomed the fact that, with due regard for the subsidiar- ity principle, the proposed regulation provides local and regional authorities with the necessary flexibility to respond more effectively to the spe- cific or complex local requirements of public transport services, in line with their social and territorial cohesion objectives.

Safety and security of transport General aspects 1.21.14. Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on enhancing sup- ply chain security. Adopted on 27 February. The Commission con- sidered that the first step towards improving the security of the entire supply chain is needed. It considered, in view of the size and complexities of the market, that a voluntary, but controlled framework for land transport supply chain secu- rity is the most appropriate course of action. For the Commission, the framework will stimulate interconnectivity between the various modes of transport and operators, thereby enhancing secu- rity along the supply chain as a whole. Further- more, it underlines that the framework has to be put in place and can be further developed over time, in line with the assessed security risks and the level of acceptance by commercial operators. The Commission will encourage supply chain operators to introduce new security management tools and to improve existing ones in accordance with specific minimum requirements. Finally, it points out that the voluntary element is under- pinned by practical advantages in security con- trols, including those carried out by customs. Moreover, the Commission mentioned that it encourages innovative measures and allows par- ticipants to increase their competitiveness. COM(2006) 79 1.21.15. Proposal for a regulation of the Euro- pean Parliament and of the Council on enhancing supply chain security. Adopted on 27 February. The Commission seeked to: increase the level of security along the supply chain without impending the free flow of trade; establish a common framework for a systematic European land transport security approach without jeopardising the common trans- port market and existing security measures; avoid in this context unnecessary administrative proce- dures and burdens at European and national lev- els; improve the European Union\u2019s international standing in security matters. In view of the speci- ficities and size of the market concerned, the measure proposed: establishing a system requir- ing Member States to create a security quality label; introducing a voluntary scheme under witch operators in the supply chain increase their security performance in exchange for incentives; making operators in the supply chain responsible for their security performance in European freight transport; allowing \u2018secure operators\u2019 to benefit from facilitations where security controls are car- ried out and to distinguish themselves positively from other competitors and allowing the regular updating and upgrading of security requirements.

The Commission con- ducted a survey of the European road safety action plan launched in 2003. The number of deaths on European Union (EU) roads increased to 41 600 in 2005. It also notes that progress has acceler- ated since road safety has become a political con- cern in the Member States. The review, which contains summary files on individual Member States, shows a very contrasting picture regarding the performance of individual Member States: the countries that have recorded a more rapid reduc- tion than the EU-25 average, the countries that have seen limited progress and the countries where the situation has deteriorated. The Com- ",
        "Transport Bull. EU 1/2-2006 91 mission shows that efforts need to be redoubled in order to achieve the objective set in 2001 of hav- ing the number of facilities on the roads by 2010 (i.e. cutting the figure from 50 000 deaths in 2001 to 25 000 in 2010). Indeed, given the current rates of progress, there would still be 32 500 victims on Europe\u2019s roads in 2010, some way short of the target figure.

The Parliament sup- ported the Commission in its desire to make progress on the EU external policy for aviation. It is pleased with the method chosen by the Com- mission: renegotiation of the existing bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries to conform with Community law and negotiation of global agreements with third coun- tries on the basis of the principles of market opening and statutory convergence. Parliament stressed that a coherent policy had to be put in place, allying market opening and statutory con- vergence, to know that future air agreements, which must be balanced in terms of market access, could include such issues as cabotage, rights of establishment, property and controls, competition rules and State aid, but only on a strictly reciprocal basis. The Parliament suggests that for the countries with which the EU has to negotiate and in order to take account of eco- nomic criteria, priority must be given to countries of substantial importance for the European mar- ket (China, Russia, the United States), as well as countries situated close to Europe, and also that agreements should contain references to interna- tional laws on social rights and to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and EU secu- rity regulations. According to Parliament, Mem- ber States must endeavour more to assist third countries in which the safety level is insufficient and it exhorts the Commission to insist on the necessity to include references to international social legislation in the agreements, in particular to the standards of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) or to the Rome Convention on the law applicable to contracts. 1.21.18.

Parliament supported the Commission in its desire for a mandate to nego- tiate overall air agreements with China and Rus- sia. Parliament insisted that no global agreement with Russia would be reached without the com- plete abolition of Russian overflight charges, nor did it support a modified version of charges to replace the current scheme. Parliament also asked the Commission not to conclude an agreement on Russia\u2019s membership of the World Trade Organ- isation (WTO) while Russia continues to make these charges. Regarding China, it called on the Council to extend the scope of the Commission\u2019s negotiating mandate on putting in place the nec- essary infrastructure in Chinese airports and air traffic control over Chinese airspace, both of which are inadequate at present. 1.21.19.

The Committee stated that in the international context of increasing energy demand, the sensi- ble improvement of energy efficiency constitutes an important element of the forthcoming energy policy. It is important for the Committee not to ignore the fact that the rapid rise in demand and increase in energy costs can have a heavy impact on the economic growth of the European Union (EU), to encourage certain high energy consum- ing sectors to relocate and, consequently, damage the social situation of Member States. It fully supported the plan to reduce energy consumption by 20% and feels that it is vital not only to quickly reach the objective of a 1% annual reduc- tion in energy consumption but to also set an effective reduction target of 2% as part of a sec- ond phase. The Committee underlined that trans- port and construction industries, as the two sec- tors with the largest energy consumption, must be the focus of intense efforts and the search for innovation. According to the Committee, the con- tinued and gradual introduction of efficient inno- vations in the field of energy efficiency responds to the needs of both consumers and industry. Finally, it underlined that the EU and Member States must become strongly involved in conver- gent policies aimed at promoting energy effi- ciency, the exchange of best practices, the distri- bution of the best technologies as well as information and incentive campaigns for house- holds and consumers. 1.22.3.

Reference: Commission communication \u2018Biomass action plan\u2019: COM(2005) 628; Bull. 12-2005, point 1.4.82 Adopted on 8 February . The Commission pro- posed a biofuels strategy for the European Union (EU) that intends to reflect the current knowl- edge, prepare the way for future developments and set out a specific approach to biofuels with three aims. Firstly, the Commission wishes to fur- ther promote biofuels in the EU and developing countries, ensuring that their production and use is globally effective for the environment and that they contribute to the objectives of the Lisbon strategy. Secondly, it seeks to prepare for the large-scale use of biofuels by improving their cost competitiveness through the optimised cultivation of dedicated feedstocks, research into second generation biofuels, and support for market pen- etration by scaling up demonstration projects and removing non-technical barriers. Finally, it aims to explore the opportunities for developing coun- tries, including those affected by the reform of the EU sugar regime, for the production of bio- fuel feedstocks and biofuels, and sets out the role that the EU could play in supporting the devel- opment of sustainable biofuel production.

The Commission\u2019s proposed action plan identifies five main areas that will map out future initiatives in this field. The first of these is the upgrading of existing minimum standards for animal protec- tion and welfare in line with new scientific evi- dence and socioeconomic assessments as well as the possibility of elaborating specific minimum standards for species or issues that are not cur- rently addressed in EU legislation. The second area is concerned with giving a high priority to promoting policy-oriented future research on animal protection and welfare and the applica- tion of the 3Rs principle: the principle of replace- ment, reduction and refinement of alternative approaches to animal testing. The third area deals with the introduction of standardised animal wel- fare indicators, which will enable the classifica- tion of welfare standards applied. On this basis options for EU labelling will be explored in a sys- tematic manner. Ensuring that animal keepers/ handlers and the general public are more involved and informed on current standards of animal pro- tection and welfare is the basis of the fourth area of the plan and the fifth, deals with contin- uing to provide support as well as introducing further international initiatives to raise aware- ness and create a greater consensus on animal welfare.

On labelling it suggested that within a maximum of six months from the date of adop- tion of the directive, the Commission should pres- ent a report on the possible introduction of a spe- cific, obligatory and harmonised labelling regime for chicken meat and chicken-based products, the label should also mention stocking density and the age of the animal. Also, it suggested that the competent authorities should carry out unan- nounced spot checks at least once a year to check that standards are being adhered to and the cost of these inspections should be met by the author- ities themselves. It was in favour of harmonised sanctions among Member States and introduced measures to check, and if necessary to ban, chicken imports from third countries and from holdings which failed to respect rules comparable with those of the EU. Finally, it suggested that four years at most from the date of adoption of the directive, the Commission should produce a report accompanied by a legislative proposal on respecting the principle that genetic selection must not limit, diminish or threaten the potential welfare of chickens. 1.23.6.

The Committee in general welcomed the proposal put forward and described it as an important effort to prevent and control diseases in aquatic animals. It accepted the view that special provisions should not be laid down, applicable to the placing on the market of orna- mental and other aquatic animals which are kept under controlled conditions. However, when such aquatic animals are kept outside closed systems ",

The Committee also stated that the risk of diseases can be mitigated by sound manage- ment and by keeping such stocks in closed and controlled systems, by maintaining good hygiene practices and applying the animal health moni- toring system and other measures proposed in the directive.

The Commission established interim protection meas- ures. Greece should establish protection and sur- veillance zones around the area where the virus is either suspected or confirmed. The protection zone with a radius of at least 3 kilometres and surveillance zone of at least 10 kilometres, shall take into account the geographical, administra- tive, ecological and epizootic factors relating to avian influenza, and of monitoring facilities. Measures to be applied within the protection zone include: periodic and documented visits to all commercial holdings, a clinical inspection of holdings, the implementation of appropriate on- farm bio-security measures and campaigns to increase disease awareness amongst owners, hunters and birdwatchers. Within the protection zone, the movement of poultry and other captive birds out of the zone is prohibited while in the surveillance zone their movement out of the zone is prohibited for the first 15 days following the establishment of the zone. The hunting of wild birds in this time frame is also prohibited. OJ L 40, 11.2.2006 1.23.9.

It lays down cer- tain protection measures to be applied in cases where highly pathogenic avian influenza is iso- lated in wild birds in the territory of a Member State, caused by influenza A virus of subtype H5 suspected or confirmed to be of the neu- raminidase type N1, in order to prevent the spread of avian influenza from wild birds to poultry or other captive birds as well as the con- tamination of products thereof.

The Committee expressed the opinion that in general the proposed decision establishing a joint programme for Community action on health and consumer protection is not justified or sufficiently elucidated in many respects. The reasons it gives for this are: that although there are common and ",
        "Health and consumer protection 100 Bull. EU 1/2-2006 complementary points between health and con- sumer policy, this is not enough proof of their supposed synergies and that incorrectly invoking a shared legal basis for the two policies could bring consumer protection policy into the remit of the strict subsidiarity criteria that underpins pub- lic health policy, thus having the perverse effect of undermining the EU\u2019s own powers in this field. It also stated that consumer policy is losing out in the general budget calculation because of this sin- gle basis. The Committee also expressed the fear that the proposed institutional innovations, in par- ticular the creation of a \u2018consumer institute\u2019 with rather sketchy powers and responsibilities (which will be acting as \u2018department\u2019 of the Executive Agency for the Public Health Programme but have no real powers of its own), will not make the decisive contribution that would be desirable to ensure that current legislation is implemented more effectively. Committee of the Regions opinion delivered at its session of 16 and 17 February. The committee advised that the local and regional authorities have to be associated with the initiatives regarding strategies to improve public health. It also stressed that in order to meet overall policy objectives, it is necessary for there to be more coordination between health and consumer protection policy and other policy areas; in particular in the fields of employment and agricultural policy. On the issue of the legal basis, it stated that resorting to a sin- gle legal basis for both public health and consumer protection contradicts the principle of subsidiarity. It also noted that the final budget has yet to be finalised and is dependent on current negotiations on the financial perspective of the EU for the period 2007\u201313 but that it sees fit that the policy of the EU regarding public health and consumer protection takes financial priority, as it is included in the programme and in the strategy. Finally, it stressed that the success of the information cam- paign envisioned in the strategy, relies in part on forging links between the local and regional level.

The Council welcomed the Commission\u2019s communication \u2018The western Balkans on the road to the EU: consolidating sta- bility, raising prosperity\u2019 as a good basis for fur- ther work in preparing discussions at the Gym- nich and at the informal EU\u2013western Balkans foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in Salzburg in March 2006. The Council expressed its sadness at the death of the President of Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova, and called on all Kosovar parties and leaders to work together so that further progress is achieved in implementing standards and that Kosovo participates constructively in the status process. The Council appointed Christian Schwarz-Schilling as EU Special Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Council wel- comed the discussions on constitutional reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina, assisted by the inter- national community, and encouraged the politi- cal leaders to ensure that the country\u2019s central institutions function more effectively in order to meet European standards. The Council recog- nised that the constitutional charter of Serbia and ",

It also stressed that such a process has to conform to internationally recognised democratic standards, a critical element for stability and for the pace of progress towards the EU. The Coun- cil expressed its full support for the mission of Ambassador Miroslav Lajcak, the personal rep- resentative of Javier Solana, Council Secretary General and CFSP High Representative. It called on all political forces in Montenegro to cooper- ate with each other and with the personal repre- sentative to agree on the conduct and implemen- tation of the proposed referendum and to refrain from unilateral actions that might reduce the chances of success of the dialogue. The Council expressed concern at the comments of the Inter- national Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) President and Chief Prosecu- tor in their presentations to the UN Security Council on 15 December 2005. The Council underlined again the importance of full coopera- tion with the ICTY by both Serbia and Mon- tenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Coun- cil recalled that the pace and conclusion of negotiations on stabilisation and association agreements with these countries will depend inter alia on full cooperation with the ICTY and that it would jointly review with the Commission the performance in this area and other key areas before negotiations conclude. The Council called on both countries to take decisive action to ensure that remaining fugitive indictees, notably Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, are finally brought to justice in The Hague. 1.24.12. Visit by Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, and Commissioner Rehn to the western Balkans from 15 to 18 February. Commission President Barroso undertook his first visit to the western Balkans region together with Commissioner Rehn. Mr Barroso met the leaders of Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro (including Kosovo), the former Yugoslav Republic of Mace- donia, Albania, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. President Barroso and Commissioner Rehn sent a message of encouragement and confidence. They reaffirmed that the Commission is commit- ted to the European perspective of the western Balkans. They encouraged the leaders of the countries to intensify their reform efforts so they can make faster progress on the road towards the European Union. 1.24.13.

The Council took note of the report on President Barroso\u2019s and Com- missioner Rehn\u2019s recent visit to the western Balkan countries. The Council welcomed progress made so far by the government and the opposition in defining the modalities for the pro- posed referendum in Montenegro. It called on both parties to reach a rapid agreement on the remaining open issues (majority requirement, the date and the question of the referendum), thus providing the process with the necessary legiti- macy. The Council welcomed the meeting between Belgrade and Pri s tina on decentralisa- tion, held on 20 and 21 February in Vienna under the auspices of the UN Special Envoy, as a demonstration of the preparedness of both sides to engage constructively in the Kosovo status process. Recalling the statement issued at the contact group ministerial meeting on 31 January 2006 the Council expressed its continued support for UN Special Envoy Ahtisaari and urged all parties to continue their engagement in this process and to maintain the spirit and the momen- tum of negotiations aiming to reach sustainable and practical solutions acceptable to all parties concerned on all outstanding issues such as decentralisation. The Council also reaffirmed the importance of continued and effective standards implementation. It urged the provisional institu- tions of self-government to intensify their efforts to achieve in parallel with the status process con- crete and rapid progress on standards implemen- tation, particularly regarding the protection of minority communities. The Council noted with concern recent comments by ICTY Chief Prose- cutor del Ponte about Serbia and Montenegro\u2019s unsatisfactory cooperation with ICTY. The Coun- cil strongly supported the recent messages deliv- ered by the Commission in Belgrade and Sara- jevo that full cooperation with the ICTY must be ",

The Council asked the Presidency and the Commission to remain in close contact with the Chief Prosecutor and to continue to keep the Council fully informed.

The European perspective provides a powerful incen- tive for political and economic reform in the region and has encouraged reconciliation among its peoples. The Commission believes that rein- forcing the EU\u2019s policy for the region, especially in areas of mutual interest where there is a strong demand from the people of the region, such as justice, liberty and security, education and trade, is the best means to strengthen the credibility of the process and to lessen political risks. The Commission\u2019s objective is to promote stability, security and prosperity in the western Balkans through the region\u2019s progressive integration into the European mainstream.

Satisfied by the concrete and undeniable contributions that the CFSP has already made toward peace and stability in the world, Parliament is concerned about the insub- stantial instruments currently available to the EU to exercise real influence on worrying develop- ments, like in Palestine, the Middle East, Iran, the Balkans or Ukraine. Parliament considers it is insufficiently informed or informed too late about initiatives taken under CFSP policy. It asked the Council to appear before its foreign affairs com- mittee to take note of all the \u2018general affairs and external relations\u2019 and all high-level Councils with international partners. The Parliament also proposed a review of financing in order to pro- vide sufficient flexibility for extraordinary spend- ing, and to strengthen the consistency and com- plementarity between Community policies and CFSP instruments. Moreover, it required imple- mentation of certain aspects of the European Constitution and called, within the framework of the revision of the EU security strategy, for greater importance to be given to the issue of EU energy supply from countries and regions that are increasingly unstable.

The Commission created a trust fund which will operate as a financial tool of the EU\u2013Africa partnership for infrastructure. The fund will target transnational projects, and in particular African energy, water and telecom net- works. The fund\u2019s political objective is to attract additional resources from Member States which have pledged to increase official development assistance in the framework of the millennium development goals. 1.28.3. European Parliament resolution on new financial instruments for development in connec- tion with the millennium goals. Adopted on 16 February. Parliament welcomed the conference to be held in Paris from 28 Feb- ruary to 1 March, which seeks to make progress on the agreement of international levies, with a particular focus on a possible levy on airline tickets. It insisted that any alternative methods of financing for development must bring new, additional funds for development and must not replace official development assistance. Parlia- ment nevertheless regretted the lack of a pre- cise timetable committing all developed coun- tries to the pursuit of the intermediate and final millennium development goals targets and high- lighted that the effectiveness of aid must be improved.

        "Development cooperation 124 Bull. EU 1/2-2006 Adopted on 25 January. The Commission pro- vided orientations for the future programming of thematic interventions, complementary to country programming, in the area of food security. It envisaged three main areas of intervention: sup- porting the delivery of international public goods contributing directly to food security and the financing of global programmes; addressing food insecurity in countries or regions where either governments are not in place, or not in control of parts of a country, or no country strategic frame- work is operational; and, finally, promoting inno- vative policies and strategies in the field of food security. The proposal focuses particularly on Africa and has a continental, regional, national and local level. COM(2006) 21 Health, AIDS and population 1.28.5.

Parliament stresses that disability issues should be reflected in the Com- mission\u2019s development policies and in its specific programmes. It believes that disability issues must be mainstreamed at all levels, from policy development to implementation and evaluation, and that all actors involved in EU development cooperation activities should be informed about issues relating to disability and the promotion and protection of the fundamental human rights of disabled people in developing countries.

The Commission pro- posed a programme intended to be the successor of the current NGO co-financing and decen- tralised cooperation programmes. The programme is \u2018actor-oriented\u2019 instead of \u2018sector-oriented\u2019. It supports stakeholders\u2019 right of initiative by pro- viding financial resources for their \u2018own initia- tives\u2019, when geographical programmes are not the appropriate instrument, and by complementing the support that other \u2018sectoral\u2019 thematic programmes can provide to the same actors. Three main areas of intervention were proposed: support for inter- ventions in the field carried out in partner coun- tries, interventions which promote awareness for development and activities which facilitate coor- dination between stakeholders\u2019 networks.

The Parliament voted in support of a neighbourhood policy for those European countries which do not, or do not cur- rently have an accession perspective, but seek a closer political and economic relationship with the EU. The Parliament insisted on the European neighbourhood policy being adapted to the needs of the different countries to which it applies and not being a one-size-fits-all policy. The Parlia- ment also supported the idea of sanctions against countries which failed to respect European and international standards, particularly in human rights, considering that, for such countries, the EU should be ready to restrict or suspend Com- munity aid, or even revoke the European neigh- bourhood policy action plan. Furthermore, the Parliament stated that the promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law must remain priorities in the ENP action plans drawn up within the framework of this policy. 1.30.2.

The European Parlia- ment has criticised the use of violence by the Egyptian police against Sudanese demonstrators in December, and urged the authorities to end their indiscriminate use of force on Sudanese asy- lum seekers, refugees and immigrants. It wel- comed the investigation into the violence by the Egyptian authorities, but has also called for an independent inquiry which would include some United Nations experts. The resolution criticises the failure of the United Nations High Commis- sion for Refugees (UNHCR) to find a solution for the Sudanese refugees, yet recognising the difficulties, urges the European Commission and Member States to establish genuine partnership with the UNHCR, to provide both political and financial support for their work in Cairo. Believ- ing there has been an escalation in the level of human rights violations in Egypt in recent months, the Parliament has repeated its calls for the rights of the leader of the Egyptian opposi- tion, Ayman Nour, who is currently imprisoned on charges of falsifying signatures required for the registration of his political party, to be respected.

Council conclusions on the Middle East peace process. Adopted on 30 January. The Council welcomed the holding on 25 January of elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council, and congratulated President Abbas and the Palestinian people on an electoral process that was both free and fair. It stressed the need for the continuous commitment of all parties to the pursuit of a peaceful solution with Israel, underlined that violence and terror are incompatible with democratic processes, and urged Hamas and all other factions to renounce violence, recognise Israel\u2019s right to exist, and to disarm. On this basis, the European Union would stand ready to continue to support Palestinian economic development and democratic State building. It reaffirmed its strong support for a two-State solution which would see the emer- gence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian State, and stated that it expected Israel to adhere to its obligations under the roadmap. 1.32.9.

It declared its respect of the results of the election, and called for the swift formation of a new government which abides by international rules, rejects violence, recognises Israel\u2019s right to exist, renounces all forms of terrorism, and com- mits itself to the principle of peaceful negotiation aiming at a two-State solution. The Parliament concluded by reaffirming its belief that the dis- pute over East Jerusalem remains an issue for negotiations by both sides, and called for an end to the discriminatory treatment of Palestinian res- idents, and for the re-opening of Palestinian insti- tutions in East Jerusalem. 1.32.10.

The Council adopted a statement strongly rejecting any threats by mili- tant factions against European Union citizens, in response to death threats made by certain Islamic circles against leading figures of Danish and Nor- wegian newspapers which published caricatures of the prophet Mohammed. The Muslim religion bans all imagery of Mohammed. The Council underlined the importance of both freedom of expression and respect for religious beliefs, as being part of the Union\u2019s fundamental values. 1.32.12. Council conclusions on the reactions in the Muslim world to publications in European and other media. Adopted on 27 February. The Council expressed its deep concern at the events that followed the publication of cartoons in a number of European and other media, and acknowledged and regretted that these cartoons were considered offensive and distressing by Muslims across the world. The Council strongly condemned all violent acts and threats against citizens and property of the Euro- pean Union, and expressed its full solidarity with all those countries whose citizens, diplomatic or consular missions have come under attack. It recalled the special duty of States under the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations to protect diplomatic agents and con- sular missions and called upon all governments to ensure they meet their obligations. It welcomed the statements by those prominent Muslim schol- ars and religious and political leaders who have called for moderation and have spoken out against the violent actions of a minority. The Council reiterated that whilst freedom of expres- sion is a fundamental right and an essential ele- ment of a democratic discourse, it does come with responsibilities, notably it should be exer- cised in a spirit of respect for religious and other beliefs and convictions. Finally, the Council wel- comed the recent visit to countries in the Middle East and the Gulf by Mr Solana, the Council Sec- retary-General and CFSP High Representative, and the contacts and renewed dialogue which have taken place in Vienna between the European Union Presidency, the Foreign Minister of Den- mark and Islamic leaders.

The Council expressed its grave concern at the removal of seals at sev- eral nuclear installations in Iran, and urged Iran to reinstate the seals and refrain from all enrich- ment related and reprocessing activities until international confidence is restored. It stressed that the current dispute is not one between Iran and Europe, but between Iran and the interna- tional community, and that the Union does not and has not questioned the right of Iran to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in con- formity with its obligations under the Non-Pro- liferation Treaty. The European Union will, it stated, closely coordinate and work with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors at their forthcoming extraor- dinary meeting in Vienna, to reinforce the author- ity of the IAEA. The Council concluded by underlining its commitment to a diplomatic solu- tion, and its belief that the issue can still be solved by negotiations, so long the Iranian authorities demonstrated a cooperative and trans- parent approach, and a return to full suspension. Adopted on 27 February. The Council welcomed the resolution adopted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Gover- nors to refer Iran to the United Nations Security Council. It regretted Iran\u2019s decision to withhold voluntary cooperation with the IAEA and added that Iran\u2019s decision to limit cooperation only ",
        "Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and central Asia Bull. EU 1/2-2006 135 increases international concerns and suspicions about Iranian intentions. The Council reaffirmed that the European Union does not question Iran\u2019s right to to the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in conformity with its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, yet stressed that international concerns about Iran\u2019s programme must be fully addressed. In this respect, the resumption of enrichment-related activities, including enrichment at Natanz, is clearly a neg- ative development. The Council described the recent attacks on European missions in Tehran as unjustifiable and totally unacceptable, and called on Iran to protect diplomatic missions, including through proper policing, in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. 1.32.15. European Parliament resolution on the confrontation between Iran and the international community.

The Parliament con- demned the words of President Ahmadinejad denying Israel\u2019s right to exist, and called upon Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities. It stated its support of the decision of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to forward the Iran dossier to the Security Council and called upon Iran to take a serious look at the compromise proposed by Rus- sia, to delocalise Iranian uranium enrichment activities. The resolution reaffirmed, however, that Iran is within its rights in developing a nuclear programme in line with article IV of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, but voiced serious doubts as to the peaceful nature of the uranium enrichment programme. The Parliament also believes that negotiations on the establishment of a de-nuclearised zone in the Middle East and the Mediterranean may constitute an important step in addressing regional security concerns.

Council conclusions on Iraq. Adopted on 30 January. The Council welcomed the announcement of the provisional results of the 15 December 2005 elections, and paid tribute to the courage of the Iraqi people who voted in impressive numbers despite the difficult and chal- lenging circumstances. It expressed its belief that the large participation reflects a very serious com- mitment on the part of the Iraqi people to democ- racy, and urged the swift formation of an inclu- sive government committed to working towards the building of a secure, stable, unified and pros- perous Iraq. The Council reaffirmed its support for Iraq\u2019s political transition and its economic and social reconstruction, as demonstrated by such actions as its rule of law mission (Eujust Lex), and its commitment to holding regular political dialogue in accordance with the joint EU\u2013Iraq declaration. Adopted on 27 February. The Council con- demned the criminal bombing of the holy shrine of Ali Al-Hadi and Hassan Al-Askari in Samarra, aimed at provoking sectarian strife, and all sub- sequent retaliatory acts, including attacks on reli- gious sites and the resulting loss of life. It strongly supported calls by Iraqi political and religious leaders for restraint and non-retaliation, urging Iraq to come together in a spirit of dia- logue and mutual respect, and expressed its full support for both the efforts of the UN in promot- ing inter-communal dialogue and national dia- logue and the initiative by the League of Arab States to hold a second conference on national reconciliation with participation of all Iraqi com- munities. The Council underlined its belief that recent developments in Iraq highlight the urgent need for the formation of a government of national unity and urged all political leaders in the country to match the courage of the Iraqi peo- ple, who voted for them in impressive numbers at the elections on 15 December 2005.

The Council reiterated its deep concern at the deteriorating situation in respect of democracy, human rights and political freedoms in Belarus, and called on the authorities to ensure that the presidential elections due on 19 March are conducted in accordance with inter- national standards. It welcomed the invitation by the Belarusian authorities to allow an OSCE international election observation mission, and urged them to fully implement recommendations from the previous parliamentary election obser- vation report. The Council restated its readiness to take further appropriate restrictive measures against the responsible individuals in the event of failure to uphold international standards in the electoral process. The Council concluded by reit- erating its support for initiatives aimed at sup- porting democratisation and civil society in Belarus, and expressed its hope of closer and bet- ter relations between the European Union and Belarus, particularly within the framework of the European neighbourhood policy, but stressed that this is subject to the Belarusian authorities clearly demonstrating their willingness to respect demo- cratic values, human rights and the rule of law. 1.32.26.

The Parliament adopted a resolution expressing its dismay at the contin- uing deterioration of the political situation, the continuing violations of the civil and human rights of the Belarusian people, and called for the immediate release of all political prisoners. The Parliament called on the Belarusian authorities to adhere strictly to international standards in the preparations for the presidential election in March 2006, in which the incumbent Mr Lukashenko seeks another term. It welcomed the fact that Minsk had invited the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to send observers to the elections, but regretted that it had not invited the European Parliament or the Council of Europe, unlike in the 2001 presidential elections. It urged Belarus to extend an invitation to both institutions as soon as possible. The resolution went on to condemn the recently adopted \u2018anti- revolution law\u2019 which amongst other things allows the detention of anyone suspected of pro- viding or financing training for people to take part in street protests, or anyone misinterpreting information about the situation in Belarus. It also suggested that the European Union consider appointing a Special Representative for Belarus should respect for democratic principles in Belarus deteriorate further. The Parliament urged that, should the upcoming elections fall short of being both free and fair, the Union consider fur- ther initiatives against the Belarusian authorities, including expanding the visa ban list and freez- ing assets.

However, it deplored the fact that eight candidates were killed during the electoral process. Parliament called for the new Afghan government to pursue its efforts concerning good governance and to implement sustainable reforms in favour of gender and eth- nic equality. On this point, it considered the par- ticipation of women in the recent elections as a positive outcome; nevertheless, it said this result could be improved upon. It added that it hopes that the Afghan authorities will be more account- able for development process. On this point, the EU must ensure greater visibility of its actions and financial contributions, since it is the second biggest donor in Afghanistan. In view of the Lon- don conference on international involvement in Afghanistan, the Parliament called for a strategy which lays emphasis on specific objectives, such as respect for human rights, democratic gover- nance and the adoption of a system of balance of power. It also called for a permanent delegation to be established within Parliament to deal with relations with the Afghan Parliament, in order for it to be able to have a positive influence on the democratisation process.

The EU remains determined to assist with fos- tering the establishment of a democratic, account- able and sustainable Afghan State capable of exercising its sovereignty and protecting the rights of its citizens. The EU will build on its engagement in political and humanitarian fields, as well as ensure its activity in countering nar- cotics. Counter-narcotics will remain a cross- cutting priority in overall EU policy towards Afghanistan and will support the development of strong and effective counter-narcotic institutions, law enforcement and criminal justice agencies. Finally, another transversal priority will remain the promotion of human rights, with special attention being paid to women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights. 1.32.51.

The Council welcomed the comprehensive Commission communication on \u2018A stronger partnership between the European Union and Latin America\u2019 and underlined the EU\u2019s objective to continue to cooperate closely with Latin America to promote common values and interests, and to contribute jointly to peace and security, protection and promotion of human rights as well as to the strengthening of citizen\u2019s participation and democracy. It identified the key objectives of the strategic partnership that the EU has with the region as being: social cohesion, sus- tainable development, including the protection of the environment and the strengthening of interna- tional environmental governance within the EU system, support to regional integration and stabil- ity. It recognised the need to support efforts to reinforce democratic institutions, good governance and the rule of law, to combat drugs and organised crime, including human trafficking, to promote gender equality, children\u2019s and indigenous rights. It also highlighted the need to address migration issues and human security in all its dimensions. On the subject of reinvigorating economic and commercial relations, the Council welcomed the recommendation to step up regulatory dialogue, including on issues such as barriers to trade and investment sees and the forthcoming EU\u2013Latin America and Caribbean Summit in Vienna as a forum to reaffirm such policy priorities. It stressed that Community cooperation in Latin America for the period 2007\u201313 should have as its primary objective the eradication of poverty, sustainable development and the pursuit of the millennium development goals. Furthermore, it acknowledged the need for a genuine, well-tailored political dia- logue with the region as a whole, with the various sub-regions, as well as with individual countries.

The Council underlined the importance of complet- ing the transition process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is also essential for fostering peace and stability throughout the Great Lakes region. The suc- cessful referendum of 18 and 19 December 2005 has demonstrated the importance the Congolese people attach to the democratic process. The forthcoming electoral process will be a key step to that effect. The Council welcomed the prom- ulgation of the new Constitution and the adop- tion of the electoral law. The Council encour- aged the transitional national government, the political parties, their leaders and civil society to work together to ensure peaceful, fair and trans- parent elections according to international stan- dards which should contribute significantly to securing the DRC\u2019s future as a democratic and stable country. The Council underlined that the agreed transition timetable, including the elec- tions before the end of June 2006, should be respected. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire 1.32.80.

Parliament rejected the European Council\u2019s deal on the financial perspectives 2007\u201313, con- firming its desire to negotiate a better budget deal with the other EU institutions. Parliament con- sidered that the European Council deal does not guarantee that the EU budget enhances prosper- ity, competitiveness, solidarity, cohesion and security in the future. It demanded greater involvement in the process of revising the EU budget (income and expenditure). Parliament concluded by saying that it is willing to enter into constructive negotiations with the Council on the basis of respective positions provided by the Austrian Presidency. The European Council reached a deal agreeing on a total budget equiv- alent to 1.045% of EU-27 GNI (gross national income) in commitment appropriations.

(1) Examination of heading (a) of the question referred in Case C-453/03, of Question 1 in Cases C-11/04 and C-12/04, and of Question 1(a) in Case C-194/04 did not reveal any factors capable of supporting the con- clusion that the adoption of Article 1(1)(b) and 1(4) of Directive 2002/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 amending Council Directive 79/373/EEC on the circulation of compound feeding stuffs and repealing Commission Directive 91/357/EEC was not valid on the basis of Arti- cle 152(4)(b) EC. (2) Examination of Question 4 in Case C-12/04 did not reveal any factor capable of affecting the validity ofArti- cle 1(1)(b) and 1(4) of Directive 2002/2 in the light of the principle of equal treatment and non-discrimination. (3) Article 1(1)(b) of Directive 2002/2, which requires manufacturers of compound animal feeding stuffs to indicate, at a customer\u2019s request, the exact composi- tion of a feeding stuff, is invalid in the light of the prin- ciple of proportionality. By contrast, examination of heading (c) of the question referred in Case C-453/03, of Question 2 in Cases C-11/04 and C-12/04, and Question 1(c) in Case C-194/04 has not revealed any factor capable of affecting the validity of Article 1(4) of Directive 2002/2 in the light of that principle. (4) Directive 2002/2 must be interpreted as meaning that its application is not contingent on the adoption of the positive list of feed materials designated by their specific names referred to in recital (10) in the pream- ble to that directive. (5) Even in the case in which a court of a Member State forms the view that the conditions have been sat- isfied under which it may suspend application of a Community measure, in particular where the question of the validity of that measure has already been referred to the Court, the competent national adminis- trative authorities of the other Member States cannot suspend application of that measure until such time as the Court has ruled on its validity. National courts alone are entitled to determine, taking into considera- tion the specific circumstances of the cases brought before them, whether the conditions governing the grant of interim relief have been satisfied.

(1) The third paragraph of Article 234 EC requires a court or tribunal of a Member State against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law to seek a ruling from the Court of Justice on a question relating to the validity of the provisions of a ",
        "Decisions by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance 154 Bull. EU 1/2-2006 regulation even where the Court has already declared invalid analogous provisions of another comparable regulation. (2) Paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1423/95 of 23 June 1995 laying down detailed implementing rules for the import of products in the sugar sector other than molasses are invalid inasmuch as they provide that the additional duty referred to therein is, as a general rule, established on the basis of the representative price referred to in Article 1(2) of that regulation and that that duty is established on the basis of the cif import price of the shipment concerned only if the importer so requests.

(1) Sets aside the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 5 December 2002 in Case T-114/00 Aktion- sgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum v Commission . (2) Dismisses as inadmissible the action brought by AktionsgemeinschaftRecht und Eigentum eV before the Court of First Instance of the European Communi- ties for annulment of the Commission decision of 22 December 1999 authorising State aid under Arti- cles 87 and 88 (ex Articles 92 and 93) of the EC Treaty.

(1) Article 8(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 of 29 May 2000, relating to the signif- icance and notification in the Member States of the legal and extrajudicial measures in civil and commer- cial matters, has to be interpreted in that, when the addressee of a document has refused it on the grounds that it is not in an official language of the Member State addressed or in a language of the Member State which the addressee understands, it is possible for the sender to remedy that by sending the translation requested. (2) Article 8 of Regulation No 1348/2000, has to be interpreted in that, when the addressee of a document has refused it on the grounds that it is not in an offi- cial language of the Member State addressed or in a language of the Member State which the addressee understands, that situation may be remedied by send- ing the translation of the document in accordance with the procedure laid down by Regulation No 1348/2000 and as soon as possible. In order to resolve problems connected with the way in which the lack of translation should be remedied that are not envisaged by Regulation No 1348/2000 as interpreted by the Court, it is incumbent on the national court to apply national procedural law while taking care to ensure the full effectiveness of that regulation, in compliance with its objective.

(1) Article 3(a) of Council Directive 89/592/EEC of 13 November 1989 coordinating regulations on insider dealing precludes a person who receives inside infor- mation in his capacity as an employees\u2019 representative on a company\u2019s board of directors, or in his capacity as a member of the liaison committee of a group of undertakings, from disclosing such information to the general secretary of the professional organisation which organises those employees and which appointed that person as a member of the liaison committee, unless: \u00a1 there is a close link between the disclosure and the exercise of his employment, profession or duties, and \u00a1 that disclosure is strictly necessary for the exercise of that employment, profession or duties. As part of its examination, the national court must, in the light of the applicable national rules, take particu- lar account of: ",
        "Decisions by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance Bull. EU 1/2-2006 155 \u00a1 the fact that that exception to the prohibition of dis- closure of inside information must be interpreted strictly; \u00a1 the fact that each additional disclosure is liable to increase the risk of that information being exploited for a purpose contrary to Directive 89/592, and \u00a1 the sensitivity of the inside information. (2) Article 3(a) of Directive 89/592 precludes disclo- sure of inside information by the general secretary of a professional organisation to colleagues, such as those referred to in the third and fourth questions, except under the conditions set out in the reply to the first and second questions. As part of its examination, the national court must, in the light of the applicable national rules, take particu- lar account of the criteria also set out in that reply.

Articles 43 EC and 48 EC preclude registration in the national commercial register of the merger by dissolu- tion without liquidation of one company and transfer of the whole of its assets to another company from being refused in general in a Member State where one of the two companies is established in another Mem- ber State, whereas such registration is possible, on compliance with certain conditions, where the two companies participating in the merger are both estab- lished in the territory of the first Member State.

As Community law now stands, Articles 43 EC and 48 EC do not preclude provisions of a Member State which generally prevent a resident parent company from deducting from its taxable profits losses incurred in another Member State by a subsidiary established in that Member State although they allow it to deduct losses incurred by a resident subsidiary. However, it is contrary to Articles 43 EC and 48 EC to prevent the resident parent company from doing so where the non- resident subsidiary has exhausted the possibilities available in its State of residence of having the losses taken into account for the accounting period concerned by the claim for relief and also for previous account- ing periods and where there are no possibilities for those losses to be taken into account in its State of res- idence for future periods either by the subsidiary itself or by a third party, in particular where the subsidiary has been sold to that third party. OJ C 36, 11.2.2006 Free movement of goods Article 234 of the EC Treaty 1.34.11. 8.11.2005: Case C-293/02 Jersey Pro- duce Marketing Organisation Ltd v States of Jer- sey and Others. (1) The combined provisions of Article 29 EC and Arti- cle 1 of Protocol No 3 on the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man annexed to the Act concerning the Condi- tions of Accession of the Kingdom of Denmark, Ire- land and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the adjustments to the Treaties are to be interpreted as precluding legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which: \u00a1 on the one hand, prohibits, with penalties imposed for non-compliance, Jersey producers from offering for export or exporting their potatoes to the United King- dom market unless they are registered with a body such as the Jersey Potato Export Marketing Board and have entered into a marketing agreement with it for the pur- pose of determining, in particular, the areas which may be planted with crops for export as well as the identity of those authorised to acquire those crops, and, \u00a1 on the other hand, prohibits, also with penalties imposed for non-compliance, all marketing organisa- tions from effecting such exports unless they are party to a management agreement with that same body for the purpose of determining, in particular, the identity of the sellers from whom it is permissible for them to obtain their supplies. (2) The combined provisions of Articles 23 EC and 25 EC and Article 1 of Protocol No 3 are to be inter- preted as precluding legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings which confers on a body such as the Jersey Potato Export Marketing Board the power to impose on Jersey potato producers a contribution, the amount of which is fixed by reference to the quantities of potatoes produced by the parties concerned and exported to the United Kingdom. (3) Community law precludes a contribution levied under the same conditions, the amount of which, how- ever, is fixed by such a body by reference to the agri- cultural area used by the parties concerned for grow- ing potatoes, to the extent to which the income therefrom serves to finance activities undertaken by that body contrary to Article 29 EC.

Article 36 of Council Directive 92/50/EEC of 18 June 1992 relating to the coordination of procedures for the award of public service contracts and Article 34 of Council Directive 93/38/EEC of 14 June 1993 coordi- nating the procurement procedures of entities operat- ing in the water, energy, transport and telecommunica- tions sectors must be interpreted as meaning that Community law does not preclude a jury from attach- ing specific weight to the subheadings of an award cri- terion which are defined in advance, by dividing among those headings the points awarded for that cri- terion by the contracting authority when the contract documents or the contract notice were prepared, pro- vided that that decision: \u00a1 does not alter the criteria for the award of the con- tract set out in the contract documents or the contract notice; \u00a1 does not contain elements which, if they had been known at the time the tenders were prepared, could have affected that preparation; \u00a1 was not adopted on the basis of matters likely to give rise to discrimination against one of the tenderers.

(1) Clause 8(3) of the Framework Agreement on fixed- term contracts concluded on 18 March 1999, put into effect by Council Directive 1999/70/EC of 28 June 1999 concerning the framework agreement on fixed- term work concluded by ETUC, UNICE and CEEP, should be interpreted as not being contrary to domes- tic legislation such as that at issue in the main pro- ceedings, which for reasons connected with the need to encourage employment and irrespective of the imple- mentation of that agreement, has lowered the age above which fixed-term contracts of employment may be concluded without restrictions. (2) Community law and, more particularly, Article 6(1) of Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treat- ment in employment and occupation must be inter- preted as precluding a provision of domestic law such as that at issue in the main proceedings which autho- rises, without restriction, unless there is a close con- nection with an earlier contract of employment of indefinite duration concluded with the same employer, the conclusion of fixed-term contracts of employment once the worker has reached the age of 52. It is the responsibility of the national court to guaran- tee the full effectiveness of the general principle of non-discrimination in respect of age, setting aside any provision of national law which may conflict with Community law, even where the period prescribed for transposition of that directive has not yet expired.

(1) Dismisses the action. (By its action, the European Central Bank (ECB) is in essence asking the Court to rule that the Federal Republic of Germany is required to refund to it, in respect of all supplies of goods and services which it requires for its official use in Germany, and in partic- ular of all leasing or letting of property, the amounts of turnover tax which can be proved, or at least assumed, on the basis of a rational economic assess- ment, to be included in the prices paid by that institu- tion.
