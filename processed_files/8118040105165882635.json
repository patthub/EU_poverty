        "Forward by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission. This book has been published by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Development and Cooperation - EuropeAid in August 2014. European Commission European Development Days 2006-2013 Eight years of policy debates from the European Consensus to the post-2015 agenda ",

        "5 by Jos\u00e9 ManUEl Barroso President of the European Commission I have always passionately believed in a Europe that is open; a Europe that is committed to the values of freedom, development and global solidarity. These values have been central to the European project ever since its inception and continue to inspire our Union today. They are a central part of what makes us European. They have also been at the heart of European Development Days \u2013 Europe\u2019s premier forum on global development issues. In just a few years, European Development Days has established itself as a fixture in the world\u2019s development calendar. It is a key forum at which leaders and stakeholders can address global challenges openly and shape innovative thinking on a wide range of issues. This book is a tribute to all those who have made this success story happen: The European Commission which I had the privilege to lead for 10 years, notably Louis Michel and Andris Piebalgs as Commissioners for Development; the European Parliament and the European Union Member States; but most prominently our partners in development, from Heads of state and Government to local activists, from businesspeople to civil society. Thanks to their vision and insights our debates have flourished and our ideas have gained traction on the ground. The European Union remains at the forefront of global development cooperation, especially in economically difficult times. We remain the planet's most generous donor of financial assistance and I fought hard to preserve our high aid levels in our multi-annual budget 2014-2020. In addition, my Commission has stepped up special measures for the poorest, like the EUR 1 billion Food Facility or our strong support for the United Nation's Sustainable Energy for All initiative that addresses the twin challenges of energy insecurity and climate change. Moreover, as the world's biggest integrated market and trading bloc, the European Union remains open for business, notably with the most challenged nations. Europe also is a key partner in tackling global issues: from the fight against climate change, on which we are the world's leader, to international action against entrenched poverty. We are at the helm of pushing the Millennium Development Goals and shaping the new post-2015 development agenda, which must combine the fight against poverty with the fight for green growth. In a globalised world in constant flux, standing side by side with the most vulnerable is not just a human imperative. It is a matter of strategic intelligence. We can only shape globalisation, reap its benefits and protect the global commons if we work together. That is why I am proud of having launched European Development Days. They are an incubator of new ideas that inform and inspire our shared aim: that of a poverty-free, sustainable and fair world in which everyone has the same chance at a decent life. ForEworD ",

        "9 Innovative ideas can have a lasting impact on the way the development community works, opening people up to new realities and new ways of understanding challenges. Aimed at anticipating future trends, european Development Days has become as sounding board for global thought leadership. At every level, participants, moderators, and panellists from around the world can put forward their ideas and examine creative solutions to shared problems. The forum provides a unique networking and brainstorming platform for the development community by inviting participants to form new relationships and share best practices. ",
        "10 - Ideas \u2018The first responsibility is to the people. They must be fed. You cannot govern over dead bodies.\u2019 16 November 2008 Morgan TsvangIraI President, Movement for Democratic Change, Zimbabwe FooD & EnErgy The successive crises of the 21 st century have put vulnerabilities in the agriculture and energy sectors under the spotlight. Access to modern and sustainable energy services is vital for satisfying basic human needs and is a prerequisite for growing prosperity. Yet more than 1.3 billion people in the world do not have access to electricity and 2.7 billion rely on traditional biomass for cooking. This is why energy is among the key target areas of eU assistance, as outlined in the 2011 Agenda for Change. The eU\u2019s poverty reduction policies are helping to break the vicious cycle of drought, hunger and poverty in developing countries by focusing on the protection and sustainable management of natural resources. european Development Days has helped develop links between the humanitarian and development communities and build consensus on how to boost the resilience of those affected by disasters. \u2018Energy for a country is like oxygen for the human body.\u2019 7 December 2010 Jakaya MrIsho kIkwETE President of the Republic of Tanzania ",

        "12 - Ideas Human development is the ultimate objective of development policy. It is a broad-based concept that covers issues related to empowerment, including health and gender equality. Improving health in developing countries is vital to combat poverty. The eU assists developing countries in strengthening their healthcare systems overall and addressing critical public health challenges such as pandemics. In the developing world, women suffer disproportionately from poverty. The eU pursues a dual approach to gender equality by taking measures specifically to address inequalities and by mainstreaming gender issues into all aspects of development policy. european Development Days has helped push forward gender equality on the international agenda and advance the international community\u2019s efforts to fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. hUMan DEvElopMEnT \u2018Human beings must be at the centre of development.

Direct focus has to be placed on the working poor and underemployment. We must ensure that governments develop social protection frameworks to combat the various dimensions of poverty and inequality.\u2019 26 November 2013 porTIa sIMpson MIllEr Prime Minister of Jamaica People need protection against the risks and shocks that can drive them into poverty. Social protection involves promoting efficient labour markets, reducing people's exposure to risks, and enhancing their capacity to manage risks, such as unemployment, exclusion, sickness, disability and old age. The eU supports social protection in partner countries by promoting legislation and programmes that can safeguard vulnerable people from these dangers. The eU also supports technical education and vocational training to encourage employment and lift people out of poverty. european Development Days has facilitated a number of exchanges among experts, trade unions, employers and development partners on how best to support the development of national social protection systems in partner countries. This can be an effective way to both reduce inequalities and ensure resilience. Social protection will be a pivotal area of cooperation towards a decent life for all by 2030. ",

Parliament is the most important institution in every democratic system.\u2018 23 October 2009 JErzy BUzEk President of the European Parliament Human rights and democracy are key elements of good governance and a top priority for cooperation between the european Union and its partner countries worldwide. They are integral to effective work on poverty alleviation and conflict prevention and resolution. They are also valuable bulwarks against terrorism. The european Union promotes its democratic values with the european Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (eIDHR). Since 2007, this instrument has been the concrete expression of the eU's intention to integrate the promotion of democracy and human rights into all of its external policies. european Development Days has been a regular opportunity to reaffirm the importance of freedom and democracy to prosperity in developing countries . The forum has also created an invaluable platform for freedom fighters from around the world.

Sustainable development is not possible in a country threatened by internal insecurity, crisis and conflicts. At the same time, there cannot be sustainable peace without development. Moreover, insecurity, crisis and conflicts can impede the efficient use of aid. Tackling the causes of conflict and fragility has become a priority for the european Union. Its approach to conflict prevention aims to address the root cause of conflicts and build sustainable peace through mediation and peace building operations. european Development Days has become a key forum to discuss these challenges, especially as the international community prepares to develop a new framework for a post- 2015 world.

Many poor, vulnerable countries are already experiencing climate change impacts, including higher temperatures, more frequent and intense storms, and less predictable rains and harvests. The eU leads the world in its resolve to address climate change. It\u2019s 2020 Strategy for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth is demonstrating to both developed and developing countries how addressing climate change can create jobs and boost energy security. The eU\u2019s strong actions on climate change internally have made it a particularly effective partner for developing countries. Programmes are helping countries to access renewable energy and clean technologies, protect biodiversity and fight desertification. european Development Days has become an occasion both to reiterate the position of the european Union on climate change, and to give voice to the leaders of nations whose most vulnerable are bearing the costs of inaction. \u2018You will not have the development and growth you want to see in the 21 st century unless you fight climate change.\u2019 27 November 2013 ConnIE hEDEgaarD EU Commissioner for Climate Action \u2018While the economic crisis is a crisis of a generation, climate change is a once-in-a-millennium crisis.\u2019 24 October 2009 Carl BIlDT Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sweden ",

Policy coherence for development, as it is known, has become an overarching objective of the european Union. Since the 2005 european Consensus on Development and the 2009 ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, the european Union is compelled to minimise contradictions from and to seek synergies with its domestic policies when they have an impact on developing countries. european Development Days has hosted discussions on reports that assess progress towards policy coherence in 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013.

        "30 - Ideas Developing countries bear the primary responsibility for their own development. For this reason, aid is genuinely focused on priorities set by our partners. eU development aid targets countries that are in greatest need of external support and where it can really make a difference, including fragile states.

The european Union as a whole is the most generous donor of official development aid worldwide. In 2010, it provided over eUR 53 billion \u2013 more than 50 % of global aid. european Development Days has served to facilitate greater cooperation among european development actors with a view to greater aid effectiveness.

        "37 \u2018A place where everyone is heard, where everyone has a voice\u2019 loUIs MIChEl Former European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid Over the years, European Development Days has gained greater recognition and emerged as Europe\u2019s main development forum. This international development forum is now considered as the \u2018Davos for Development\u2019. The idea behind the launch of this 'major development forum\u2019 was primarily to engage in profound reflection \u2013 with all stakeholders \u2013 on the future of development, our values, our principles, our policies, the world\u2019s evolution and the actions to undertake in order to make aid more effective, and imaginative. I wanted to create a framework for exchange and reflection for African and European leaders, international decision-makers, heads of international organisations and private companies, academics, and all development actors. It is this family spirit that has always prevailed and continues to inspire European Development Days. It is this collective consciousness that unites all those who work daily to promote a fairer world, a better world in which everyone enjoys full development, peace, security, and a decent standard of living, and in which the basic rights and freedom are respected. It is the willingness to work together to achieve common goals, to affirm shared universal values while respecting everyone\u2019s diversity. Non-governmental organisations, public authorities, partners, civil society, officials, field men and women, politicians, together we all formed a stronger ideal, more integrated, more ambitious and based on the same faith, the same conception of mankind and humanity, the same fervour and unwavering conviction, the same passion. We, as development actors, have this determination to fulfil a moral debt towards humanity. European Development Days is \u2018a place\u2019 where everyone is heard, where everyone has a voice: ",
        "38 heads of state, ministers, academics, local authorities, the private sector, and the media\u2026 It is a place for discussions, cross-fertilisation of ideas and approaches, exchanges, proposals. The forum has the merit of tackling all subjects without taboos, including sensitive issues as long as the confrontation takes place in a constructive spirit. As a universalist and humanist, I strongly believe that everyone has the right to express their views. This constructive confrontation is a source of inspiration to chart new paths aiming to toughen up development. Eurafrica If I created European Development Days in 2006, it is principally because I have faith in both Africa and Europe, and I am convinced that our two continents have a common destiny shaped by a common history and a relationship of interdependence. Europeans and Africans are \u2018natural allies\u2019. An indispensable, strong and sincere alliance between two great and beautiful continents will shape a future of peace and prosperity. Together, these two continents have the ability to influence decisively a new world order, more just, with more solidarity and freedom. Eurafrica is not an empty concept, but a goal to achieve in order to weigh for the best on the world order. Africa is the cradle of humanity, the continent of the future. Despite the continuing crises, Africa now offers to the world another face, the face of a new hope, the face of compelling perspectives. The decade of exceptional growth of the continent, despite the economic and financial crisis, calls for a positive future. Africa knows that world public opinion no longer sees it as the \u2018poor cousin\u2019, a continent that is \u2018geopolitically weak\u2019 but as a strong and credible partner of the utmost importance. Grounded in a positive dynamic \u2013 spectacular growth of 5 % on average in 2013, which in all likelihood should attain around 5.8 % in 2014 \u2013 independent and courted by both traditional powers and emerging powers, Africa has regained its place on the international political and economic stage. Media and development I wanted to make European Development Days an inclusive political event to give it the widest possible visibility. The forum thus served as an opportunity to recognise the achievements of journalists who are committed to democracy, human rights, fundamental freedoms and development. In this regard, the Lorenzo Natali Prize , a global prize, is an integral part of the European Commission's development policy, which considers that defending freedom of expression, democracy, human rights and development, is acting for good governance, peace and progress; it helps to improve living conditions in the poorest countries. Democracy is an ongoing quest for majority rule, minority rights and rule of law. It is a legal framework in which no party can modify the constitution for its own benefit. In this regard, the right to difference is a fundamental expression of human rights. I have always been persuaded that democracy needs conflicting tensions based on the expression of different opinions. The democratic organisation of society must allow the public authorities to explain and justify, but must also ensure to countervailing ",
        "39 powers the right to confront, to denounce, oppose and propose an alternative. Democracy cannot survive unless it provides an alternative possibility. For the media to perform their role of \u2018watchdog\u2019 for democracy, mouthpiece for civil society, and information vector, there is a need for a free press and quality journalists. Committed journalism involves risks but embodies an ideal: freedom of expression. It proves that the ideals of the Enlightenment are alive and well in our world. A country's economic and social development requires not only a strong democracy, but also an informed debate on its future that leaves room for all opinions. The relationship between media and development is particularly important in countries where the vectors of education, training, or simply entertainment are few and often limited to urban elites. Raising awareness among youth Finally, European Development Days is open to actors of all ages. In this regard, the forum hosted the Youth and Development Award to raise awareness of development issues among young Europeans from 16 to 18 year old. By launching this award, I purposely wanted to inspire our youth to get active and take part in the reflection and true awareness-raising around the challenges and issues of development cooperation. Many young Europeans have little knowledge about what is happening to hundreds of millions of people of their own age in Africa. They do not know either that there is another Africa: an Africa of hope, potentialities, and opportunities; a progressing Africa that shows impressive growth, democratic elections, an emergent middle class and with it the development of social movements. By establishing this award, I wanted to educate young people about the work of the European Commission in Africa and in other developing regions so that they become the future engines for development and positive change. I wanted to make our youth the front-line ambassadors for development. European Development Days has been in existence for eight years now. Its success is a source of satisfaction to all of us, Africans and Europeans. It is proof of our commitment to reflect, share and work together. It is a proof that we all know that there exists between our two continents a bridge of opportunities that is just waiting to be developed in a globalised world. It is an opportunity to raise public awareness of development issues and nurture the spirit of the European Consensus on Development in order to improve aid effectiveness. Throughout the years, European Development Days has discussed essential issues and topical matters such as governance, decentralisation, regional integration, the role of local authorities, the food crisis, the financial crisis, the importance of the private sector, the role of the media, budget support, economic partnership agreements, or the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The year 2015 will be a pivotal year for development in which the voice of the European Parliament will be expected and heard: it is the target year for achieving the Millennium Development Goals as ",
        "40 agreed at the international level, and the year during which important decisions will be made regarding the post-2015 development framework; also the year of fulfilment of Europe\u2019s commitment for reaching the United Nations target of 0.7 % of gross national income for official development assistance. If we want to be seen as credible and strong by all our partners in the developed world and the developing world, we must keep the promises we made in terms of public development aid. For my part, I will always keep engraved in my memory the living words, filled with pride and dignity, of Reverend Desmond Tutu, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, during the closing ceremony of European Development Days in 2006: \u2018Africa, you have produced some great personalities: Nyerere, Sadat, Mandela. Go anywhere in the world today and ask who is the most admired statesperson? Almost universally it is an African, Nelson Mandela. But these African leaders were men, mainly, who were leaders of governments. They were altruistic, they were people who said: I am in this not for what I can get for myself, not for self- aggrandisement. I am in this for the sake of those I lead. They upheld high standards of morality. Yes, we have the capacity to be born again, we who were the cradle of humankind; we have the capacity to bring a wonderful contribution to the community of nations. Again, it is we in Africa, who have given the world an extraordinary example of how we deal with post-conflict situations. For where people expected that a black-led government would be hungry for revenge and retribution, they saw instead the Truth and Reconciliation Commission processes in South Africa. That no, there is another way, the way of forgiveness of reconciliation. The gift we can give the world is our concept of Ubuntu, where you say, my humanity is bound up in your humanity. I need you in order for me to be me. I need you to be you. And, dear friends, you must know, that there is no way in which we are going to be able to win wars against terror, as long as there are conditions in so many parts of the world that make people feel desperate. And so, we say, there is no way in which we can be free, except together.\u2019 Inclusive growth I would add that our freedom depends on our ability to build more inclusive growth and prosperity. There is no human development without economic growth. Development makes sense only if it serves all partners of a company and more broadly all citizens of a community. To ensure development and human progress, economic growth needs the rule of law and fair redistribution; in a nutshell, a justice system guaranteed by an impartial state apparatus. In developing countries, we need more economic freedom to give people the means to create prosperity for themselves and for others. There is also a need for more states to redistribute, to provide services to citizens, to strengthen equal opportunities, in short, to build social cohesion. I am convinced that Africa's development will take place through its integration into the global economy, without which there can be no human development. 1 % growth in Africa is more remunerative for Africans than any official development assistance. Globalisation offers to the world incomparable ",
        "41 positive potential. Nevertheless, to be worthy, globalisation must be complemented by a state that stimulates market forces, shifting them for the enhancement of social well-being; a state that forges social cohesion; a state that consolidates democracy; an impartial state that fully complies with individual beliefs. World government Beyond that, as Jacques Attali once put it, we must \u2018dare to think the world\u2019. We need a \u2018global political space\u2019. The world\u2019s growth is managed by weak institutions with no regulatory power. No comprehensive decision can be taken to impose a course of action. There is no universal law. A lesson we can learn from the global financial crisis is understand that the construction of a global government must align with corporate globalisation by giving it a political dimension. A world government must put forward, coordinate and control \u2013 with states \u2013 solutions to global development issues that cannot be tackled at national level. It is our duty to ensure the role of development policy on the international agenda. It is our responsibility to ensure the position of developing countries in this debate and in the new regulatory system. In this globalised world, Europe is certainly the most valuable partner for Africa and Africa is irrefutably the most promising partner for Europe. Together, African and Europeans have the ability to adapt globalisation to a model that complies with their shared values and which is more respectful of their identities. Without this alliance, globalisation will overtake us. It is not too late to build this Euro- African space for growth, based on a relationship between partners who are equal in terms of rights and duties. Such a forum contributes to this goal as it strengthens the optimists and encourages politicians to have more courage in their decision-making. It is all a matter of political will. Therefore, it is our role to ensure that the optimism of the will prevails over the pessimism of the reason. The legacy of European Development Days must be transmitted, shared and defended. I congratulate and thank the authors of this initiative, who, by producing this retrospective book on European Development Days editions from their launch in 2006 to 2013, help ensure that it continues.

        "46 - Editions Theme In the eyes of the EU, good governance is an imperative \u2013 applying both to partner countries and donors alike. Good governance involves participatory, transparent and accountable leadership. It is also effective and equitable while promoting the rule of law. In 10 roundtables, participants discussed the full range of governance challenges, including the fight against corruption, the voice of civil society, the role of the media, building a culture of democracy, social rights, the protection of vulnerable groups, the rehabilitation of the state, migration, natural resource management and new paradigms shaping cooperation. Another roundtable brought together six former African presidents who shared their views on how to transfer power peacefully. In the final plenary session, 16 African leaders including Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan President Paul Kagam\u00e9, presented their strategies to improve governance in their countries. They agreed on the importance of engaging civil society, ensuring sustainable growth and providing equitable benefits for citizens. The first edition of european Development Days (eDD06) in Brussels brought together a broad cross-section of stakeholders to debate governance in Africa, following the introduction of \u2018incentive mechanisms\u2019 in the european Union\u2019s support programmes.

This is where our shared future lies: in a new strategic alliance between the European Union and Africa.\u2019 15 November 2006 Jos\u00e9 ManUEl Barroso President of the European Commission Outcome The first edition produced two important outcomes. First, it demonstrated to Europeans the need for an annual gathering of development actors to discuss major issues in international cooperation in an open, multistakeholder format. It reinforced the principles of the European Consensus on Development (2005) and illustrated a shared desire for greater aid effectiveness. The diversity of the forum allowed participants to address contemporary challenges without the paternalism and distrust that has stalled progress in the past. Second, the partnership that developed between Europe and Africa became a great source of satisfaction and pride. It showed mutual readiness to embark on a more constructive and balanced partnership based on open and frank dialogue. In that spirit, as European Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso explained, EDD06 paved the way for the 2007 EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon, Portugal. This gathering had not taken place since its first edition in Cairo, Egypt in 2000. \u2018You [the European Union] triumphed because you invested in democracy, freedom and peace. Development and prosperity require peace and good governance. You established the rule of law and showed near-zero tolerance of corruption. You upheld the fundamental rights of all, the freedom of expression, of association, the freedom of movement. You had accountable and transparent governance, and a vibrant and free press. Finally, you had an engaged and lively civil society that became a vigilant watchdog.

        "50 - Editions Memorable The 1984 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu delivered an eloquent closing address that became one of the most memorable moments of European Development Days in 2006. His words still resonate in the hearts and minds of those who attended, and his message struck a chord: Africans themselves need to drive the change they seek. Change must come from within. The Archbishop presented two powerful arguments. First, he reminded participants that Africa has a long, but little understood democratic tradition. Many African societies have been consensus-driven: \u2018In African traditional governance the good ruler was one who sat with his council, for it was a participatory system. He sat and listened. And the good ruler was he who, at the end, would then be able to sum it all up in the consensus of his community. It is a gross untruth to suggest that democracy is alien to Africa.\u2019 After reminding Africans of their great historical figures, their successes and progress, Tutu invited the continent to move forward with confidence and in a spirit of solidarity. Second, he emphasised the legacy of Ubuntu, a southern African philosophy. \u2018The gift we can give the world is our concept of Ubuntu, where you say, \u201cMy humanity is bound up in your humanity. I need you in order for me to be me. I need you to be you.\u201d Ubuntu teaches that you cannot enjoy your prosperity on your own. \u2018The only way we will ever be safe and secure is together.

        "54 - Editions Theme Climate change is a matter of life and death for many populations in developing countries. The world\u2019s poor will be hit hardest by global warming, yet ironically they emit the least greenhouse gases. Most \u2013 if not all \u2013 development efforts over the past 50 years are at risk of being washed away if the rise in average temperatures cannot be held in check. In 2007, the figures were already of grave concern: 40 % of coral reefs had disappeared and 1 % of tropical forests were being destroyed annually. In the next decade, it was estimated that crop yields could drop by 50 %. Reports of floods, hurricanes, fires, heat waves and droughts throughout the world have hit headlines with alarming regularity. Structured around four roundtables and two high-level panels, participants at EDD07 discussed the need for stronger partnerships among actors. They discussed the importance of addressing vulnerability and adaptation, growth and mitigation, poverty and urbanisation, as well as the preservation of global public goods. Participants agreed that world leaders must be compelled to act sooner rather than later in light of the immediate and irreversible threats from climate change. The second edition of european Development Days (eDD07) convened in Lisbon with climate change in developing countries at the top of the agenda. World leaders would soon be gathering in Bali, Indonesia for the United Nations Climate Change Conference and forum participants were asking whether developing countries could respond and adapt to the climate crisis. Discussions focused on how to respond to the needs of vulnerable developing countries and address the links between climate change, poverty and migration. Organised by the european Commission in cooperation with the Portuguese Presidency of the european Union, eDD07 initiated a truly open and participatory process that has become a hallmark of the forum.

        "57 Outcome The consensus at EDD07 was that while acting now may be costly, the cost of inaction is far greater. \u2018For far too long we have considered climate change as a problem for the future. But we must remember that climate change is an all-encompassing threat. It is not an issue of rich versus poor, of north versus south. It\u2019s a global issue and we are seeing its effects everywhere,\u2019 said Kofi Annan, President of the Global Humanitarian Forum. In response to the former Secretary-General\u2019s call, EDD07 heralded a process where the EU and developing countries work together against climate change in a strong political partnership that also advances the Millennium Development Goals. During the forum, the European Commission highlighted its most recent initiative, the Global Climate Change Alliance, which provides technical expertise to the world\u2019s poorest countries to integrate their national development and climate change strategies. The Alliance has been supporting measures to reduce emissions from deforestation, take advantage of the global carbon market and help developing countries to better prepare for natural disasters. The Commission has also supported partner countries in routinely applying prevention, adaptation and mitigation policies. The European Union brought to the forum two decades of leadership on climate change and five decades of development cooperation experience to the discussion. Europe had already taken the lead on climate change by setting a target to reduce EU greenhouse emissions by at least 20 % by 2020, with an increase to 30 % if global agreement could be found. The EU has consistently pushed the plight of developing countries, recognising that the poorest countries are often the hardest hit. The EU also designated the environment as a priority theme in the EUR 22 billion European Development Fund, which closed in 2013. \u2018Climate change is the greatest challenge of our generation. Developed countries have a special responsibility to take the lead in cutting emissions and pushing a comprehensive, global agreement on future climate action, in the UN framework. We are determined to help developing countries to face the impact of climate change on the environment and on human and social development.\u2019 7 November 2007 Jos\u00e9 ManUEl Barroso President of the European Commission ",
        "58 - Editions Partnership EDD07 helped foster closer ties between the EU and its Portuguese-speaking partner countries, opening up opportunities for cooperation on development. The European Commission signed a Memorandum of Understanding with both the African Countries of Portuguese Official Language and the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries. These groupings include countries that are not geographical neighbours but nonetheless have strong cultural links: Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, and Timor-Leste. The Memoranda of Understanding were expected to strengthen mutual cooperation, including the sharing of human resources in the health sector, education, trade, investment, justice and employment. Report In addition to climate change, EDD07 addressed policy coherence for development and advanced partnerships with Portuguese-speaking countries. The first progress report on the coherence of European domestic policies with its development objectives was published in 2007 and widely debated at EDD07. The European Consensus on Development detailed the EU\u2019s commitment to policy coherence in December 2005. Acknowledging that some of its policies could have a significant impact outside the EU \u2013 either contributing to or undermining its development policy \u2013 the Consensus sought to minimise contradictions and build synergies among policies. In 2005, the EU agreed to make its twelve domestic policy areas more coherent with its development objectives in order to accelerate progress on the Millennium Development Goals. \u2018Policy coherence for development is a dimension of EU development policy that will continue to gain considerable momentum in the years to come.

Participants stressed throughout the forum the importance of local action to meet the MDGs. This core theme drew much-needed attention to issues of local governance, decentralised cooperation and the role of local authorities and civil society in development. Nearly 40 sessions, including workshops, panels and other events, were held with a multistakeholder approach. The message was one of cohesion: meeting the MDGs hinges on the involvement of every level of society. EDD08 called for a greater role for Europe's local authorities in development and showed how they too could contribute to good governance and democracy and support essential services like education and health. Local authorities are also pivotal in responding to the consequences of climate change. Earlier in 2008, the Communication, \u2018Local Authorities: Actors for Development\u2019 put forward a series of measures recognising the role of local authorities and decentralised cooperation. In 2007, the European Commission began financing development cooperation projects implemented by local and regional authorities through its \u2018Non-State Actors \u2013 Local Authorities\u2019 programme.

This situation was compounded by strong variability in seed and fertilizer prices that year. EU Member States used the 2008 forum to discuss a rapid response facility to help farmers in developing countries, which they later formalised with a pledge of EUR 1 billion. This funding aimed to increase agricultural production, improve access to agricultural inputs and services, and satisfy the basic food needs of some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people. Platforma \u2013 an initiative to facilitate dialogue between the European institutions responsible for development policies and local and regional authorities \u2013 was launched on 16 November 2008.

Supported by the European Commission, the Charter was initiated by the French Presidency of the European Union and United Cities France. It established standards to improve the effectiveness of local-level cooperation in partner countries. The Charter also recognised the adherence of local authorities to the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005) that had recently been updated in Accra, Ghana (2008). EDD08 also paved the way for the Assises of Decentralised Cooperation, a biannual gathering of local and regional authorities led by the Committee of the Regions.

Carl Bildt, Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs, said it best: \u2018Our challenge is to act simultaneously on warming up a deep-frozen economy and cooling down an overheated Mother Earth.\u2019 Given the importance of governance to solving these challenges, democracy and development was another theme. This edition took place 50 days ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. The forum served as a sounding board for countries and communities already affected by climate change. Leaders of partner countries from Bangladesh to Burkina Faso, and from Haiti to Vanuatu shared their views and concerns with internationally renowned experts and stakeholders. The forum provided a rich opportunity to hear from leaders who were trying to forge international consensus ahead of Copenhagen, especially among developing countries. After editions in Brussels, Lisbon and Strasbourg, european Development Days 2009 (eDD09) came to Stockholm. Held on 22-24 October, eDD09 was the flagship event of the Swedish Presidency of the european Union, bringing together about 6 000 participants from over 130 countries. The edition also took place at a pivotal time for europe following european parliamentary elections and ahead of major institutional changes with the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. eDD09 engaged the development community in debates around the most pressing challenges at the time: responding to the global economic crisis, addressing climate change and promoting democracy.

        "73 Outcome Discussions at EDD09 stimulated the later reshaping of European development policy in 2010. In his closing remarks Karel De Gucht, European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, stressed that the ongoing financial, food, climate and energy crises offered an opportunity to reshape development aid, bringing development assistance more in line with a low-carbon development strategy. Rajendra K. Pachauri, Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, suggested the forum be renamed \u2018European Re-development Days\u2019, because \u2018we cannot proceed on the path of development as we understand it.\u2019 Participants had three messages for European policymakers in Stockholm. First, effective development in partner countries requires both strong political leadership and responsive politicians. At the same time, accountability can only be ensured through free media and an engaged civil society. Second, development is not solely a matter of philanthropy. The \u2018hungry billions are not only a moral disgrace\u2019, said Commissioner De Gucht, \u2018underdevelopment is a global problem that threatens us all\u2019. Similarly, Rajendra K. Pachauri warned that \u2018failing to address climate change will produce instability around the world. A large number of failed states will emerge \u2013 an outcome the world cannot accept and must prevent\u2019. Third, we need to shape international cooperation to better address the future challenges ahead. This means taking a more proactive approach to trade and infrastructure, climate change, migration, global food security and energy. Pachauri cautioned against forgetting the \u2018missing\u2019 Millennium Development Goal, namely access to energy, and reminded participants of the 1.6 billion people with no access to electricity. \u2018Poverty is linked to climate change \u2013 the most vulnerable people will be the hardest hit.

EDD09 further strengthened the Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA) launched in 2007. The Prime Minister of Vanuatu, Edward Natapei, signed an agreement with the Commission and stressed: \u2018We cannot meet the challenges of climate change alone. The GCCA is necessary and will go a long way to enable Vanuatu to meet the challenges [we face]. We need funding that is timely and accessible.\u2019 The Commission awarded the 2009 Lorenzo Natali Grand Prize to the Chinese journalist Yee-Chong Lee for a TV documentary on the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. He revealed the corruption and substandard construction of public buildings that many people blamed for the huge death toll. The award celebrates the work of journalists committed to human rights, democracy and development. Report Addressing fragility has been an increasingly important priority within the European development and security agendas. In 2009, fragility was the theme of the inaugural European Report on Development \u2013 launched at European Development Days \u2013 in which it was described as the \u2018toughest development challenge of our era\u2019. The European Report on Development seeks to enhance the EU\u2019s perspective on development issues on the basis of independent knowledge, excellence, innovation and better links between top academics and policymakers. It is a concrete manifestation of the EU\u2019s commitment \u2013 as the world\u2019s largest aid donor \u2013 to go beyond aid delivery and actively contribute to the global policy dialogue on development. The European Commission and several Member States support the initiative. \u2018Global poverty is not acceptable. This is indeed the challenge for our civilisation.

The stakes were high; the deadline for achieving the MDGs was a mere five years away. EDD10 took place during a time of intense international debate on development, less than two months after the United Nations High Level Summit on the Millennium Development Goals in New York and a week after the third Africa-EU Summit in Tripoli, Libya. The EUR 1 billion MDG initiative announced by the EU in New York provided additional momentum. The summit in Libya had also instilled new energy into the Joint Africa-EU Strategy, a true partnership between continents that looks beyond aid. For its fifth edition, european Development Days 2010 (eDD10) returned to where it began in 2006. On 6-7 December, the european Commission organised the forum in cooperation with the Belgian Presidency of the european Union in Brussels. eDD10 came at a decisive moment in european development policymaking, just weeks before the launch of the european external Action Service in January 2011 and following the publication of a european Commission Green Paper on increasing the impact of development policy in October 2010.

Following the Cotonou Appeal against counterfeit drugs in 2009, the Chirac Foundation organised a one-day seminar on the responses to the shadowy and lethal trade in counterfeit drugs. These mislabelled or ill-produced \u2018medicines\u2019 can account for up to 30 % of healthcare products in circulation in developing countries, causing pain and often death. Participants discussed the massive potential wealth that mining mineral resources could produce for Africa over the next decade, if properly managed. Corruption and lack of transparency, however, threaten these potential gains. Governments in developing countries lose billions of euros each year because of tax evasion. A group of academics sponsored by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation and led by Paul Collier, a professor of economics at Oxford University, launched a natural resource charter at the forum that sets conditions for sound and sustainable management. In 2013, the European Union reached a deal to match a US law that compels oil, gas and mining companies to publish payments they make to governments and release information on how much they earn in each country. The EU legislation requires all companies listed on EU stock exchanges to report their payments by country and project. Large unlisted companies registered in the EU are also required to comply. The proposed EU law goes one step further than the US law, adding the forestry industry to the list of companies that need greater transparency. \u2018I think European Development Days is far superior to Davos because we do serious work here.\u2019 7 December 2010 Mo IBrahIM Founding Chair of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation ",

The report stressed that social protection could help sub-Saharan Africa combat poverty by reducing its vulnerability to shocks and promoting inclusive growth. European Commissioner for Development Andris Piebalgs said: \u2018Social protection is often taken for granted in Europe. In fact, it has played an important and historic role in eradicating poverty in Europe. If well designed and managed, building on Africa\u2019s own priorities and specificities, it could deliver similar success in Africa.\u2019 The Commission awarded the 2010 Lorenzo Natali Grand Prize to the Nicaraguan journalist Yader Francisco Luna Garcia for an article on violence against women in his home country. The award celebrates the work of journalists committed to human rights, democracy and development. Outcome As the economic crisis was forcing nations to find cost-effective solutions in every domain, Europe\u2019s premier development platform helped generate exchanges between practitioners and decision-makers about the most efficient ways to help the estimated 1.4 billion people living in poverty. EDD10 addressed subjects as sensitive \u2013 and broad \u2013 as governance, human rights, the management of natural resources, access to energy, sustainable and inclusive growth, global health, support to the private sector, the effectiveness of aid, and the future of development cooperation policy for the institutions prescribed by the Lisbon Treaty. Participants agreed on two essential prerequisites for effective cooperation. First, on the need for partnership among stakeholders and recipient countries. Second, on the need for greater policy coherence according to the Lisbon Treaty. \u2018The secret of this event's success is its unique format: it combines a summit-style gathering of leaders with a forum for debate with NGOs and civil society.

Panellists agreed that the areas where Europe could help lay the foundations for sustainable and inclusive growth included governance, clean energy, and agriculture and food security. Just two weeks before the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan, South Korea, sessions addressed the call within the Agenda for Change for a more coordinated development approach at the European level and more development strategies led by partner countries. These principles of partnership and ownership are critical to aid effectiveness. Participants stressed the importance of South-South cooperation, aid effectiveness and accountability, decentralisation and strengthened local governance, democratic ownership, and the role of parliaments and civil society.

        "89 Outcome Several sessions explored the call for more effective budget support to partner countries that meet eligibility requirements, as set out in the Agenda for Change. Participants discussed the principles of \u2018smart conditionality\u2019, which includes a stable macroeconomic framework, national and sector policies that promote sustainability and poverty reduction; and financial management within strong institutional and regulatory frameworks. Importantly, participants agreed to focus attention on a country's record on democracy, particularly regarding human rights and gender. These changes should help move the EU from \u2018aid effectiveness\u2019 to \u2018development effectiveness\u2019. Participants communicated three key messages clearly in Warsaw. First, that the desire for freedom is not cultural, but human. Revolutions like those that began in Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and elsewhere 20 years before are now springing up in other parts of the world. Second, democratisation should begin from within partner countries. The days of donor interference and rule setting are over. Ownership in building democracy and pursuing development goals is essential. Partnership in sustaining the course towards democratisation is vital too. In this regard, EU Member States can share their own and often recent experiences transitioning to democracy. The EU overall has a proud tradition supporting transitions abroad as well. Third, human rights must be deeply rooted in the approach to development and should be given greater weight in cooperation. EDD11 highlighted the EU\u2019s proud track record in this area. The 2006 European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights has made a considerable difference in advancing these issues worldwide. Participants agreed that a multidimensional approach is needed to address human rights violations by using a combination of political dialogue, sanctions, and leveraging financial and technical cooperation. Finally, participants acknowledged that the world can prosper only in an era of partnership. No one has a monopoly on knowledge \u2013 we can all learn from each other. Developing countries are partners in an enterprise in which we all have a stake. As Hans Rosling, Chairman of the Gapminder Foundation, exclaimed: \u2018We are one world\u2019. \u2018The fundamental wish to have a dignified life for oneself and one\u2019s children, free from poverty, violence, oppression and corruption, where all can participate in a community that is respectful of its people, that is something that all human beings have in common. There may be cultural differences, but I believe that these are the common aspirations of every human being.\u2019 15 December 2011 Jos\u00e9 ManUEl Barroso President of the European Commission ",
        "90 - Editions One year after the protests in Tunisia, several high-level representatives from North Africa and the Middle East shared their vision for the future at EDD11. Tunisia\u2019s interim Prime Minister Mohammed Beji Caid Essebsi told the story of 26-year- old Mohammed Bouazizi who set himself on fire after being stripped of the most basic human desire to provide for his family. Through his tragic sacrifice, millions of his fellow Tunisians \u2013 and people throughout the wider region \u2013 can now aspire to the brighter future. At EDD11, Tunisia's leaders sought Europe's support to realise their democratic aspirations. Similarly, Mustafa Mohammed Abdul Jalil, Chair of Libya's National Transitional Council, called on the international community to support Libyan efforts to develop security, stability and the rule of law. He emphasised the need to reintegrate young freedom fighters into society through education and employment. The rapt audience during his address expressed their solidarity with Libya's cause. Memorable The focus of EDD11 was the link between development and democracy. Presenters and participants alike shared about their experiences with democratic transitions from Eastern Europe and Central Asia to North Africa and the Middle East. Given the high stakes, expert testimonies and debates were especially memorable. Twenty years earlier, Central and Eastern European countries experienced dramatic transitions. In 2011, participants discussed the experience of Poland and its neighbours. They explored how to transfer best practices to different political environments, including Arab countries. They examined the lessons learnt after 20 years of independence in Central Asian countries. EDD11 gave the floor to a number of eminent leaders, including former President of the Kyrgyz Republic Roza Isakovna Otunbaeva, who described how tyrants could not restrain the democratic aspirations of citizens, especially among youth. Her speech was a timely reminder that the road to democracy can be long and bumpy. \u2018This is the first time in the Arab world that the people rose up, not only for daily bread, but for dignity, freedom, equal rights and accountability of rulers.\u2019 15 December 2011 MohaMED BEJI CaID EssEBsI Interim Prime Minister of Tunisia ",

It was structured around three topics: building resilience, through sustainable agriculture, food security and nutrition; engaging the private sector for development and empowering people for inclusive growth. In 2012, about 16 % of the world\u2019s population \u2013 more than one billion people in all \u2013 were hungry and lived in poverty. Most lived as small-scale farmers in rural areas where agriculture is the main economic activity. At EDD12, six high-level panels addressed the issues of sustainable agriculture, food security and resilience. Achieving food and nutrition security was at the top of the international political agenda. Participants discussed how best to empower farmers and harness the enormous potential to scale up agricultural production in developing countries. On 16-17 October 2012, european Development Days (eDD12) returned to Brussels. The ongoing crisis in the Sahel region and the Horn of Africa was the backdrop for discussions concerning sustainable agriculture, food security and resilience. eDD12 discussed how to best support inclusive and sustainable growth for human development, as advocated by the european Commission\u2019s new blueprint for development, the Agenda for Change. Participants explored the links between inclusive and sustainable growth, and debated how to build more resilient communities, engage the private sector, and empower people to contribute to development.

        "97 Engaging the private sector as a development partner to create jobs and income opportunities for the poor is evolving into a cross-cutting issue in development cooperation. At EDD12, six high-level panels addressed how to successfully engage the private sector in development and use innovative financial approaches from the private and public sectors. Growth patterns are just as important as growth rates to reducing poverty. Without inclusive growth - charachterised by people's ability to participate in, and benefit from wealth and job creation - benefits cannot be sustained over the long term. At EDD12, six high-level panels focused on how to create inclusive growth while ensuring basic levels of social protection. As European Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso said at the EDD12 opening ceremony: \u2018Growth is not an end in itself. It needs to be sustainable and inclusive. In the long run growth and social inclusion are two sides of the same coin.\u2019 Outcome The European Commission built consensus around its Communication on social protection, as an effective way to reduce poverty and vulnerability. \u2018Social protection floors\u2019, for example, have made healthcare and education more affordable and accessible. Debates included in-depth discussions of how to finance universal healthcare and education and improve the rights of informal young workers. Participants also supported the scaling up of the SHARE programme, the EU's response to the food crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. This joint humanitarian-development programme has made impressive gains at making people, communities and countries more resilient to acute emergencies. Participants called for greater cooperation between development and humanitarian efforts, particularly in disaster preparedness. Participants shared success stories and best practices; learnt about the European Commission\u2019s platform to bring together development partners to make maximum use of blending instruments, discussed the potential of the private sector to transform African economies, debated what constitutes inclusive business models, and looked at how best to boost innovation and move towards green and inclusive growth.

Today, ECHO is anticipating the crisis by assessing risks, improving early warning systems and investing in resilience. Anniversary EDD12 was an opportunity to celebrate 20 years of European solidarity with people in need worldwide. Founded in 1992, the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) has since provided EUR 14 billion of humanitarian assistance to people suffering from natural disasters and human-made crises. Its work has been carried out under the principals of humanity, neutrality and independence. Together, EU Member States and European institutions are the biggest donors of humanitarian aid, providing more than half of official global contributions. Since 2008, ECHO\u2019s budget had averaged EUR 1 billion annually. In 2011, ECHO supported more than 120 million people in 80 countries. \u2018I have a two year old granddaughter and recently I played with her in Sofia and she laughed and cried.

Forum participants were invited to directly interact with Andris Piebalgs, eU Commissioner for Development; Jan eliasson, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations; ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of Liberia; and the executive Director of Oxfam International, Winnie Byanyima; as well as prominent academics, Paul Collier and Debapriya Bhattacharya.

        "102 - Editions Themes While the MDGs set in 2000 have helped focus efforts to reduce poverty and improve human wellbeing, progress has been uneven. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of Liberia, noted that in many poor countries, particularly in Africa, many of the goals have not been achieved. She called for much greater consultation with and participation of poor countries in formulating the post-2015 agenda, and for a stronger global partnership to underpin it. The European Union has set its vision for a post-2015 agenda with its 2013 Communication 'A Decent Life for All' and Council Conclusions,\u2018The Overarching Post-2015 Agenda\u2018. The European Union is advocating for a combined approach that ensures the adoption of a single set of goals and targets. Policymakers have called for universal application that takes into consideration national circumstances, capacities and levels of development. For its eighth edition, european Development Days (eDD13) remained in Brussels. More than 5 000 participants gathered around 343 senior experts and global leaders. eDD13 was also the largest ever eDD edition in terms of the depth and breadth of its programme, with 80 sessions. eDD13 followed the european Commission's Communication, 'A Decent Life For All: Building Consensus for a New Development Agenda'. The Communication encouraged participants to create common and ambitious european positions to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable development as part of the post-2015 agenda. eDD13 helped to shift the perception of development as a poor country problem to a challenge for the entire world to address. 5 000 participants 80 sessions 343 speakers 154 countries 105 bilaterals ",

        "105 Anniversary EDD13 was an opportunity to celebrate the 20 th anniversary of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and EU cooperation in the field of human rights. Flavia Pansieri, UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, began her address by reciting the first article of the UN Declaration on Human Rights. She cautioned the large and appreciative audience: \u2018We must make sure we recognise the importance, the absolute necessity of promotion and respect for human rights in everything we do. If it is true that there is no peace without development and no development without peace, it is equally true that neither of the two can exist without human rights.\u2019 Stavros Lambrinidis, EU Special Representative for Human Rights, recalled the 1993 Vienna Declaration from 20 years ago that emphasised the central role of civil society to promote human rights around the world. The EU needs to set an example and not overlook human rights violations: \u2018The fact that we\u2019re not all perfect does not mean we\u2019re all equally imperfect. Cultural relativism is very dangerous. Human rights are the universal language of the powerless against the relativism of the powerful. This is our inspiration. This is our compass. This is where we join hands with others to be able to make a difference, not just a point.\u2019 \u2018The fact that we\u2019re not all perfect does not mean we\u2019re all equally imperfect.

        "106 - Editions EDD13 also contributed to a vision of a world where every man, woman and child lives in dignity with the right to prosperity. As President Barroso stated, \u2018it is both a human imperative and a matter of strategic intelligence\u2019. Some participants believed that the post-2015 development agenda should address inequality in a meaningful way. Income inequality and gender discrimination are major worldwide impediments to poverty eradication and sustainable development. With regard to gender equality, participants agreed that the successor targets to the MDGs must promote change within society as a whole, including focusing on the role of men and boys. A recurrent theme across the two-day programme was one of interdependence. The discussions repeatedly highlighted the links between climate change and the limits of natural resources; between poverty, conflict and migration; and between education and inclusive and sustainable growth. \u2018A clear vision of an interdependent world, in which problems in one place affect us all,\u2019 was how Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of Liberia, summarised the ambition and sentiment of this EDD edition. Outcome The main outcome of EDD13 was the consensus built towards a bold, but realistic agreement for a post-2015 agenda, including sustainable development goals. The recognition that development is a common challenge for the entire world \u2013 for every country and every citizen \u2013 was the dominant message of EDD13. Because the challenges ahead are universal and interrelated, participants agreed on the need to address them together. EDD13 took place just a few days after the UN climate change conference in Warsaw and against the backdrop of the catastrophic consequences of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. Participants reiterated that climate change threatens poverty reduction efforts worldwide and called yet again on global leaders to take action. To achieve poverty eradication and sustainable development in its three dimensions \u2013 economic, social and environmental \u2013 the new agenda would need to address climate change as a cross-cutting issue and require all nations to \u2018live within planetary boundaries\u2019. 27 November 2013. At the closing session, ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of Liberia, stressed that one of the biggest challenges remaining ahead for the post-2015 global development framework is to ensure ownership, convincing every nation that the framework is in their national interests. \u2018The post-2015 framework should aim to construct a reinforced world-level partnership, based on solidarity with the poorest people, and an acceptance that the world of the 21 st century is unquestionably interdependent and destined for integration.\u2019 26 November 2013 Jos\u00e9 ManUEl Barroso President of the European Commission ",
        "107 \u2018The most difficult part in getting the necessary consensus will be the negotiation among countries, ensuring that each region feels it is engaged. The way to do it is through gaining support for the idea of one humanity. This time we are talking about mutual responsibility [where] we all commit to common goals for a common humanity. The international community should negotiate the future framework not as north, south, east, west, poor, rich \u2013 but as members of one humanity with a common destiny.\u2019 ",
        "",
        "109 \u2018Changes, Challenges and Chances\u2019 anDrIs pIEBalgs European Commissioner for Development Why development matters Why do we do development? To answer that question, picture the face of a hungry child \u2013 a face filled with fear and despair. That child is just one of the millions worldwide who may never grow up to become healthy adults; who may never have the chance to study and find a decent job; who may never fulfil the potential in them to build a better life for themselves, their families and the societies in which they live. All because they are dragged down by poverty, conflict or oppression, through no fault of their own. Development policy is about dispelling fear, conquering despair and offering real hope for the future. The desire to build a just, sustainable future for all people, free from poverty and conflict, motivates us all as development actors in the policies, strategies and actions we pursue. The desire to get the share experiences and build genuine, lasting partnerships to make our efforts count brings us together every year at European Development Days. I have been honoured to have overseen this premier event as European Commissioner for Development, following in the footsteps of Louis Michel. Together with Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, Louis took the vision for European Development Days and then quickly and skilfully turned it into a permanent fixture on the development calendar that no one with an interest in development issues can afford to miss. Over the years it has attracted a host of world leaders, development thinkers, NGOs and civil society representatives from the four corners of the globe and every walk of development life. The key theme of my closing speech to European Development Days in Brussels in 2012 was \u2018people- centred development\u2019. Of course, we all know that any development policy worth its salt must have people at its centre. However, from time to time we should remind ourselves of why we do development, and who we do it for. Back in the 3 rd century BC the Indian teacher and philosopher, Chanakya, said that before embarking ",
        "110 on a project, you should always ask yourself three questions: \u2018Why am I doing it?\u2019, \u2018What might the results be?\u2019, and \u2018Will I be successful?\u2019 Only when you have found satisfactory answers to these questions should you go ahead. We could apply this philosophy from to many different aspects of 21 st -century life. And it has certainly governed the way in which we have opened a new chapter in our development story \u2013 a story almost as old as the European project itself. The first question is relatively easy to answer. As I mentioned earlier, we are doing what we do to help people shake off the shackles of poverty and enjoy the freedom and opportunity to make the most of their talent and potential. Over the years our development cooperation has pursued with great determination its overriding aim of eradicating poverty. It is an aim to which I have remained fully and tirelessly committed ever since I became Commissioner for Development in 2010. The EU as a whole provides over half of all global aid and I have been privileged to see how, when combined with country-led development efforts, it can truly change people\u2019s lives for the better. Development aid really does work. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which the European Union has consistently championed, have shown us just what can be done when we work together. Thanks to the MDGs, global poverty was halved in a mere 10 years. In addition, with support from the European Commission, since 2004 more than 13.7 million new pupils have enrolled in primary education and more than 70 million people have been connected to improved drinking water. Over the same period the EU has helped construct or renovate more than 8 500 health facilities worldwide. Adapting to a changing world We live in a world that has changed a great deal in a few years \u2013 even since 2006, when the first European Development Days took place. We have watched emerging economies around the world move from being development aid beneficiaries to become donors. Developing countries have contributed an astonishing 70 % of the world\u2019s growth in the last 10 years. Africa, the world\u2019s youngest continent in demographic terms, has been enjoying unprecedented, sustained growth. At home we have seen how the Member States that have joined the European Union since 2004 \u2013 including my own country of Latvia \u2013 are gradually becoming fully- fledged development players. This sends out a clear, optimistic signal to countries around the world that the transformation from closed, rigid oppression to prosperous, outward-looking freedom is perfectly possible \u2013 and that the EU can help them along that path, too. This significant shift in global power, influence and markets to emerging and developing countries is encouraging. It shows that while aid can undoubtedly deliver, it is no longer the only road to development and that development cooperation is as much about mutual interest as it is about solidarity. So the changes over recent years have presented us with challenges and chances at one and the same ",
        "111 time. If my days as a teacher and headmaster have taught me anything, it is that we can always do better. This deep-rooted conviction made me all the more determined to rise to these challenges and capitalise on these chances to build on the healthy development legacy left to me by my predecessors. I was also acutely aware of the need to get the highest impact from our resources. The European Union owes it to its partner countries and to Europeans at home to make its development funding as effective as possible. I therefore set about devising a blueprint for a modern, focused, high-impact development policy to take us forward. That blueprint became the \u2018Agenda for Change\u2019, which we have debated in great detail at successive EDDs. Delivering high-impact aid The Agenda for Change gives us a relevant, high-impact policy fit to take on development challenges in the modern world. It is about getting more impact from our policy with the resources we have, targeting them where they are most needed, have a comparative advantage and bring real added value, so that people can move out of poverty and stay out of it. It focuses on good governance, inclusive and sustainable growth and human development. We have focused on good governance because of our deeply held conviction that empowering and enabling people to stay out of poverty is about laying solid governance foundations, so that everyone gets a fair start in life, a fair chance to create wealth for themselves and boost their country\u2019s development as equal members of society, and a fair deal when they fall sick, lose their job or retire. We have focused on inclusive and sustainable growth because too often the fruits of growth do not translate into poverty reduction or wealth creation for those who really need them. For us, growth that comes in fits and starts and whose benefits are not felt across society is a wasted opportunity. Lasting growth in which everyone can share gives all people an equal chance to make the most of their potential and in doing so to create wealth that benefits them, their families, their communities and society as a whole. I am delighted that our current EU budget, taking us from 2014 to 2020, has kept development funding at a high level, thereby enabling us to pursue the important development priorities we have set under the \u2018Agenda for Change\u2019. Yet aid is not a cure-all. That is why we believe it can be used effectively to leverage additional funding \u2013 for instance to spur better domestic revenue mobilisation, or in combination with funds from other sources, including new partners like the private sector. At the same time, we are improving coordination with Member States and other donors to avoid unnecessary overlaps and work more effectively. We are doing more to join humanitarian and development efforts together, striving whenever possible to lay the foundations for lasting peace and security and investing in resilience. And we are seeking to leave behind the old donor-recipient approach to aid and forge new relationships with our partner countries, in which they have full ownership of their development strategies and we pursue cooperation in other ",
        "112 areas of mutual interest. Because development in the 21 st century is not a zero-sum game. If our partner countries can pursue real and lasting development, rid themselves of insecurity and conflict and gain full access to world trade, we will benefit as well. Nonetheless, aid must also continue to do its traditional job, addressing our partner countries\u2019 stated development needs and priorities. There can be no let-up in our development efforts because much remains to be done. The MDG deadline expires in 2015 and yet progress towards meeting the goals has been uneven and many countries have not made adequate headway. Too many people in too many countries remain trapped in poverty. The EU remains totally committed to working with its partner countries worldwide to help them achieve the MDGs by 2015. Our EUR 1 billion MDG Initiative, through which we have been working with more than 50 countries to foster action in improving access to food, maternal health and access to water and sanitation, is ample proof of that. All in all, with the Agenda for Change to guide us, we have set about making an ever greater contribution to our partner countries\u2019 efforts to eradicate poverty and secure a sustainable development path for themselves. We have a truly relevant policy in place, fit to take on any of the development challenges that our modern world throws at us. A vision for the future They are challenges that the international community is tackling now as it sets about shaping an ambitious post-2015 framework to take us ever closer to making poverty history and sustainable development the future. The EU has made its position clear. We believe that the post-2015 development framework should have poverty eradication and sustainable development at its core, and include five main elements: basic living standards; inclusive and sustainable growth; sustainable management of natural resources; equity, equality and justice; and peace and security. This is not a task we should treat lightly. Nor is it time for half-measures or cautious moves. On the contrary, it is time for bold action. Through the post-2015 framework we have the best opportunity in history to eradicate poverty and secure a sustainable future for our planet. The resources and technology we need are there. What is required on top of them, as UN Secretary-General Ban-Ki Moon has rightly suggested, is political courage. Then we can truly begin to realise the bold yet achievable vision for the world that the European Union has brought to the post-2015 table. It is a vision of a world in which every man, woman and child lives in dignity and prosperity. A world in which giving birth is no longer a matter of life and death. A world in which all people, beginning with children, have access to water, sanitation, energy, education and health services. A world in which progress does not push our planet beyond its limits, thereby safeguarding future generations\u2019 well-being and livelihoods. A world in which the face of a hungry child with no future is replaced ",
        "113 with the face of a healthy and happy child who has everything to live for. This vision answers the second of our three questions. It is a vision that we are fully capable of realising. But it absolutely must be a common effort in which each and every one of us plays our part. A partnership built to last The post-2015 development framework and the process leading up to it have shown that development is truly a collaborative effort. Partner countries, donors NGOs, the private sector, parliaments and people all need to be involved. Only then can all people, wherever they may be, genuinely benefit. If we all pull together, we can answer the third question positively and make our inclusive, comprehensive partnership a genuine success. European Development Days is a microcosm of this partnership, in which no issue, no country and no person is left out. The forum shows what can be achieved with the right mix of compromise, commitment and common vision. Without it we would not have come as far as we have. They are unique and vital to furthering the development cause. It binds us together in a partnership built to last. At the opening session of the 2011 edition of European Development Days in Warsaw I referred to it as a place where we can get important business done. I very much look forward to seeing this forum continue in the same vein in the years to come. Development issues will always be close to my heart and I will have many, many fond memories to take with me from European Development Days. Development is, and will always be, about people. The people who gather at the forum every year and make it such a success, know that. This is why I have every confidence that, whatever issues they may discuss, European Development Days will always have people at their heart. ",

        "E u r o p e a n D e v e l o p m e n t D a y s 2 0 0 6 / 1 3 Today, the European Union is leading the fight as the world\u2019s largest aid donor and the main trading partner of developing countries. Tomorrow, the European Union will continue to take the lead with more aid and more effective aid. With the Lisbon Treaty, coherent policy based on poverty alleviation is at the heart of future EU external action. European Development Days shows Europe\u2019s commitment to the eradication of poverty. Launched in 2006 by the Council of the European Union as a vehicle for greater aid effectiveness, the forum fosters knowledge sharing, innovative thinking and real efficiency gains. All this with one aim in mind: to constantly improve our concepts and instruments in securing better lives for people across the globe. The forum further builds on a core belief: cooperation is the cornerstone of a fairer world. Development aid alone will not be enough. Only through the mobilisation of all actors \u2013 multilateral organisations, governments, experts, researchers, civil society, business, journalists and citizens \u2013 can and will the world change. An essential aim of the European Development Days is thus to facilitate networking and inspire the desire to work together even more closely. Each year, European Development Days attracts about 5 000 participants from over 140 countries, representing 1 200 organisations from the field of development cooperation, human rights and humanitarian aid. The forum thus demonstrates the willingness of the European Commission to foster a true spirit of partnership with all stakeholders. In bringing together the global development community, the European Union also engages political leaders, development practitioners, the private sector and civil society in shaping the EU\u2019s policies for tackling poverty worldwide. Since 2006, European Development Days has led debates around the challenges ahead in international cooperation: climate change, policy coherence, global governance, human development, food and energy, security and fragility, support for democracy. Europe can show a lead on development. This is a policy based on European values \u2013 solidarity with partners in developing countries, global governance based on universal values and respect for the environment. In a nutshell, the forum is the yearly gathering of those who work daily to promote a fairer and better world. Debates are often passionate, sometimes controversial yet always inspiring.
