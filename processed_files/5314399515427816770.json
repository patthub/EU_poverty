        "5 Annex II - Assessment of the situation in the enlargement region 1. Introduction The enlargement annex of the Staff Working Document (SWD) provides detailed data on the Western Balkans implementation of the NRIS. It is based on data from the 2018 annual reports from the NRCPs on measures implemented in 2017 and the shadow reports prepared by enlargement Roma civil society networks. This analysis also takes into account the results of the 2019 Regional Survey \u201cBreaking the cycle of Roma exclusion in the Western Balkans\u201d 1 (RRS), which is based on 2017 data and its evolution from 2011, year of the first regional Roma survey in the region since the 2011 Roma Framework. It is worth noticing that both the 2011 and the 2017 RRS were financed by the EU through IPA pre-accession funding and implemented by the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programmes (UNDP). This annex includes both partner and thematic information concentrated on the five 2 priority areas: education, employment, health, housing and civil documentation. The focus is on the effect, on the ground, of measures taken, and their evolution in the period 2011-2017. The six Western Balkans partners reported in 2018 on measures in the fields of education (121 measures), employment (92 measures), healthcare (73 measures) and housing (69 measures). This section presents limited information on the situation of Roma in Turkey. The country provided the second annual NRCP report on the implementation of the NRIS in November 2018, which includes partial information. Turkey did not take part in the 2017 Regional Roma Survey. 2. General assessment Estimates on the Roma population in the Western Balkans suggest that they represent between 1.6% in Bosnia and Herzegovina and 9.6% in North Macedonia of the total population. The Roma population is diverse and this analysis focusses on the situation of marginalized Roma and identifies important gaps between Roma and non-Roma living in the vicinity. Roma have only limited access to education, employment, health and housing and often lack the necessary documentation to benefit in full from their fundamental rights. During the period 2011-2017, limited progress on Roma integration is reported for the Western Balkans by the 2017 RRS. The demographic evolution of the Roma population together with the aging of the society in the region represent a challenge and an obligation to gear-up actions on Roma socio-economic inclusion and non-discrimination and to explore economic opportunities and potential fiscal gain. Advancing on Roma inclusion is a moral imperative and smart economics, particularly in the enlargement partners to set the ground for closer collaboration with the EU Member States. In the averages across the five priority areas, data from 2011 and 2017 indicate continued minimal progress in coverage, limited access to basic services and few economic opportunities among Roma. The progress achieved does not surpass 3.3%. In inequality (gap between Roma and non-Roma living in the vicinity), there was deterioration in two countries (Albania and Montenegro), and 10% improvement in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 1 https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eca/publication/breaking-cycle-of-roma-exclusion-in-western-balkans. Please note that all graphics included in this section are taken from this report. 2 In addition to the four key priorities identified in the 2011 EU Framework, the 2013-2014 Enlargement Strategy, in section II \u201cKey challenges\u201d, identified a fifth key priority for the enlargement region: civil documentation and registration. ",
        "6 Overall, a look at the performance of individual partners shows that Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Serbia performed well in relative terms. These three countries improved, even if not much, in both coverage and inequality. Montenegro worsened in both coverage and inequality. Albania improved in coverage (only 2.6 %), but worsened in inequality. 2.1. Education This is an area with significant, common improvement in the period 2011\u20132017. Despite progress, remarkable gaps between Roma and their non-Roma neighbours remain substantial, especially in upper- secondary and tertiary education with no clear trend of reduction. In 2017, pre-primary enrolment rates among Roma, ages 3\u20135, ranged from only 3% in Bosnia and Herzegovina to 33% in Albania. Financial costs are identified as the most relevant barrier. Future improvement in this area is essential: reduced early childhood stimulation at home and restricted exposure to the majority language have, as consequence, that Roma children are less prepared when entering primary school. Education is the great equaliser, a right of children and a duty of public authorities. Gaps persist in enrolments to compulsory education, where a compulsory public school system is essential in providing equal opportunities to children regardless of ethnicity or socioeconomic background. In Albania and Montenegro, at least a third of Roma children, ages 7\u201315, were outside the school system in 2017. Compulsory education completion rates among Roma, ages 18\u201321, are generally low and range between 34% in Montenegro and 70% in North Macedonia. The regional completion average for non-Roma is 95%. The completion rate is especially low for Roma girls. Cost barriers are fundamental in limiting enrolment. In addition, child marriage, especially for girls, is an important hindering factor to enrolment and early dropouts. In upper-secondary education , completion among Roma, ages 22\u201325, shows a wide range across the region, from only 3% in Montenegro to 32% in North Macedonia. Albania, North Macedonia and Serbia achieved progress between 2011 and 2017. Tertiary education completion is almost non-existent among Roma, with a success rate of 3% in North Macedonia as the highest in the region.

Large gaps exist in enrollments in compulsory school Adjusted net enrollment rate, % of children (ages 7-15) ",
        "7 Adult education remains an area deserving important attention. Literacy rates of Roma population stays low, especially of Roma women. For Roma female youth and females of working age (15\u201364), literacy ranges from 58% in Albania and Montenegro to 82% in North Macedonia. The high relevance of the family background, notably the educational attainment of mothers for the enrolment of Roma children in compulsory education, is worth noting. 2.2. Employment The labour market is the priority area that lags the most behind, with a substantial deterioration since 2011 in labour force participation and employment among Roma across the region. North Macedonia is the only country where the situation remains mostly unchanged. There is also a lack of progress in Source: World Bank estimates based on weighted 2017 UNDP-World Bank-EC Regional Survey data The ethnic gap is wider in upper-secondary completion Upper secondary (ISCED level 3) completion rate (ages 22-25) Source: World Bank estimates based on weighted 2017 UNDP-World Bank-EC Regional Survey data Self-reported literacy rates are low among Roma, especially Roma females Literacy rates, % by gender (ages 15-64) ",
        "8 narrowing the gaps to non-Roma neighbours. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo * and Montenegro have especially bleak employment outcomes among Roma. Unemployment is remarkably high among Roma. Over 50% of economically active working-age Roma are unemployed in Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Employment among active Roma ranges from 13% in Kosovo to 22% in North Macedonia. Entrepreneurial activity is low, and Roma start-ups, when set up, are significantly more likely to be informal. The gender gap in labour force participation among Roma is wide: it ranges from 23% in Albania to 33% in Kosovo. Furthermore, the majority of Roma youth are not in employment, education, or training (NEET), placing them at risk of social and economic exclusion. NEET rates among young Roma, ages 15\u201324, are high, ranging from 62% in Serbia to 82% in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The low level of education among Roma appears to be one of the key factors contributing to weaker labour market prospects. There are several barriers influencing the capacity of Roma to enter the labour market: the lack of skills and experience constitutes the first and most important one. Other constrains are residential segregation, * This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence.

        "9 lack of childcare and eldercare at affordable prices, limited flexibility in work arrangements, lack of documentation, discrimination and antigypsyism, and employment programmes not adapted to the job market demand or the reality of Roma in terms of access to documents (e.g. proof of completed education as enrolment request). Social assistance schemes do not seem to have generated disincentives to shift Roma individuals from employment or unemployment to inactivity. 2.3. Healthcare Self-perceived health is poorer among Roma than among neighbouring non-Roma, despite Roma being a younger demographic group. The health status of marginalized Roma may be affected by poor living conditions and low social standing, in addition to deficiencies in the access to and use of health care services. Across the region, the majority of Roma report high costs or the lack of health insurance as the reasons behind their unmet need for medical care. In most cases, the gap in health insurance coverage between Roma and their non-Roma neighbours primarily revolves around sociodemographic characteristics: employment status and household asset holdings. Experience shows that there is also a large gap between Roma and non-Roma as regards the use of preventive health care services, e.g. cholesterol tests and gynaecological check-ups.

        "10 From the different possible barriers, affordability (lack of insurance coverage or inability to afford the medicines needed) appears to be the bigger problem. Other important barriers are the perceived acceptability of health care due to lack of information, fear, language barriers and discrimination. The availability of health care centres does not seem to be a major barrier across the region, as the vast majority of Roma report that there is a health care centre in their vicinity. 2.4. Housing Many disadvantaged Roma live in informal settlements to which they do not have legal titles and often experience severe overcrowding. Across the region, at least one-third of Roma live in dilapidated housing or slums, the shares range from 30% in Albania to 43% in Montenegro. Additional evidence of the inferior quality of housing among Roma is the lower rate of access to basic public services, such as electricity, piped water, connections to public sewerage or wastewater tanks and waste collection. Access to electricity among Roma ranges from 84% in Albania to 93% in North Macedonia. A similar picture emerges on access to piped water inside the dwelling: while in Albania, less than one-half of Roma have access to this essential service versus 89% of non-Roma neighbours, this is the case for only three-fourths of Roma in Montenegro. Connection to public sewerage or wastewater tanks ranges from 55% in Montenegro to 84% in North Macedonia.

The panels show the share of respondents reporting that they have accessed preventive services in the previous 12 months. Data based on the RSS are based on randomly selected household members. Preventive health care services include a dental check-up, an x-ray, ultrasound or other scan, cholesterol test, or heart check-up among individuals ages 16+. ",
        "11 2.5. Documentation In the Western Balkans, the burden and costs associated with civil registration are sometimes an important barrier that disproportionately affects Roma communities. In Serbia, for example, the lack of income to pay the high fees for naturalization, identification cards or legal assistance is a prohibitive barrier for many Roma. In Montenegro, there are still unregistered internally displaced persons (IDPs). In January 2015 their IDP status was phased out, making their legal status uncertain. In 2018, a Law on foreigners was adopted, that provides a legal basis for regulating their status. Throughout the region, there is a high coverage of birth certificates and identity cards, but qualitative evidence indicates that Roma often lack adequate documents - such as proof of residency - to gain access to social services.

        "12 Finally, access to documentation is an issue that overly affects returnee children, a lot of whom are Roma. Many Roma returnee children have benefited from schooling inside the EU. However, lack of documentation and certification often leads to delays in the enrolment in formal education systems or the enrolment of children in classes that do not reflect their schooling in the EU.

        "16 Country summaries on the enlargement region ALBANIA (Egyptians are included under the umbrella term Roma) Summary based on NRCP report - 2017 Roma integration measures G ENERAL INFORMATION Institution acting as NRCP The General Director for Social Policies at the Ministry of Health and Social Policies (MoHSP). Strategic document The National Action Plan for the Integration of Roma and Egyptians in the Republic of Albania was adopted in 2015. It replaces the National Roma Integration Strategy and includes, as a priority mechanism, to coordinate and monitor policies underpinning the inclusion of Roma and Egyptians in the country. Roma population (Council of Europe average estimation, updated in July 2012) 115,000 (3.59% of 3,204,284). Available options for data collection Questions on ethnic self-identification are included in the population census; two Regional Roma Surveys (2011, 2017 3 ) were carried out by UNDP and the World Bank; the Roma Inclusion Index 2015; 2015 Poverty Mapping in Albania 4 ; the Annual Monitoring Report on the Implementation of the Roma Integration Policy (2017, 2018); the ROMALB monitoring platform (https://www.romalb.org/ ). S UMMARY OF THE REPORTING YEAR The main achievements Albania has made significant steps towards Roma integration with the adoption of a number of relevant laws. The Law on Minorities, adopted at the end of 2017, officially recognises Roma and Egyptian as national minorities. The Law on Social Housing prohibits forced eviction and foresees information to and consultations of citizens affected by public infrastructure investment projects. It also introduces a 5% quota dedicated to Roma for the different renting options, notably renting bonus, social housing and soft loans. The Law on Legal Aid also benefits Roma. Albania established a network of Roma focal points in the ministries and municipalities, who together with the ROMALB information system, allow for real-time monitoring of the implementation of the Roma Action Plan and automatic generation of report indicators. The main challenges Main challenges include the lack of ethnically disaggregated data to assess the impact of national policies and measures underpinning the inclusion of Roma and to monitor the impact of EU financial and technical support in priority areas. Compulsory education, with a significant gap of 31% in enrolments between Roma and non-Roma, is mostly driven by discrimination. At least a third of Roma children ages 7-15 were outside the school system in 2017. Employment and labour market access, with over 55% of economically active working-age Roma that are unemployed. Specific legislative measures aimed at supporting social enterprises, tax reduction and specific sectors, like, for example, waste recycling. These measures could be more effective if accompanied by vocational education measures and transition programmes from education to employment or self- employment. Access to finance and financial literacy would facilitate the creation of micro and small enterprises. T HEMATIC A REAS In 2017, four thematic areas were reported as relevant for the implementation of the Roma Strategy: 1) education and intercultural dialogue, 2) employment and VET, 3) health and 4) housing and urban integration. In addition, Albania reported on Access to civil registration and justice; Social protection; and Policy coordination, monitoring and assessment. These elements will not be reported on in this document. A total of 11 objectives and 80 measures were reported on. Hereof, 39 were implemented, 13 were partially implemented and 28 were not implemented. The objectives were a mixture of mainstream and partly targeted measures. EDUCATION Inequalities in education between Roma and non-Roma emerge early in life with generally low enrolment in pre-primary education (ages 3-5) in the Western Balkans. In Albania, this gap reaches 31%. Similarly, in compulsory education, the gap between Roma and non-Roma in Albania reaches 31% with 66% of Roma children enrolled. Advances as compared to 2011 are remarkable, although more improvement is still needed to catch-up with the country and EU averages. The Roma Integration Action Plan for Albania records as strategic goal in the area of education that Roma and Egyptians have full access to and inclusion in qualitative education without being subjected to discrimination and segregation. The thematic priority includes four objectives: 1) more Roma and Egyptians to complete all levels of education; 2) promote intercultural dialogue and mutual understanding through school- based community development; 3) strengthen the collaboration between schools and social services; 4) value and promote the recognition of the Roma and Egyptians identities as part of Albanian cultural heritage. These four objectives were structured in a total of 34 measures, out of 3 https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eca/publication/breaking-cycle-of-roma-exclusion-in-western-balkans 4 http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/659991480409319302/pdf/110582-REVISED-PUBLIC-report-eng- complete.pdf ",
        "17 which 19 were fully implemented, seven partially implemented, and eight not implemented. The most important success Albania witnessed the largest increase in the Western Balkans in compulsory education enrolment since 2011. Completion rates in compulsory education increased significantly, from 23% in 2011 to 43% in 2017. Nonetheless, 57% of Roma still do not complete compulsory education. The completion rate in upper-secondary education increased five times, from a low of 3% in 2011 to 15% in 2017. The re-evaluation of educational programmes in kindergartens and schools together with efforts in some municipalities to exclude Roma children from pre-school education fees contribute to address the existing gap between Roma and non-Roma attendance in pre-school education. The \u201cSecond chance\u201d programme of school reintegration for adults has proven successful, enabling Roma adults to finish compulsory education and then continue further with vocational education and training. The most important challenge Segregation in education is still a challenge together with the increasing number of school dropouts due to both family migration and the attraction into the informal labour market, notably among early teenagers. The gap between Roma and non-Roma in attendance in pre-school and compulsory education remains a challenge for the country. At least a third of Roma children, aged 7\u201315, were outside the school system in 2017. Improving the outreach in support for school enrolment by use of mediators can affect the school attendance of Roma children. The gap in completion of tertiary education significantly increased in Albania, as the rate of Roma completing tertiary education remained around 1% in both 2011 and 2017. EMPLOYMENT Over 55% of economically active working-age Roma are unemployed in Albania. The gender gap in labour force participation among Roma is 23%, where the main reason behind female inactivity is the presence of children in the household and family responsibilities. Among males, inactivity mostly arises because of insufficient labour demand. Data from the Regional Roma Surveys of 2011 and 2017 denotes a worsening in labour force participation, employment to population ration, unemployment rate and NEETs (not in employment, education or training). The Roma Action Plan for Albania records as strategic goal in the area of employment and vocational education and training to provide equal opportunities for formal employment of Roma and Egyptians. The thematic priority includes three objectives: 1) integrate Roma and Egyptians in the labour market through VET and active employment programmes; 2) promote entrepreneurship and self-employment; 3) build capacity and improve the performance of the National Employment System and VET system for the integration of Roma and Egyptians in the labour market. These objectives were structured into 21 measures. Hereof, eight were implemented, three were partially implemented, and 10 were not implemented. The most important success The adoption in March 2019of the Law on Employment Promotion Programmes introducing specific programmes for self-employment addressing elements relevant for the Roma and Egyptian population. Still, access to funding and financial literacy for Roma is limited, hindering their possibility to benefit fully from the recently approved law. The most important challenge Roma labour market participation decreased between 2011 and 2017, notably for males aged 33-44. The employment-to-population ratio dropped significantly, from 42% of working age Roma employed in 2011 to only 18% in 2017. The implementation of employment promotion programmes subsidized from the state budget have limited impact on the Roma employment rates. According to official data from the National Employment Agency, in 2018 only 239 Roma out of 5,845 registered Roma job seekers were employed. Not all Roma remain employed and some of the reasons for their dropping out from jobs are discrimination and dire working conditions. A stronger effort is required to: promote social entrepreneurship and self-employment of Roma through sufficient funding and appropriate legislation and programmes; study the potential impact of tax exemptions for Roma transferring from unemployment; study the potential impact of concessions to waste collectors of recyclable waste; award grants to Roma farmers; or engage Roma in public services. The aforementioned measures would also serve to tackle informal work of Roma. HEALTHCARE In Albania, the situation in terms of health insurance coverage denotes a worsening, while an improvement is recorded in terms of self- reported unmet need for medical care and the use of preventive healthcare services. The Roma Action Plan for Albania records as strategic goal in the area of health to increase access for Roma and the use of mainstream healthcare services. The target is that, by the end of 2020, the whole Roma community is able to use mainstream healthcare services. The thematic priority included two objectives: 1) increase the number of Roma using the mainstream healthcare services; 2) improve healthcare information and promotion of the available healthcare services for Roma. These objectives are structure into 11 measures. In 2017, six measures were implemented, one was partially implemented, and four were not implemented. The most important success The merging of health and social protection sectors in early 2018 is resulting in more attention towards Roma health needs, notably information to women about free mammography tests, awareness campaigns on early and forced marriages and help preventing potential cases of domestic violence and/or human trafficking. Moreover, more health centres and immunization campaigns are reaching a larger number of Roma. In 2017, 30,354 Roma possessed health insurance cards, free of charge or based on paid insurance contributions. The most important challenge The lack of health insurance coverage is hindering access to certain medical examinations and the affordability of expensive medicines. A 2014 amendment to Law 7703 \u201cFor social Insurance\u201d is depriving Albanians, including many Roma, of access to health and social services, posing ",
        "18 new requirements in terms of contributions to the social security system, thus excluding many unemployed Roma. Health mediators should be part of the healthcare system so that dissemination of information and different governmental health campaigns can reach Roma living in remote areas. Anti-discrimination measures targeting staff in health institutions, such as developing standard trainings for healthcare workers on equitable provision of services, are not implemented. HOUSING Access to housing is a persistent issue among Roma in Albania. It can be also noted that access to electricity and connection to public sewage or wastewater tanks denotes a worsening between 2011 and 2017, while in the same period improvement in waste collection, rooms per household member and overcrowding rates is recorded. The Roma Action Plan for Albania records, as strategic objective, to improve housing conditions for Roma, with two main objectives: 1) improve mechanisms for facilitating legalization procedures for Roma families, aiming to successfully complete 80% of legalization procedures initiated by the end of 2020; and 2) inclusion of Roma families in the direct and indirect housing programmes. These two objectives are structured into 14 measures, out of which six are implemented, two partially implemented, and six not implemented. The most important success In May 2018, the Albanian Parliament adopted Law No. 22/2018 \u201cOn Social Housing\u201d which introduces a 5% quota dedicated to Roma for the different renting options, notably renting bonus, social housing and soft loans. It also prohibits forced eviction, foresees legal procedures for information of and consultation with citizens affected by public infrastructure investment projects. The law introduces the obligation by public authorities to offer effective alternative housing and legal aid to affected citizens. The secondary legislation is planned to be adopted and enter into force during 2019. The definition of displacement and institutional cooperation procedures related to evictions, and the training of staff on prioritising Roma, are also planned for the upcoming period. The mapping of Roma informal settlements, together with investment feasibility studies, facilitated planning of social housing projects and legalisation of Roma housing. The most important challenge The issue of discrimination in the housing sector persists. The mainstream population is not willing to rent to Roma. As a result, they cannot enter rental contracts and benefit from rent support. Moreover, local governments have insufficient capacity to design housing policies and prepare investment proposals that take into account the needs of beneficiary populations and eradicate segregation. G OVERNANCE AND COOPERATION Human resources for the NRCP The NRCP is the Director General of the MoHSP. She is supported by one Roma Specialist from the Social Inclusion Directory at the MoHSP. The NRCP coordinates the implementation and monitoring of Roma policies in the country. The implementation of the Action Plan is monitored by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection. Cross-sectorial coordination The NRCP and the MHSP are in charge of coordinating line-ministries, inter-sectorial policies and local authorities in the implementation and monitoring of the Roma policies. The MoHSP has a coordination role in all social policies and action plans, including Roma. As a result, the MoHSP is fully involved in the decision-making process. Examples of participation include co-chairing the bi-annual Roma Seminars, representation in EU fora and policy workshops, participation in the meetings of the inter-disciplinary body Integrated Policy Management Group (IPMG) on Employment and Social Sector (ESS)\u2019s Thematic Group on Social Inclusion, Gender Equality and Roma Issues, national Roma platform meetings etc. The key dialogue platforms among relevant stakeholders are the two-yearly Roma Seminars and the annual National Roma Platforms. The following actors are involved in the monitoring and evaluation of the Roma Strategy: \u2022 the government; \u2022 the NRCP; \u2022 the inter-disciplinary body Integrated Policy Management Group (IPMG) on Employment; \u2022 the Social Sector (ESS)\u2019s Thematic Group on Social Inclusion, Gender Equality and Roma Issues; \u2022 Roma and pro-Roma NGOs. Dialogue/cooperation has been established between the Ombudsman/equality body and the NRCP: ad-hoc contacts. There is a baseline against which progress in the implementation of the Roma Strategy and Action Plan can be measured. This information can be found in the Action Plan. The 2016-2020 Roma Action Plan in Albania focuses on seven priority areas. The priority areas mirror those of the Roma integration framework in the EU, adding some elements needed to underpin the enlargement process in the Western Balkans. They are: \u2022 Education and promotion of intercultural dialogue; \u2022 Employment and vocational education and training; \u2022 Health; \u2022 Housing and urban integration; \u2022 Social protection; \u2022 Equal access to civil registration and justice; \u2022 Policy coordination, monitoring and assessment.

        "19 ALBANIA (Egyptians are included under the umbrella term Roma) Assessment based on civil society country reports 5 SUBSTANTIVE POLICY AREAS S TRENGTHS /K EY ELEMENTS OF THE PARTNER APPROACH W EAKNESSES /G APS /R ECOMMENDATIONS E DUCATION \uf0b7 Concrete efforts in enrolling children in early childhood care and education, as well as in the re-evaluation of educational programmes in kindergartens and schools. \uf0b7 Efforts at municipal level to exclude Roma children from payment of fees to be enrolled in pre-school education, notably in Tirana, Gjirokastra, Fier and Elbasan. \uf0b7 School textbooks are provided free of charge for all children in first to fifth grade of compulsory education, and for Roma children in sixth to ninth grades of compulsory education. \uf0b7 Roma children are registered in schools despite lack of registration documents. Legal measures are stated to avoid segregation (monitoring tools by the Educational Directorates). \uf0b7 Free university quotas for Roma students, exclusion of university fees for bachelor level and 50% reduction for master studies. \uf0b7 Recently, as part of the reformed university education package, the tuition fees for master studies have been removed for vulnerable categories, including Roma. \uf0b7 Roma pupils attending professional high schools benefit from scholarships. \u201cSecond chance\u201d, a programme of school reintegration for adults, has proven to be successful, enabling Roma adults to finish compulsory education and then continue further with vocational education and training. \uf0b7 The lack of childcare infrastructures appears to be a significant barrier to pre-school enrolment among Roma. Improved childcare services and outreach to most vulnerable Roma families can help the enrolment of children into the pre-school system. Support to Roma mothers can improve the access of children to pre-school and basic education. Needed pre-school textbooks and didactic materials, unless not provided for the Roma children, hinder their attendance. \uf0b7 In compulsory education, the increasing number of school dropouts is due to family migration, or attraction into the grey labour market, especially among early teenagers. Providing employment opportunities for parents can minimise the school dropout of Roma children. \uf0b7 Improving the outreach by the mediators can affect school attendance by Roma children. Distance from schools together with the absence of safe commute and transport is a barrier to the attendance among Roma children, especially girls. \uf0b7 Qualification of teachers, involvement of support teachers and quality of the service assessment index can help monitoring the system. Gaps in primary education curricula hinder vocational education and training attendance. \uf0b7 An increasingly lower number of Roma children access high school and university. Bilingualism, communication and cultural differences have a negative effect on most Roma graduation marks not meeting the requirements to enter university. Quotas for Roma students should be introduced for master studies. \uf0b7 Continuous support for the \u201cSecond chance Programme\u201d to be provided. Scholarships/incentives based on merit and progress starting for pupils in elementary schools and high schools can help the families to overcome the economic barriers affecting proper education. E MPLOYMENT \uf0b7 In March 2019, the Albanian Parliament approved Law No. 15/2019 on Employment Promotion Programmes. The law introduces a specific programme for self-employment, which addresses several segments among the Roma and Egyptian population who are engaged in informal economic activities or who are interested in developing a small business. \uf0b7 There is an increasing interest from industry for Roma workers through more project incentives and government subsidies. \uf0b7 Incentives for unemployed job seekers attending vocational education and training have been set up. Vocational training curricula have improved. \uf0b7 Absence of ethnically disaggregated data hinders the monitoring of the impact of the measures. \uf0b7 Need to simplify procedures to register in the National Employment Service. \uf0b7 Discrimination is persistent. \uf0b7 Vocational training is incoherent with the real market demand and the financial support to participate was stopped in 2019. \uf0b7 Seasonal migration pays off better than local formal jobs. \uf0b7 The implementation of the employment promotion programmes, subsidized from the state budget, has not been effective in terms of Roma and Egyptian employment. According to official data from the National Employment Agency, in 2018 only 239 Roma and Egyptians out of 5,845 Roma and Egyptian registered job seekers were employed. 5 Roma Active Albania, USHTEN, Institute of Romani Culture in Albania (IRCA), Romano Sezi, A place for All, Voice of Roma in Albania, United Roma of Berat, Roma Gate for Integration, Romano Kham, NACRIA, OSF Albania; Roma and Egyptian Youth Movement; Treja Center; Center for Social Action. ",
        "20 \uf0b7 Need to tackle the lack of Roma employed in public administration. For instance by employing Roma mediators by the public administration. \uf0b7 Need to address the gender gap though awareness raising, employment incentives, proximity of pre-school facilities, etc. \uf0b7 Accelerate the approval of secondary laws to implement Law No. 15/2019 \u201cFor promotion programme\u201d. \uf0b7 Allocate necessary resources. According to official data, in 2018 the Ministry responsible for employment requested 730 million Lek (EUR 5.9 million) for employment promotion programmes, but the budget allocated to these programmes was only 490 million Lek (EUR 3.9 million). \uf0b7 Access to finance, notably microcredit, financial literacy and entrepreneurial training is needed to link up with the recently approved self-employment programme. H EALTHCARE \uf0b7 Health centres are present in Roma neighbourhoods, or easy to reach. \uf0b7 Health cards are issued for most of the Roma population. \uf0b7 Immunization and awareness campaigns have been launched in different areas where Roma population live. \uf0b7 Though mentioned as a priority in the National Plan, there is no programme to introduce health mediators. A health mediators programme should be established and piloted with health mediators being trained and recognized as a professional qualification and working closely both with Roma and Egyptian communities and health services. \uf0b7 Limited information on the services and family planning methods. \uf0b7 Based on fieldwork, many Roma families still do not know their family doctor and have never received medical visits to their families. \uf0b7 Certain medical examinations and medicines are not affordable for Roma. \uf0b7 The exclusion criteria introduced in the 2014 amendments to Law 7703 for disability pension limited access of deprived people to their basic rights, in particular Roma and Egyptians. The law should be amended. H OUSING \uf0b7 In May 2018, the Albanian Parliament adopted Law No. 22/2018 \u201cOn Social Housing\u201d, which introduces different renting options, notably renting bonus, social housing and soft loans. It prohibits forced eviction, foresees legal procedures for the information and consultation with citizens affected by public investment projects in infrastructure and introduces the obligation of public authorities to offer effective alternative housing and legal aid to affected citizens. \uf0b7 Funds for improving houses have been channelled from the Ministry of Finance and Economy to the Local governments, aiming to improve the housing conditions for Roma. A positive development consists in the grants provided by the government for housing reconstruction for Roma and Egyptians. \uf0b7 The Parliament adopted Law 43/2015 \"On the Electricity Sector\", which mentions a form of financial aid from the state budget for poor families to guarantee the supply of electricity. In order to implement the law, in 2016 the Council of Ministers should have adopted a decision listing the criteria, the procedures for obtaining the status of client in need and the concrete and actionable steps. Such a decision was not adopted bringing poor families to reconnect illegally to the electricity grid. \uf0b7 Economic difficulties//Living on informal income exclude Roma from accessing the benefits of the Social Housing legislation. \uf0b7 Hidden discrimination by property owners when renting to Roma families who benefit from the renting bonus could be prevented through using intermediary public agencies. \uf0b7 Settlement in distant suburban areas exclude Roma from basic services such as access to water, roads, street lighting, etc. Investments should be encouraged in these areas. \uf0b7 The effectiveness of the new legislation to avoid displacement of families is still to be proven. \uf0b7 Absence of housing plans for Roma and Egyptians by the municipalities. \uf0b7 The Legalization Agency should have one dedicated contact person for Roma and Egyptian families to provide information on legal criteria and the progress of their case. The Agency should take measures to respect legal deadlines with regards ",
        "21 to the processing of houses legalization requests. \uf0b7 Funding for housing programmes remains insufficient taking into consideration the scale of the needs of Roma and Egyptians and the rights given by the new legislation. Municipalities should increase the responses to requests for improvement of housing conditions by Roma and Egyptians. HORIZONTAL MEASURES S TRENGTHS /K EY ELEMENTS OF THE PARTNER APPROACH W EAKNESSES /G APS /R ECOMMENDATIONS A NTI - DISCRIMINATION \uf0b7 Law No. 10 221 of 4.2.2010 \u201cFor Protection from Discrimination\u201d. \uf0b7 There are public institutions such as the State Commissioner for Protection from Discrimination, also with offices at municipal level \uf0b7 There is TV time space for information in the Roma language. \uf0b7 Insufficient understanding, especially at local level, of the antidiscrimination law and relevant enforcement mechanisms. \uf0b7 Insufficient enforcement of the law. \uf0b7 Lack of internal capacities in regularly addressing discrimination cases \uf0b7 Need to amend Law 10 221 of 4 February 2010 \"On Protection From Discrimination\" to address the increased number of cases of hate speech in the last three years. The institutional mechanisms to recognize and sanction hate speech remain mostly ineffective. Based on the annual report by the Commissioner Against Discrimination, there were 43 cases for the period 2017-2018 on grounds of discrimination because of race. Roma and Egyptian community is not well informed about the rights, services or legal routes to provide these services. \uf0b7 Training on avoiding discriminatory language against the Egyptian and Roma minorities within the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Interior for judges, prosecutors, police officers. F IGHTING ANTIGYPSYISM \uf0b7 The Law on National Minorities provides more space for Roma integration and identity expression. This will bring in more financial support for the preservation of culture and identity. \uf0b7 Dialogue with the central and local governments is established and growing: this process enables a necessary space where measures on fighting antigypsyism can be proposed. \uf0b7 Delays in adopting the package of secondary legislation that will enable full implementation of the Law on National Minorities. \uf0b7 Implemented measures mainly relate to law and education. \uf0b7 Lack of recognition of the phenomenon. \uf0b7 Media reports to avoid referring to Roma in negative contexts, which contribute to consolidating persisting stereotypes. \uf0b7 Proportionality in provision of funds related to addressing identity, cultural preservation and integration having regard to the particular needs of Roma. A DDRESSING SPECIFIC NEEDS OF MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS AMONG R OMA \uf0b7 Newly reformed scheme providing economic aid for families in need. \uf0b7 Channels addressing domestic violence and child protection units are operating at municipal level. \uf0b7 Roma have difficulties to access and comprehend information on the economic aid scheme, resulting in a low number of Roma applicants. \uf0b7 Domestic violence is not properly dealt with by the state institutions. Training addressing Roma to be provided. STRUCTURAL MEASURES S TRENGTHS /K EY ELEMENTS OF THE PARTNER APPROACH W EAKNESSES /G APS /R ECOMMENDATIONS S TAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT AT THE CENTRAL LEVEL \uf0b7 Roma CSOs and activists are increasingly involved in open dialogue with the central government. \uf0b7 The national focal point for Roma coordinates an inter-ministerial group. The National Action Plan on Roma and Egyptian Inclusion foresees involvement of several stakeholders. \uf0b7 Government has been more open in terms of official consultation when preparing new legislation or the drafting of sectorial strategies. \uf0b7 Importance to guarantee sustainable support to existing monitoring and participation mechanisms. \uf0b7 Political awareness toward Roma inclusion to be raised further. \uf0b7 Consultation with civil society sector to be structured with the intention to inform the decision-making instead of just fulfilling a legal obligation. ",
        "22 C IVIL PARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERMENT \uf0b7 There is an ongoing process of empowering the Roma civil society and increasing transparency among CSOs. \uf0b7 Monitoring of policies at central and local level is carried out by civil society coalitions. \uf0b7 Involvement of civil actors in drafting local action plans in different municipalities through several projects/measures. \uf0b7 Feedback provided by civil society should be institutionalised and given due consideration by respective decision-making authorities. M AINSTREAMING OF R OMA INCLUSION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL \uf0b7 Local Action plans on Roma inclusion are adopted or in the process in different municipalities in Albania. \uf0b7 The civil registration of Roma children was improved, making it easier for mothers to register them. \uf0b7 Roma sensitive budgeting continues to remain an unresolved issue. Moreover, local governments are often unable to properly channel the funds derived from central government in the respective plans for Roma inclusion. \uf0b7 The transfer of the National Action Plan into local plans should be supported and also fed with dedicated funds for Roma integration by the respective municipalities. \uf0b7 Civil registration to be further improved, following the actual progress. D ATA COLLECTION \uf0b7 There are platforms of data collection for the purpose of monitoring, such as ROMALB. \uf0b7 There are additional data collection systems at municipal level within education, healthcare, economic aid. \uf0b7 Systematic ethnic and desegregated data collection system should be ensured through ROMALB. \uf0b7 Centralised system on social service delivery and civic registration, manageable at municipal level can increase the impact of combined service delivery. F UNDING FOR CIVIL SOCIETY \uf0b7 The main existing central instrument for civil society funding is through the Agency for Support to the Civil Society. \uf0b7 In sporadic cases support from municipalities exist for non-Roma CSO. \uf0b7 More funds could be channelled to Roma CSOs working in capacity building for youth along with service delivery, cultural heritage and identity through line-ministries and other agencies. \uf0b7 Municipalities should regularly issue open calls to the local and central Roma CSOs to mobilize them in implementation of measures foreseen in the Local Action Plans. \uf0b7 Monitoring activities and capacity building of CSO and civil society activists must obtain constant support in providing capacity building for the community members to empower the civil society itself. E XAMPLE OF PROMISING PRACTICE \uf0b7 Capacity building for Roma civil society, e.g. the Roma National Coalition led by Roma Active Albania established in the framework of the project \u201cJoint Initiative to Empower Roma Civil Society in the Western Balkans and Turkey\u201d co-funded by the European Union, and the Roma Integration 2020 Roma network co-funded by the European Union and the Open Society Foundation (OSF). \uf0b7 Promoting positive examples of Roma inclusion policies, recognition and appreciation of work done by respective stakeholders whether in municipalities or among civil society organizations and even individual activists, e.g. Most Roma Friendly Mayor, best projects for Roma integration, distinguished Roma women, etc. \uf0b7 Setting up a feedback-response mechanism at local and central levels that would provide due consideration to recommendations provided by Roma civil society with regard to improving the implementation of the Roma Integration Strategy and respective local plans. \uf0b7 The OSF for Albania is funding a project consisting in the creation of a new market where 100 Roma and Egyptian traders will be supported. The Municipality of Tirana has provided the infrastructure site while the OSF will invest in the physical construction of the market, provide support with the goods to be sold and assist with the registration of the businesses at the National Business Centre. The market will provide space for Roma merchants to exercise their activities, conditioned by children going to school and at least one family member following vocational training to transit to the formal labour market. M OST IMPORTANT PRIORITIES TO BE ADDRESSED 1. The most important priorities are in the field of housing and employment, followed by education and healthcare. Improvement of housing and employment can positively affect the fields of antidiscrimination and fighting antigypsyism. Furthermore, civil participation and empowerment can further contribute to the mainstreaming of Roma inclusion and help the overall integration process. 2. Capacity building for Roma civil society should be upgraded and continued in order to maintain and improve a more vibrant and principled civil society in the country. 3. ROMALB system to be upgraded with regard to availability and collectability of data, while better synchronizing it with other mainstream area-specific databases. ",
        "23 BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA Summary based on NRCP report - 2017 Roma integration measures G ENERAL INFORMATION Institution acting as NRCP The Assistant Minister in the Ministry of Human Rights and Refugees (MHRR). Strategic document Bosnia and Herzegovina has a Strategy on Integration of Roma, which is in force since 2005 with unlimited duration, a Roma Integration Action Plan for Addressing Roma Issues in the Fields of Employment, Housing and Health Care 2017-2020 implemented since 2017, and a Framework Action Plan on Educational Needs of Roma 2018-2022 implemented since 2018. Roma population (Council of Europe average estimation, updated in July 2012) 58.000 (1.54% of 3,760,149). Available options for data collection Questions on ethnic self-identification included in the population census; two Regional Roma Surveys (2011 and 2017 6 ) implemented by the UNDP and World Bank; UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster household Surveys 7 (Roma settlements MICS5 2011-12, MICS6 2019 (pending)); Roma Inclusion Index 2015; Annual Monitoring Report on the Implementation of the Roma Integration Policy in Bosnia and Herzegovina (2017, 2018); territorial mapping 2019 (pending). S UMMARY OF THE REPORTING YEAR The complex institutional structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina requires close coordination among all levels of authorities (state, entities, cantons and municipalities) for the implementation of the 2005 Roma Strategy and its action plans. In 2018, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Council of Ministers adopted a new action plan on the educational needs of the Roma. Although Bosnia and Herzegovina has been quite successful in providing access to housing to a substantial number of persons, the need remains big. Compared with 2011, Bosnia and Herzegovina improved access to compulsory education for ages 7-15, access to public electricity and waste collection infrastructure as well as access to documentation, and reduced informal employment, self-reported unmet need for medical care and overcrowding. Overall, by 2017, Bosnia and Herzegovina demonstrated a general trend across the five key priority areas towards not worsening the gap between Roma and non-Roma compared to 2011. In 2017 and 2018, the Ministry allocated around EUR 1 million per year for the implementation of Roma actions plans. The main achievements The EUR 2.5 million Roma Action II Project, which was finalized in October 2018, provided concrete support to 140 families in 9 municipalities across Bosnia and Herzegovina. They moved into reconstructed homes (72) or newly constructed social housing units (68). In general, more than 2,400 Roma individuals directly benefited from this project. The Action Plan on the Education Needs for Roma (2018-2022) was adopted in September 2018, and an IPA supported mapping of Roma needs is being considered. The main challenges The lack of ethnically and gender disaggregated data measuring policy impact that will help to assess the effectiveness of national policies and clarifying to which extent the Roma population benefits from mainstream policies. The existing unharmonised system of monitoring and reporting, including of budget spending, of MHRR does not reflect the real situation of human rights of the Roma population in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is no systematic, coherent and coordinated approach in comprehensively addressing the problem of discrimination among the main coordinating institutions (MHRR, Ombudsman and Gender Equality Agency (GEA)). The cooperation between those three institutions should be further supported in order to enhance communication and ensure complementarity of future actions, including communication with lower levels of government. For that reason, there is a need for coordinated action to support the effective protection of human rights and anti-discrimination, in particular towards the most vulnerable and marginalized groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a specific attention given to a tailored approach, especially at municipal level. Thorough coordination of this kind of action at all government levels is crucial for success; here the role of civil society organisations cannot be overestimated. Social exclusion of all vulnerable groups need to be tackled through better policy implementation. Establishment of robust mechanisms for monitoring, reporting and evaluation of social inclusion of vulnerable categories would enable the evaluation of the effect of social inclusion policies from a participatory perspective and proposing actions and priorities to improve access to human rights. T HEMATIC A REAS The 2017-2020 Roma Action Plan, together with the Action Plan on Educational Needs of Roma 2018-2022, identifies five strategic goals for the period. In 2017, the following actions have been taken under the respective specific objectives: 1) education, 2) employment, 3) health care, 4) housing in addition to a fifth on institutional capacities, which is partially analysed under governance and cooperation below. A total of 12 objectives and 31 measures were reported on. Hereof, 13 were implemented, three were partially implemented and 16 were not implemented. All objectives were mainstream, with partially targeted measures, and a public authority at government level implemented them. 6 https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eca/publication/breaking-cycle-of-roma-exclusion-in-western-balkans 7 http://mics.unicef.org/surveys ",
        "24 EDUCATION In 2018, Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted a new Action Plan on Educational Needs of Roma 2018-2022. Most education measures in the Revised Action Plan of Bosnia and Herzegovina on educational needs of Roma 2010-2016 expired in 2014. Out of the eight measures planned, four were implemented or partially implemented and four not implemented. For the reporting year 2017, three objectives were identified and reported on: 1) Ensure that Roma children are included into the system of mandatory elementary education, 2) Encourage Roma population to continue high school and university education and 3) Preservation and promotion of Roma language, culture and history. The operational objectives were implemented through six measures. Hereof, four were fully or continuously implemented and two were not implemented. The measures reached a reported 1,332 Roma beneficiaries, which is lower than the 2016 figure of 1,966. There is no information on the total beneficiaries eligible for the education measures. The most important success Compared with 2011, 6% more Roma youth (ages 22-25) completed secondary education (15% vs. 21%, respectively). However, as the completion rates for non-Roma youth rose from 84% to 86%, it is clear that much needs to be done. The most important challenges 12% of Roma children attend majority Roma schools compared with 5% non-Roma children. This may be due to the design of school districts as well as the global segregated structure of school offers by ethnicity. Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have official information about the number of Roma children enrolled in education. The 2017 Regional Roma Survey shows that Bosnia and Herzegovina has the lowest pre- primary enrolment rate in the region for both Roma (3%) and non-Roma (2%) children. This indicates that associated school fees may affect Roma and non-Roma alike. This represents a 50% drop in the enrolment rate since 2011 (6%). The lack of pre-primary education for 97% of Roma children is further reflected by the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina has the third-lowest completion rate (42%) in compulsory education for Roma children in the region. In 2011, the figure was 44%, i.e. this completion rate has not decreased as much as for enrolment into pre- primary education. The regional average in 2017 was 53%. This figure becomes especially relevant when comparing with the completion rate of non-Roma children of 94% in compulsory education. This represents a gap of 52%. A similar gap is evidenced for secondary and tertiary education, where 21% (86%) and 0% (21%), respectively, of Roma and non-Roma youth completed their education in 2017. EMPLOYMENT For 2017, two objectives were identified and reported on: 1) Improve employment and employability of Roma and 2) Programme for education, additional qualification/change of qualifications of Roma registered at the Employment Service offices. The operational objectives were implemented through eight measures. Hereof, one was fully implemented, one was partially implemented and six were not implemented. The measures reached a reported 132 Roma beneficiaries (33 women). There is no information on the total beneficiaries eligible for the measures. The budget for employment remains the same from year to year while the policy effect and the number of employed Roma continues to increase (103 persons were employed in 2016). The government clarified that this is due to low interest in participating in employment programmes. Consequently, funds from previous years are being utilized later than planned, leading to increased employment in the following years. The MHRR and the Roma Board have recognized that the current approach in employment does not yield results and are in the process of defining a new approach to employment of Roma. The most important success The informal employment rate for Roma in Bosnia and Herzegovina decreased from 80% in 2011 to 61% in 2017. This corresponds to the regional average. This, however, still represents a gap compared with non-Roma of 47% in 2017. The most important challenge The labour market situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina for Roma is the most precarious in the region. The registered labour force participation rate was 25% for Roma (regional: 31.17%), compared with 40% for non-Roma (regional: 42%). Only 11% of the Roma population has employment compared to 29% of non-Roma. The regional employment rate is 16.8% for Roma and 32.7% for non-Roma, respectively. Correspondingly, the rate of registered unemployed Roma was 56% in 2017 compared with a regional figure of 44.7% for Roma and 23.17% for non-Roma. This represents a stagnant development since 2011 where the corresponding unemployment rate for Roma was also 56%, while 7% more Roma labour market actives were employed in 2011 (18%). Concerning Roma youth, the figures are equally serious. As many as 82%, the highest rate in the region, of young are not in employment, education or training (NEET). The corresponding non-Roma rate is 43%. The low completion rates, and corresponding high dropout rates of Roma children enrolled in compulsory education, is a serious challenge. This significantly reduces their life-long expectations for a better life, their possibility for acquiring human capital and productive assets as well as impairs their use and returns of assets. HEALTHCARE For 2017, four objectives were identified and reported on: 1) Roma health mediators, 2) Ensuring access to health care through insurance in Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 3) Preventive health care and 4) Health education and information. The operational objectives were implemented through nine measures. Hereof, five were fully or continuously implemented, two were partially implemented and two were not implemented. The measures reached a reported 2,376 Roma beneficiaries (1,569 women). There is no information on the total beneficiaries eligible for the measures. The most important success Compared with 2011, access to health care insurance improved slightly by 2017 (coverage increased from 70% to 73%). The improved coverage consequently reduced the rate of unmet need for medical care from 39% to 33%, and increased the use of preventive health care services from 46% to 49%. Workshops on general health, infectious diseases and addictive diseases were held by Roma CSOs. Preventive examinations for breast and uterine cancer were provided to Roma women. Planned activities, such as education on general health, reproductive health, how to exercise ",
        "25 health care rights etc., were partially implemented. The most important challenge Although Bosnia and Herzegovina has a compulsory health insurance scheme, coverage is restricted to a number of specific types of beneficiaries, and in some cases health institutions are not able to increase the number of beneficiaries due to limited funds. In 2017, this effectively excluded 27% of Roma from accessing the scheme, with high out-of-pocket payments for health services or inability to cover for the retroactive refund of health insurance expenditures as a result. As few as 6% non-Roma faced the same problems. The regional average of health insurance coverage was 62.7% for Roma and 73.5% for non-Roma. This correlates well with a reported 33% unmet need for medical care by Roma (15% for non-Roma), and the second-lowest use of preventive health care services in 2017 of 49% for Roma compared to as much as 66% for non-Roma. A further challenge for Bosnia and Herzegovina is that the Roma inclusion activities that the country authorities seek to implement, cannot be implemented at all levels of government nor throughout the country unless the respective entities decide to ensure the citizens residing there the same rights and possibilities. Roma CSO would like to be better included in consultation processes. HOUSING For 2017, three objectives were identified and reported on: 1) Legalization of housing units in informal Roma settlements, 2) Construction of social housing units for Roma (individual and/or collective) and 3) Improve housing conditions in Roma housing units. The operational objectives were implemented through eight measures. Hereof, three were fully or continuously implemented and six were not. The measures reached a reported 1,850 Roma beneficiaries (980 women). There is no information on the total beneficiaries eligible for the measures. The most important success Bosnia and Herzegovina has for some time been very active on securing access to housing for Roma. By 2018, more than 1,000 housing units were allocated to Roma. Further, infrastructure projects for improving living conditions in Roma settlements and reconstruction of housing owned by Roma were implemented in 2017. While Bosnia and Herzegovina has a very good record of accomplishment in housing, much of the funding comes from EU and other international donors. The most important challenge It is estimated that a minimum of +2,500 housing units is needed to meet the current need. While the MHRR is active in implementing the housing policy, they do not have the mandate nor the human capacity to oversee housing projects. This leads to long delays in implementation and the risk of criminal offences, such as non-implementation based on structural antigypsyism. During the implementation process, end- beneficiaries cannot become reallocated to other beneficiary schemes, which de facto leaves them homeless until the access to housing is finally secured. Since 2011, 7% more Roma have access to electricity (83% to 90%) compared to 98% of non-Roma. 87% of Roma maintain access to piped water (no development), while 96% of non-Roma have access to piped water. 2% fewer Roma have connection to waste installations (70% down to 68%) compared to 80% (down from 90%) of non-Roma. This fall would indicate a general trend in society as regards reduced access to waste infrastructure. 6% fewer Roma do not have access to waste collection (down from 25% to 19%) as compared to 7% non-Roma (down from 26%) who do not have access to waste collection. The biggest gap recorded between Roma and non-Roma concerns overcrowding: 65% (down from 74% in 2011) of Roma have access to 0.7 (up from 0.6) rooms per household member, compared to 21% (down from 30%) non- Roma who have access to 1.3 (up from 1.1) rooms per household member. G OVERNANCE AND COOPERATION Human resources for the NRCP The NRCP is supported by one Expert Advisor in the Department for the protection of rights and cooperation with national and other minorities, religious communities and NGOs. The NRCP/MHRR has the potential to lead Roma integration, but needs continuous assistance and support from within the MHRR, from the Roma Board and from the Roma communities. The MHRR has access to funding and legitimacy for fundraising. The MHRR needs further assistance in the field of monitoring (i.e. setting targets and measuring impact), specific project development process (i.e. each measure represents a programme that needs to be further elaborated into an operational plan and may require additional funding), budgeting of policies, and donor coordination (fund raising and lobbying). The MHRR does not have mandate to perform its role in the field of education, as the policy area is not under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, increased support from the Ministry of Civil Affairs (responsible for education at the federal level) is required to ensure successful implementation of the Framework Action Plan and to serve as a link between the MHRR (performing coordination) and the entities. Cross-sectorial coordination The institutional set-up for Roma integration in Bosnia and Herzegovina is designed in such way that it includes relevant ministries, institutions and Roma representatives at all levels of government. The Roma Board, the inter-ministerial body, has 22 members 11 of whom are Roma. The Roma Board is designed to lead the Roma integration process considering the complex administrative structures and multi-layered decision-making processes in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The structure allows Bosnia and Herzegovina to plan activities targeting the Roma population and distribute funds to all levels of the government and institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Board could benefit from capacity building as regards knowledge and/or capacities for planning, implementing and monitoring the process. Were the MHRR to invite to a workshop, during which the methodology of planning, implementation and reporting is explained, possible misunderstandings as to results achieved through government efforts could be avoided that otherwise may lead to loss of trust by the Roma community. The NRCP: \u2022 is consulted and does participate in the development of policies. ",
        "26 \u2022 participates in decision making processes regarding funding of relevant policies. \u2022 participates in decision making processes regarding the implementation of relevant policies. Examples of participation include co-chairing the bi-annual Roma Seminars, representation in EU fora and policy workshops, participation in the meetings of the Coordination Body for Monitoring the Implementation of the Roma Strategy, national Roma platform meetings etc. The key dialogue platforms among relevant stakeholders are the two-yearly Roma Seminars and the annual National Roma Platforms. Stakeholders involved in the monitoring and evaluation of the Roma Strategy: \u2022 The inter-disciplinary body (Roma Board). \u2022 Representatives of entity governments and other ministries. \u2022 Country authorities at all levels of government. \u2022 Some local authorities also provide data annually. \u2022 The Roma communities. CSOs provide shadow-reports. Dialogue/cooperation has been established between the Ombudsman/equality body and the NRCP: ad-hoc contacts. There is to some extent baseline information against which progress for the implementation of the Roma Strategy can be assessed. This information is contained in the Roma Integration Action Plan for Addressing Roma Issues in the Fields of Employment, Housing and Health Care 2017-2020, albeit without source references. There are some measurable targets in the Roma Integration Action Plan for 2017-2020. The monitoring report covers the implementation of the Revised Action Plan of Bosnia and Herzegovina on educational needs of Roma 2010-2016 and the Revised Action Plan for Addressing Roma Issues in the Fields of Employment, Housing and Health Care 2017-2020, but not the Revised Action Plan of Bosnia and Herzegovina for addressing Roma issues in the field of employment, housing and health care 2013-2016 or the Framework Action Plan on Educational Needs of Roma 2018-2022.

        "27 BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA Assessment based on civil society country reports 8 SUBSTANTIVE POLICY AREAS S TRENGTHS /K EY ELEMENTS OF THE PARTNER APPROACH W EAKNESSES /G APS /R ECOMMENDATIONS E DUCATION \uf0b7 In 2017, after broad consultation, the state authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina approved a Platform for the Development of pre-school and education (2017-2022) and in September 2018 a Framework Action Plan (AP) for Educational Needs of the Roma 2018-2022 was adopted. \uf0b7 The AP recognises and defines the need for increased Roma education, and puts focus on Roma identity, history, culture and language - preconditions for preservation of Roma identity and a way to inform the general population of the Roma culture, increase understanding and combat discrimination. \uf0b7 The complex legal framework and governmental organisation will only make the Framework AP for Educational Needs of the Roma operational after each Entity AP on Education has been adopted. Therefore, the recognition of Roma educational needs and support to Roma education by the Bosnia and Herzegovina educational systems is delayed. \uf0b7 NGOs initiated the adoption of the AP on Education in Republika Srpska, but this initiative was stopped by the decision by the government of the Republika Srpska entity not to cooperate with civil society organisations. \uf0b7 Each of the levels of government in Bosnia and Herzegovina should take ownership of Roma integration obligations. All levels of government should develop and adopt Local Action Plans (LAPs) with allocated budgets. Current and future LAPs/Roma Action Plans (RAPs) to be harmonized with the principles laid out in the Framework AP on Education and implementation ensured. \uf0b7 The national legislation on compulsory pre-school education has not been harmonized across the country. \uf0b7 Approx. 5% Roma children attend compulsory pre- school education; promotion of the importance of pre- school education is needed. Enrolment of Roma children is for the time being enabled only through project interventions by NGOs. \uf0b7 The Ministry for Human Rights and Refugees (MHRR) has no competency over Roma education policies, which requires a stronger financial engagement by the responsible ministries and authorities. \uf0b7 Founders of pre-school institutions (municipalities or ministries of education) do not allocate funds to (co)finance the enrolment of children from socially disadvantaged families into pre-school institutions/ kindergartens, as requested by the Law on Social Protection. E MPLOYMENT \uf0b7 AP adopted, including employment measures 2017-2020. \uf0b7 The Ministry for Human Rights and Refugees (MHRR) supports programmes for encouraging Roma employment in co-operation with the Entity Employment Bureau. \uf0b7 Employment programmes to be linked with affirmative measures for additional education for Roma. \uf0b7 Improved criteria for employment needed. \uf0b7 Employers should be able to prolong programmes if positively evaluated by employees. \uf0b7 Improved planning with needs assessment and gap analyses would contribute to mainstream Roma needs into general policies. \uf0b7 Dialogue about priorities between different measures 8 The Citizens\u2019 Association for the Promotion of Roma Education \u201cOtaharin\u201d, \u201cBolja budu\u0107nost\u201d Tuzla, \u201cNova Generacija\u201d Banja Luka, \u201cRomkinja\u201d Bijeljina, \u201c Zemlja djece in BiH\u201d Tuzla, \u201cRomani \u0106ej\u201d Prnjavor, \u201cCentre for Mothers \u2013 Nada\u201dKakanj, \u201cSensus\u201d Mostar, \u201c\u017divot Roma\u201d Sarajevo, \u201cBudi mi prijatelj\u201d Visoko, Kali Sara \u2013 Roma information centre (KS RIC).

H EALTHCARE \uf0b7 Action plan (2017-2020) adopted, including health measures for solving Roma issues. \uf0b7 The amended law on compulsory health care for ages +65 covers Roma. \uf0b7 Roma registered as unemployed also have right to health care. \uf0b7 2018 Roma Seminar operational conclusions to be implemented. \uf0b7 Specific measures should be proposed to ensure mainstreaming of Roma needs into existing sector policies, e.g. through research into ineligibility and barriers to access health care for children under 15 years. \uf0b7 Relevant ministries and institutes to develop annual health checks of the population and use the findings to suggest different vertical programmes for prevention and early detection in the most vulnerable population (women, children, persons over 65 years of age, smokers, pollution related conditions etc.). This would contribute to full mainstreaming of Roma needs. It will also especially benefit Roma, as some conditions affect them more due to poor nutrition, inferior housing conditions and various other indicators that are directly linked with difficult socio-economic conditions. \uf0b7 Mapping of needs and data collection is essential. Authorities to introduce new ways of looking at the health of the population and find ways to invest in prevention and education. \uf0b7 All levels of government to enable access to health care. \uf0b7 Roma Action Plan measures to be financed. \uf0b7 Systematic prevention of health risks among Roma to be undertaken in partnership with civil society organisations. \uf0b7 Health care for Roma returned trough readmission to be solved systematically. H OUSING \uf0b7 Action Plan (2017-2020) in place, including housing measures for solving Roma issues. \uf0b7 The MHRR supports the programmes in partnership with civil society. \uf0b7 Local governments implement the housing programme focused on the most vulnerable members of the Roma communities. \uf0b7 Housing to be included in a holistic and multi-faceted policy intervention that, through synergy with other measures, achieves the goal set forth by the Roma integration policy. \uf0b7 To improve the upcoming Spatial Planning of Roma Settlements with respect to Roma culture of living. \uf0b7 Donor community to be consulted pooling resources to start implementing AP measures, especially measure M1.1 \u201cMapping of illegal Roma settlements and illegally built individual housing units and determining the condition of the space\u201d and M1.2 \u201cDeveloping programming plans for legalization or relocation of Roma housing settlements in the local communities\u201d.

This prevents even persons who know their rights from entering into legal proceedings. \uf0b7 Introduction of Roma history and culture in the general education curriculum. F IGHTING ANTIGYPSYISM \uf0b7 The Anti-Discrimination Law, forbids discrimination based on e.g. ethnic origin. \uf0b7 The Ombudsman institution has published a special report on the situation of the Roma in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \uf0b7 To address antigypsyism at all levels and recognise its devastating impact on society. \uf0b7 To adapt legal framework for fighting antigypsyism and provide affirmative measures that will facilitate Roma women and men access to rights. \uf0b7 Increased focus on combatting latent discrimination caused by antigypsyism and public information campaigns to inform potential victims about their legal rights and the mechanisms of defence against discrimination.

C IVIL PARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERMENT \uf0b7 A civil society sector of about 100 Roma NGOs is very active in follow-up of the Roma issues and advocacy for improvement of the Roma position and access to rights. \uf0b7 Roma and pro-Roma civil society organisations improve capacities through various programmes and trainings. \uf0b7 Roma are involved in the development of the AP and in the monitoring of its implementation. \uf0b7 Pro-Roma organizations are exposed to pressures and discrimination, e.g. their legitimacy to work on issues related to Roma is disputed. M AINSTREAMING OF R OMA INCLUSION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL \uf0b7 22 local communities have Local Action Plans for inclusion of Roma. \uf0b7 The LAPs seldom contain an integrated gender component or provisions to address the specific needs of the most vulnerable groups among Roma (women, migrants, etc.). \uf0b7 Need to design interventions that contribute to the implementation of the SDGs (SDG5 Gender equality; SDG10 Reduced Inequalities: SDG16 Peace, Justice and strong Institutions). \uf0b7 Importance of increasing mainstreaming of Roma issues also at local level. \uf0b7 AP to be properly budgeted. Roma-responsive budgeting and planning will become a key issue in the upcoming period. \uf0b7 Municipalities to use the same methodology for developing LAPs (format, tables etc.) as at central level and to cover all areas of concern: education, health care, housing, employment, combating discrimination and preservation of Roma history, language and culture. D ATA COLLECTION \uf0b7 MHRR country approach for data collection and mapping of Roma needs in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \uf0b7 A system for collection of Roma-relevant data needs to be further developed. \uf0b7 Better data collection is required, in cooperation between all responsible authorities, to ensure access to reliable, annual, disaggregated financial and non- financial data for Roma. \uf0b7 Monitoring and reporting to be improved through unified annual reports for each policy area with financial and nonfinancial data (to be reported annually by the participants in each policy area at all levels of government who are different legal subjects). The report should list financial data about unspent assets by previous and current years - especially for housing and employment. F UNDING FOR CIVIL SOCIETY \uf0b7 Grants at different levels: MHRR grants for national minority, entity level ministry grants for education, municipality grants. \uf0b7 Grants with very specific goals within which it is possible to realize small projects for the amount of up to 10,000 BAM. \uf0b7 International organizations support with projects/ programmes. \uf0b7 Most of the funds invested in Roma integration are provided by international donors. \uf0b7 Local communities and MHRR provide funds that are insufficient for the needs detected in Roma communities. Entities and cantons should allocate appropriate funds also. ",
        "31 E XAMPLE OF PROMISING PRACTICE \uf0b7 Thanks to EU support, a total of 140 Roma families (652 persons of which 320 children) in nine municipalities of Bosnia and Herzegovina moved into new or rebuilt social housing units, and improved their social and economic conditions. State and local authorities were supported in preparing action plans for the social inclusion of the Roma population. M OST IMPORTANT PRIORITIES TO BE ADDRESSED 1. Entity Action Plans for Educational Needs of the Roma must be adopted to allow the Framework AP for Educational Needs of the Roma to be operational and improve Roma access to education. 2. The potential of the implementation of the SDGs (especially SDG5 Gender equality; SDG10 Reduced Inequalities; and SDG16 Peace, Justice and strong Institutions) should be used for mainstreaming of the Roma issues in all relevant policies and action plans. 3. Fight against antigypsyism as major concept for improvement of the position and inclusion of Roma must be recognised, defined and fostered in Bosnia and Herzegovina at all levels of government. ",
        "32 KOSOVO (Ashkali are included under the umbrella term Roma) Summary based on NRCP report - 2017 Roma integration measures G ENERAL INFORMATION Institution acting as NRCP The Office for Good Governance in the Office of the Prime Minister. Strategic document Kosovo has a Strategy and an Action Plan for inclusion of Roma and Ashkali communities in the Kosovo society 2017-2021. The previous Roma integration strategy covered also the Egyptian community. Roma population (Council of Europe average estimation, updated in July 2012) 37,500 (2.07% of 1.815.000). Available options for data collection Questions on ethnic self-identification included in the population census, 2017 Regional Roma Survey 9 ,10 implemented by the UNDP and World Bank; UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster household Surveys 11 (Roma settlements MICS5 2013-14, MICS6 2019 (pending)); Annual Monitoring Report on the Implementation of the Roma Integration Policy in Kosovo (2017, 2018). S UMMARY OF THE REPORTING YEAR The main achievements According to the 2017 Regional Roma Survey, in terms of inequality between Roma and their non-Roma neighbours, Kosovo shows the smallest gaps in the region. The main challenges Roma continue to suffer from marginalisation and discrimination, with women particularly affected. The poverty levels affecting these communities remain high compared to other communities in Kosovo. The general lack of ethnically and gender disaggregated data forms a major obstacle for assessing the effectiveness of the Strategy and Action Plan and its implementation. This problem is exacerbated by the absence of effective monitoring tools and the informal consultation methodology of the inter-disciplinary monitoring body. The 2017 report of the Kosovo government on the implementation of the Strategy and Action Plan does not provide values for the indicators. Kosovo did not implement an IPA project targeting Roma integration specifically. T HEMATIC A REAS In 2017, four thematic areas were reported as relevant for the implementation of the Roma Strategy: 1) education, 2) employment and social welfare, 3) health care and 4) housing. A fifth thematic area, social protection, is not reported on in this report. A total of 10 objectives and 53 measures were reported on. Hereof, 15 were implemented, 15 were partially implemented and 23 were not implemented. All objectives were mainstreamed with partly targeted measures. EDUCATION In 2017, there were three specific objectives in the area of education: 1) To improve participation in education, 2) to improve students\u2019 performance and 3) to increase awareness to support Roma and Ashkali education. 15 education measures were foreseen. Hereof, six were fully or continuously implemented, four were partially implemented and five were not implemented in 2017. The most important success The enrolment rate at all levels has been increasing, although it is still significantly below the national average and many young Roma and Ashkali do not reach higher levels of education. Inequality in education is below the regional average. The most important challenge While 73% of Roma children (compared with 92% of non-Roma) were enrolled in compulsory education, the compulsory education completion rate for ages 18-21 is only 62% compared with 95% for non-Roma. For secondary and tertiary education, the completion rates fall to 21% (77%) and 3% (24%), respectively. Roma girls have less access to education at all levels than both Roma boys and non-Roma boys and girls. In upper-secondary education there is significant gender gap in favour of Roma boys of 12%. On gender equality in education Kosovo ranks among the lowest in the region. The existing mechanisms for reintegration into education and adult education are difficult to access for Roma that dropped out and those not able to provide certificates for education attended abroad. Discrimination in education should be addressed. EMPLOYMENT In 2017, there were two specific objectives in the area of employment and social welfare: 1) to improve the level of employment and 2) to improve participation in the social welfare schemes and better access to social services. 14 and 12 mainstream measures, respectively, were foreseen. As elsewhere in this Annex to the Staff Working Document to the 2019 Communication on Roma integration, due to the focus on the four key priorities in the EU Roma Framework for the EU Member States, the measures regarding social welfare are not reported on in this 9 https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eca/publication/breaking-cycle-of-roma-exclusion-in-western-balkans 10 Kosovo was only included in the 2017 survey wherefore no comparison between 2011 and 2017 data is possible. 11 http://mics.unicef.org/surveys ",
        "33 document covering the enlargement region. Of the 14 employment measures, three were implemented, three partially implemented, while eight remained unimplemented in 2017. The most important success In a regional perspective, Kosovo\u2019s NEETs rate (youth between 15-24 not in employment, education, or training) of 69% lies below the regional average of 72.3%. With a 30% NEETs gap ratio to non-Roma, the NEETs rate indicates that the ethnic gap is less pronounced than in the region (37.2% gap), except for Serbia (29%). The most important challenge The overall figures show that labour market participation of 13% in general is lower than the regional average for both Roma and non-Roma, with even lower figures for Roma women (4%). With 70%, informal employment is the highest in the region. The registered unemployment rates for Roma and their non-Roma neighbours in 2017 were 48% and 32%, respectively. The 33% gender gap in labour force participation among Roma is the largest in region. The annual monitoring report by the government for 2017 did not allow an assessment of the achievements, as values for the indicators for 2017 were not provided. None of the planned Roma-targeted measures in the Action Plan were implemented in 2017. HEALTHCARE In 2017, there were three specific objectives regarding health: 1) to improve access to health services, 2) to improve health routines and practices and 3) to provide a healthy environment. Of the 12 measures, four were implemented, three were partially implemented, and five were not implemented in 2017. The most important success Kosovo has the lowest health insurance coverage in the region for both Roma and non-Roma, but scores above average on other health indicators. This indicates that low health insurance coverage does not appear to be hindering Roma from obtaining access to services comparable with the services available to Roma in countries with higher health insurance coverage and their non-Roma neighbours. The gap towards non-Roma is the lowest in the region. Both Roma and non-Roma report comparable levels of self-perceived health (68% and 76%), health insurance coverage (10% and 12%) and self-reported unmet need for medical care (26% and 23%). Three of the implemented measures under the objective of access of Roma to health services covered: breast cancer and mammography screenings (102 female beneficiaries), home visits to mothers and children by mobile teams (1,950 beneficiaries), and purchase of medical equipment for a health facility near a Roma settlement (7,224 potential beneficiaries). The most important challenge The above figures of reported equality in access to health services are largely due to the fact that Kosovo does not provide universal health insurance, although authorities inform that all persons are entitled to public health services. The annual monitoring report from the government did not provide values for 2017 for the indicators, thus the assessment on the achievement of the strategic goal is not possible. The 2017 Regional Roma Survey reports that only 10% Roma (same for females) have health insurance, but the rate is as low for non-Roma as well. HOUSING In 2017, there were three specific objectives regarding housing: 1) to identify needs for adequate housing and social housing, 2) to increase awareness about active participation in solving housing issues and 3) to progress significantly towards settlement of the housing problem. Of the 12 measures, two were implemented, five were partially implemented and five were not implemented in 2017. The most important success Kosovo\u2019s coverage in housing lies above the average across the region. Kosovo has relatively high access to piped water inside dwellings and connections to public sewerage or wastewater tanks. The share of Roma who report that waste is never collected is also lower than the regional average. 771 Roma families have been identified as families living in inadequate housing conditions, from the 12,337 identified. The most important challenge Kosovo has a greater overcrowding rate (71%) than the regional average (67.7%). This is mostly because of larger households. Compared to non-Roma neighbours, a lower number of Roma households has connection to water (84% vs. 97%), sewerage (75% vs. 91%) and electricity (89% vs. 97%). A three-year housing programme has been developed with a budget of 90,000 EUR. However, as it is not Roma-specific it is unclear why the budget is reported as spent for Roma. Legalisation of informal settlements and identification of properties for constructing social housing remains to be implemented. G OVERNANCE AND COOPERATION Human resources for the NRCP The Director of the Office for Good Governance within the Prime Minister\u2019s Office is charged with the coordination of the implementation of the Roma Strategy and Action Plan that is adopted by the government. The Roma portfolio is only one of the numerous tasks of the NRCP, which limits the capacities of the NRCP to perform this role. There is only one staff in the Office of Good Governance supporting the NRCP in his Roma related tasks (a Senior Officer on Equality and Communities). Cross-sectorial coordination The NRCP is chair of an informal inter-disciplinary body consisting of a number of Contact Points in some of the institutions central to Roma integration. Although there are no formal coordination mechanisms or meetings, the body coordinates the strategy\u2019s implementation. The NRCP further consults with civil society through thematic Working Groups whose members are representatives from relevant institutions and civil society. ",
        "34 Local municipalities are tasked to appoint a Contact Point who is responsible for establishing a Municipal Action Committee (MAC). In 2017, such MACs were yet to be established in most municipalities due to local elections. Examples of participation include co-chairing the bi-annual Roma Seminars, representation in EU fora and policy workshops, participation in the meetings of the informal inter-disciplinary body, national Roma platform meetings etc. The key dialogue platforms among relevant stakeholders are the two-yearly Roma Seminars and the annual National Roma Platforms. Relevant stakeholders \u2022 National authorities (line-ministries, agencies, municipal offices, public health institutes, schools etc.). \u2022 The informal Inter-Institutional Steering Committee, \u2022 The thematic Working Groups, \u2022 Some regional and local authorities also provide data annually. \u2022 Roma and pro-Roma NGOs.

There is a baseline against which progress for the implementation of the Kosovo Strategy for inclusion of Roma and Ashkali communities in the Kosovo society 2017-2021 and its Action Plan 2017-2021 could be assessed. There are target indicators for some of the overall objectives. No such information is provided for the specific activities/results in the Action Plan. Baseline source references are provided. Policy measures may contain non-measurable target information without source references. The current Action Plan has overall objectives focussing on: 1) education, 2) employment and social welfare, 3) health, and 4) housing. Some of the specific activities/results are budgeted, while most are not. No gender disaggregated information is provided. The 2017 report by the government does not provide values for the indicators. It is therefore impossible to assess in how far the situation has improved in comparison to the baseline.

This promise remains to be realized. \uf0b7 The legalization process is slow. Partly due to the low number of applications especially from the Roma and Ashkali community. \uf0b7 Large households living in small spaces continues to be a concern in settlements.

It affects in particular the denial of their rights within society. \uf0b7 Discrimination precedes racism, and as such, a complete change of state on the awareness of the historical and cultural elements of this community is needed. F IGHTING ANTIGYPSYISM \uf0b7 The government supports Roma day on 8 April. \uf0b7 The KOSINT programme aims to foster ideas that combat antigypsyism. \uf0b7 Antigypsyism remains an unknown terminology and phenomena for the institutions. \uf0b7 Lack of understanding and recognition of antigypsyism and hate speech by the authorities in the judiciary. \uf0b7 Antigypsyism is a social problem that is mainly manifested by community members being labelled with distracting names that produce stigmatization and prejudice in society. As such it is exceedingly difficult to combat as it also produces Roma self- denial in society. A DDRESSING SPECIFIC NEEDS OF MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS AMONG R OMA \uf0b7 Regional and national projects supported by different donors contributes to the improvement of living conditions for Roma and Ashkali. They further create a healthy Roma civil society who acts as watchdog, promotes transparency and accountability and holds institutions accountable towards the Roma community. \uf0b7 Addressing the needs of community members is at a stage where technological systems provide increased opportunities for meeting their needs while at the same time raising awareness about the work of the specific institutional mechanisms that manage their submissions. \uf0b7 No measures have been adopted to address (explicitly) Roma LGBTI issues or the difficulties faced by Roma women. \uf0b7 Part of the community, due to lack of education, have problems with submitting administrative requests.

        "37 \uf0b7 The National Strategy for inclusion of Roma and Ashkali in Kosovo Society 2017-2021 foresees in its implementation the involvement of municipalities, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Ministry of Communities and Return, Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning. \uf0b7 Authorities seek to involve different stakeholders. \uf0b7 Public authorities at central and local levels employ a number of Roma community members. \uf0b7 Lack of budget allocated from public institutions for the implementation of the strategy remains a concern. \uf0b7 Involvement of stakeholders at central level was influenced by the lack of a greater dynamic of socio- political engagement. C IVIL PARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERMENT \uf0b7 Civil society is involved in the creation of new policies, administrative instructions and changes to existing laws. \uf0b7 Civil society sends in shadow reports. \uf0b7 Civil society organizations continuously propose measures to empower vulnerable Roma. \uf0b7 Citizen participation and empowerment in political, cultural and other fields has reached a higher level than a few years ago. \uf0b7 Roma leaders need to promote Roma interest at national level. \uf0b7 Lack of political influence of Roma leaders. \uf0b7 Participation and empowerment is confronted with discriminatory situations in society and limited access and participation in various forms. M AINSTREAMING OF R OMA INCLUSION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL \uf0b7 Creation of Local Action Plans in almost all municipalities with Roma and Ashkali communities based on the National Strategy for Inclusion. \uf0b7 Creation of Municipal Action Committees for monitoring the implementation of local action plans (e.g. EU co-funded ROMACTED process). \uf0b7 The integration of Roma inclusion at the local level is mainly based on their representation in Committees for Communities, and the mechanisms that address the integration idea. \uf0b7 The budgets allocated by municipalities differ. As a result, many planned activities cannot be implemented due to budget limitations. \uf0b7 The Municipal Action Committees do not meet as regularly as planned. This negatively affects the necessary and dynamic cooperation between non- governmental organizations and mechanisms such as the Communities Committee. \uf0b7 Problems related to the divergent views of the Committees and other mechanisms vis-a-vis the planned municipal budgets and the benefits of the most appropriate lines that address the needs of the Roma community. \uf0b7 A major obstacle concerns inappropriate political strategies that influence the representation of communities in municipal assemblies and their voicing of their needs. D ATA COLLECTION \uf0b7 Population census of 2011. \uf0b7 The collection of data on various community issues has increased. This shows an increase in the intensity of interest in dealing with issues which community members themselves often face. \uf0b7 Several public institutions do not disaggregate statistics based on ethnicity, but they do disaggregate data for other minority groups (Albanians, Serbs and Others). This does not allow accurate information on Roma receiving services from public institutions. \uf0b7 Outdated data. \uf0b7 The collection of data during various research on Roma community issues has been challenged by the problems of obtaining complete information. F UNDING FOR CIVIL SOCIETY \uf0b7 The civil society, which acts in the context of community rights and their development in diverse aspects, has almost always been supported financially by various donors, ranging from public institutions, embassies, foundations and different international organizations. \uf0b7 Co-funding from municipalities. \uf0b7 The funds for the implementation of the National Strategy for Inclusion of Roma and Ashkali in Kosovo Society 2017-2021 are planned in a theoretical way with no clear link with what is available in reality from different institutions and donors. \uf0b7 Civil society are sometimes hampered by co-operation with other actors resulting in problems being treated superficially and without necessary concrete results. \uf0b7 Civil society sometimes have problems with the complete and successful completion of projects.

        "39 MONTENEGRO (Egyptians are included under the umbrella term Roma) Summary based on NRCP report - 2017 Roma integration measures G ENERAL INFORMATION Institution acting as NRCP The General Director of the Directorate for the promotion and protection of the rights of minorities and other minority communities in the Ministry of Human and Minority rights (MHM). Strategic document \u201cStrategy for Social Inclusion of Roma and Egyptians 2016-2020\u201d. Annual Action Plans for its implementation have been adopted (2017, 2018). The 2019 Action Plan was adopted in the first quarter of 2019. Roma population (Council of Europe average estimation, updated in July 2012) 20.000 (3.17% of 631.490). Available options for data collection Questions on ethnic self-identification included in the population census; Survey of Roma and Egyptians in Montenegro (2008) implemented by MONSTAT Statistical Office of Montenegro; two Regional Roma Surveys (2011, 2017 13 ) implemented by the UNDP and World Bank; UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster household Surveys 14 (Roma settlements MICS5 2013, MICS6 2018); Annual Monitoring Report on the Implementation of the Roma Integration Policy in Montenegro (2017, 2018); research on Social Position and Social Inclusion of Roma and Egyptians in Montenegro (2016) implemented by the Ministry of Human and Minority Rights; Roma Inclusion Index 2015; survey on child begging in Montenegro implemented by the Centre for Democracy and Human Rights (CEDEM) (2017); employment of Roma and Egyptians in Montenegro: Research on Attitudes of Companies' Representatives and Socio- Economic Position of RE population (2018); participative assessment of inclusivity of the Employment Agency of Montenegro (2018). Official statistical surveys on the Roma population in Montenegro currently remain outside of five-year and annual plans of official statistics. Ethnically disaggregated information on Roma was collected by MONSTAT in 2008 as a one-time statistical exercise. Line-ministries provide some of the ethnically disaggregated data, but do not officially collect them according to the standardised methodology. Impact assessment information comparing the position of Roma with that of the general population exists on education and is available from the Ministry of Education Information System (MIES). S UMMARY OF THE REPORTING YEAR The main achievements Montenegro started a set of activities for promoting inclusion of Roma in education, which should be continued and scaled-up. Coverage increased mainly thanks to a substantial improvement in pre-primary education. Roma who are internally displaced persons benefitted from social housing allocated through the Regional Housing Programme in significant numbers. The government\u2019s expenditure for Roma integration is continuously increasing according to its reports. The main challenges Overall, Montenegro went backwards in both average coverage and inequality. There is a wide gap between marginalised Roma and neighbouring non-Roma in terms of education, access to labour market and material well-being. The gap is especially large for young people. The Action Plan for Roma Integration is adopted for a single year. The deadline for adoption is 31 March each year, which means that the state is effectively without an action plan for up to three months each year. The NRCP and its team needs significant strengthening in terms of their capacities and the coordinating mandate vis-\u00e0-vis other responsible institutions in charge of implementing Roma integration policy. Donor dependency is strong. In 2016, about 3.3% of the total expenditure for implementation of the Roma integration policy was allocated from the central budget, increasing to 4.1% in 2017. The numbers on government expenditure are only approximations, as the structure and the methodology of budget planning and reporting does not provide clear information on spending for a particular population group. T HEMATIC A REAS In 2017, four thematic areas were reported as relevant for the implementation of the Roma Strategy: 1) education, 2) employment, 3) health care and 4) housing. A total of 14 objectives and 41 measures were reported on. Hereof, 20 were implemented, 14 were partially implemented and 7 were not implemented. The objectives were a mixture of mainstreamed and targeted measures. Montenegro further reported on Legal status; Social Status and Family Care; and Culture, Identity and Information, all of which are not reported on in this report. EDUCATION Five operational objectives were implemented through 20 measures, 16 of which were Roma targeted. 13 measures were fully implemented and seven were partially implemented. Five operational objectives were identified and reported on for 2017: 1) increase the enrolment level 13 https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eca/publication/breaking-cycle-of-roma-exclusion-in-western-balkans 14 http://mics.unicef.org/surveys ",
        "40 and reduce drop-out rates, 2) expand enrolment in preschool education, 3) enhance school achievements of children through engagement of parents and community 4) specific measures for reducing drop-out rate, 5) raise awareness on the importance of education. The most important success Pre-primary education enrolment rates among Roma increased significantly between 2011 and 2017, but remain well below those of their non-Roma neighbours. The increase was mainly driven by boys in urban areas. There has been a significant rise, to 62%, in the rate of enrolment into compulsory school for Roma children, resulting in the reduction of the gap vis-\u00e0-vis neighbouring non-Roma children attending compulsory school (92% enrolment rate). However, despite recent improvements, the adjusted net compulsory education enrolment rate of Roma in Montenegro is still the lowest in the Western Balkans. Montenegro is continuously putting significant efforts into ensuring desegregated education for Roma children by providing daily transportation to mainstream schools and back home. Since recently, measures in education are managed from the budget of the Ministry of Education. The most important challenge The low completion of compulsory education 34%. Around two-thirds of marginalised Roma aged 18-21 lack basic education. This group is also at a significant disadvantage with respect to their neighbouring non-Roma counterparts, almost all of whom have this level of education that is often a prerequisite for even low-skilled jobs. Upper secondary and tertiary completion is very rare; the completion rate of 3% for upper secondary education is the lowest in the Western Balkans. Data on Roma children not enrolled in school and children who dropout are not available. Stronger effort is required to identify these children and to integrate them into the mainstream school system. More efforts are also required to systematically prevent and address child begging. EMPLOYMENT Four operational objectives are identified and reported on for 2017: 1) increase participation in active employment measures, 2) increase the level of vocational qualifications, 3) direct employment measures, 4) strengthen capacity of employment bodies to deal with Roma population. The operational objectives are implemented through 13 different measures, five of which are Roma targeted. Five measures were fully implemented, two were partially implemented, whereas six measures were not implemented at all or Roma did not benefit from them. The most important success The fall in the unemployment rate. 23% of registered, economically active Roma aged 15-64 were unemployed in 2017, the lowest rate in the Western Balkans. This fall was largely driven by females gaining employment. The most important challenge Access to economic opportunities deteriorated. Marginalised Roma are much less likely to be employed than their neighbouring non-Roma counterparts, and gaps between the communities are increasing. Labour force participation among Roma fell, and in 2017, it was the lowest in the Western Balkans (19%). The great majority (78%) of marginalised Roma youth (ages 18-24) in Montenegro were not in employment, education or training (NEET) in 2017; this was a significant increase compared to 2011, and the gap vis-\u00e0-vis neighbouring non-Roma is widening. Effects of active labour market employment measures are insufficient to enable sustainable employment of Roma. Conditions for participation in some of the mainstream active labour market employment measures de facto exclude them from participation. There is a need for employment promotion programmes specifically targeting Roma, including those who engage in informal work. Proposed activities to tackle informal work within the Economic Reform Programme 2019-2021 do not account for the specific position of undeclared workers. Legislation on social entrepreneurship, which could be used in support of implementing specific programmes for employment of Roma, is not in place. The subsidy to employers for employing hard to employ groups, including Roma, was revoked in 2019. HEALTHCARE Three operational objectives were reported for 2017: 1) increase access to health care, 2) provide health prevention at health facilities and in the field, and 3) raise awareness on importance of health prevention. The operational objectives were implemented through five different measures: one mainstream and four Roma-targeted. Two measures were fully implemented; two were partially implemented, whereas one measure was not implemented. The most important success The majority of marginalised Roma in Montenegro have health insurance coverage (80%) and three Roma health mediators are employed in state-run health centres. The most important challenge The use of preventive health care is especially low, although it is on the rise; the gap vis-\u00e0-vis non-Roma neighbours is still the largest in the Western Balkans. Distance and lack of transport to local health centres has been identified as a problem. Only three associates for Roma inclusion were engaged to work with Roma in 2017, and there is no information about the number of people who benefited from their support services. Roma are insufficiently supported to obtain prescribed therapy and medications, which are often not affordable for them. Three out of five measures planned for 2019 are in fact awareness raising measures. HOUSING Two operational objectives are reported for 2017: 1) to improve housing conditions of Roma and 2) to close the informal temporary collective centres by resettling Roma to constructed, sustainable and decent housing. The operational objectives were to be implemented through three measures: 1) creation of database of available social housing and review of the legal basis for its use, 2) construction of social housing for internally displaced persons, and 3) presenting the needs for closure of collective centres to potential donors. The three measures were partially implemented. ",
        "41 The most important success Within the Regional Housing Programme, a minimum of 238 Roma benefitted from social housing through 2016-2018. This officially led to the closure of the Konik camp. Tivat municipality recently allocated land parcels for the construction of social housing benefiting Roma families. The most important challenge Overcrowding among Roma has been rising in recent years and is now the highest in the Western Balkans. Higher overcrowding occurs not only because they have larger households (typically with a higher number of children), but also because the dwellings they live in have a smaller number of rooms. Contrary to the regional evolution, since 2011 there has been a worsening of the housing situation of Roma regarding access to public services: piped water, connection to public sewerage and waste collection. The activities on legalisation are not included in the Action Plans, although activities on legalisation of Roma owned housing and Roma settlements are envisaged by the Roma Integration Strategy and the Law on Spatial Planning and Construction of Structures governing legalisation adopted in 2017. Domiciled Roma are insufficiently benefitting from the housing support. There remains a strong donor dependency in construction of housing. G OVERNANCE AND COOPERATION Human resources for the NRCP Three advisors work as technical support to the NRCP in the Department for Promotion and Protection of Rights of Roma and Egyptians. The Department is without an appointed Head of Department. Cross sectorial coordination The NRCP coordinates the implementation and monitoring process and chairs the Commission for monitoring the implementation of the Strategy for Social Inclusion of Roma and Egyptians 2016-2020. Examples of participation include co-chairing the bi-annual Roma Seminars, representation in EU fora and policy workshops, participation in the meetings of the Commission for monitoring the implementation of the Strategy for Social Inclusion of Roma and Egyptians, national Roma platform meetings etc. The key dialogue platforms among relevant stakeholders are the two-yearly Roma Seminars and the annual National Roma Platforms. Relevant stakeholders The interdisciplinary Roma integration coordination body includes representatives from the Ministries of Human and Minority Rights, Education, Labour and Social Welfare, Internal Affairs, Culture, European Affairs, Sustainable Development and Tourism and Finance. Other members are: Fund for Protection and Realisation of Minority Rights, Office of National coordinator for Fight against Trafficking in Human Beings, Employment Agency, Red Cross, Roma Council, Center for the Preservation and Development of Minority Cultures, Ombudsman's office, Directorate for the Care of Refugees, Statistical Office - MONSTAT, Union of Municipalities of Montenegro, Municipality of the Capital Podgorica and a representative of Roma NGOs. Civil society stakeholders. The role of the interdisciplinary body: preparation of Action Plans for implementation of the Strategy, monitoring of action plans and the Strategy implementation, assessment of achieved results, proposing amendments to the Strategy on a yearly basis, informing the Government of Montenegro about the Strategy implementation. Existence of baseline against which progress for implementation of NRIS /set of policy measures is assessed: Regional Roma Survey 2017 and 2017 information from MIES (last available baselines).

Media reports on Roma are often in a negative context, which contributes to persisting stereotypes. \uf0b7 Affirmative action not adequately and fully applied. \uf0b7 More actions are needed which involve joint activities of members of Roma community and the majority population. A DDRESSING SPECIFIC NEEDS OF MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS AMONG R OMA \uf0b7 Guidelines for actions of relevant institutions in cases of detection of child marriages. \uf0b7 An operational team for fight against domestic violence and violence against women was established in 2018. \uf0b7 Roma women are recognised as a particularly vulnerable group. \uf0b7 Roma women are still very susceptible to early marriages and need to be more empowered, both educationally and economically. \uf0b7 More specific measures need to be focused on empowerment of Roma women, in particular for entrepreneurship opportunities. \uf0b7 Majority of employed Roma work in public utility companies, and this type of work often happens in harmful environments and involving very difficult physical jobs.

There is some feedback that this is demotivating and discouraging NGOs to apply for EU projects. E XAMPLE OF PROMISING PRACTICE \uf0b7 Through a project, an education mediator in the municipality Bijelo Polje (northern Montenegro) was employed in a school with less than 70 Roma children. Engagement of the mediator showed immediate results in improved educational outcomes of students, more regular school attendance and easier overcoming of language barriers. This practice reflects a real need, the value of education mediators, and moreover the need to lower the existing threshold of 70 children per mediator. M OST IMPORTANT PRIORITIES TO BE ADDRESSED \uf0b7 Employment: High percentage of informal work/standardisation of professions specific to Roma, such as collectors of secondary waste, vocational trainings for Roma and life-long learning possibilities. \uf0b7 Education: Decreasing the level of dropout and increasing successful completion rates through diminishing the gap between primary school and secondary school students (improved transition between the two educational levels). \uf0b7 Housing: Social housing for Roma families, legalisation of informal objects and housing solutions for Roma who live on privately owned properties.

        "45 NORTH MACEDONIA Summary based on NRCP report - 2017 Roma integration measures G ENERAL INFORMATION Institution acting as NRCP The Minister without Portfolio. Strategic document Strategy for the Roma 2014 - 2020. Roma population (Council of Europe average estimation, updated in July 2012) 197,000 (9.56% of 2,060,563). Available options for data collection Questions on ethnic self\u2013identification included in the population census; UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster household Surveys 16 (Roma settlements MICS4 2011, MICS6 2018-19); two Regional Roma Surveys (2011, 2017 17 ) implemented by the UNDP and World Bank; Roma Inclusion Index 2015; Annual Monitoring Report on the Implementation of the Roma Integration Policy in Serbia (2017, 2018). The EU Delegation conducted a Thematic Evaluation of EU Support to Roma Communities and Roma Social Mapping and data collected by the State Employment Service Agency. S UMMARY OF THE REPORTING YEAR The main achievements The most salient results were achieved in the field of education. Among the measures implemented, it is worth mentioning: the inclusion of Roma children in pre-school education; the building of kindergarten infrastructure, notably in Shuto Orizari; the provision of assistance to children in primary education; the raising of parents\u2019 awareness on the importance of education; the offer of scholarships and tutoring for high school students; the academic support to university students. Most of the activities are implemented in cooperation with donors, notably the Roma Education Fund. Satisfactory results were achieved in the field of health. The health insurance coverage in North Macedonia for both Roma and non-Roma is close to 100% and Roma report that only 16% of their total health needs are unmet. The main challenges The main challenge remains the lack of actions to tackle Roma discrimination. No advance was reported in 2017, in spite of the horizontal nature of this priority in both the Strategy for Roma Integration and its Action Plans. Further challenges include: Data collection (the lack of ethnically and gender disaggregated data for monitoring, impact assessment and evaluation), budget allocation versus budget commitment and spending, and employment and labour market access, specifically the persistent high unemployment rate of Roma. Specific measures facilitating access to microcredits, developing financial literacy and entrepreneurial skills may offer an opportunity to self-employment and establishment of micro and small enterprises. T HEMATIC A REAS In 2017, four thematic areas were reported as relevant for the implementation of the Roma Strategy: 1) education, 2) employment, 3) health care and 4) housing. A total of 11 objectives and 92 measures were reported on. Hereof, 19 were implemented, 14 were partially implemented and 59 were not implemented. The objectives were a mixture of mainstreamed and targeted measures. EDUCATION Inequalities in education between Roma and non-Roma emerge early in life with a national enrolment in pre-primary education (ages 3-5) generally low in Western Balkans. The lack of available childcare options continues to be a barrier to pre-school enrolment. However, in North Macedonia, the gap between Roma and their non-Roma neighbours in terms of overall rate of school enrolment is the lowest in the region. The Roma Action Plan on education records as strategic goal the improvement of educational structures of Roma communities, notably for the benefit of women and girls. This strategic goal includes specific objectives aimed at enhancing access and successful completion of education for Roma, especially girls, in all levels of education. The fifth and sixth specific objectives are related to the number of Roma adults and children who completed primary and secondary education, especially Roma girls and young women. These six specific objectives are structured in 32 measures, out of which eight have been implemented, six partially implemented and 18 not implemented. The most important success Important steps have been achieved on inclusion of Roma children in pre-school education. The primary and secondary education is free of charge and fees are paid only for pre-school education. Free of charge transportation to school has also had a positive impact in reducing the number of dropouts. The most important challenge Roma returnees returning from the EU Member States because of the declaration of the Western Balkans as \u2018safe countries of origin\u2019 are at risk of staying out of the education system. A recent study published by the World Bank, commissioned by the European Commission 18 , identifies North Macedonia among the receiving countries of returnees from EU Member States, including Roma. 16 http://mics.unicef.org/surveys 17 https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eca/publication/breaking-cycle-of-roma-exclusion-in-western-balkans 18 World Bank Group with Funding from the European Commission, 2019: \u2018Supporting the Effective Reintegration of Roma returnees in the Western Balkans\u2019. ",
        "46 EMPLOYMENT North Macedonia stands out as the only country in the Western Balkans in which access to economic opportunities rose. The unemployment rate, registered in 2017 by the Regional Roma Survey, indicated that the unemployment rate at national level is 24%, with 49% among Roma and 19% among non-Roma. Among the unemployed Roma, 58% of women are unemployed, while in the case of non-Roma women, this rate stands at 26%. The strategic objective of the Roma Action Plan on employment for North Macedonia is to increase opportunities for employment of Roma in dignified workplaces. To achieve this strategic goal the following two specific objectives have been identified: 1) enhance access of Roma to Government employment programmes by 2020, especially for Roma women; and 2) higher income and sustainable employment for Roma by 2020, with a focus on women. These specific objectives are structured into 21 measures, out of which three have been implemented, five partially implemented and 13 not implemented. The most important success The implementation of Active Labour Market Policies (ALMP) targeting explicitly the Roma population by introducing a specific programme which addresses several segments among the Roma population who are mostly engaged in informal economic activities or who are interested in developing a small business. The implementation of the Youth Guarantee Scheme, deployed in three municipalities, was extended in 2019 to all municipalities where Roma are explicitly targeted. The most important challenge Besides the involvement of 23 Roma (seven young, four women) in the national self-employment programme, there are no significant results on unemployment reduction among Roma. The unemployment rate of Roma women remains a challenge in North Macedonia together with transition from education to employment, and the high rate of informal work among Roma. HEALTHCARE In North Macedonia, the Action Plan on Health arising from the National Roma Strategy has contributed to improved access to health and health coverage. The 2017 Roma survey records that health system affordability and proximity to health centres in North Macedonia represents about 20% and 10% of reasons for Roma population\u2019s unmet needs in the healthcare system, with waiting lists counting for about 40%. The strategic objective of the Roma Action Plan for North Macedonia in the area health is to increase life expectancy of Roma by 2020. This strategic objective is structured into two specific objectives: 1) enhance Roma\u2019s access to integrated, quality, preventive and curative health systems; 2) reduce risks and preventable diseases related to child mortality of Roma children. These specific objectives concur in the achievement of the concrete goal of reducing the violation of health and social rights against Roma when using health services. A total number of 25 measures have been identified, out of which six have been implemented, one partially implemented and 18 not implemented. The most important success Access to healthcare is facilitated by the existence of several mainstream programmes for public health, for health protection of mothers and children, for the health protection of the infant and immunization. Some of these programmes are explicitly targeting Roma. The most important challenge Challenges remain with regard to the low awareness of the different existing programmes and plans among Roma, the allocation of budget and the local level implementation of plans and programmes. The integration of Roma mediators in the national health system is still not addressed. HOUSING Houses of substandard quality with limited access to services, notably electricity, and illegal dwellings represent an obstacle to decent housing conditions for Roma in North Macedonia, similarly to all the Western Balkans partners. The strategic objective of the Roma Action Plan in the field of housing is to reduce the gap in the quality of housing between Roma and non- Roma communities. To achieve this strategic objective, a specific objective is identified in order to provide social housing for Roma families from socially vulnerable categories, together with concrete objectives aimed at enhancing living condition for Roma families through the development and implementation of integrated urban regeneration programmes and the elimination of harmful living conditions. Out of the 14 measures, two were implemented, two partially implemented and 10 not implemented. The most important success A project for Housing for Socially Vulnerable Groups (F/P 1674) is being implemented by North Macedonia and the Council of Europe Development Bank. The project envisages the construction of social houses in 28 municipalities, with Roma being explicitly targeted as a social group within the categories of beneficiaries. The legalization of illegal dwellings has benefitted many Roma. This legalisation process will be further supported with IPA funds specifically targeting Roma population. The most important challenge It is worth noting the difficulties faced by Roma (mainly economic, but also related to awareness of the conditions of eligibility) in fulfilling the requirements of the legislation allowing for the legalization of illegal dwellings. The role of the municipalities in improving Roma settlements, in supporting the legalisation of the Roma dwellings and in managing the consequences of evictions. Access to electricity still represents a challenge, and 2017 data denote a worsening in comparison to 2011. G OVERNANCE AND COOPERATION Human resources for the NRCP The Minister without Portfolio is responsible for the implementation of the Strategy for Roma Integration 2014-2020 and for the coordination of the implementation of the Action Plans. He is also the National Roma Contact Point and he shares and coordinates this activity with the ",
        "47 Ministry of Labour and Social Policy. The Minister is supported by a cabinet of five staff members and by the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, where a specific Roma unit is established. Cross-sectorial coordination There are currently nine active Roma political parties, out of which three are participating in the ruling coalition government. Two Roma MPs sit in the parliament and one Mayor sits in the Suto Orizary town hall. The Government has a Roma minister without portfolio with political and coordination responsibility on the Roma strategy. The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy is responsible for the implementation of the Roma Strategy and different sectoral ministries for the implementation of the Action Plans. A National Coordination Body for the Roma Inclusion Strategy (comprised by relevant ministries, NGOs and Roma activists) monitors the implementation of the Roma Inclusion Strategy 2014-2020. Examples of participation include co-chairing the bi-annual Roma Seminars, representation in EU fora and policy workshops, participation in the meetings of the National Coordination Body for the Roma Inclusion Strategy, national Roma platform meetings etc. The key dialogue platforms among relevant stakeholders are the two-yearly Roma Seminars and the annual National Roma Platforms. Relevant stakeholders \u2022 NRCP and Ministry of Labour and Social Policy (leading institutions); \u2022 The National Coordination Body, supported by the RCC Roma Integration 2020 action; \u2022 Government; \u2022 Parliament, particularly members of Roma ethnicity; \u2022 Ministry of labour and social policy; \u2022 Minister without portfolio responsible for the implementation of the Strategy for improvement of the situation of Roma; \u2022 National employment agency; \u2022 Ministry of education, Directorate for development and advancement of the education on the languages of the communities; \u2022 Ministry of transport and connections; \u2022 Ministry of health; \u2022 Ministry of culture, Directorate for affirmation and advancement of the culture of communities; \u2022 Ministry of local self-government; \u2022 Ministry of internal affairs; \u2022 Ministry of external affairs; \u2022 Ministry of finance; \u2022 Ministry of information society and administration; \u2022 Ministry of justice; \u2022 State statistical office; \u2022 Agency for realisation of the rights of communities; \u2022 Commission for protection from discrimination; \u2022 Secretariat for European affairs; \u2022 Secretariat for implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement; \u2022 Association of the Local Self-Government Units (ZELS); \u2022 Roma Information Centres; \u2022 Roma and pro-Roma NGOs; \u2022 Inter-governmental organisations and multilateral and bilateral donors/implementers, such as the Council of Europe, OSCE, UNDP, UNOPS, GIZ, UNICEF, etc. Dialogue/cooperation has been established between the Ombudsman/equality body and the NRCP: ad-hoc contacts. There is no baseline or indicators against which progress in the implementation of the Roma Strategy can be measured. The Strategy for Roma Integration in North Macedonia covers the period 2014-2020. The National Action Plans for Roma Integration in the fields of Education, Employment, Housing and Gender cover the period 2016-2020.

        "48 NORTH MACEDONIA Assessment based on civil society country reports 19 SUBSTANTIVE POLICY AREAS S TRENGTHS /K EY ELEMENTS OF THE ENLARGEMENT APPROACH W EAKNESSES /G APS /R ECOMMENDATIONS E DUCATION \uf0b7 Compared to the other areas, the biggest progress lies in education. \uf0b7 The Ministry of Education offers free education to all pupils at primary and secondary education, which is also a compulsory level of education. There is an increasing trend of Roma enrolment in these levels of education. The Ministry has hired Roma educational mediators on a yearly service contract financed by the state budget. \uf0b7 There is progress in decreasing the number of Roma students in special schools. The state is committed to including children with mild disabilities in the regular schools and to strengthening the monitoring system together with the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, the Ministry of Health and the Bureau of the Education Development. \uf0b7 Where available, free of charge transportation of the pupils in compulsory levels of education is provided. \uf0b7 Scholarship schemes for Roma high school and university students have become state level policies (c.f. the Law on the Student Standard), thereby fostering their enrolment and graduation rates. \uf0b7 There is a quota system in place for enrolment of students belonging to minorities in state universities, ensuring the appropriate representation of minority groups. \uf0b7 Roma children are benefitting from free fees in kindergarten in some municipalities. However, only 4% of Roma children aged 3 to 5 attend pre-school. Their limited participation is also caused by the low institutional capacity of pre-school institutions. \uf0b7 Further measures are needed to tackle dropouts in primary and secondary schools. \uf0b7 Institutionalization of Roma school mediators in the compulsory education system is needed to tackle dropout and help their transition to the labour market. \uf0b7 Roma returnees have difficulties to re-enrol their children in the compulsory education system. Measures to ensure their enrolment and continuation of their education are needed, including recognition of diplomas. \uf0b7 Additional measures to support Roma street children to return to school and family life are needed. \uf0b7 Segregated schooling of Roma children is still an issue together with the unjustified enrolment or Roma pupils in special schools. E MPLOYMENT \uf0b7 The Active Labour Market Policies (ALMP), promoted by the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, explicitly target the Roma population. \uf0b7 The Youth Guarantee Scheme, deployed in three municipalities, is extended from 2019 to all municipalities and the Roma are explicitly targeted. \uf0b7 The new Law on Social Protection (to be enacted by June 2019) is expected to provide higher social security coverage to families and to activate the labour market, including for Roma. \uf0b7 The employment of Roma in national and subnational public administrations is guaranteed with the Ohrid Framework Agreement. \uf0b7 The participation of Roma in ALMP is very low. Only 3% of Roma are benefitting from these policies, and the majority of them are included in the Public Work Programme and Trainings. To increase the participation of Roma, additional courses for all the measures should be introduced (i.e. preparatory trainings). \uf0b7 Roma NEET should be targeted by the Youth Guarantee scheme. \uf0b7 The country Strategy on returnees should be further operationalized, notably in support of Roma returnees\u2019 integration in the labour market. \uf0b7 The Roma information centres should be institutionalized within the Centres for Social Work, ensuring equitable representation in the public administration. \uf0b7 The low level of education for most disadvantaged Roma remains a major obstacle to employment. H EALTHCARE \uf0b7 Several mainstream programmes facilitate the access of Roma to health care. These include: the programme for public health, for health protection of mothers and children, for the health protection of the infant and immunization. Roma are specifically targeted in some of these programmes. \uf0b7 All citizens of the country are entitled to free health insurance.

H OUSING \uf0b7 The Project for Housing for Socially Vulnerable Groups (F/P 1674) is implemented in partnership by the Republic of North Macedonia and Council of Europe Development Bank. The project envisions the construction of social houses in 28 municipalities, where Roma are targeted as a social group within the beneficiary categories. \uf0b7 The mainstream policy for legalization of the illegal dwellings had a significant effect on Roma, as a high number of Roma succeeded to legalize their dwellings or are in the procedure of legalization. \uf0b7 The targeted infrastructural projects within the Ministry of Transport and Communication in the Roma communities have positive effects and should continue further with a higher budget. \uf0b7 Positive efforts to provide alternative housing for evicted Roma and homeless people are noticed in the municipality of Skopje. \uf0b7 Many Roma, due to urbanization issues and low socio- economic status, could not apply for legalization by the deadline established by the law. An extension of the deadline may help to complete the legalisation of illegal dwellings. Local self-government faced major problems in the legalization process: state institutions should set-up one-stop- shops/helpdesks to advice on the implementation of the legislation. \uf0b7 At the local level, modification of the general urbanistic plans and adoption of the detailed urbanistic plans, which include the Roma neighbourhoods, is needed. This would provide Roma with additional options for legalised housing and improvement of the infrastructure. \uf0b7 There is no government programme for provision of alternative housing for homeless Roma in the case of forced evictions. \uf0b7 There are Roma neighbourhoods in some municipalities, which lack basic infrastructure and access to water, electricity, asphalt road, sewage system. HORIZONTAL MEASURES S TRENGTHS /K EY ELEMENTS OF THE ENLARGEMENT APPROACH W EAKNESSES /G APS /R ECOMMENDATIONS A NTI - DISCRIMINATION \uf0b7 The new Law on anti-discrimination approved in March 2019 is expected to have a positive effect on addressing discrimination, including against Roma. It introduces sexual orientation and gender identity as grounds for discrimination, and a new form of discrimination (segregation) is added. In addition, foundations or other civil society organizations, as well as informal groups can file a lawsuit for protection against discrimination of public interest. \uf0b7 The Commission for the protection against discrimination must ensure Roma representation. \uf0b7 School segregation remains pervasive and is aggravated by residential segregation. Support to maintaining segregation is sometimes presented as part of Roma inclusion measures. F IGHTING ANTIGYPSYISM \uf0b7 In its report for 2016, the Commission for protection against discrimination acknowledged the existence of direct discrimination on the basis of skin colour in the area of access to goods and services. \uf0b7 Dedicated days for Roma supported by the Government: 8 April (Roma Day), 2 August (Roma Genocide Remembrance Day), 5 November (Roma Language Day). \uf0b7 There is a need for training of the judiciary on the practical implementation of the new anti-discrimination law and on the identification of discrimination. \uf0b7 Lack of understanding and recognition of antigypsyism by the institutions in general and the national authorities in particular. \uf0b7 Data concerning monitored cases of antigypsyism are not publicly available. \uf0b7 Cultural awareness of the genocide of Roma is almost non- existent in the national collective consciousness. A DDRESSING SPECIFIC NEEDS OF MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS AMONG R OMA \uf0b7 Identification and creation of a database of Roma without ID. \uf0b7 Civil society is involved in proposing measures to empower vulnerable Roma. \uf0b7 The ROMACTED programme is focusing on the local level and improving dialogue between the community and local stakeholders also covering most vulnerable Roma. \uf0b7 More needs to be done to address the issue of Roma without ID, to trigger participation of Romani women in the labour market, and to promote entrepreneurship among young Roma. \uf0b7 There are no measures to address (explicitly) Roma LGBTI issues. \uf0b7 A National Action plan for Romani women exists, but it lacks budget and is not implemented.

The national coordination body is responsible for monitoring and directing the implementation of the strategy and action documents. commitment for implementing of the National Roma Strategy and Action Plan. \uf0b7 The government is lagging behind regarding the implementation of the Roma Strategy. C IVIL PARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERMENT \uf0b7 Two seats within the National Coordinative Body are reserved for the representatives of civil society organisations. \uf0b7 Regional and national projects supported by the European Commission, DG NEAR, such as \"Joint initiative to empower Roma civil society in Western Balkans and Turkey\" (JIERCSWBT) is enabling the creation of a healthy Roma civil society that is acting as a watch-dog, promoting transparency and accountability and holding institutions accountable towards the Roma community. \uf0b7 There is a need for higher representation of Roma CSOs in the National Coordinative Body. \uf0b7 There is a lack of political influence of Roma leaders, as well as the capacity to engage in the promotion of Roma interests at the national level. \uf0b7 Projects of Roma civil society organizations are ongoing in order to deal with issues that the state fails to cover. These projects are mainly driven by donor funds, while the allocation of the state budget remains insufficient and unchanged. M AINSTREAMING OF R OMA INCLUSION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL \uf0b7 There is a targeted approach for addressing the Roma inclusion at the local level through the Local Action Plans adopted by some municipalities. \uf0b7 There continues to be a lack of capacity in the local administration and some resistance from local authorities to implement integrated measures. Local Action Plans should include targets and funds. \uf0b7 The planned budget within the financial framework of the National Action Plans for Roma is significantly different from the planned funds within the state budget. The new National Action Plans should build on the current plans and improve substantially their quality, objectives, assessment framework and budget. D ATA COLLECTION \uf0b7 The process of gathering data on Roma inclusion is undertaken by various administrative bodies, including Ministries and the State statistical office. \uf0b7 A project for social mapping of the Roma community is funded by IPA pre-accession funds. This mapping should serve as a baseline of the situation of the community housing, infrastructure, education, employment and health. \uf0b7 There is no systematic monitoring nor evaluation of the measures undertaken within the national strategy of Roma. \uf0b7 A survey to assess the progress in the Roma communities should be conducted every two years. \uf0b7 The state should start collecting segregated data on ethnic communities. F UNDING FOR CIVIL SOCIETY \uf0b7 Funding for CSOs is available. \uf0b7 It is important to ensure that the planned interventions under the 2014-2020 programming period effectively reach the most vulnerable, especially Roma. \uf0b7 Roma CSOs should be involved in a consultative process for designing result-oriented projects based on the priorities of the Roma communities. E XAMPLE OF PROMISING PRACTICE \uf0b7 Positive progress in transforming projects for Roma into sustainable policies is noted in the area of education (pre-school, secondary and tertiary education). \uf0b7 The new law on anti-discrimination will strengthen the legal protection of Roma, especially in the area of segregation in schools. \uf0b7 After several years of project implementation, the Institute of Public Health issued a report on the work of health mediators for 2016. According to their records, 11 Roma health mediators were active in 8 municipalities. According to the report of the Institute, out of 1,727 realized services, 806 are for health care, 497 for administrative assistance for personal documentation, and 424 for exercising the right to financial social assistance. In general, the analysis shows that Roma health mediators successfully carry out their work tasks, which is also shown by the increased number of services provided compared to 2013. ",
        "51 M OST IMPORTANT PRIORITIES TO BE ADDRESSED 1. The majority of Roma undeclared workers are engaged in waste collection, open market or street trade, seasonal agricultural work, and cleaning services (particularly relevant for Roma women). The policy of transforming the informal work should consider different approaches for the different types of economic activities, because of the characteristics and context in each economic area. Necessary amendments to the laws shall be proposed and formulated (such as, for example, extension of the scope of the Law on Debt Write-off, if necessary). The formulated policy shall include the required funding for implementation and a concrete proposal for funding from the state (and local) budget and donors. 2. According to the 2017 regional Roma survey, around 70% of the dwellings where Roma live are illegally built. At the same time, 87% of the Roma face material deprivation. Combined with the marginalization that entails lack of opportunities, facing prejudice, lack of knowledge and capacities, as well as the costs related to housing, it is necessary to provide support to Roma to ensure secure and adequate housing. 3. Keeping the commitments and intensifying the measures and activities of the state institutions for the inclusion of Roma in society. 4. Reviewing the need for the Programme for Assistance and Support to returnees in the Republic of North Macedonia in accordance with the readmission agreements. 5. Intensifying the efforts to register persons in public records and to provide personal documents to all persons in the country. 6. Strengthening the capacities and resources of Roma Information Centres and Roma Health Mediators to provide information and effective paralegal assistance to Roma returnees (and Roma in general). ",
        "52 SERBIA Summary based on NRCP report - 2017 Roma integration measures G ENERAL INFORMATION Institution acting as NRCP The Special advisor to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure. Strategic document Serbia has a \u201cStrategy for Social Inclusion of the Roma in the Republic of Serbia 2016-2025\u201d and adopted an Action Plan for the implementation of the Strategy for the period 2017 to 2018. The Action Plan for the period 2019-2020 is expected to be adopted in the second half of 2019. Roma population (Council of Europe average estimation, updated in July 2012) 600,000 (8.23% of 7,292,574). Available options for data collection Questions on ethnic self\u2013identification included in the population census; three Regional Roma Surveys (2004, 2011 and 2017 20 ) implemented by the UNDP and World Bank; UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster household Surveys 21 (Roma settlements MICS4 2010, MICS5 2014, MICS6 2019 (pending)); Roma Inclusion Index 2015; Annual Monitoring Report on the Implementation of the Roma Integration Policy in Serbia (2017, 2018); government database for monitoring the measures for Roma inclusion ( http://inkluzijaroma.stat.gov.rs/ ) collecting process data from municipalities on a voluntary basis. Qualitative information on Roma integration in Serbia exists from various governmental, international and non-governmental organisation such as: Child Marriages Among Roma in Serbia by UNICEF, The Wall of Anti-Gypsyism by Civil Rights Defenders, Characteristics of Roma Entrepreneurship in Serbia by a team of researchers. S UMMARY OF THE REPORTING YEAR The main achievements Serbia showed a small improvement in the overall Roma coverage in the five priority areas, however there was no change in inequality (gap between Roma and non-Roma neighbours). The increase in coverage was mainly driven by improvements in housing and education. The Government's work on improving the housing situation of Roma through significant national and IPA funding is worth praise and should continue. The main challenges For the implementation of the Roma integration policies, the total expenditure for 2017, including public and donor funding, only represents around 30% of the total budget planned. Furthermore, the general amount was less that the budget spent in 2016. The institutional structure dealing with Roma integration remains ineffective and complicated, without a clear distribution of tasks. T HEMATIC A REAS In 2017, four thematic areas were reported on: 1) education, 2) employment, 3) healthcare and 4) housing. The 25 identified operational objectives were implemented through 45 measures. 10 were completely implemented or are ongoing measures, three were implemented partially, and 32 measures (about 70% of all measures) were not implemented. The objectives were implemented through a mixture of mainstream and targeted measures. EDUCATION The 2017 measures covered: 1) early childhood education, 2) good quality primary and secondary education with effective prevention of drop outs, 3) prevention and intervention in case of discrimination, 4) fostering Roma language and culture, 5) support higher education, 6) provide high quality adult education. The six identified operational objectives were implemented through nine different measures; hereof three are mainstream and six Roma targeted. Five of the measures were fully or continuously implemented, three were partially implemented, and one not implemented. The most important success The proportion of Roma children of compulsory school age who were enrolled in school rose to 84%, but it has yet to catch up with the near- universal enrolment among non-Roma neighbours. The figure for completion of compulsory education also shows signs of progress with the corresponding gap vis-\u00e0-vis neighbouring non-Roma decreasing. Despite significant improvements, over one-third of marginalised Roma aged 18-21 lack basic education. This is tackled through adult education mainstream policy, where Roma participate with around 60% of the beneficiaries. It is also encouraging that the rate of Roma in tertiary education doubled by 2017 compared to 2011 (although still very low, at 1%, compared to non-Roma neighbours with 16%). The most important challenge Serbia needs to mobilize the necessary resources to close the gap between Roma and non-Roma with special attention to completion of compulsory education. 20 https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eca/publication/breaking-cycle-of-roma-exclusion-in-western-balkans 21 http://mics.unicef.org/surveys ",
        "53 Pre-primary school enrolment for Roma at 9% was low in 2017. Cost and fear of discrimination continue to be important barriers. Furthermore, the admission criterion requiring at least one parent to be employed, which is rare among Roma, is an extra barrier. Funds allocated for pre- school education are mainly spent for teacher training (97%) and not on efforts to include Roma children. The most significant measure in primary education (for which almost all the planned funds are spent) is engagement of pedagogical assistants. However, there is still a need to regulate their position and to engage more assistants to fully meet the needs of Roma students. Since the affirmative measure for university enrolment contributed to a significant raise in the rate of Roma at university, it should be maintained by reversing the recent decision of the National Coordination Body to abolish it. Possible abuse of the measure should be properly investigated. EMPLOYMENT Seven operational objectives, all Roma targeted, were reported on for 2017. They were related to: 1) increase share of Roma in formal employment, 2) reduce discrimination, 3) increase competitiveness, 4) stimulate employment and empowerment of Roma, 5) integrate Roma employment policy into local economic development plans, 6) increase the number of employed in public authorities and 7) legalise the work of non-formal employed Roma, specially in the waste management sector. Of the 11 planned measures, four were implemented while seven were not. The most important success We can identify two trends. On one side, unemployment decreased to 36%, but mostly due to reduction in labour force participation. On the other side, the informality was reduced, even if the reduction was larger for the non-Roma. The most important challenge Labour force participation decreased significantly without a clear objective factor that could explain this evolution. 64% of Roma are engaged in undeclared work, compared to only 14% of non-Roma neighbours. However, this area of concern did not manage to get sufficient attention of the authorities, who in 2017 implemented none of the foreseen targeted measures regarding formalisation of undeclared work. Roma are twice as likely to be unemployed compared to non-Roma. The government has only implemented mainstream active employment measures, where Roma are involved as one of the \u201chard-to-employ\u201d groups and where participation of Roma is low. On one side, the incentives for self-employment have criteria excluding most of the Roma from being eligible (loan guarantors, ownership of land/object). On the other, subsidies for employment of \u201chard-to-employ\u201d are usually not being used by private employers, as they would rather employ persons from other \u201chard-to-employ\u201d groups. HEALTHCARE Five operational objectives were identified and implemented through nine different measures: two are mainstream and seven Roma targeted. The objectives aim to: 1) develop supporting environment, 2) development and health of Roma children, 3) support persons with chronic non- communicable disease and reproductive health, 4) access to quality health without discrimination and 5) preventive health care. Of the nine planned mainstream measures with Roma targeted elements, one was implemented while eight were not. The most important success According to the newest Law on Health Insurance, Roma are entitled to health care even if they are without a permanent residence. The health insurance coverage among Roma is 92% (almost reaching the rate of non-Roma of 97%). Furthermore, the use of the preventive care health services (58% of population aged 16+) is the highest in the region. The most important challenge The self-perceived health is the worst in the region and has deteriorated since 2011. Slightly more than one-fourth of Roma aged 16 and over report having not accessed health services when needed; this percentage remains much higher than that among neighbouring non-Roma. The Action Plan on health is relying on the work of the Roma health mediators that are not yet institutionalised. The implemented activities are solely related to informing the Roma community about rights in health, health prevention and care, health services and similar. Other planned activities (such as regular examinations and special meals for Roma infants, screenings for colorectal, cervical and breast cancer, regular examinations and special meals for pregnant Roma women, etc.) are not implemented. Mainstream health services remain limited for the Roma. HOUSING Serbia stands out as the country that increased the most on catching up on coverage and decreasing inequality compared with the level of the region. Seven operational objectives were identified and implemented through 16 different measures: three were mainstream and four Roma targeted. The seven identified objectives focussed on: 1) provide preconditions for improving housing conditions, 2) create spatial planning and 3) normative preconditions, 4) improve infrastructure in Roma settlements, 5) improve housing standards, 6) implement programmes of social housing, 7) implement international standards in the case of forced displacements. Of the 16 planned mainstream measures with Roma targeted elements, none were implemented. The most important success There was a relevant increase, in the period 2011-2017, in access of marginalised Roma to electricity and piped water and the gaps vis-\u00e0-vis neighbouring non-Roma are narrowing. The gap in access to sewerage with respect to non-Roma neighbours is significantly narrowing, but coverage among the Roma is still low. The most important challenge Even though overcrowding among marginalised Roma has been falling since 2011, the gap with respect to non-Roma neighbours is still the second largest in the Western Balkans. The non-collection of waste is also an issue affecting a larger share of the Roma population living in marginalised communities. Information on illegal dwellings and segregated settlements is not readily available. The existing legislation on legalisation should be reviewed ",

G OVERNANCE AND COOPERATION Human resources for the NRCP The government report for 2017 does not provide information on the technical/secretarial staff working for/with the National Roma Contact Point. The Special advisor to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure is a member of the Coordination Body for Monitoring the Implementation of the Strategy and Head of the Council for the improvement of the position of the Roma and the implementation of the Decade of Roma Inclusion. For certain aspects of the Roma integration policy, the Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure \u2013 the highest official responsible for the Roma integration portfolio \u2013 is also delegating to a State Secretary from the Ministry in charge of international cooperation. Cross-sectorial coordination The Roma Strategy is proposed and adopted by the government as a policy document of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy. The Coordination Body for Monitoring the Implementation of the Strategy consists in principle of the highest level of decision makers (Ministers and other high-level officials). This is quite high-level compared to other similar bodies in the region. However, since its establishment, it has only met two times with short meetings not covering all Roma integration areas, and most participants were representatives from its \u201ctechnical body\u201d. The Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction Unit (SIPRU) is charged with the administrative, expert, technical and secretariat tasks for the Coordination Body and coordinates the planning of the next Roma Action Plan. The inter-sectoral task force includes members of the Ministries of Education, Health, Labour and Employment and Veteran and Social Affairs, the Public Employment Service, the Institute for Social Protection, Youth and Sport, Ministries of the Interior, European Integration, Finance, Construction, Transport and Infrastructure, Public Administration and Local Self-Government, and Team for Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction. It also includes a representative from the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities, National Council of the Roma National Minority and the Standing Conference of Roma Citizens\u2019 Associations. The EU Delegation, Roma Integration action team and other representatives of international organisations are involved as observers. The Office for Human and Minority Rights (OHMR) is responsible for collecting information and preparing reports on the implementation of the Roma Strategy. There is also a Council for the Improvement of the Position of Roma. It is not functional, but still exists. The NRCP: \u2022 is being consulted and participates in the development of policies. \u2022 is not participating in decision making processes regarding the funding of relevant policies. \u2022 is participating in decision making processes regarding the implementation of relevant policies. Examples of participation include co-chairing the bi-annual Roma Seminars, representation in EU fora and policy workshops, participation in the meetings of the Coordination Body for Monitoring the Implementation of the Roma Strategy, national Roma platform meetings etc. The key dialogue platforms among relevant stakeholders include the two-yearly Roma Seminars and the annual National Roma Platforms. Stakeholders involved in the monitoring and evaluation of the Roma Strategy: \u2022 National authorities (line-ministries, agencies, municipal offices, public health institutes, schools etc.), \u2022 Some regional and local authorities also provide data annually, \u2022 The National Council of the Roma National Minority, \u2022 The Standing Conference of Roma Citizens\u2019 Associations, \u2022 The Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities, \u2022 Roma and pro-Roma NGOs, \u2022 Inter-governmental organisations and multilateral and bilateral donors/implementers, such as the Council of Europe, OSCE, UNDP, UNOPS, GIZ, UNICEF, etc., \u2022 Serbian Roma civil society provides shadow-reports. Dialogue/cooperation has been established between the Ombudsman/equality body and the NRCP: ad-hoc contacts. There is a baseline 22 against which progress in the implementation of the Serbian Roma Strategy is assessed, and the accompanying Action Plans may contain references to baseline information, albeit often without source references. Policy measures may contain baseline information also often without source references. There were some measurable targets in the expired Action Plan for the Implementation of the Strategy for Social Inclusion of Roma in the Republic of Serbia for 2017-2018.

A DDRESSING SPECIFIC NEEDS OF MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS AMONG R OMA \uf0b7 Relevant authorities and CSOs active in the promotion of human and minority rights regularly inform the Roma about their civil status rights and provide free legal aid to members of the Roma community in these proceedings. \uf0b7 Law on Free Legal Aid adopted. Entry into force expected for October 2019. \uf0b7 Increased number of persons who successfully resolved civil status rights with regard to: right to birth registration, right to citizenship, permanence residence registration, identification document thus resolving potential obstacle for birth registration. \uf0b7 It is evident that the number of legally invisible persons decreased significantly, but, on the other hand, it is a fact that a fairly large number of people still live in Serbia without possessing any identity document and who therefore are denied almost all rights. \uf0b7 Specifically, provisions of the bylaws are still in force that stipulate that data on parents in the birth registration are recorded from their birth certificates and identity cards, or \"personal documents which are considered as proof of that data\u201d. This means that if a mother does not have the abovementioned documents, it will not be possible to determine the personal name of the child and the child will actually remain unregistered. \uf0b7 New Law on Free Legal Aid, apparently, will not be adopted before 2020. It is especially important that the new Law takes into consideration, as also stipulated, the role of CSOs in this process. STRUCTURAL MEASURES S TRENGTHS /K EY ELEMENTS OF THE PARTNER APPROACH W EAKNESSES /G APS /R ECOMMENDATIONS S TAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT AT THE CENTRAL LEVEL \uf0b7 Adoption of a new Strategy for social inclusion of Roma in the Republic of Serbia 2016-2025 accompanied by Action Plan. \uf0b7 The Strategy does not include financial resources for its implementation. \uf0b7 Coordination and monitoring mechanisms and systems envisaged by the Strategy are not set yet. \uf0b7 The Action Plan for the period 2018-2020 is not adopted nor has it been publicly discussed. Priorities and dynamics of planned activities are unknown to the Roma civil society. \uf0b7 Coordination body has been formed, but there were no meetings or activities. Coordination body and its Expert group are broadly conceived and it is unclear how it will function and be operational. The Expert group is comprised of government employees and representatives of the Roma national council and activists. C IVIL PARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERMENT \uf0b7 Regular coordination meetings on projects focused on improvement of the situation of Roma are held quarterly and organised by the Office for Human and Minority Rights. \uf0b7 Projects of Roma civil society organizations are ongoing in order to deal with issues that the state fails to cover. M AINSTREAMING OF R OMA INCLUSION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL \uf0b7 Development and further strengthening of the network of Roma coordinators in local self-governments (LSGs), including an increase of their number, according to the local needs, in order to closely cooperate with other relevant state mechanisms to improve the position of the Roma. \uf0b7 There are some efforts of the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities in regard of standardised Terms of Reference for Roma coordinators in local self-governments, but the monitoring and improvement is very limited. Experience with Mobile Units for Roma inclusion IPA 2012 project shows that local governments often entrust this work to non-Roma employees. D ATA COLLECTION \uf0b7 Data collection from local level using local Roma mechanisms and other sources such as CSOs \uf0b7 Database has been formed, but limited numbers of Local Self- Governments are participating, and limited data are collected and available. This is in direct relation to the unregulated situation of Local Roma Coordinators, Pedagogical Assistants and Roma Health Mediators. State still does not acknowledge ",

        "58 TURKEY (Dom, Lom and Abdal are included under the umbrella term Roma) Summary based on NRCP report - 2017 Roma integration measures G ENERAL INFORMATION Institution acting as NRCP Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Services. Strategic document The National Strategy Paper on Roma Citizens 2016-2021. The first phase Action Plan (2016- 2018) has expired. The second phase Action Plan (2019-2021) is pending adoption. Roma population (Council of Europe average estimation, updated in July 2012) 2,750,000 (3.78% of 72,752,325). Available options for data collection Annual Reports on the implementation of Roma Integration Public Policy (2017, 2018); SIROMA (EU funded project) final report. S UMMARY OF THE REPORTING YEAR The main achievements The social service coordination units (local mobile teams) set up within the EU funded SIROMA project and operating in 2017. The extra-curricular training programme developed in 2017 that supports pre-primary, primary and lower secondary education and targets school non-attendance and school dropout. The main challenges The Action Plan (2016-2018) did not include data on the desired results of measures, number of beneficiaries, indicators measuring success of activities, nor the amount and sources of funding. The Government is preparing the second phase Action Plan (2019-2021) whose adoption is delayed effectively leaving the country without an action plan for implementing the Roma Strategy. The annual implementation reports (2017, 2018) do not include data on Roma beneficiaries or expenditure allocated specifically for Roma, but rather for the entire mainstream measure. T HEMATIC A REAS In the 2017 monitoring report, four thematic areas were identified and reported on. In total, eight objectives were planned to be implemented through 13 mainstream measures. Hereof, four were partly implemented and four were not implemented. There is no information about the other measures. EDUCATION The strategic objective is to ensure Roma children access to quality education and equal opportunities, enabling young Roma to successfully complete minimum compulsory education. Three strategic goals are planned relating to: 1) preventing dropout and absenteeism, 2) increasing Roma families' knowledge about socio-economic benefits of education, and 3) strengthening the social bond between Roma parents, schools, teachers and peers. An additional two measures, not stipulated in the Action Plan, were reported on that relate to awareness raising about the socio-economic benefits of education. The most important success The extra-curricular modular training programme was developed in 2017. Implementation of the programme should result in lower dropout rates, better performance in education and increased engagement in extra-curricular activities leading to empowerment. Roma children are provided with free of charge transportation, textbooks and conditional cash transfers. The most important challenge There is no information on the number of Roma benefiting from education support in Turkey, nor their needs in education. The impact assessment information is not provided, thus there is no data on enrolment and completion ratios and education profiles of Roma. Segregation in education is referred to in the Strategy, but no comprehensive analysis of the possible causes has been made. EMPLOYMENT The strategic objective is to facilitate Roma to enter the labour market and to increase their employment in qualified and secured jobs. The strategic objective is further divided into four strategic goals: 1) enabling Roma to reach the professional quality demanded by the labour market; 2) developing collaboration among employers, NGOs and related sectors in support of obtaining professional qualifications and employment opportunities, 3) encouraging entrepreneurship including through micro-crediting and finally 4) preventing child labour. Four measures were planned, out of which three can be regarded as partially implemented since there is no information on Roma beneficiaries and actual results of the implemented measures. There is no information about the other measure, which must be considered not implemented. The most important success Awareness raising activities about employment opportunities and minimum working conditions were implemented in areas densely populated by Roma. Vocational trainings were implemented in the same areas. The most important challenge There is no government related information on the number of Roma benefiting from employment support in Turkey, nor their needs. Additional ",
        "59 measures should be planned and implemented, including more direct support to become employed and/or formalise undeclared work. HEALTHCARE The strategic objective in health is to ensure that Roma people more efficiently benefit from health services. The three strategic goals are to 1) increase awareness of Roma of the existing health services; raise awareness on how to access maternal and infant health services, 2) fight infectious, contagious, chronic diseases, and what are the hazardous effects of smoking and drug addiction; and 3) increase Roma health literacy. Only two measures were planned in the Action Plan, one relating to determining the health needs of Roma and providing them with minimum health services in situ (vaccination, delivering vitamins, etc.) and increasing health literacy. Awareness raising activities were implemented in relation to the two measures, but there is no information about direct provision of health services to Roma. The most important success Implementation of awareness raising activities to increase health literacy. The most important challenge There is no information on the number of Roma who benefited from implemented healthcare measures in Turkey or who benefitted from mainstream healthcare services. The activities to assess healthcare needs of Roma or directly engage to improve their health were not implemented. HOUSING The strategic objective is to promote adequate housing opportunities in disadvantaged areas with an access to public transportation, healthy and liveable milieu, and functioning infrastructure through taking the beneficiaries' demands and social lives into consideration. The three strategic goals are 1) improving conditions of housing settlements; 2) delivering social housing to those who live in unhealthy environments and inadequate or temporary housing; and 3) developing legislation to deliver side services for the effective application of social housing and urbanisation projects. Two measures were planned, but none was implemented. The most important challenge The activities to improve living conditions of Roma through legalisation or to provide them with housing through tailor-made programmes were not implemented. Legalisation activities are not planned. G OVERNANCE AND COOPERATION The Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Services is responsible for the implementation of the Strategy Document, and the coordination of social inclusion policies for Roma people. The NRCP is an expert at the Department of Social Policy and he is supported by an Assistant Expert from the Department of Social Inclusion. The communication with the EU is governed through the Directorate of the EU Affairs within the same Ministry. The government established the Monitoring and Evaluation Board that monitors the implementation of the Roma Integration Strategy and Action Plan. There is no information on the work of the Monitoring and Evaluation Board.

        "60 TURKEY (Dom, Lom and Abdal are included under the umbrella term Roma) Assessment based on civil society country reports SUBSTANTIVE POLICY AREAS S TRENGTHS /K EY ELEMENTS OF THE PARTNER APPROACH W EAKNESSES /G APS /R ECOMMENDATIONS E DUCATION \uf0b7 Equal opportunity for education is under constitutional guarantee. \uf0b7 The National Strategy on Roma Citizens published in 2016 recognizes that Roma children do not have equal access to education. \uf0b7 Implementation models which would ensure equal access to education for Roma children are not developed at national or local level. \uf0b7 Children face lack of nutrition due to poverty, which negatively affects school attendance and educational performance. We would recommend provision of basic nutrition for free at schools. \uf0b7 The rate of literacy for adults is still very low. \uf0b7 In several districts, there are Roma-only segregated schools. These schools usually have very poor physical conditions. The quality of teaching in these schools is lower, with very high teacher turnover rates. Children may remain illiterate even when they go to school. We recommend allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged districts and an incentive mechanism for teachers to serve in these schools. \uf0b7 School dropout is very common among Roma children. This also triggers early marriages. Second chance education opportunities should be provided for children and adults who dropped out from school at an early age. \uf0b7 Several Roma children are encouraged to get disability reports and are then directed to special education and rehabilitation centres to benefit from the government subsidy provided per child attending these centres. Some of these Roma children do not attend school at all. We recommend that a better monitoring and inspection mechanism is enforced for provision of these disability reports and enrolment into special education and rehabilitation centres. \uf0b7 Conditional cash transfer amounts are so low that it is not sufficient to keep children in the education system. \uf0b7 Opportunities for sports, social and cultural activities should be enhanced in schools to attract Roma children. \uf0b7 Roma children have extremely low access to pre-primary education because the families cannot afford the registration fees. Pre-primary education should be free for low-income families. E MPLOYMENT \uf0b7 National Strategy on Roma Citizens published in 2016 recognizes that Roma does not have equal access to labour market. \uf0b7 Temporary (6 to 9 months) employment opportunities have been provided to Roma in community service programs run by \u0130\u015eKUR (Turkish Employment Agency), though the scope was limited. \uf0b7 Roma people mostly participate in precarious and temporary employment and are not covered by the social security system. \uf0b7 Vocational training courses rarely lead to employment. Only the training courses which respond to the jobs on demand in the labour market should be opened. Regional and local conditions and differences should be taken into account while designing programs. \uf0b7 Cooperatives to be established by employees currently in precarious jobs should be encouraged. \uf0b7 Literacy training for adults should be conducted in a way that is easily accessible by Roma citizens. \uf0b7 Employment of well-educated Roma youth in public services should be encouraged. ",
        "61 H EALTHCARE \uf0b7 Health services are accessible to all Roma citizens. \uf0b7 In several cities, newly established city hospitals are located outside the city centres. Some Roma families cannot afford the transportation costs of reaching these hospitals. \uf0b7 Recently increased medical consultation and medicine fees (patient's contribution) negatively affect access to health services. \uf0b7 Early marriages lead to reproductive health problems. \uf0b7 Use of drugs among Roma youngsters and fatalities related to drugs has become widespread. We recommend development of comprehensive national and local policies to fight against drug abuse, which are incorporated into the National Roma Strategy as well. H OUSING \uf0b7 The National Strategy on Roma Citizens published in 2016 recognizes that Roma citizens face \"physically insufficient\" housing conditions. \uf0b7 Almost all Roma populated neighbourhoods across Turkey face the risk of urban transformation in the short to medium term. These projects lead to forced evictions and displacement of Roma families. \uf0b7 Urban transformation projects should be planned together with the community, and the needs of the community should be taken into account as a priority. \uf0b7 Houses in which Roma live are sometimes as small as 15 square meters, they usually are overcrowded and do not have adequate space for children to study. \uf0b7 There are lack of infrastructure and environmental issues in Roma populated neighbourhoods that threaten public health. HORIZONTAL MEASURES S TRENGTHS /K EY ELEMENTS OF THE PARTNER APPROACH W EAKNESSES /G APS /R ECOMMENDATIONS A NTI - DISCRIMINATION \uf0b7 The National Strategy on Roma Citizens published in 2016 recognizes the need for fighting discrimination against Roma. Awareness raising and training activities to fight the prejudices against Roma was foreseen. \uf0b7 Hate speech towards Roma is not recognized as a crime in the legislation, and this should be addressed by a legislative amendment. F IGHTING ANTIGYPSYISM \uf0b7 Establishment of the Human Rights and Equality Institution of Turkey is a positive development. \uf0b7 Grassroot NGOs established by Roma communities do not have the capacity to monitor and record discriminatory practices, nor to make use of existing administrative and legal mechanisms to fight discrimination and antigypsyism. A DDRESSING SPECIFIC NEEDS OF MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS AMONG R OMA \uf0b7 Children, elderly and persons with disabilities are recognized as disadvantaged groups in the National Roma Strategy. \uf0b7 The presence of Roma with refugee background should be recognized in national policy documents and their needs also addressed. \uf0b7 Extremely vulnerable situation of Roma groups (Dom, Abdal etc.) in Central, Eastern and South-eastern Anatolia should be taken into account while developing local and regional policies. \uf0b7 The National Roma Action Plan should be gender mainstreamed. Specific needs of Roma women should be taken into account (such as provision of literacy courses and vocational trainings, affordable childcare services, reproductive health services, prevention of early marriages, self- empowerment). STRUCTURAL MEASURES S TRENGTHS /K EY ELEMENTS OF THE PARTNER APPROACH W EAKNESSES /G APS /R ECOMMENDATIONS S TAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT AT THE CENTRAL LEVEL \uf0b7 A number of Roma NGO representatives are members of the \uf0b7 Participation of Roma NGOs in decision-making mechanisms at ",
        "62 National Roma Strategy Monitoring and Evaluation Board, which convenes once a year. national level is very limited. C IVIL PARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERMENT \uf0b7 There are two members of the National Parliament with Roma origin (out of 600 members). \uf0b7 Roma citizens and NGOs do not have enough information or awareness about their fundamental rights. \uf0b7 Programmes to support civic participation of Roma citizens should be implemented. M AINSTREAMING OF R OMA INCLUSION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL \uf0b7 Turkish Union of Municipalities and the Council of Europe implements the ROMACTED programme, aiming to promote Roma inclusion at local level. \uf0b7 The National Roma Strategy is not known at the local level. National policies need to be localized and promoted at the local level. \uf0b7 We recommend that municipalities and governorates should establish Roma contact points, which facilitate Roma citizens' access to services and their enjoyment of basic rights. \uf0b7 Community centres should be established near Roma populated districts. D ATA COLLECTION \uf0b7 The National Strategy on Roma Citizens published in 2016 recognizes the need for data collection and evidence based policymaking. \uf0b7 Lack of data about Roma people at local and national levels makes the design of social policies and monitoring of the implementation of measures very difficult. \uf0b7 Poverty mapping exercises are needed to determine the most vulnerable districts and to monitor and respond with appropriate policy measures. F UNDING FOR CIVIL SOCIETY \uf0b7 EU, national and regional development agency funds have been made available for Roma NGOs in recent years. \uf0b7 Small scale and flexible funding opportunities should be created for NGOs willing to work for Roma inclusion. \uf0b7 Vulnerable Roma groups (such as refugees, women, children, elderly and disabled) should be prioritized for funding. \uf0b7 Coaching and counselling mechanisms should be made available for Roma NGOs to properly benefit from funding possibilities. E XAMPLE OF PROMISING PRACTICE \uf0b7 Establishment of the community centres near Roma districts in the Istanbul-Sisli and Samsun-Canik municipalities have been good examples. M OST IMPORTANT PRIORITIES TO BE ADDRESSED 1. Comprehensive national and local policies to fight against drug abuse should be developed and implemented, which are incorporated into the National Roma Strategy. 2. Roma children face lack of nutrition due to poverty, which negatively affects school attendance and educational performance. We would recommend provision of free basic nutrition at schools. 3. National Roma Strategy is not known at the local level. National policies need to be localized and promoted at the local level. 4.
