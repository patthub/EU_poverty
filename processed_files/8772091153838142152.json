        "RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECTS Marxan with zones study to identify candidate MPAs - Mauritius Element Description Title Identification of candidate Mauritian MPAs for discussion through a Marxan with zones study SDG Target 14.5 Country or Region Mauritius Main challenge(s) or gap(s) which project addresses Mauritius will not meet the SDG 14.5 target of MPA coverage by the target date of 2020. Although there are a number of MPAs (and similar zones) created in Mauritius they are not of large size. Scientific support using identified \u201cgood\u201d practice as employed in the Seychelles for the same purpose is recommended to identify candidate MPAs for discussion. Objective Building on the experience of the Seychelles (Seychelles Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) Initiative and The Nature Conservancy) in identifying candidate areas for MPAs using a Marxan with zones approach this project will replicate this process in Mauritius where there are similar fisheries, habitats and stakeholders. The objective would be to develop candidate MPAs in Mauritius to meet the required level of coverage within 3 years. Main elements of the project The main elements of the project workplan to enable achievement of the objective(s) would include: \uf0b7 Identification of data sources required; \uf0b7 Stakeholder inputs into process; \uf0b7 Data collection; \uf0b7 Development of candidate MPAs; \uf0b7 Secondary stakeholder consultation; and \uf0b7 Provision of advice to meet necessary SDG target of 10% coverage. This would be implemented using a Marxan with zones style analysis. Marxan is the most widely used decision support software for conservation planning globally. It's used in 184 countries to build marine and terrestrial conservation systems and is the global leader in conservation land and sea use planning software. Implementing Organisation * The Ministry of Environment was going to contact the SMSP / TNC (see below) after the project visit to see if they could start moving forward initially with external assistance as required.

While Mauritius itself has a cleaning programme, the outer islands have little or no control and therefore are more vulnerable to the impacts of marine plastic pollution. If marine debris is not cleared up, then over time the negative effects will accumulate and may impact ecosystems and possible industries (e.g. tourism and fisheries). Objective To identify the main sources and pathways of marine plastic pollution in a Mauritian EEZ. This information can then be used to increase public awareness of the issues with marine plastic and help to support the development of a regional strategy to minimise waste. The indicators which can be used to measure whether the objectives are reached include: - Method developed which accurately tracks plastic waste from source to sink. - Training course programmes and record of attendance. - Joint regional strategy developed in Indian Ocean. Main elements of the project Long-term studies are in place Mauritius to monitor coastal waters already. This should be expanded to cover all parts of the Mauritian EEZ including the outer island groups that are currently not monitored.

        "Mauritius Literature Review Page 1 LITERATURE REVIEW EASME/EMFF/2016/031 International Oceans Governance - Scientific Support Mauritius, Literature Review 1. B ACKGROUND The Republic of Mauritius is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean, ca. 2,000 km off the southeast coast of Africa. It has a population of approximately 1.3 million people, distributed across an area of approximately 2,046 km 2 (789.965 mi 2 ), which equates to a population density of ca. 620 people per km 2 . The EEZ of Mauritius (Rodrigues and Agalega included) covers about 1.2 million km 2 . Mauritius is considered a stable democracy - according to the World Bank\u2019s Worldwide Governance Indicators, under most dimensions of governance (political stability, government effectiveness, rule of law and control of corruption), Mauritius is in the top third of all countries surveyed 1 (Figure 1). Mauritius is classified as a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) and a Middle Income Country (MIC). Since its independence in 1968 the economy of Mauritius has developed from a low- income agriculture-based economy to a middle-income diversified economy. Despite the constraints, Mauritius has created a well-established welfare system, a sound educational system and a resilient and stable economy based on tourism, textiles and financial services. More recently seafood has emerged as an increasingly important sector, supported by increasing investment from both local and foreign investors. Mauritius has one of the largest EEZs in the world and in 2012 the government announced its intention to develop the marine economy 2 . Mauritius is ranked high in 1 http://info.worldbank.org/governance/WGI/#reports 2 http://mauritiusassembly.govmu.org/English/Documents/Add%20president/Govt%20Address%202012.pdf ",

Poverty in Mauritius has declined significantly over recent decades; in 2012 around 9.4% of households were considered to be living in relative poverty 4 , and it has an HDI of 0.781 (ranked 64th). The Mauritian environment is considered to be particularly rich \u2013 it was designated by IUCN as a \u2018centre of plant diversity\u2019 and is included as part of the Madagascar and Indian Ocean Islands biodiversity hotspot. Mainland Mauritius has a coastline of 322 km and is surrounded by 150 km of protective coral reefs, covering a lagoon area of around 243 km 2 . The marine environment therefore constitutes a major ecosystem and is particularly diverse, with some 1,700 species, including 786 fish species of which about 5% are commercial targets 5 . However, it is also considered to be at risk, particularly critical ecosystems include mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs - mangrove cover decreased by 30% between 1987 to 1994, due in part to the expansion of tourism.

The Republic of Mauritius have demonstrated their commitment to the SDGs at various international events, through regional partnerships and through national policies, action plans and frameworks. They have specifically identified SDG 14 as an important target due to their desire to make the ocean sector a pillar of its economy in the future, although, the ocean economy is not new to Mauritius, with marine tourism, shipping and fisheries having a long history. 2. P ROGRESS ON SDG TARGETS Target specific details about SDG 14 are captured in Table 1 while Table 2 and 3 provide a perspective on challenges that might thwart delivery and mechanisms that could support it, respectively. 2.1. Overview International level Mauritius play an active role in the field of SDGs, particularly SDG14 - they are active members of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) 7 , and as such lead in commitments to sustainable development of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) - in 2005 they hosted an international meeting that resulted in the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation, which strengthened commitment of the international community to support sustainable development implementation in SIDS 8 . The Mauritian Government adheres to many international laws and agreements, including; the agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas; the agreement related to the Conservation and Management of Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks of the UNCLOS (Fish Stocks Agreement); FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries - International fishery conservation and management measures, and the FAO Port State Control Measures. The Republic of Mauritius are being supported by a number of international development partners to implement programmes in various sectors of relevance to sustainable development \u2013 in particular, Mauritius has benefited from the financial and technical support of partners such as the UN, the EU, the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, the Commonwealth Secretariat, the World Bank, the IMF and the GEF. Below is a list of 6 http://info.worldbank.org/governance/WGI/#home; WB defines extreme poverty as living on less than USD1.90 per day> (PPP), and moderate poverty as less than USD3.10 a day. 7 http://www.sidsnet.org/aosis-issues/ 8 https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/563National%20Synthesis%20Report%20FINAL.pdf ",

Regional level In order to create and encourage cross-border partnerships, Mauritius is party to several regional groups, including the SADC, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the Indian Ocean Rim \u2010 Association for Regional Cooperation and the IOC. Mauritius is also a member of the IOTC, CCAMLR, SWIOFC, SIOFA and the Nairobi Convention. Being a relatively active member of these organisations, is evidence of Mauritius\u2019 drive to progress fisheries conservation and management measures at the regional level. National level With regards to the implementation of the SDGs, on September 25 th 2015, the Government of Mauritius committed to a comprehensive program of implementation, to develop a national strategy, setup a national monitoring framework and process for annual reporting, and to establish a multi-stakeholder advisory group to support their implementation 9 . The implementation of all SDGs is steered by the Ministry of Environment, Sustainable Development, and Disaster and Beach Management. SDG 14 was again highlighted as a crucial target at the third international conference of SIDS, where Mauritius representatives re-affirmed its commitment and prioritisation of the \u201cMauritius Strategy for the further Implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States\u201d 10 . 9 http://statsmauritius.govmu.org/English/Documents/SDGs%202016/Presentations/1%20Presentation%20on%20 instituitional%20arrangement%20by%20Mr%20D.%20Bahadoor.pdf 10 https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/conferences/msi2005 ",
        "International Oceans Governance - Scientific Support Mauritius Literature Review Page 5 At the national level, the main legal frameworks that regulate the marine environment of Mauritius are; the Environment Protection Act 2002 (EPA), the Tourism Act 2006, the Wastewater Management Authority Act 2000, and the Maritime Zone Act 2005. Fisheries and fishers in the nation are also supported via other frameworks such as the Fisheries and Marine Resources Act 2007, the Fishermen Welfare Fund Act (2000) and the Fishermen Investment Trust Act (2006). With the enactment of these \u2018Fisheries Acts\u2019, regulations have been adopted that include, the Vessel Monitoring System Regulations, the Undersized Fish Regulations, MPA Regulations, and several technical control measures. Mauritius has also been very progressive with regards to combatting IUU fishing, on a national and regional scale \u2013 setting up an additional suite of tools and regulations, such as; VMS and AIS regulations, mentioned above and Port State Control Units for boarding and inspection of vessels. Similarly, additional national measures have been implemented to help build sustainable fisheries and protect the marine environment, such as; banning of explosive fishing; closed seasons for certain gear types; minimum landing sizes for some commercial fish; building nearshore FADs for artisanal fishers, to relocate effort and sustain catches; and the creation of a Fishermen Training and Extension Centre to train fishers to fish off-lagoon. Mauritius also adopted an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Framework in 2010 which aims to ensure the effective and sustainable management of all coastal development around the island. On-going activities under the ICZM include coastal protection works, beach re-profiling, propagation of mangroves and other restoration works. The following projects have been recently created that are aimed at achieving SDG14: \uf0b7 Investigation of land-sea interactions through groundwater discharge; \uf0b7 Evaluating the anthropogenic accumulation of micro-plastics in Mauritius waters; and \uf0b7 The study of Ocean Acidification in Mauritius waters (NB: Tentative title is subject to change). The first two projects directly address SDG 14.1, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution with the critical indicator 14.1.1. The project on Ocean Acidification is expected to address SDG 14.3 - average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling stations. Other projects currently undertaken at the Mauritius Oceanography Institute, in line with SDG14 include: \uf0b7 Molecular characterization / Assessment of living resources in the EEZ of Mauritius; \uf0b7 Marine Biosecurity Programme: (i). Port Mathurin Port biological baseline survey, (ii) Survey of invasive aquatic species related to bio-fouling in Port Louis Harbour, Mauritius; \uf0b7 Assessment of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) flux to meet potable water demand and improve domestic water supply in coastal regions; \uf0b7 Mapping of coastal and oceanic environments including the characterization of the earmarked aquaculture sites around mainland Mauritius; and \uf0b7 Monitoring for Environment and Security in Africa (MESA) project.

Progress with MDGs Mauritius successfully achieved most of the MDG targets, especially in the area of education, gender equality and poverty reduction, but, a number of concerns and priorities emerged during that relate to unemployment due to skills mismatch, demographic challenges, and environmental and climate change issues \u2013 all of which are considered by the Prime Minister 11 , to impact the achievement of the MDGs and will persist going forward towards the SDGs. 2.3. Delivery across SDGs Mauritius have declared that their strategy will focus on sustainably developing the Ocean Economy while striving to achieve targets set out in SDG 14 for 'life below Water'. Emphasised when Mauritius hosted a preparatory workshop for the 2017 UN Oceans Conference, which paid particular attention to SDG 14. The Republic of Mauritius appear to be one-step-ahead of many other countries, in that Statistics Mauritius have constructed a national SDG database 12 - as of March 2017, the database comprised data on around 130 of the 216 indicators (60%) (Table 1) that are relevant to the Mauritian context. Data are presented as from 2010 to enable trend analysis prior to 2016. Mauritius plays a leading role in the SDGs, particularly SDG 14, both at the international level, regional level and through national policies and commitments. With respect to SDG 14.1, Mauritius announced it will increase research on the possible link of contaminated seafood consumption with the rise in diseases such as cancer by studying the accumulation of microplastics in the marine food chain and its potential impact on human health in the period 2017 to 2022 13 . In addition, under SDG 14.4 Mauritius announced it will launch in 2018 an assessment of all the fishing vessels (including purse seiners and long liners operating in the region) operating in the waters of the Indian Ocean Commission States in order to study their identity, history, ownership and activities. With a view to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing. Project's completion is expected in 2021. The data will be assessed and a report will be prepared with recommendations on means to combat effectively IUU fishing in waters of the Member States of the Indian Ocean Commission. Furthermore, the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) announced the extension from 5 to 8 Participating States of the EU- funded Regional Fisheries Monitoring mechanism in the Southwest Indian Ocean. The 8 Participating States (Comoros, Madagascar, France / La R\u00e9union, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, Tanzania) have signed the 2017 Fisheries Ministerial Declaration to commit to the institutionalised structure of the IOC Secretariat to combat IUU fishing and fisheries crimes in the industrial tuna fisheries in the South West Indian Ocean basin.

It is noted that Mauritius has also made a commitment to support the FISH-I in implementing a programme of vigilance in the Western Indian Ocean. Under 14.a Mauritius announced it will launch in 2018 an ocean data management project to improve data accessibility and provide a temporal and spatial perspective for the sustainable development of the ocean and its resources. The project is expected to be completed in 2022 and is part of a substantial effort to harmonise and standardise ocean data so as to allow dissemination to the largest community possible. Similarly, under 14.b Mauritius reaffirmed its commitment to elaborate by 2021 a Marine Spatial Plan for the maritime zones of Mauritius to sustainably and effectively manage the conflict of uses in its waters. Australia is hosting visiting fellows from IORA countries (Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles) in November 2017 and supporting a proposed IORA summit in 2018 that will support Mauritius achieve SDG 14.c. In spite of the investments and commitments of the Mauritian Government and stakeholders, there are still a number of challenges prevailing 14 , including, potential for economic shocks and financial constraints; human resources and skills mismatch; and technology gaps. Specifically with regard to SDG 2; Mauritius has limited land resources, most of which are already exploited and there is little scope for further development and expansion. However, Mauritius has a huge territory, of which 99% is ocean. As a result, the exploitation of ocean and marine resources present an opportunity to promote and improve economic diversification and resilience of the country. However, this will require significant resources and expertise to ensure it is conducted in a sustainable manner \u2013 in line with SDG 14. Mauritius presently lacks the financial capacity, skills, and technology to maximise sustainable use of the potential offered by the marine environment for food security, economic development, energy and carbon sequestration. Furthermore, whilst this offers key prospect for sustainable development in Mauritius, integrated assessment and regular monitoring of the marine environment is required. Mauritius requires further assistance to replenish fish stocks, combat IUU fishing and piracy and prevent marine pollution, amongst other things. In this regard, the support of the International Community is crucial to enable Mauritius achieve its sustainability goals. 14 https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/563National%20Synthesis%20Report%20FINAL.pdf ",

G OOD PRACTICE AND LESSONS LEARNT The Joint Management Area (JMA) between Mauritius and the Seychelles 16 is considered to be a good example of joint collaboration between neighbouring countries. UNDP GEF recognises that this is one of the first \u2018transboundary\u2019 management agreements for an Extended Continental Shelf scenario and represents a unique and innovative joint management demonstration 17 . This is particularly valuable due to the expected number of ECS applications which will subsequently require the development of innovative management approaches. This places the Mauritius-Seychelles Joint management Agreement in a \u2018cutting-edge\u2019 position to take the lead in piloting new mechanisms and strategies for such joint ECS management. Noteworthy elements within the Treaties, which are reflected in UNCLOS, include: \uf0b7 Agreement to exercise sovereign rights jointly for the purpose of exploring the continental shelf and exploiting its natural resources \uf0b7 Importance of jointly managing the natural resources of the continental shelf in the Mascarene Plateau Region in a manner that is sustainable and consistent with the precautionary principle and the protection of the marine environment and the biological diversity of the continental shelf The EPA 2002 \u2013 the main legislative framework to support environmental management in Mauritius \u2013 provides a range of tools to combat overfishing, IUU etc. and this is considered to be best practice in terms of national legislation. 16 http://mdr.govmu.org/English/defence/Documents/treaties/Treaty%20Concerning%20the%20Joint%20Manag ement%20of%20the%20Continental%20Shelf%20in%20the%20Mascarene%20Plateau%20Region.pdf 17 http://www.mu.undp.org/content/dam/mauritius_and_seychelles/docs/Roland2015/JMA%20ProDoc%20for% 20Revision%20following%20LPAC%20150225.pdf ",

        "1 I NTRODUCTION The main objective of this series of SWOT analyses is to obtain information about the capacities and the limitations that are currently faced by each of the countries in the study in being able to address their SDG14 requirements. In a standard SWOT analysis (strengths weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) internal (S&W) and external (O&T) factors (to the country in this case) are analysed. The internal scope (strengths and weaknesses) are those related to the organisations, projects and structures of the country; the external scope (opportunities and threats) are those events and pressures that influence the country from outside but can much it easier (opportunities) or make it more difficult or prevent a country from achieving its objectives (threats). Once the four elements: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats have been analysed individually (Section 0), some key underlying mechanisms may be determined to utilise strengths and opportunities individually or to address and counter weaknesses and threats. However, it is usually necessary to further analyse the relationships between the four components to identify potential ways forward and then to set strategies to follow in order to take advantage of our strengths based on specific opportunities and to reduce threats, and to work to combat any identified weaknesses by identifying opportunities and to highlight where weaknesses and threats coincide so measures can be taken to reduce the potential negative impacts. ",
        "Page 20 2 S UMMARY SWOT TABLE This document provides a summary SWOT analysis at the country level for Mauritius. A summary of the analysis can be found in Table 1, with the details found for each specific section in for Strengths (Section 3.1 - Table 2), Weaknesses (Section 0- Table 3), Opportunities (Section 3.3 - Opportunities detail any external improvement that can be taken advantage of by a country. Opportunities should be external to the country. Opportunities are a combination of different circumstances at a given time that offer a positive outcome, if they can be effectively and efficiently taken advantage of. As opportunities are external, a country cannot easily \u2018create\u2019 opportunities, they can only ensure that they are in the best position to gain the maximum benefit from any opportunities that appear, i.e. have the governmental structures in place. SDG 14 has a priority regionally and strong NGO support and access to external experts creates several positive opportunities in terms of marine resource governance. There is potential to diversify the marine sector within Mauritius, with opportunities to expand areas such as aquaculture/mariculture, offshore oil and gas, deep sea mining and renewable energies. Opportunities to improve regional coordination and share fisheries MCS resources are available under the IOC SMARTFISH programme and have indicated positive results improving levels of IUU in the region. Additionally, the regional IOC SMARTFISH programme has a particular focus on a number of SDG 14 targets, and there are future opportunities to be part of successful initiatives such as the Regional Biodiversity Programme and Coral Reef Monitoring Network. Table 4) and Threats (Section 0 - Threats are external factor, i.e. originating outside of the country being analysed. No control is exercised by the country over these factors, but there will be a benefit by having contingency plans to address them if they should occur to reduce any negative impacts. A typical threat would be \u201cGlobal warming creating negative economic impacts through reduced fishing opportunities and environmental damage\u201d. The common pool nature of a number of marine resources shared with neighbouring states makes management very difficult, and although the IOTC plays a role in managing highly migratory fish stocks, their consensus based decision making process can make agreeing strategies with other MS difficult. Common waters add additional issues, including the lack of control over external sources of marine pollution from nearby countries. Lack of MCS resources means that areas of Mauritius EEZ is susceptible to IUU activities, and there is currently a number of IUU threats to pelagic fisheries from Sri Lankan and India vessel amongst other. The short term and cyclical nature of external funding (2-3 years) is not conducive to long-term monitoring and evaluation activities to assess progress of SDG14 policy measures. Mauritius\u2019s relatively small economy and dependence on a few industries makes the country vulnerable to external economic disturbances, while future climate changes impacting natural resources may degrade its already fragile economic stability.

Each element identified is given a unique number for future reference, fully described and evidence given. 3.1 Strengths Strengths can be described as a country\u2019s internal positive attributes that makes a country stand out from others. Strengths could include attributes such as a defined national focus on a particular key issue, strong academic infrastructure that can underpin research, good long-term funding for relevant government bodies etc. For example, a country may only have a single national university but if that university has a strong oceanographic or marine biology focus with strong internationally renowned research groups that would be a key strength in developing mechanisms and analysing data to enable a country to meet its SDG targets. Mauritius indicates a stable political environment, with a transparent structure involving one ministry in charge of the Ocean Economy, Marine Resources, Fisheries and Shipping. The country has implemented a strong regulatory framework for environmental and fisheries issues, backed by a legal framework and long term policy management plans. Based on an ecosystem approach to fisheries, there is a strong environmental focus to policy, with a number of measures established to protect and conserve local ecosystems and biodiversity, while maximising sustainable economic and social use. This includes, a strong EIA processes, marine debris cleaning programmes, oil spill contingency plans and several critical habitat rehabilitation projects. There is a strong focus on fishery development expanding diversity, whilst removing destructive fishing practises and enforcing strong measures to reduce IUU. In addition to having a strong primary and secondary academic infrastructure, tertiary level education has been strengthened with the creation of the Faculty of Ocean Studies, offering courses specifically focussed to SDG14 targets. As a result, Mauritius appears to support the promotion of scientific research, encouraging levels of data collection and creation ecosystem maps indicating critical habitats.

The Blue Bay Marine Park was designated a Wetland of International Importance (Site No. 1744) and included in the List of Wetlands of International Importance established by Article 2.1 on the Ramsar Convention on Wetland on 31 January 2008 to protect the marine ecosystem. The Ministry is responsible for the long- term protection and conservation of marine bio-diversity and habitats for sustainable use while maximizing economic and social benefits derived from the coastal zone through the following activities: (a) manage the Marine Protected Areas and contribute to a regional/global network of marine and coastal protected areas (b) sensitize the public on Marine Protected Areas, sustainable development and use of the coastal zone.

        "Page 34 3.2 Weaknesses Weaknesses stop a country from performing at its optimum level. Weaknesses are highlighted as areas or attributes that can be improved to enable the country to improve in particular areas for example a lack of political will to implement changes, reduced administrative or enforcement capacity that can reduce effectiveness. A large EEZ and limited resource capacity has meant that effectively enforcing management measures within Mauritian waters has been limited. Overall, lack of guarantees for long-term funding has made it difficult for Mauritius to achieve a number of short and long-term domestic and international targets. Research capacity in Mauritius is limited, as restricted resources has resulted in a short supply of research vessels, a poor understanding of marine resources within the EEZ and limitations associated with publically available data following an absence of a central data repository. Although MPA planning is in place for small MPAs, general coverage of protected areas is unlikely to meet the requirements of 10% coverage defined by SDG14.5. Oil spill contingency planning is in place, however there is a lack of links with overseas oil spill protection units and a complete absence of planning for future chemical spills within their EEZ. Table 3: Summary of Weaknesses Identified for Mauritius. # SDG Target Weakness Description and evidence 1 All 14.1 14.2 14.3 Capacity (technical skills) Lack of specific expertise and staff - 14.1 specific skills in water quality assessment - 14.2 trained officers for coral reef and associated ecosystem monitoring. - 14.3 training for monitoring (ocean acidification) - EIA across all SDGs (both conduct and assess) 2 All Capacity (budget) including long-term planning may be limiting Some areas highlighted as being lacking in capacity due to budget limitations. Noted increased workloads due to commitments against international agreements but no corresponding increases in budgets. Funds for capacity building have been identified in national budgets though. General lack of staff to meet domestic and international commitments highlighted. Long-term funding difficult to guarantee, e.g. provision of MCS for expanded MPA areas if they were introduced to meet SDG 14.5 3 14.5 MPA planning in place for smaller MPAs but not on the scale required to meet SDG 14.5. At the moment no single management plan has been developed in Mauritius for MPA development. A number of smaller MPAs have been created and implemented but no overall defining structure nationally exists. 4 14.4 Large EEZ limits enforcement effectiveness with limited capacity \u2013 management of large remote MPAs may suffer. Mauritius has a large EEZ of approx. 1.3m km\u00b2 (potentially even larger and more complex when Tromelin (approx. 250 km\u00b2) and Chagos Archipelago 640 km\u00b2 are included). Large area to cover with limited resources. Focus on Mauritius has demersal resources, around the islands and on the banks, and migratory pelagic tuna and tune-like species in the EEZ. Good monitoring of all fisheries in place. ",
        "# SDG Target Weakness Description and evidence Good port State control \u2013 dedicated Port State Control Unit established in 2004. MCS in Mauritius involves the Fisheries Management Division, the Fisheries Protection Service of the Ministry of Fisheries and Rodrigues, National Coast Guard, and the Port Authority. Surveillance is conducted by the National Coast Guard (NCG) with regular air and sea surveillance missions using Dornier aircraft and their three patrol vessels, \u201cGuardian\u201d, \u201cRescuer\u201d and \u201cRetriever\u201d. Fisheries one priority amongst many for the NCG. The Fisheries Protection Service controls illegal fishing in the lagoon mainly but also participates in joint surveillance activities in the maritime zones with the NCG besides assisting in the implementation of port state measures in the port. (NPOA IUU) 22 VMS / AIS and remote sensing are used as MCS tools. Good level of regional cooperation (COI, SADC and RFMOs), though COI indicated that enforcement of control needs to be increased particularly related to port access and the level of inspections conducted. This may represent a funding capacity issue more than skills capacity though. 5 Planning for chemical spills \u2013 no level of preparedness but at least known. No current plan exists, although need has bene identified 6 Low level of stakeholder input compared to other countries in the region. The level of stakeholder input on decision making appears to be lower than other countries in the region. This may just be a representation of scale. 7 Administrative effectiveness in some Ministries may be limiting. The level of administration and setup in government Ministries may limit effectiveness. Control is very vertical with approval for decisions at most levels having to be taken up to high levels before 8 Limitations on data availability There is no one central data repository for SDG 14 related data that has public transparency and availability. Researchers often do not know what data exist, how they were collected and over what timeframes. The UoM and the MOI are working closer together but more could be done to remove the limitations on data availability. 9 Toxic waste As no dumping of toxic waste is allowed in the marine environment, all toxic waste is either stored locally (limited capacity) or must be transported at high cost to Europe for safe disposal.

There is a development plan to the pelagic resources offshore by developing a national fleet but with current effort levels and investment potential this may not happen at the desired speed. The lack of raw material for the tuna canning plant in recent times has highlighted the need to develop a national fleet that will be able to supply the plant with regular raw materials at all times. Rules of origin changes may also disrupt trade. 13 14.1 Lack of links with overseas oil protection It was noted internally that external assistance and arrangements are not in place. For example Reunion has arrangement in place with the UK company Oil Spill Response Limited (based in Singapore). May be more effective than local response for big offshore spills. 14 14.4 Lack of observers on foreign fleet (require trained observers pool) Foreign fishing vessels operating in the Mauritian EEZ (and outside but using Port Louis as a base) have low levels of observer coverage. The fleets are typically longline vessels that do not come in to port, bunkering, transhipping (under the IOTC transhipment observer programme) and receiving supplies at sea. This makes deploying and recovering observers very difficult. Observers could be trained but would need extensive coordination and cooperation from the fishing fleets to deploy and manage a successful programme. 15 14.4 14.7 14.b By catch not put to proper use ( value addition) At the moment bycatch is not fully utilised from domestic fisheries. This would add to the total value and address ecosystem impacts of continual 16 14.5 Coverage level of MPAs The required target of 10% coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas is not likely to be reached by the deadline of 2020. Only small coastal protected areas have been designated (see Strengths) but these do not appear to cover all ecosystems (e.g. banks and deep-water) or have critical areas such as the Alix Seamount been assessed as a formal exercise. Lack of potential zones for MPAs due to restricted small lagoons and outer islands that are far away from mainland. Areas such as Rodrigues could benefit from MPA status and protection. 17 14.5 MPA Management Plan No current single plan exists. ",
        "# SDG Target Weakness Description and evidence 18 14.6 Subsidies may contribute to overcapacity in domestic fisheries. The subsidies provided by Mauritius through the Fishermen Welfare Fund, provides financial incentives and certain facilities to fishing companies and the fishermen such as: \uf0b7 Scholarships to children of fishermen \uf0b7 Sickness allowance \uf0b7 Interim allowance to fishermen family in distress such as when a fisher dies at sea and is the only earner in the family. The Fund manages a scheme for bank fishermen known as Winter Allowance. The Fund and fishing operators, each contribute 2,000 rupees per bank fisherman who will participate in the scheme. The contributions received are lumped and the 6,000 rupees is provided as financial assistance to bank fishermen during the months of June, July and August in three equal instalments. It is not thought that these subsidies would contribute to overcapacity in domestic fisheries. 19 14.a Lack of research vessels The Ministry of Ocean Economy, Fisheries and Trade noted that there is a lack of research vessels in Mauritius to undertake basic research as well as that required to meet the SDG targets. 20 14.1 14.5 Pollution research not equally distributed Pollution monitoring in place in heavily studied lagoon areas with 7 key species monitored for heavy metals for instance. This is very detailed compared to other areas that could be declared MPAs where little or nothing is known about pollution levels or biodiversity. 21 14.1 Chemical spill preparedness The Ministry of Environment noted themselves that although prepared for oil spills the level of preparedness for spills of any other kind is non-existent at the moment. 3.3 Opportunities Opportunities detail any external improvement that can be taken advantage of by a country. Opportunities should be external to the country. Opportunities are a combination of different circumstances at a given time that offer a positive outcome, if they can be effectively and efficiently taken advantage of. As opportunities are external, a country cannot easily \u2018create\u2019 opportunities, they can only ensure that they are in the best position to gain the maximum benefit from any opportunities that appear, i.e. have the governmental structures in place. SDG 14 has a priority regionally and strong NGO support and access to external experts creates several positive opportunities in terms of marine resource governance. There is potential to diversify the marine sector within Mauritius, with opportunities to expand areas such as aquaculture/mariculture, offshore oil and gas, deep sea mining and renewable energies. Opportunities to improve regional coordination and share fisheries MCS resources are available under the IOC SMARTFISH programme and have indicated positive results improving levels of IUU in the region. Additionally, the regional IOC ",

Table 4: Summary of Opportunities Identified for Mauritius. # SDG Target Opportunity Description and evidence 1 COI presence beneficial (locally based international experts) COI is based at the Cybercity in Mauritius. The benefits of having this very useful organisation based in Mauritius are clear with experts and access to the programme staff locally. 2 SDG 14 has high priority regionally SDG 14 due to the nature of the Indian Ocean island States (three of the four study countries are SIDS) each with relatively large EEZs naturally makes SDG 14 a priority amongst the States. 3 Strong NGO / Intergovernmental support and pressure (UNDP etc.) There is an NGO presence in Mauritius which can provide support and funding although this may not be as strong as in other smaller SIDS. 4 Regional knowledge and experience is high (COI experience vital to region). Number of specific opportunities exist. Regional knowledge, experience and sharing is good with several regional organisations that have been shown to work well. COI is vital to the region with research, capacity building and training projects implemented under COI being well respected and very successful e.g. SMARTFISH. 5 Good access to external experts (through academic connections, new connections being developed e.g. UK NOC links) Mauritius has a history of academic and consultancy links to projects, through Ministries and organisations such as AFRC and MOI with links to previous DFID programmed for long-term research and links in development with the UK National Oceanographic Centre in Southampton. 6 Diversification of marine sector (e.g. Mariculture and offshore oil, natural gas and mining) Offshore oil and gas, as well as providing revenue from their exploitation are seen as a major potential employer in Mauritius. To develop this a requirement for strict EIAs has been included for all exploration work. It was identified that the University of Mauritius was not addressing the needs for the sector and therefore MSc and PhD students were attached to sites relating to exploration as well as BSc Coastal Engineering final year students conducting projects. Leads to an increase in experienced local staff for the industry and government oversight. 7 14.1 14.2 14.3 Renewable energy identified and possible funding Renewable energy (wind, solar and tidal) potential has been identified along with alternative funding sources. This would replace current polluting fossil fuel energy generation.

No control is exercised by the country over these factors, but there will be a benefit by having contingency plans to address them if they should occur to reduce any negative impacts. A typical threat would be \u201cGlobal warming creating negative economic impacts through reduced fishing opportunities and environmental damage\u201d. The common pool nature of a number of marine resources shared with neighbouring states makes management very difficult, and although the IOTC plays a role in managing highly migratory fish stocks, their consensus based decision making process can make agreeing strategies with other MS difficult. Common waters add additional issues, including the lack of control over external sources of marine pollution from nearby countries. Lack of MCS resources means that areas of Mauritius EEZ is susceptible to IUU activities, and there is currently a number of IUU threats to pelagic fisheries from Sri Lankan and India vessel amongst other. The short term and cyclical nature of external funding (2-3 years) is not conducive to long-term monitoring and evaluation activities to assess progress of SDG14 policy measures. Mauritius\u2019s relatively small economy and dependence on a few industries makes the country vulnerable to external economic disturbances, while future climate changes impacting natural resources may degrade its already fragile economic stability. Table 5: Summary of Threats Identified for Mauritius. # SDG Target Threat Description and evidence 1 14.4 Common pool nature of fisheries resources (including IOTC decision making processes) 15% reduction in raw material in the past year due to reductions in effort agreed at IOTC. No planning by fishing States meant that quota used up early in the year, creating an unstable resource supply for the processing factories in Mauritius. This has obvious labour and financial implications. Mauritius attempting to address through development of own fleet to stabilise supply but long-term view only (2015 15 year strategic masterplan). 2 14.1, 14.2 Common waters \u2013 pollution and marine debris sources external to Mauritius but pollution sources e.g. marine plastics not local and no control (e.g. some sourced in Madagascar). Mauritius has no control over sources of pollution and marine debris. External sources have been shown to dominate composition and the outer islands in particular have little or no control (cleaning programmes exist on Mauritius itself). Madagascar noted as a key source of pollution found in Mauritian waters. 3 14.4 Illegal fishing potential (large EEZ, low level of MCS resources) The Mauritian EEZ is very large, with a number of susceptible areas (e.g. Rodrigues) and the level of MCS resources dedicated to it at sea are relatively low. Although IUU rates in pelagic fisheries are low, there are a large number of potential IUU threats to pelagic fisheries. Illegal fishing on banks (e.g. Saya de Mahla) is high risk with known illegal fisheries conducted by Sri Lanka and India amongst others (see IOTC Compliance Committee Reports) Port control and control of Mauritian flagged vessels is higher than many countries in the region as Mauritius relies on the port as a source of income.

External funding that organisations rely on often comes in 2-3 year funding cycles. SDG 14 targets require long-term monitoring and evaluation and therefore there is a continual risk of loss of funding to these programmes, staff leaving programmes due to lack of security and the introduction of unwelcome gaps into time series of data. 5 All Economic \u2013 Global economic downturn Any large-scale global economic down-turn could impact Mauritius greatly. Relatively small economy with dependence on agriculture, fisheries and tourism and imported fuel may have negative impact. Recent diversification of economy would be of benefit to buffering any downturn. 6 14.3 Climate change Global warming and ocean acidification can contribute to coral bleaching and other natural disasters affecting vulnerable natural ecosystems and resources. 7 14.4 High investment costs for expansion of national fleet In order to generate a steady supply for national industry, the national fleet has been identified as required growth and strengthening. The investment required for the development of a larger, technically up to date offshore tuna fleet (purse seine or longline) is huge and investors are not likely to invest when the yellowfin tuna stock is at capacity 8 14.4 Current high level of regional fishing effort Foreign vessels dominate offshore tuna fisheries and has been easier to licence them than invest in own fisheries. Now fishery is known to be at or above capacity and it is difficult for SIDS to find a way of increasing national fishing effort without exceeding the fishing effort cap even when the increases or detailed in national development plans. 9 14.5 Conflicts with tourist sector This emphasises the need for integrated stakeholder involvement in a Marxan with zones style analysis to determine MPA zonation. 10 14.5 MPAs not declared to sufficient level of coverage If MPAs are not del\\cred to a sufficient level of coverage then there may be a significant loss of biodiversity and damage to valuable ecosystems mat occur.

This will identify and gaps and needs in Mauritius, by identifying where existing strengths could be used to plug gaps, i.e. using existing national experience and organisations to address a gap. These may be linked to an opportunity i.e. an existing funding stream or potential collaboration with another country or international organisation 4.1 Strengths and Opportunities \u2013 \u201cNatural Opportunities\u201d This section match a country\u2019s strengths and any existing opportunities i.e. any obvious natural priorities that currently exist. These \u201cnatural opportunities\u201d are those that a country should be able to take advantage of easily due to their existing strengths. These should present the greatest return on investment (based on money or time) as they are likely to be quickest and easiest to implement. These should justify immediate planning or assessment of feasibility. These combinations are most likely to succeed and generate good practice examples due to the matching of a country\u2019s strengths and opportunities. When these areas have not already being highlighted, then it is recommended that they are planned for with a national planning structure and prioritised, i.e. there is a need to adjust focus and reprioritise. Mauritius\u2019s political stability and commitment to Oceans Governance though the creation of Ministry of Ocean Economy and Faculty of Ocean Studies has been identified as the country\u2019s major strength. In addition, the States strong primary, secondary and tertiary academic infrastructure provides a good opportunity for Mauritius to act as a Focal Hub for studies related to the ocean sector and SDG14. Hence, the provision of tertiary training and course by Mauritian universities to students from other regional nations is recommend, also creating a de facto regional network of trained researchers. The bilateral relationship with the Seychelles and good links with NGO research provides additional natural opportunities for Mauritius to improve coverage levels of MPAs. By adopting Marxan analysis, Mauritius could effectively use scientific data and stakeholder inputs to reach the required 10% coverage of MPAs under SDG14 (As conducted in the Seychelles).

The University of Mauritius already has taken a lead through the Faculty of Ocean Studies in being able to develop courses in the sector. Currently many African universities are not capable of providing courses on the scale required due to staff and finances. Mauritius could be able to take a lead and bring in students from other States at a level that could be viable for a number of courses.

For many existing threats the current skills, funding and administrative requirements may already be in place to be able to meet these threats e.g. financial planning to ensure lean periods can be managed without having to resort to laying off of staff, cutting back on research programmers etc. Many threats are often not recognised as they have been countered effectively by standard procedures that are reviewed on a regular basis. Good practice can be developed to show how to effectively address threats in limited situation. Mauritius undertakes strong measures to reduce IUU activities, however the nature of common pool fisheries resources and high illegal fishing potential (large EEZ and low level of MCS resources) threaten its current and future progress. To improve the current situation, Mauritius should conduct further National IUU risk assessments based on scientific evidence as part of its MCS strategy to effectively utilise limited MCS resources. 24 http://cleanseas.org/ ",
        "Although Mauritius has a strong political commitment to marine governance, good MPA Management Plans and ongoing rehabilitation projects, the current coverage of protected areas does not meet the target defined under SDG14.5. Thus, to promote Mauritian MPA development, it is recommended the country considers Marxan analysis using appropriate additional scientific support to determine biodiversity hotspots. Table 7: Summary of Strength and Threat Combinations Identified for Mauritius. # Strength Threat Description and evidence 1 Strong measures undertaken to reduce IUU Common pool nature of fisheries resources (including IOTC decision making processes). Strong measures currently put in place in Mauritian waters will need to be enhanced when MPAs reach 10% or higher to meet the SDG target. Mauritius with regional partners will need to enhance MCS to ensure effective management with minimal IUU of the shared resources. This could be through the IOC Smartfish programme, through SWIOFC and IOTC programmes such as the e-PSM, the proposed centralised VMS or bilateral measures with neighbouring States.

The extension of the port is being finalised that will further enhance the capacities provided in Mauritius. Government keen on investment on national fleet High investment costs for expansion of national fleet. The planned port improvements will provide an incentive to companies wanting to invest in the Mauritian national fleet that is required to provide continual raw material to the processing plants in Mauritius. It is recommended though given the current level of effort on the tuna fisheries that this increase in the national fleet is implemented through a reflagging process of existing vessels rather than the building of new vessels that would contribute to overcapacity and also reduce investment costs. 7 Strong measures undertaken to reduce IUU Banks fisheries well- regulated with quota / licensing system Current high level of regional fishing effort. Strong measures currently put in place in Mauritian waters to manage fisheries and keep them within sustainable limits. Some shared stocks exist e.g. Saya de Mahla bank and pelagic tuna and tuna-like species that require shared management to restrict or reduce current levels of effort (both legal and illegal). Mauritius with regional partners will need to enhance MCS to ensure effective management with minimal IUU fishing of the shared resources. This could be through the IOC Smartfish programme, through SWIOFC and IOTC programmes such as the e- PSM, the proposed centralised VMS or bilateral measures with neighbouring States as appropriate.

A management plan is in place and some of the building blocks towards 14.5 are in place, including importantly a political will and commitment. It is suggested that a Marxan analysis is considered (as conducted in the Seychelles) for Mauritian MPA development. Some data are available e.g. fisheries data, ecosystem maps etc. but more data may be required. Where appropriate additional scientific support to conduct the analysis could be provided, e.g. biodiversity analysis to determine hotspots. 4.3 Weaknesses and Opportunities \u2013 \u201cAttractive Opportunities\u201d Where a national weakness has been identified but an opportunity exists these can be potentially attractive options in being able to plug a gap in funding, skills or experience. These opportunities are likely to produce good returns if the basic level of capability and implementation are viable. This could be in the form of funding and bringing in experience to enhance the skills of staff to add long-term skill capacity to a research organisation along with necessary technical equipment, e.g. Training course on otolith reading along with microscopes and otolith staining materials to remove the reliance on expensive external laboratories. Good practice examples in these cases may come from addressing current weaknesses turning those weaknesses into strengths. If weaknesses are not being addressed and opportunities exist it should be identified what is stopping or limiting progress on implementation, are assumptions correct and are plans realistic and substantial or are other weaknesses limiting the chances of exploiting opportunities e.g. poor government effectiveness limiting the ability of government research agencies to apply for and win external funding. Current planning for smaller MPAs is in place, but current coverage levels is not on the scale required to meet the demands of SDG 14.5. Progress is being hindered further by limited technical capacity required to define and manage MPAs. There are clear opportunities to utilise existing projects such as UNDP-GEF to improve MPA training, therefore filling specific knowledge gaps and improving technical capacity. ",

In these cases the assessment of risk is crucial. It is very important to understand the risks faces and ignorance of those risks is a poor state to be in. Where risks and potential impacts are shown to be low then we should highlight these issues as a low priority and ensure that countries are not distracted by them, but where the risks and / or the impacts are high then it is recommended that an assessment of funding and capability gaps is conducted and a mitigation plan developed to ensure these risks are addressed. This could be through additional funding, training, bringing in additional temporary technical assistance, or working with neighbouring States to transfer skills, personnel or equipment (e.g. rent of a patrol vessel during \u201chigh\u201d season in one EEZ during the \u201clow\u201d season in the vessel owners\u2019 EEZ) or joint purchasing and usage of high value resources.

Lack of observers on foreign fleet (require trained observers pool) Coverage level of MPAs Illegal fishing potential (large EEZ, low level of MCS resources). Science and evidence based risk assessment needs to be completed to identify high risk areas, areas of high potential impact from all various actors (i.e. risk fleets). This needs to then be developed given a clear understanding of the means and measures available (given the requirements for shared use) into a structured MCS plan to combat IUU fishing. MPAs at the moment in Mauritius are small and disjointed. Understanding of MCS requirements in the development of MPAs needs to be included, not just within Mauritius but with the potential for creating larger connected MPAs with neighbouring coastal States e.g. Seychelles where the benefit of two MPAs either side of a shared border could be assessed. This could also be combined with the planned establishment of a network of High Seas MPAs as well as defining a legal framework for these networks to be implemented by IUCN 25 .

Currently the national fleet is small compared to neighbouring States and DWFNs. The intention is to increase the national fleet in size to provide a consistent input to the processing sector at all times during the year. The cost of investment in new fishing vessels is high, and during the current need to reduce effort in tropical tuna fisheries this may be seen as a high risk investment as returns would not be as high as required. 8 Limited national fleet Current high level of regional fishing effort.

Challenges may bring unexpected benefits from working outside of normal parameters \u2013 increase skill ranges and capacity. Good practice may come from addressing weaknesses \u2013 highlights for training / capacity building. Planning question : \"What is stopping or limiting progress on implementation, are assumptions correct and are plans realistic and substantial?\" T h r e a t s \u201cThreats should be easy to defend and counter\u201d Current skills, funding and administrative requirements should be in place to be able to meet these threats. Funding and capacity should be reviewed regularly to ensure prioritisation. Generally threats neutralised. Good practice can be developed to show how to effectively address threats in limited situation. Planning question : \"Are threats properly informed and organisation in place to deal with threats? No surprises. Regional threats be turned into local opportunities?\" \u201cPotentially high risk scenarios\u201d Assessment of risk crucial \u2013 ignorance is a poor state to be in. Where risk is low then we should highlight these issues as a low priority and not be distracted by them (financial planning). Where risk is high assess funding and capability gaps and develop mitigation plan. Planning question : \"Are risks and impacts assessed for these issues? Where the risks / impacts are high are specific mitigation plans in place?\" ",
