The information on the employment practices, including the number of persons with disabilities employed, or the reasonable accommodation measures is therefore subjective and the European Commission is consequently not liable for the validity of the information. This Guide was prepared by Dr. Magdi Birtha, Rapporteur of the EUvsDiscrimination campaign, researcher at the European Centre for Social Welfare Policy and Research.

        "EUvsDISCRIMINATION CAMPAIGN For the purpose of the campaign, a campaign website, a leaflet and videos have been produced in all official EU languages, and a social media strategy was also launched. The EU website provided citizens with details of their national equality bodies so they can have more information on how to enforce their rights. Another strand of the campaign focused specifically on reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities. The European Commission therefore organised a set of events between May 2019 and February 2020 in Member States where the employment gap between persons with and without disabilities is among the biggest in the EU. The actions aimed to raise awareness among EU employers and citizens, who are not aware of the paossibilities granted by EU legislation, to fight discrimination at the workplace. These events provided a good opportunity to meet and discuss directly with employers the advantages of hiring persons with disabilities, as well as the experiences of providing them with reasonable accommodation. In order to inform EU citizens of their rights not to be discriminated against, in May 2019, the European Commission launched the #EUvsDiscrimination campaign.

        "BACKGROUND 02 EU in 2015\u201d, almost half of the people would not know their rights in case of discrimination. 3 Surveys also show that around one in eight Europeans consider themselves part of a group at risk of discrimination because they are in a racial or ethnic minority, have a disability, or because of their sex, sexual orientation, age, religion and/or beliefs. Discrimination, hate speech and attacks against minorities unfortunately remain a daily reality for many people in the European Union. Notably, a significant gap of 24.2 percentage points still exists between the employment situation of persons with and without disabilities. 4 This means that persons with disabilities are less likely to be employed than persons without disabilities and the gap is even larger for persons with more severe disabilities. Having been traditionally excluded from the labour market has resulted in persons with disabilities being subject to social exclusion and deprivation as well as put at higher risk of poverty and presented with significant barriers to their participation in society. Nevertheless, employment is key to achieve social inclusion, reduce poverty and inequalities across the Union. Such persistent employment gap exists, despite the EU and all of its Member States ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD) , which explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the labour market and calls on States Parties to ensure reasonable accommodation in the workplace. Reasonable accommodation means necessary and appropriate adjustments should be made to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment of their human rights. Providing reasonable accommodation improves the access of persons with disabilities to the open labour market. The legislation requires employers not to discriminate at work and secures the right of employees not to be discriminated against. EU law therefore guarantees that people working in the EU are entitled to equal treatment in recruitment, working conditions, promotion, pay, access to vocational training, occupational pensions and dismissal. All EU Member States have long transposed this Directive into national law. However, there are still too many people who are not aware of these rights and the protection it offers. In 2014, the Joint Report on the application of the Racial Equality Directive and the Employment Equality Directive concluded that \u201cthe main challenge now is to increase awareness of the already existing protection and to ensure its better practical implementation and application\u201d. 2 According to a Special Eurobarometer on \u201cDiscrimination in the THE EU EMPLOYMENT EQUALITY DIRECTIVE (DIRECTIVE 2000/78/EC) BANS WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION ON THE GROUNDS OF AGE, SEX, DISABILITY, ETHNIC OR RACIAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR BELIEF, OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. 1 Since 2000, equal treatment legislation at EU level has set out minimum levels of protection for everyone working in the EU. 0 8 B A C K G R O U N D E U v s D I S C R I M I N A T I O N C A M P A I G N ",

The aim of this Guide is to improve the general understanding on what reasonable accommodation means and how to put it into practice. The Guide focuses specifically on reasonable accommodation and disability and will highlight some of the benefits of employing persons with disabilities in the open labour market. To some extent, it will serve as a myth buster to tackle the most common stereotypes and misconceptions about the costs, or complications of providing reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities. The Guide showcases promising practices from across the EU of committed public and private employers who already support the labour market inclusion of persons with disabilities through various measures and a great vision of creating a diverse and flexible working environment. All of them agree on one thing: having persons with disabilities in their offices and companies is a win-win situation for everyone. Finally, the Guide will hopefully inspire other employers to hire more persons with disabilities and find solutions to provide them with reasonable accommodation. 1 0 B A C K G R O U N D E U v s D I S C R I M I N A T I O N C A M P A I G N ",
        "WHAT TYPES OF WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION EXIST? Harassment is another form of workplace discrimination. This is unwanted conduct, bullying or ot he r behaviour that has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. For example, if a boss or colleagues tell jokes based on sexual orientation to one of their gay/lesbian colleagues. Instruction to discriminate is when a person incites an oth er to discriminate against someone else. For example, if an employer asks a temporary work agency to find only workers aged under 40. Victimisation is where people suffer negative consequences in reaction to a complaint about discrimination. For example, if someone has been dismissed or refused promotion because they filed a discrimination complaint against their boss. Direct discrimination is when an employer treats you worse than someone else in a comparable situation, on the grounds of age, sex, disability, ethnic or racial origin, religion or belief, or sexual orientation. An example would be to refuse to recruit someone because they are over 50 years old. Indirect discrimination is where a practice, policy or rule that applies to everyone has a negative effect on some people. These measures seem neutral at first sight, but actually discriminate against certain people. For example, implementing rules that are unfavourable for part-time workers may indirectly discriminate against women as most part-time workers are women.

        "Reasonable accommodation is any change to a job or a work environment that is needed to enable a person with a disability to apply, to perform and to advance in job functions, or undertake training on an equal basis with others. The purpose of reasonable accommodation is to enable persons with disabilities to have access to, participate in, or advance in employment. Employees with disabilities thus could achieve the same work outputs and have equal opportunities as non-disabled employees, by doing things a bit differently. Reasonable accommodation is aimed at any employee with a disability. The right to reasonable accommodation extends to all work-related activities covered by EU law, from the job application process through termination, and includes working conditions and fringe benefits. If you have a disability and believe you need adjustments to your job or workplace, you can request reasonable accommodation. WHAT IS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION? WHAT DOES THE LAW SAY? Under the EU\u2019s Employment Equality Directive , employers have to provide reasonable accommodation to employees with disabilities, to the extent that doing so would not impose a disproportionate burden on the employer. This sets reasonable accommodation duties, which may include technical solutions like providing equipment. According to the Directive, reasonable accommodation means that: Employers shall take appropriate measures, where needed in a particular case, to enable a person with a disability to have access to, participate in, or advance in employment, or to undergo training, unless such measures would impose a disproportionate burden on the employer. This burden shall not be disproportionate when it is sufficiently remedied by measures existing within the framework of the disability policy of the Member State concerned. (Article 5, Council Directive 2000/78/EC) Reasonable accommodation is also an obligation under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) , to which the EU and all its Member States are parties. The Convention defines reasonable accommodation as: \u201cNecessary and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or undue burden, where needed in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.\u201d (Article 2, UNCRPD). 03 1 2 W H A T I S R E A S O N A B L E A C C O M M O D A T I O N ?

        "WHAT ACCOMMODATION MYTHS ABOUT REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION CAN BE OFFERED? Other cases of reasonable accommodation might relate to: Working arrangements, like providing flexible working hours, teleworking, leave, relocation to a new office or redeployment to a different job if requested by the employee. Training to support employees to use assistive technology when at work and mentoring to enable employees to overcome any barriers they encounter in the workplace. Modifying procedures and policies, like centralising the system through which employees can request accessibility support. A wareness raising measures so that persons with disabilities can perform their job in a supportive working environment. The technical solutions might include: Installing elevators or ramps. Putting office furniture at an appropriate height. Installing computer software such as screen readers, screen magnifiers or speech, recognition software, etc. Providing Braille terminals. Installing real time interpretation via telecommunications. It is important to note that reasonable accommodation complements accessibility measures and when accessibility is already guaranteed, the arrangement of reasonable accommodation, in relation to technical devices is much simpler and less expensive. It is usually expensive. It is complicated to provide the accommodations to employees with disabilities. Specialist expertise is always needed to plan and offer reasonable accommodation. It is not a priority for the top leadership of the company to employ persons with disabilities. Employing persons with disabilities would increase health and safety risks. The main types of reasonable accommodation include technical solutions, working arrangements, training measures and awareness raising measures. CHECKBOX: WHAT IS \u2018REASONABLE\u2019? Will it work? Does it address the particular needs of the employee with a disability? Is it practical? Will it result in unsustainable direct and indirect costs to the employer? If costs are incurred, are external resources (money subsidies & expertise) available to support employers? Will it disrupt other employees from being able to do their jobs? Can it be done without health and safety implications? 1 3 W H A T I S R E A S O N A B L E A C C O M M O D A T I O N ? E U v s D I S C R I M I N A T I O N C A M P A I G N ",
        "PROMISING PRACTICES OF This section of the Guide presents the promising practices received as part of the #EUvsDiscrimination campaign, following the lively discussions with employers during the national awareness-raising events. It was an important aspect during the selection process to feature employers from both the public and private sectors. These are committed employers, who hired persons with disabilities in the open labour market and have already showed great leadership in how to successfully provide reasonable accommodation to employees with disabilities in different working environments. Reading through these promising practices, it is clear that several employers are already committed across Europe to creating an inclusive workplace by making some necessary adjustments, because they consider the recruitment of persons with disabilities improved the working environment and performance of their businesses.

        "BRUXELLES ENVIRONMENT (BELGIUM) Environment/ Public administration 5 www.environnement.brussels AREA OF ACTIVITY CONTACT NUMBER OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES EMPLOYED: Since January 2018, Bruxelles Environment has sought to recruit persons with disabilities for all kinds of positions (e.g. field workers, administrative staff, management, non-management etc.) under different contracts (permanent contracts, fixed-term contracts etc.). They have introduced a number of concrete measures to ensure the successful recruitment and integration of employees with disabilities: DESCRIPTION OF THE PROMISING PRACTICE A clear statement and checkbox is included in the job application forms, emphasising that Bruxelles Environment wants to recruit people from diverse backgrounds without discrimination and that persons with disabilities can ask for reasonable accommodations; The recruitment process can be adapted to meet the needs of persons with disabilities (e.g. sign language interpretation, test adaptations); A comprehensive accessibility audit in their offices resulted in carrying out necessary adaptations for the smooth integration of employees with disabilities; Exchanged experiences with other public administrations to expand and improve their inclusive employment policy; All staff members received written communication about the inclusive employment policy of the organisation and about 50 employees participated in an internal awareness-raising event. Bruxelles Environment recognised that there is a real professional interest in recruiting persons with disabilities. When hiring someone with a disability, the organisation wants their integration to be as smooth as possible in a non-discriminating, reassuring and attentive environment. The management of the organisation is committed to provide stable financial support to employ persons with disabilities and provide them with reasonable accommodation (e.g. in 2018, the cost of sign language interpretation was \u20ac 30 000). Awareness of the staff is key to include employees with disability in the team, so when a deaf gardener was recruited on an open-ended contract, Bruxelles Environment organised 4 half-day French sign language classes to his direct colleagues during working hours in collaboration with a specialised association.

        "LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE Persons with disabilities are usually underrepresented among applicants. Therefore, Bruxelles Environment collaborates with associations of persons with disabilities and service providers at the regional level to find suitable candidates. Nevertheless, the human resources team had to be carefully prepared to judge candidates with disabilities only on their skills, without any prejudice towards their impairments. There are also a number of administrative challenges. For instance, Bruxelles Environment wants to employ persons with disabilities on a special contract, but it is difficult to combine such arrangements with the specificities of their own administration. Public procurement can also make it difficult to provide reasonable accommodation, for example if a sign language interpreter needs to be contracted on a short notice for the recruitment process. Fighting stereotypes and changing mentalities is a long process that should take place at different levels. Awareness-raising should continue even several years after the recruitment of a person with a disability, or members of any other vulnerable groups. Staff members need to understand that reasonable accommodation is not about favouring one candidate over another, but it is a measure to ensure candidates would have the same opportunities to deliver the same output. It is important to emphasise that employing someone with a disability is not a charity project for Bruxelles Environment, but brings a real added value to the organisation. The project will further develop in the near future, through better collaboration with other regional administrations, greater cohesion between different support services, internal investment in this area (both in human and financial terms) and through continued awareness-raising. 1 7 E X A M P L E S F R O M T H E P U B L I C S E C T O R E U v s D I S C R I M I N A T I O N C A M P A I G N ",
        "The Government of the Province of Biscay has had a longstanding commitment and experience in employing persons with disabilities, except for persons with intellectual disabilities. Thus, in 2017, the Government approved an offer of public employment for five service staff places targeting persons with intellectual disabilities. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROMISING PRACTICE Public administration 5 https://web.bizkaia.eus/ AREA OF ACTIVITY CONTACT NUMBER OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES EMPLOYED: The call aimed to recruit five civil servants through a standard, but adapted, multi-stage recruitment process. The overarching goal was to support the social and labour market inclusion of the most disadvantaged people. The specificity of this call required the Government to adopt new ways of working, including more flexible arrangements. Political commitment played a fundamental role in making this initiative successful. The Government received a total of 281 applications, of which five people were recruited and 146 people were added to a job bank, for further potential openings.

        "LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE The recruitment process had four distinct phases, each playing a key role in achieving positive results: 1. Understanding the needs of persons with intellectual disabilities: Elimination of existing prejudices and stereotypes, training to HR staff on how to prepare documentation in easy-to-read in relation to the call, internal awareness-raising trainings, involvement of persons with intellectual disabilities in the whole process. 2. Organising the recruitment process in an accessible way: A standard recruitment process was used to comply with all legal requirements for entering a public employment post, but it was adapted to the needs of persons with intellectual disabilities. Besides providing information in accessible format, it was also important to ensure safeguarding and mentoring throughout the whole process, as well as to provide a calm and safe environment (e.g. choosing an exam centre that is bright and easy to access by public transport). 3. Providing adequate support: A partnership agreement was signed with third party entities to support the successful candidates with job coaching and mentoring. 4. Taking up employment and induction training: The selected candidates could take part in several visits, together with their families and the job coaches to learn about the workplace and attend training sessions. A point of contact was designated for each of them in their respective departments to provide direct support. During the induction meeting, all appointed candidates signed the necessary documents to enter civil service, prepared in easy-to-read format. To date, the five recruited persons with intellectual disabilities successfully perform their tasks and integrated well in their teams. The project therefore marks the beginning of taking a different and truly inclusive approach towards providing employment opportunities as civil servants for all persons with disabilities. The initiative of the Government of the Province of Biscay has already received several awards and prizes for their cooperation with the third sector and for the promotion of the rights of persons with intellectual disabilities in Spain. It is a successful model, recommended to other public authorities to adopt it. The main challenges during the implementation of the project were mostly operational and attitudinal. Existing stereotypes, the lack of protocols to accommodate the needs of persons with intellectual disabilities, as well as the complexity of creating a calm and friendly recruitment process were the major issues to tackle. For the long-term sustainability of this initiative, it is important to maintain close connection with the media, to disseminate results and showcase that persons with intellectual disabilities can be fully integrated in public administration jobs. They also aim to further improve the process, based on the evaluation results and to open further positions at different levels of the administration, not only at lower level.

        "EMPLOYING PERSONS ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM AT THE NATIONAL OFFICE FOR THE JUDICIARY (HUNGARY) NATIONAL OFFICE FOR THE JUDICIARY (HUNGARY) Magistracy AREA OF ACTIVITY In 2013, following the establishment of the National Office for the Judiciary in Hungary, the management had a clear goal to involve highly qualified members of a disadvantaged group in the work of the Office. After thorough consideration, they contacted AURA Association (https://www.auraegyesulet.hu/), a bottom-up NGO, with vast experience in supporting the social and labour market inclusion of persons on the autism spectrum. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROMISING PRACTICE The aim was to find suitable candidates, with the help of AURA for specific tasks, including filing, archiving, managing archived documents, digitalisation of documents and in-house delivery service, among others. These tasks are generally considered repetitive; thus, it has always been challenging to find staff members with the necessary educational background (minimum high school degree) and motivation to stay on this job. The selection, assessment and training of the candidates on the autism spectrum was carried out by AURA. Mentors from AURA attended the job interviews and supported the selected candidates to settle into their new positions. They also advised the Judiciary on how to create an accessible, autism-friendly working environment, for instance by creating special workstations. 7 https://birosag.hu/en CONTACT NUMBER OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES EMPLOYED: H U N G A R Y 2 0 E X A M P L E S F R O M T H E P U B L I C S E C T O R E U v s D I S C R I M I N A T I O N C A M P A I G N ",
        "LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE special attention has been paid to fully involve staff members on the autism spectrum in the social activities of the Office too (e.g. Christmas celebrations, team building days etc.). Since the beginning of the project, member organisations of the National Office for the Judiciary, such as the Registry Court in Budapest, or the Central District Court in Buda, also joined the initiative and now employ in total seven persons on the autism spectrum. The project helped participants to acquire a stable, well-paid job in the public sector, become tax-payers and afford to live independently. The involvement of an expert NGO was key for the quality assurance of the project. AURA also acted as a mediator in situations that required conflict resolution between the employer and the new staff members. In the experiences of AURA, the lack of adequate reasonable accommodation measures often led to the job loss of people on the autism spectrum. However, in most cases, there are easy ways to resolve misunderstandings and provide people with the necessary support. Reasonable accommodation measures in this project included more flexibility regarding the starting of the working day or allowing more regular breaks for employees to rest. Staff members of the judiciary also attended a series of training sessions to prepare them for welcoming the new colleagues and break down any existing stereotypes. Since their recruitment, The National Office for the Judiciary considers their project a promising practice and believes that persons on the autism spectrum could also contribute to the work of other public administration offices in Hungary. Several workshops have been organised to engage with the management of various public authorities, as part of their corporate social responsibility. The Judiciary recommends other public employers to identify for which specific tasks they need new staff members and assess if there is a specific group of persons with disabilities that could be trained and employed for that role. The involvement of an expert NGO is a guarantee for smooth recruitment, training and induction. The positive attitude of existing staff is also important to ensure good integration in the teams.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROMISING PRACTICE The SIAMU Diversity Charter was the first step to establish company values that respect diversity and differences. Today, in SIAMU 10 out of the 250 administrative staff have either a federal and/ or regional disability recognition. Furthermore, 4 of the firefighters also have a disability and a new reassignment procedure will make it possible to better support firefighters with disabilities. The organisation believes that what helps breaking stereotypes the most is to start working with persons with disabilities. A committed Diversity Manager plays a key role in the successful inclusion of persons with disabilities, as well as the involvement of both internal and external stakeholders and services. Furthermore, the diversity plan of SIAMU includes measures to raise the awareness of residents of Brussels with disabilities about the evacuation procedure when they attend public events. Several measures supporting the inclusion of persons with disabilities in the work of SIAMU have been taken: Continued engagement with persons with disabilities within the administrative and technical framework of SIAMU; Provision of accessible infrastructure for persons with disabilities (lifts, parking, sanitary facilities, door openings etc.); Providing employees with disabilities with various forms of reasonable accommodation; Ensuring good integration through awareness raising among staff members; Collaboration with the external support service for persons with disabilities (Diversicom) based on an annual agreement; Inclusion of diversity, gender and disability mainstreaming in different annual plans of the SIAMU departments and services.

        "LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE For SIAMU, a key element is to already create a supportive environment during the recruitment process, through which staff members feel encouraged to share whether they have a disability, including invisible disabilities (e.g. mental health problems). Knowing the individual needs of new staff members and raising awareness of the Human Resources team facilitates the employment of this group. Nevertheless, it is essential to continue making the built environment of SIAMU offices fully accessible. It is also necessary to better inform all staff members about the various recognition and assistance rules, especially for those who are not aware of being disabled, or who do not know that they would have access to recognition or assistance.

        "Following a regional ordinance, the Commune of Uccle was obliged to create a Diversity Plan in order to eliminate any discrimination within the administration. Since February 2017, public administrations in Belgium are also obliged to meet a 2.5% quota to hire employees with disabilities. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROMISING PRACTICE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIVERSITY PLAN AT THE COMMUNE OF UCCLE (BELGIUM) 0 2 4 E U V S D I S C R I M I N A T I O N C A M P A I G N I N T R O D U C T I O N As a first step, the Commune of Uccle undertook an internal awareness-raising action to sensitise all employees and prepare them to welcome colleagues with disabilities. As part of the European campaign \u201cDuoday\u201d, persons with disabilities began by taking part in a short internship programme (length between 1 and 20 days) to get a first impression of working in one of the departments of the Commune, together with a dedicated tutor. There was strong collaboration between the Commune of Uccle and Phare (Regional body for persons with disabilities in Brussels) to identify which job profiles could be open for candidates with disabilities and which type of adjustments are needed. Through Phare and its members (e.g. Bataclan, InfoSound, Le Gu\u00e9, Sisham), the Commune of Uccle can reach potential candidates much easier for specific job profiles and contract them for an internship programme. Following the internship, candidates may be offered a 1-year Professional Adaptation Contract (CAP) which can be renewed for another year. The problem with CAP is that persons are not entitled to any paid leave, nor paid sick leave during the duration of their contracts. Since the beginning of the programme, 2 people received a regular contract, upon completion of the internship programme and the 2-years of CAP. At the moment, 4 people are taking part in the internship programme and 8 employees with disabilities have a CAP contract. In the last 3 years, there has been significant change in the mentality among all employees of the Commune, now acknowledging colleagues with disabilities for their skills and contribution to the municipality. Persons with disabilities proved to be valuable team members and are enthusiastic about the job they carry out. A constant dialogue between an appointed mentor and the employees was important to ensure smooth settling into their new positions. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge for the Commune of Uccle to find persons with disabilities for certain positions without positive discrimination, but with the provision of reasonable accommodation. There is no preferential treatment, or reserved places for persons with disabilities at the Commune, but the aim is to hire people, based on their training and skills, under the same rules applied to everyone else.

Since people are trained for specific job profiles, it is not easy to offer them a contract in another department, within the same municipal administration office.

Throughout those years, she has built a successful career in public service. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROMISING PRACTICE F R A N C E ADJUSTING A PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT SERVICE OFFICE FOR THE NEEDS OF AN EMPLOYEE WITH DISABILITY (FRANCE) As an employment counsellor at the Public Employment Service, her job is to help unemployed people with registering in the French unemployment system and to inform them about the services of the agency. More specifically, she informs people about their file status, manages their demands, accelerates, and updates the compensation files of customers and she is also acting as the fraud referent of the office. She is managing the files of 350 unemployed people in the community. In order to enable her to carry out the job, several reasonable accommodation measures were introduced in the C\u00e9ret office. She met with an ergonomist, who planned carefully the most suitable office space for her (e.g. large desk fitted to her wheelchair). She also received financial support to make her car door opening system automatized and personalise the accelerator and the brake, placed on her wheel. As the manager of the Employment Service described: She worked really hard to prove to anyone, that persons with disabilities can do better work. She is very passionate about helping people getting a new job, a true fighter against unemployment. The increased awareness within the Employment Service also led to improvements in the reception area to welcome clients with disabilities. For instance, computers are set at a lower height, so unemployed people with wheelchairs can also use them to search vocational training opportunities on the job centre\u2019s data basis.

The Public Employment Service in C\u00e9ret will continue to work towards eliminating all forms of discrimination at the workplace for their staff, as well as their clients. This example shows that persons with disabilities can also be employed in smaller administrations, or companies with less available resources. The Public Employment Service in C\u00e9ret is convinced that such success stories should be widely shared, therefore they support their employee to go to awareness- raising events in schools and companies where meeting with employers can directly contribute to breaking stereotypes. Colleagues at the Employment Service became also more open towards job seekers with disabilities as they saw themselves that disability is not an obstacle and someone can build a successful career.

This shifted away from a medical towards a trust-based, person-centred approach regarding disability and individual needs in general. With this single point of entry, staff members can quickly resolve accessibility issues at the workplace. An Accessibility Centre is also set-up to provide information and advice to all employees by senior HR advisors. They also play a key role during the hiring of new staff members, together with the disability focal points (designated in different Shell locations) to ensure that needs are adequately assessed and addressed by the time people take up their new role. Shell also finds it important to constantly communicate (e.g. through internal newsletters, staff meetings etc.) about this service and country organisations often remind and encourage employees to use it. To date, the WPA service received more than 1500 adjustment requests via the online platform and the Accessibility Centre (50% in Europe). Employees who already used the service provided positive feedback, such as a staff member in the Bulgarian office: I was very happy with this service and the agent was able to offer a suitable product which arrived in a timely manner.

This gives more stability and assurance for waiting staff with Down- syndrome. Adapted placemats help staff members to visualise the place of cutleries. In the kitchen, a special workstation has been set up and many ergonomic tools and utensils are used to support employees. Furthermore, various visual aids and pictograms have been created for each employee to improve their skills and autonomy in the job. The main difficulties during the project implementation derived from administrative burdens. Since the opening, Le Reflet has been featured more than 120 times in various media channels and the reviews of customers is excellent, both in terms of the food quality, as well as the atmosphere and overall experience. The restaurant received several awards too. Besides job creation, an important social goal was to break down stereotypes and promote the social inclusion of persons with disabilities in the wider public. After a year of fundraising, the Restaurant Le Reflet opened its doors, employing 7 persons with intellectual disabilities with permanent work contracts and an ordinary salary. The restaurant runs a traditional French kitchen, is open from Tuesday to Friday for lunch, and from Thursday to Saturday also for dinner. They offer a set menu of freshly produced meals, changing every 2-weeks. The novelty of this project lies in the use of design solutions to enable persons with disabilities to carry out their jobs in the kitchen, but also as waiting staff. For instance, the order taking system has been adapted to staff with reading, writing or memory difficulties. Customers are provided with order cards, where they can simply stamp their choices of meals and drinks. Since the grip and palmar creases of Le Reflet is proud to have developed a control system which could be used as a flagship tool for catering companies who would like to employ persons with intellectual disabilities or persons with memory difficulties. The success of the project lies in the multi-stakeholder collaboration with experts from different fields. The restaurant already expanded and opened a new location in central Paris. F R A N C E Flore Leli\u00e8vre decided to open a restaurant where persons like her older brother with Down-syndrome could work, like everyone else.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROMISING PRACTICE The aim was to include more persons with disabilities in the work of the company, beyond production, also in the sales, marketing, and accounting departments. Currently, more than 50% of the total number of employees are persons with different types of disabilities, having full-time contracts. The company provides tailor-made reasonable accommodation measures to all employees who need it. For instance, a personal assistance is supporting a staff member with Down-syndrome. About 10% of the employees are deaf people, which raised initially some challenges in communication. Supervisors participated in some training to learn the basic signs, so they can interact with their employees directly. Sign language interpreters are contracted to support during company-wide meetings, or company trips. Before hiring persons with physical impairments, the entrances, bathrooms were made accessible and customised workspaces were created. Staff members with disabilities are fully integrated in the company and attend trainings and various social events, just like any other employees. A common challenge with employees with disabilities was that most of them worked a bit slower, so the company now plans with longer production time when they take on new orders. The commitment of the General Manager was indispensable in creating an inclusive and supporting working environment for all.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROMISING PRACTICE Therefore, Etincelle decided to become a social enterprise and directly create jobs for persons with disabilities in the gastronomy and cleaning sectors. The initial project was supported by the European Social Fund. By now, they are financially independent and run ten caf\u00e9s, six cleaning groups and a farm, employing in total almost 150 persons with intellectual disabilities. Nevertheless, building on these experiences, Etincelle is shifting its focus back again on supporting persons with disabilities to find jobs in the open labour market.

As a social enterprise, they offer facility services to companies who are outsourcing these tasks, including: Cleaning services Facility management Supplies & services Maintenance CSR consulting In 2019-2020, Grupo SIFU launched an inclusive employment programme to foster the access of persons with disabilities to the open labour market. In order to improve their employability in the open labour market, over 30 000 hours training were provided to more than 1300 people. In 2019, they helped over 100 employees in their transition to the open labour market. Furthermore, the Grupo SIFU Foundation is a non-profit association, running awareness-raising and sensitivity trainings for companies in the open labour market to convince them of the advantages of hiring persons with disabilities. In 2020, Grupo SIFU also won the business category of the \u2018Employment for All\u2019 Awards of the European Association of Service Providers for Persons with Disabilities. 4 4 E X A M P L E S F R O M T H E P R I V A T E S E C T O R S P A I N E U v s D I S C R I M I N A T I O N C A M P A I G N ",
        "LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE In Spain, anti-discrimination legislation imposes a 2% quota for companies to include persons with disabilities in their workforce and favour the services provided by socially inclusive enterprises, whenever possible. In case, a company cannot meet the 2% quota, it is possible to fulfil their obligations by contracting social enterprises that employ persons with disabilities for various services. However, in Spain 81% of private companies do not meet their legal obligations. According to Grupo SIFU, there are still persistent stereotypes and a lack of knowledge in society that present obstacles for persons with disabilities to find a job in the open labour market. Their mission is therefore to show through high- quality services that employing persons with disabilities can be a successful business model. 4 5 E X A M P L E S F R O M T H E P R I V A T E S E C T O R E U v s D I S C R I M I N A T I O N C A M P A I G N ",

By now, the \u201cValuable \u2013 handing opportunities\u201d is a trademark that partner companies in the network can use to reflect their commitment at three levels: Bronze, Silver and Golden. The Golden version is granted employers who recruit at least one worker with intellectual disabilities and act as ambassadors of the trademark. These placements in the open labour market supported persons with intellectual disabilities to become more independent at work, but also in their personal life, due to many new skills they developed and thanks to the income they make. The aim of the project is to enhance the Corporate Social Responsibility by promoting the labour market inclusion of persons with intellectual disabilities through targeted placement in the hospitality sector. There are already over 100 committed partner companies in the \u201cValueable Network\u201d (hotels, restaurants, and cafes), offering internships, or paid employment in the open labour market to 226 persons with intellectual disabilities in total. 75 people have been employed with a temporary or permanent work contract.

It covers 6 European countries: Italy, Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Germany and Turkey. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROMISING PRACTICE LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE The increasing number of hotels, restaurants and other companies involved in the \u201cValuable Network\u201d shows that the hospitality sector is committed to the labour market inclusion of persons with intellectual disabilities and see them as reliable workforce, if provided with reasonable accommodation measures. The project contributed to a more supportive and effective working environment at the companies and raised awareness in the wider public. One of the challenges were that persons with disabilities often lack the necessary training or ambition to seek employment in the open labour market, due to long-lasting stigma and social exclusion. The project will need sustainable financing, in order to provide a stable, reliable perspective for persons with intellectual disabilities to find jobs in the hospitality sector. 4 7 E X A M P L E F R O M C I V I L S O C I E T Y E U v s D I S C R I M I N A T I O N C A M P A I G N ",

        "HOW CAN YOU CHALLENGE DISCRIMINATION AT WORK? You can pursue discrimination cases through criminal, civil or administrative proceedings, depending on Member State laws. A negotiated solution is sometimes possible between you and your employer via Member State mediation agents. This is usually quicker and less costly. After you present evidence of discrimination, employers facing complaints have to show there was no discrimination based on the prohibited grounds. The EU non-discrimination Directives shift the burden of proof, making it easier for victims of discrimination to lodge complaints. If the claim goes to court, legal aid and advice may be available from equality bodies, trade unions, NGOs or lawyers. If the national court needs guidance on the interpretation of the EU non-discrimination Directives, it may refer to the European Court of Justice preliminary questions. You should collect any evidence needed to support your claim, like letters, e-mails and other documents. You need to show that you were treated unequally and that it was because of your sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, religion or belief, or racial or ethnic origin. It is then for the employer to prove that there has been no breach of the principle of equal treatment because his/her decision was based on other legitimate reasons. You can complain to the European Commission if you think legislation in your Member State is not compatible with EU law. However, the Commission cannot intervene in individual cases. You can contact your national equality body as it is able to negotiate between you and your employer. In some cases, it can also bring cases before the court (see above for the contact details of your National equality body). WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAVE BEEN A VICTIM OF DISCRIMINATION? WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LODGE A COMPLAINT BEFORE NATIONAL COURTS? 5 4 E X A M P L E S F R O M T H E P R I V A T E S E C T O R E U v s D I S C R I M I N A T I O N C A M P A I G N ",
        "While EU law does not state what remedies are available, it says that effective, proportionate, and dissuasive penalties are needed.

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOUR COMPLAINT SUCCEEDS? 5 5 E X A M P L E S F R O M T H E P R I V A T E S E C T O R E U v s D I S C R I M I N A T I O N C A M P A I G N ",
