        "I (Legislative acts) REGULATIONS REGULATION (EU) 2021/1529 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 15 September 2021 establishing the Instrument for Pre-Accession assistance (IPA III) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 212(2) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 2 ), Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure ( 3 ), Whereas: (1) Regulation (EU) No 231/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 4 ) expired on 31 December 2020. In order to maintain the Union\u2019s effectiveness in external action, a framework for planning and delivering external assistance should be maintained for the period between 2021 and 2027. (2) The objective of an instrument for pre-accession assistance is to prepare beneficiaries for future membership of the Union and to support their accession process. It is therefore essential to have a dedicated instrument for pre- accession assistance to the beneficiaries listed in Annex I for the 2021-2027 period (IPA III) in support of enlargement, while ensuring that its objectives and functioning are consistent with, and complementary to, the general objectives of Union external action as laid down in Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), including respect for fundamental rights and principles as well as the protection and promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. This instrument should also be complementary with the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument \u2013 Global Europe (NDICI) established under Regulation (EU) 2021/947 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 5 ).

        "(3) Article 49 TEU provides that any European State which respects the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, and is committed to promoting those values may apply to become a member of the Union. Those values are common to Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail. (4) A European State which has applied to join the Union can become a member of the Union only where it has been confirmed that it fully meets the accession criteria established at the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 (the \u2018Copenhagen criteria\u2019) and provided that the Union has the capacity to integrate the new member. The Copenhagen criteria relate to the stability of institutions which guarantee democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union, and the ability to assume not only the rights but also the obligations under the Treaties, including the pursuit of the aims of political, economic and monetary union. (5) The enlargement policy of the Union is a strategic investment in peace, security, stability and prosperity in Europe and allows the Union to be better positioned to address global challenges. It also provides increased economic and trade opportunities to the mutual benefit of the Union and the aspiring Member States, while ensuring a gradual transformation of the beneficiaries. The prospect of Union membership has a powerful transformative effect, embedding positive democratic, political, economic and societal change. (6) The enlargement process is built on established criteria and fair and rigorous conditionality. Each beneficiary is assessed on its own merits. The assessment of progress achieved and the identification of shortcomings aim to provide incentives and guidance to the beneficiaries listed in Annex I to pursue the necessary far-reaching reforms. For the prospect of enlargement to become a reality, a firm commitment to \u2018fundamentals first\u2019 remains essential. The \u2018fundamentals first\u2019 approach links the rule of law and fundamental rights with the two other crucial areas of the accession process: economic governance \u2013 strengthened focus on economic development and improved competitiveness \u2013 and the strengthening of democratic institutions and public administration reform. Each of the three fundamentals is of crucial importance for the reform processes in the beneficiaries listed in Annex I and addresses key concerns of the people. Progress towards accession depends on each applicant\u2019s respect for the Union\u2019s values and its capacity to undertake and implement the necessary reforms to align its political, institutional, legal, administrative and economic systems with the rules, standards, policies and practices of the Union. (7) Good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation are essential elements of the enlargement process and are critical for security and stability of the Union as a whole. The definitive, inclusive and binding resolution of bilateral disputes is also important. (8) Embracing and committing to core European values is a choice, and is essential for all partners aspiring to Union membership. In line with this, the partners should take ownership and fully commit to European values as well as to upholding a global order based on rules and values and vigorously pursuing the necessary reforms in the interest of their people. This includes progressive alignment with the Union\u2019s common foreign and security policy, in particular on issues where major common interests are at stake, such as restrictive measures and tackling disinformation and other hybrid threats. (9) The Commission emphasised the firm, merit-based prospect of Union membership for the Western Balkans in its communication of 6 February 2018 entitled \u2018A credible enlargement perspective for and enhanced EU engagement with the Western Balkans\u2019. On 5 February 2020, the Commission presented a revised methodology for the accession process in its communication entitled \u2018Enhancing the accession process \u2013 A credible EU perspective for the Western Balkans\u2019, which was endorsed by the Council. The Commission also presented an economic and investment plan for the Western Balkans for their recovery over the longer term following the COVID-19 crisis. (10) The Union and its Member States, in the Sofia Declaration of 17 May 2018 and the Zagreb Declaration of 6 May 2020, reaffirmed their unequivocal support for the European perspective of the Western Balkans as well as their engagement at all levels to support the region\u2019s political, economic and social transformation. In the Zagreb Declaration, the Union and its Member States reiterated their strong solidarity with the Western Balkans partners, in particular in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. EN Official Journal of the European Union L 330/2 20.9.2021 ",
        "(11) The European Council has granted the status of candidate country to the Republic of Albania, Iceland, Montenegro, the Republic of North Macedonia, the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Turkey. It confirmed the European perspective of the Western Balkans, based on the Stabilisation and Association Process which remains the common framework for relations with the Western Balkans. Without prejudice to positions on status or to any future decisions to be taken by the European Council or by the Council, those benefiting from such a European perspective which have not been granted candidate country status may be considered as potential candidates solely for the purposes of this Regulation. In March 2015, the Government of Iceland asked the Union to no longer consider Iceland a candidate country, without, however, officially withdrawing Iceland\u2019s membership application. (12) Assistance should also be provided in compliance with the agreements concluded by the Union with the beneficiaries listed in Annex I. Assistance under this Regulation should mainly focus on assisting the beneficiaries listed in Annex I to strengthen democratic institutions and the rule of law, reform the judiciary and public administration, respect fundamental rights, including those of persons belonging to minorities, and promote gender equality, tolerance, social inclusion and non-discrimination, including in relation to persons in vulnerable situations, children or persons with disabilities. It should also support the development of a social market economy in line with the key principles and rights set out in the European Pillar of Social Rights solemnly proclaimed and signed on 17 November 2017 by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission ( 6 ). It should not support actions that contribute to any form of segregation or social exclusion. (13) As good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation are essential elements of the enlargement process, assistance should also continue the support for the efforts of the beneficiaries listed in Annex I to advance regional, macro- regional and cross-border cooperation and territorial development, including through the implementation of Union macro-regional strategies. Those programmes should further contribute to the high visibility of assistance in the Union and in the beneficiaries listed in Annex I. Assistance under this Regulation should also enhance beneficiaries\u2019 economic and social development and economic governance, foster economic integration with the Union single market, including customs cooperation, promote open and fair trade that underpins a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth agenda, including through the implementation of regional development and cohesion policies, agriculture and rural development policies, social and employment policies, including labour mobility, the development of the digital economy and society, and boost research and innovation, also in the context of the 2018 flagship initiative Digital Agenda for the Western Balkans. (14) Actions under IPA III should support reconciliation, peace-building and conflict prevention through mediation efforts, confidence-building measures and processes that promote justice, truth-seeking, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence. (15) Assistance under this Regulation should be used to strengthen health security and preparedness for public health emergencies as well as to address, in complementarity with other Union instruments, the major economic shock generated by the COVID-19 outbreak and to mitigate its severe socioeconomic impact, by mobilising resources to accelerate the economic recovery of the region. (16) Special emphasis should be put on creating further opportunities for the youth, including for young professionals, while ensuring that such opportunities contribute to the socioeconomic development of the beneficiaries listed in Annex I. Assistance under this Regulation should also aim to tackle brain drain. (17) The Union\u2019s efforts to support reform progress in the beneficiaries listed in Annex I through funding under IPA III should be well communicated by those beneficiaries as well as by the Union. In that regard, the Union should enhance communication and campaign efforts in order to ensure visibility of funding under IPA III. (18) The Union should provide support to the transition towards accession for the benefit of the beneficiaries listed in Annex I, drawing on the experience of the Member States. Such cooperation should focus particularly on the sharing of experience that was acquired by the Member States during their own reform processes. ( 6 ) OJ C 428, 13.12.2017, p. 10. EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2021 L 330/3 ",
        "(19) Strengthening the rule of law, including the independence of the judiciary, the fight against corruption, money laundering and organised crime, as well as transparency, good governance at all levels, and public administration reform, including in the fields of public procurement, competition and State aid, remain key challenges and are essential for beneficiaries to come closer to the Union and to prepare to fully assume the obligations of Union membership. In view of the longer-term nature of the reforms pursued in those areas and the need to build up track records, financial assistance under this Regulation should address those issues as early as possible. (20) In accordance with the principle of participatory democracy, the Commission should encourage the strengthening of parliamentary capacities, parliamentary oversight, democratic procedures and fair representation in each beneficiary listed in Annex I. (21) Enhanced strategic and operational cooperation between the Union and the beneficiaries listed in Annex I on security is pivotal to addressing effectively and efficiently the threats of security, organised crime and terrorism. (22) Cooperation on migration at international and regional level, including further consolidating border and migration management capacities, ensuring access to international protection, sharing relevant information, enhancing border control and efforts to tackle irregular migration, addressing forced displacement and fighting against trafficking in human beings and people smuggling, is an important aspect of cooperation between the Union and the beneficiaries listed in Annex I. (23) The communication capacities of the beneficiaries listed in Annex I should be enhanced in order to ensure public support for and understanding of Union values and the benefits and obligations of potential Union membership, while addressing disinformation. (24) It is necessary that the Union lead the transition to a healthy planet and a more connected world. The European Green Deal as set out in the Commission communication of 11 December 2019 provides a renewed commitment and a new strategic framework to achieve that global objective. The Union should use its influence, expertise and financial assistance to mobilise the beneficiaries listed in Annex I to join it on a sustainable path. This Regulation should therefore promote the green agenda by reinforcing environmental protection, contributing to the mitigation of climate change and increasing resilience to climate change, and accelerating the shift towards a low-carbon economy. (25) The beneficiaries listed in Annex I need to be better prepared to address global challenges, such as sustainable development and climate change, and to align with the Union\u2019s efforts to address those issues. Reflecting the importance of tackling climate change in line with the Union\u2019s commitments to implement the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( 7 ) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, IPA III should contribute to mainstreaming climate action in the Union\u2019s policies and to the achievement of an overall target of 30 % of Union budget expenditure supporting climate objectives and the ambition of 7,5 % of the budget reflecting biodiversity expenditures in 2024 and 10 % in 2026 and 2027, while taking into account the existing overlaps between climate and biodiversity goals. Actions under IPA III are expected to contribute 18 % of the overall financial envelope of IPA III to climate objectives, with the objective of increasing this percentage to 20 % by 2027. Relevant actions are to be identified during the preparation and implementation of IPA III, and the overall contribution from IPA III should be considered in the relevant evaluations and review processes. (26) Actions under IPA III should support the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted in September 2015 as a universal agenda, to which the Union and its Member States are fully committed and which all beneficiaries listed in Annex I have endorsed. In order to achieve those objectives, in addition to actions in which climate is one of the main objectives, actions under IPA III should, whenever possible, mainstream environmental sustainability and climate change objectives across all sectors, with particular attention to environmental protection and tackling cross-border pollution, and should pursue green growth in national and local strategies, including supporting sustainability criteria in public procurement. Actions under IPA III should be consistent with the principle of \u2018do no harm\u2019 and should comply with Union taxonomy to the extent possible, in particular to ensure the sustainability of investments in the Western Balkans and Turkey. ( 7 ) OJ L 282, 19.10.2016, p. 4. EN Official Journal of the European Union L 330/4 20.9.2021 ",
        "(27) The implementation of this Regulation should be guided by the principles of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, and should seek to protect and promote women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights in line with the EU Gender Action Plans and relevant Council conclusions and international conventions, including the Council conclusions on women, peace and security of 10 December 2018. Strengthening gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in Union external action and increasing efforts to reach the minimum standards of performance indicated by the EU Gender Action Plans should lead to a gender-sensitive and transformative approach in the cooperation between the Union and the beneficiaries listed in Annex I. Gender equality should be reflected and mainstreamed throughout the implementation of this Regulation. (28) This Regulation lays down a financial envelope for the entire duration of IPA III, which is to constitute the prime reference amount, within the meaning of point 18 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 16 December 2020 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management, as well as on new own resources, including a roadmap towards the introduction of new own resources ( 8 ), for the European Parliament and the Council during the annual budgetary procedure. (29) The Commission and the Member States should ensure the compliance, coherence, consistency and complementarity of their assistance, in particular through regular consultations and frequent exchanges of information during the different phases of the assistance cycle, including at local level. The necessary steps should also be taken to ensure better coordination and complementarity with other donors, including through regular consultations. The Commission should ensure that relevant stakeholders in the beneficiaries listed in Annex I, including civil society organisations and local and regional authorities, as appropriate, are duly consulted and have timely access to relevant information to allow them to play a meaningful role during the design and implementation of programmes and the related monitoring processes. The role of civil society should be enhanced in programmes implemented through government bodies and as a direct beneficiary of Union assistance. Likewise, Union assistance should also support human rights\u2019 defenders. (30) The priorities of the actions aimed at achieving objectives in the relevant policy areas supported under this Regulation should be set out in a programming framework established by the Commission for the duration of the Union multiannual financial framework for the 2021-2027 period (\u2018IPA programming framework\u2019). The IPA programming framework should be established in partnership with the beneficiaries listed in Annex I, in line with the overall policy framework and principles, as well as with the general and specific objectives laid down in this Regulation, and should take into due account relevant national strategies. The IPA programming framework should identify the areas to be supported through assistance with an indicative allocation for each area of support, including an estimate of climate-related expenditure. (31) It is in the common interest of the Union and the beneficiaries listed in Annex I to advance the efforts of those beneficiaries to reform their political, legal and economic systems with a view to Union membership. Assistance should be based both on a performance-based approach and the fair share principle, ensuring progress in all beneficiaries listed in Annex I. Assistance should be targeted and adjusted to their specific situations, taking into account any further efforts needed to meet the objectives of this Regulation. The needs and capacities of the beneficiaries listed in Annex I should be taken into account in accordance with the fair share principle in order to avoid a disproportionately low level of assistance as compared to other beneficiaries. Assistance under this Regulation should be differentiated in scope and intensity according to the performance of the beneficiaries listed in Annex I, in particular their commitment to and progress in implementing reforms, in particular in the field of the rule of law and fundamental rights, democratic institutions and public administration reform, economic development and competitiveness. (32) Where the relevant indicators show a significant regression or persistent lack of progress by a beneficiary listed in Annex I in the areas covered by the \u2018fundamentals first\u2019 approach, the scope and intensity of assistance should be modulated accordingly, without prejudice to the powers of the Council to adopt restrictive measures following a decision on the interruption or reduction, in part or completely, of economic and financial relations with one or more third countries in accordance with Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( 8 ) OJ L 433I, 22.12.2020, p. 28. EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2021 L 330/5 ",
        "(TFEU) and without prejudice to the Commission\u2019s power to suspend payments or the implementation of financing agreements in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 9 ) (the \u2018Financial Regulation\u2019). Due consideration should be given to the respect by the beneficiaries of the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law. (33) The Commission should assess each year the implementation of the IPA programming framework, describing how the performance-based approach and the fair share principle were implemented. That assessment should also include the state of play of the level of funding for each objective, as well as for each beneficiary listed in Annex I. It should also allow the committee established by this Regulation to have adequate information to assist the Commission. (34) The Commission should ensure clear monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are in place in order to provide effective accountability and transparency in implementing the Union budget, and in order to ensure effective assessment of progress towards the achievement of this Regulation\u2019s objectives. Whenever possible and appropriate, the results of the Union\u2019s action should be monitored and evaluated on the basis of pre-defined, transparent, country-specific and measurable indicators, adapted to the specificities and objectives of IPA III. (35) The transition from the direct management of pre-accession funds by the Commission to indirect management by the beneficiaries should be progressive and in line with the respective capacities of those beneficiaries, having regard to principles of good governance. The Commission should take appropriate supervisory measures ensuring the protection of the financial interests of the Union, and be able, where necessary, to reverse that transition. Assistance should continue to make use of the structures and instruments that have proved their worth in the pre-accession process. (36) The Union should seek the most efficient use of available resources in order to optimise the impact of its external action. That should be achieved through coherence, consistency and complementarity with the Union\u2019s external financing instruments, as well as through synergies with other Union policies and programmes, such as Horizon Europe \u2013 the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation \u2013 established by Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 10 ), Erasmus+ established by Regulation (EU) 2021/817 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 11 ), the Creative Europe Programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/818 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 12 ), the European Green Deal, the Just Transition Fund established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1056 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 13 ) and the Connecting Europe Facility established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1153 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 14 ), including, where relevant, coherence and complementarity with macro-financial assistance. (37) In order to maximise the impact of combined interventions to achieve a common objective, IPA III should be able to contribute to actions under other programmes, as long as the contributions do not cover the same costs. (38) Union funding under IPA III should be used to finance actions under the international dimension of Erasmus+, the implementation of which should be carried out in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2021/817. ( 9 ) Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union, amending Regulations (EU) No 1296/2013, (EU) No 1301/2013, (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) No 1304/2013, (EU) No 1309/2013, (EU) No 1316/2013, (EU) No 223/2014, (EU) No 283/2014, and Decision No 541/2014/EU and repealing Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 (OJ L 193, 30.7.2018, p. 1).

        "(39) Horizontal financial rules adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of Article 322 TFEU apply to this Regulation. Those rules are laid down in the Financial Regulation and determine in particular the procedure for establishing and implementing the budget through grants, prizes, procurement and indirect management, and provide for checks on the responsibility of financial actors. Rules adopted on the basis of Article 322 TFEU also include a general regime of conditionality for the protection of the Union budget. (40) As the respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law is essential for sound financial management and effective Union funding as referred to in the Financial Regulation, assistance could be suspended in the event of the degradation of democracy, human rights or the rule of law by a beneficiary listed in Annex I. (41) The types of financing and the methods of implementation under this Regulation should be chosen on the basis of their ability to achieve the specific objectives of the actions and to deliver results, taking into account, in particular, the costs of controls, administrative burdens, and the expected risk of non-compliance. That should include consideration of the use of lump sums, flat rates and unit costs, as well as financing not linked to costs as referred to in Article 125(1) of the Financial Regulation. (42) The Union should continue to apply common rules for the implementation of its external action. Rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union\u2019s instruments for financing external action are laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/947. Additional detailed provisions should be laid down to address specific situations, in particular for cross-border cooperation, agriculture and rural development policy areas. (43) External actions are often implemented in a highly volatile environment that requires continuous and rapid adaptation to the evolving needs of Union partners and to global challenges such as human rights, democracy and good governance, security and stability, climate change and environment, irregular migration and forced displacement and their root causes. Reconciling the principle of predictability with the need to react rapidly to new needs consequently means adapting the financial implementation of the programmes. To increase the ability of the Union to respond to unforeseen needs, while respecting the principle that the Union budget is set annually, this Regulation should preserve the flexibility allowed under the Financial Regulation to other policies, namely carry- overs and re-commitments of committed funds, while adhering to the goals and objectives laid down in this Regulation. This will ensure the efficient use of Union funds, both for Union citizens and for the beneficiaries listed in Annex I, thereby maximising the Union funds available for the Union\u2019s external action interventions. (44) The new European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (EFSD+) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/947, which builds on its predecessor, should constitute an integrated financial package supplying financing capacity in the form of grants, budgetary guarantees and other financial instruments worldwide, including to the beneficiaries listed in Annex I. The governance of the EFSD+ operations covering the Western Balkans carried out under this Regulation should be ensured by the Western Balkans Investment Framework (WBIF). The steering committee of the WBIF includes the beneficiaries from the Western Balkans listed in Annex I, the contributors to the European Western Balkans Joint Fund, relevant financial institutions and relevant regional organisations, as appropriate. The specific strategic board for the EFSD+ operations covering the Western Balkans should continue to be as inclusive. (45) The External Action Guarantee, established by Regulation (EU) 2021/947, supports the EFSD+ operations, and IPA III should contribute to the provisioning needs in respect of the operations to the benefit of the beneficiaries listed in Annex I, including the provisioning and liabilities arising from macro-financial assistance loans.

In particular, in accordance with Regulations (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 and (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has the power to carry out administrative investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. The European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (EPPO) is empowered, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, to investigate and prosecute criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 20 ). In accordance with the Financial Regulation, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the financial interests of the Union, grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the Court of Auditors and, in respect of those Member States participating in enhanced cooperation pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the EPPO, and ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights. Beneficiaries listed in Annex I should also report the irregularities including fraud which have been the subject of a primary administrative or judicial finding, without delay, to the Commission and keep the latter informed of the progress of administrative and legal proceeding. With the objective of alignment to good practices in Member States, this reporting should be done by electronic means, using the Irregularity Management System, established by the Commission. (49) Assistance under this Regulation should be implemented in a transparent, accountable and depoliticised manner. The Commission should monitor this closely, including at local level. (50) Communication fosters democratic debate, reinforces institutional control and scrutiny over Union funding, and contributes to boosting the credibility of the Union. The Union and the beneficiaries of Union funding should enhance the visibility of Union actions, and should communicate adequately the added value of Union support. In that regard, in accordance with the Financial Regulation, agreements concluded with recipients of Union funding should contain obligations to ensure appropriate visibility, and the Commission should act in an appropriate and timely manner when those obligations are not met. (51) In order to take account of any changes in the enlargement policy framework or of significant developments in the beneficiaries listed in Annex I, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to adapt and update the thematic priorities for assistance listed in Annexes II and III as well as to adopt a delegated act to supplement this Regulation by setting out certain specific objectives and thematic priorities for assistance. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making ( 21 ). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States\u2019 experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.

For penthiopyrad and picloram, MRLs were set in Part A of Annex III to that Regulation. For Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 and Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134, no specific MRLs were set in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 nor were those substances included in Annex IV to that Regulation, so the default value of 0,01 mg/kg laid down in Article 18(1)(b) thereof applies. (2) In the context of a procedure for the authorisation of the use of a plant protection product containing the active substance aclonifen on fennel seeds and caraway fruit, an application was submitted in accordance with Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 for modification of the existing MRLs. (3) As regards acrinathrin, such an application was submitted for lettuces. As regards penthiopyrad, such an application was submitted for celeries and Florence fennels. As regards picloram, such an application was submitted for flowering brassica. (4) In accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, those applications were evaluated by the Member States concerned and the evaluation reports were forwarded to the Commission. (5) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) assessed the applications and the evaluation reports, examining in particular the risks to the consumer and, where relevant, to animals and gave reasoned opinions on the proposed MRLs ( 2 ). It forwarded those opinions to the applicants, the Commission and the Member States and made them available to the public. (6) As regards all applications, the Authority concluded that all requirements with respect to data were met and that the modifications to the MRLs requested by the applicants were acceptable with regard to consumer safety on the basis of a consumer exposure assessment for 27 specific European consumer groups. It took into account the most recent information on the toxicological properties of the substances. Neither the lifetime exposure to these substances via consumption of all food products that may contain them, nor the short-term exposure due to high consumption of the relevant products showed that there is a risk that the acceptable daily intake or the acute reference dose is exceeded.

        "(7) For ethirimol, several MRLs were modified by Commission Regulation (EU) 2020/1566 ( 3 ). That Regulation lowered the MRL for ethirimol in cucumbers to 0,05 mg/kg due to a reporting error. Ethirimol is the main metabolite of bupirimate, which is currently used in plant protection products in several Member States. As a consequence, the lowering of the MRL for ethirimol may result in potential MRL exceedances following the lawful use of bupirimate. To avoid this, the Rapporteur Member State submitted on 25 August 2020 an amended evaluation report to the Authority, who has published a correction to the relevant reasoned opinion on 30 September 2020 ( 4 ), where it recommended setting the MRL for ethirimol in cucumbers at 0,2 mg/kg. In the interest of legal certainty, it is appropriate for the MRL for ethirimol in cucumbers, provided for by this Regulation, to apply from the same date as the date of application of Regulation (EU) 2020/1566. (8) For Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 and Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134, the Authority submitted reasoned opinions ( 5 ) ( 6 ) in accordance with Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. In those opinions, the Authority recommended the inclusion of the two substances in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. (9) Based on the reasoned opinions of the Authority and taking into account the factors relevant to the matter under consideration, the respective modifications to the MRLs fulfil the requirements of Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. (10) Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly. (11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Annexes II, III and IV to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation. Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union . It shall apply from 17 May 2021 as regards the MRL for ethirimol in cucumbers. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

(2) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 872/2012 ( 3 ) adopted the list of flavouring substances and introduced that list in Part A of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008. (3) That list may be updated in accordance with the common procedure referred to in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, either on the initiative of the Commission or following an application submitted by a Member State or by an interested party. (4) On 10 August 2012, an application was submitted to the Commission for authorisation of the use of 3-(1-((3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)methyl)-1 H -pyrazol-4-yl)-1-(3-hydroxybenzyl)imidazolidine-2,4-dione, (FL No 16.127), as a flavouring substance in various foods falling, in substance, under a number of the food categories referred to in the Union list of flavourings and source materials. The Commission notified the application to the European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) and requested its opinion. The Commission also made the application available to the Member States pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008. (5) The Authority in its opinion adopted on 21 June 2016 ( 4 ) evaluated the safety of substance FL No 16.127, concluded that its use does not give rise to safety concerns when limited to levels up to those specified for various foods in different food categories. The Authority also noted that it is a substance with flavouring modifying properties. (6) Since the use of substance FL No 16.127 as a flavouring substance does not give rise to safety concerns with the specified conditions of use and it is not expected to mislead the consumer, it is appropriate to authorise such use in the light of the Opinion of the Authority. (7) Part A of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly. ( 1 ) OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 34. ( 2 ) OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.

        "COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2021/1533 of 17 September 2021 imposing special conditions governing the import of feed and food originating in or dispatched from Japan following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power station and repealing Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/6 (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety ( 1 ), and in particular Article 53(1)(b)(ii) thereof, Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2017 on official controls and other official activities performed to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products, amending Regulations (EC) No 999/2001, (EC) No 396/2005, (EC) No 1069/2009, (EC) No 1107/2009, (EU) No 1151/2012, (EU) No 652/2014, (EU) 2016/429 and (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Regulations (EC) No 1/2005 and (EC) No 1099/2009 and Council Directives 98/58/EC, 1999/74/EC, 2007/43/EC, 2008/119/EC and 2008/120/EC, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 854/2004 and (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 89/608/EEC, 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC, 91/496/EEC, 96/23/EC, 96/93/EC and 97/78/EC and Council Decision 92/438/EEC (Official Controls Regulation) ( 2 ), and in particular Article 54(4), first subparagraph, point (b), and Article 90, first paragraph, points (a), (c) and (f), thereof, Whereas: (1) Following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power station on 11 March 2011, the Commission was informed that radionuclide levels in certain food products originating in Japan exceeded the action levels in food applicable in Japan. As such contamination may constitute a threat to public and animal health in the Union, the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 297/2011 ( 3 ) imposed special conditions governing the importation of food and feed originating in or consigned from Japan. That Implementing Regulation was repealed and replaced successively by Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 961/2011 ( 4 ), (EU) No 284/2012 ( 5 ), (EU) No 996/2012 ( 6 ), (EU) No 322/2014 ( 7 ) and (EU) 2016/6 ( 8 ). In order to ensure consistency and facilitate implementation, those Regulations set out the maximum radionuclide levels by aligning with the values set out in relevant Japanese law and that practice should be maintained.

( 8 ) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/6 of 5 January 2016 imposing special conditions governing the import of feed and food originating in or consigned from Japan following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power station and repealing Implementing Regulation (EU) No 322/2014 (OJ L 3, 6.1.2016, p. 5).

        "(2) Regulation (EU) 2017/625 requires that goods subject to an emergency measure provided for in acts adopted in accordance with Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 are subject to official controls at their entry into the Union. (3) To facilitate the performance of official controls of food and feed subject to this Regulation at their entry into the Union, it is appropriate to establish a single model official certificate. It is also appropriate to lay down requirements for issuing official certificates in addition to the requirements laid down in Chapter VII of Title II of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 and, for certificates issued on paper, to those laid down in Article 39(1) of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1715 ( 9 ), and in Article 5 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/2235 ( 10 ). Furthermore, to ensure a coherent approach, it is appropriate to provide that official certificates issued in accordance with this Regulation should be replaced in accordance with the procedures for the issuance of replacement certificates laid down in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/2235. (4) The existing measures have been reviewed, taking into account more than 87 000 occurrence data on radioactivity in feed and food other than beef and more than 429 000 occurrence data on radioactivity in beef provided by the Japanese authorities for the ninth and tenth growing seasons following the accident (data reported from January 2019 until December 2020). (5) In light of those data, it appears that the obligation to sample and analyse products before export to the Union must be maintained or established for certain products, but it may be lifted for others. In particular, in addition to the products already subject to that obligation, it is appropriate to require the sampling and analysis of wild mushrooms and derived products originating from the prefectures of Iwate, Nagano, Niigata and Ibaraki, of fish and fishery products from Gunma, of wild bracken and derived products from Fukushima and of Japanese royal fern and derived products from the prefecture of Miyagi. However, the requirement to perform sampling and analysis before export to the Union may be lifted as regards Aralia sprout and derived products originating from the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Gunma, bamboo and derived products from the prefecture of Fukushima, mushrooms and derived products from the prefecture of Gunma, and koshiabura and derived products from the prefectures of Shizuoka, Yamanashi and Yamagata. Furthermore, the non-compliances in mushrooms were only found in wild mushrooms, in bracken only in wild bracken and in (Japanese) persimmon only in dried (Japanese) persimmon. It is therefore appropriate to limit the requirement to sample and analyse only wild or dried forms of these products, respectively. (6) The official controls performed at entry into the Union show that the special conditions provided for by Union law are correctly implemented by the Japanese authorities, and no cases of non-compliance with Union law have been found during official import controls for more than nine years. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep the low frequency of official controls at entry into the Union of food and feed subject to this Regulation. (7) It is appropriate to provide for a review of this Regulation when the results of the sampling and analysis for the presence of radioactivity in feed and food of the eleventh and twelfth growing seasons (2021 and 2022) after the accident are available. (8) Since the amendments to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/6 are substantial, it is appropriate, for reasons of clarity, to replace it. (9) To allow a smooth transition to the new measures, it is appropriate to provide for a transitional measure for consignments accompanied by official declarations issued in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/6, provided that such official declarations were issued before the entry into force of this Regulation.
