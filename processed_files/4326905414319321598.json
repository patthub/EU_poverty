        "The ACP-EU Energy Facility Improving access to energy services for the poor in rural and peri-urban areas ",
        "2 Framing the Challenge Access to energy is a major challenge for the 21st century. Energy services are integral to economic prosperity, social well-being, and environmental sustainability and security. Though access to energy alone is not sufficient to achieve these goals, it is certainly a crucial part and is needed for real development to take place. Currently, 1.3 billion people in the world do not have access to electricity 1 . This is especially dire in rural and peri-urban areas of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries where the electricity access rate is, on average, only 10%, and in many countries is as low as 1%. Additionally, 2.7 billion people are without access to clean cooking facilities 2 , and 1.5 million people die every year from indoor pollution caused by the inadequate use of traditional biomass fuels. Inefficient management of the natural resources used for these fuels leads to deforestation and desertification. The situation is exacerbated by poor governance, very often considered as the weakest component of the energy sector in ACP countries. \u201cLack of access to energy is a serious issue for the ACP States where the majority of people, particularly those living in rural and peri-urban areas, lack access to energy and rely on wood and charcoal for cooking and heating. Human health, economic development and social progress would be substantially increased by improved access to efficient, reliable and affordable energy. At the individual level, improved access to energy means that women and children no longer have to spend so much time gathering fuel and water, but children can instead concentrate on their education and women on other economic and family oriented activities. At the same time, overall health is increased by improved cooking stoves and no longer breathing in dangerous smoke produced by traditional open fires. At the community level, increased access to energy means that health centres can operate after dusk, refrigerate vaccines and more easily sterilise instruments. With the above in mind, it is not difficult to see how universal access to energy is at improving the lives of inhabitants of ACP States.\u201d Dr Mohammed Ibn Chambas, Secretary General ACP Group of States It has been well documented 3 that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) can not be achieved without increasing access to energy services. The ACP-EU Energy Facility was created specifically to contribute and to respond to these goals. FOREWORD 1 Special early excerpt of the World Energy Outlook 2011 - IEA 2 Idem 3 E.g.

        "3 Questions to Dr Mohammed Ibn Chambas Secretary General of the ACP Group of States Q: What is the importance for you of the ACP-EU Energy Facility? For me, the importance of the Energy Facility lies in the results that it has on the ground. In sub- Saharan Africa It is estimated that over 70% of the population lack access to electricity and over 80% are without access to modern cooking devices. Since 2006 the ACP-EU Energy Facility has been working at improving this situation for about 12 million beneficiaries. With a contribution of around EUR350 million so far, it has helped fund 139 projects, many of them in rural areas. In addition, access to energy in rural areas is rarely possible as such and needs public intervention. The Energy Facility has been instrumental in mobilising the necessary funds. It also helped to identify and develop innovative, pragmatic and technological practices in cooperation with all stakeholders. The Facility lays down the path which public authorities, communities and private investors can follow. Q: What do you think about the future for the ACP-EU Energy Facility? Further support is of the utmost importance, as it is essential that public funds are supplemented by private investment. The pooling mechanism which has been set up is intended to finance medium- sized access projects, the scale and complexity of which go beyond the scope of the last Calls for Proposals. This is a fantastic opportunity to get larger scale projects off the ground and to make a real difference at increasing access to energy. Capitalising on the successes attained so far with the Energy Facility is also important. Practically, this means continuing to develop innovative models and scaling-up the ones that have proved successful. Continued support and technical assistance should be given to the regional initiatives \u2013 Western, Central, Southern and Eastern Power Pools as well as the African Forum for Utility Regulators. These initiatives create reliable and competitive energy regional markets by increasing cross-border interconnections, energy trading, network reliability and security. They also facilitate investments by the private sector, harmonise the energy regulatory frameworks and ensure sustainable energy regional policies through sound economic, environmental and social practice. We acknowledge the achievements of the Energy Facility so far and we will carefully monitor its future development. History of the ACP-EU Energy Facility At the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, the EU\u2019s energy development policy took a major step forward with the launch of the EU Energy Initiative for Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Development (EUEI). The EUEI, a joint commitment by the Commission and the Member States, has as its main goal to contribute to providing the access to energy necessary for the achievement of the MDGs, particularly, but not exclusively, that of halving the number of people in extreme poverty by the year 2015. In order to respond to this objective in the specific case of the ACP region, in June 2005, the ACP-EU Council formally approved the creation of the ACP-EU Energy Facility (EF) as a development of the EUEI. The Energy Facility (EF) supports projects aimed at improving and increasing access to modern, affordable and sustainable energy services for the poor living in rural and peri-urban areas in ACP countries. The ACP-EU Energy Facility was first financed within the 9th European Development Fund (EDF) with EUR220 million for the period 2006 \u2013 2009. Following the successful implementation of these funds, it was decided to re-finance the Energy Facility under the 10th EDF with EUR200 million for the period 2009 \u2013 2013. The Energy Facility is one of the instruments implementing the Africa-EU Energy Partnership, which is part of the 2011 \u2013 2013 Joint Africa-EU Strategy. The total EF commitment of EUR420 million has already been partially deployed through four different implementation modalities: \u25a0 EUR348 million for three Call for Proposals (one in 2006, another in 2009 and a third scheduled for 2012); \u25a0 EUR40 million for a Pooling Mechanism , which finances mature, medium-sized projects outside the scope of the Call for Proposals; \u25a0 EUR10 million for activities in preparation of the Africa \u2013 EU Infrastructure Partnership ; \u25a0 EUR3.5 million for the Partnership Dialogue Facility , which supports energy governance in ACP countries. An additional EUR18.5 million has been allocated for contingencies and needed technical assistance to run the EF, monitor and evaluate the projects.

        "4 Activities and Results The overarching objective of the Energy Facility is to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals as well as the World Summit on Sustainable Development objectives on energy, while at the same time, helping to combat climate change. More specifically, the goals of the Energy Facility are: 1) To increase access to modern, affordable and sustainable energy services in rural and peri- urban poor areas by focusing on renewable energy solutions and energy efficiency measures; 2) To improve governance and framework conditions in the energy sector at regional, national and local levels , in particular those aimed at promoting access to energy services, renewable energy and energy efficiency. The Energy Facility focuses on energy solutions that help people in impoverished villages, rural towns and peri-urban areas lacking sustainable access to energy services. Besides social and household uses, emphasis is put on productive uses of energy to stimulate economic growth. The Facility funds actions contribute to the development of sound energy policies and strategies, facilitate the removal of the obstacles to the private sector\u2019s involvement and strengthen the capacity of public authorities to manage the energy sector . Attention is given to initiatives aimed at improving the existing institutional and regulatory framework in the energy sector and thus helping to ensure a stable investment context. The Energy Facility empowers local authorities and communities by making their participation a prerequisite to funded projects, and by privileging capacity building and knowledge and technology transfer. The Facility particularly encourages the participation of the private sector , acting as a flexible and catalytic instrument to attract private funds as well as contributions from co-donors, such as Member State development agencies and international organisations. Evaluation of the first call for proposal of the Energy facility A good part of the 74 projects from the first call for proposals are finished; an overall evaluation of the impact, efficiency and effectiveness of activities has been carried out. The overall findings of the evaluation were positive, showing that the Facility has a decisive impact on the ground. For 22 of the projects granting access to modern energy services, more than two million beneficiaries were reached out of a target of 2.5 million. The field study component also highlighted good results in some cases, with projects even overreaching their objectives. Another main finding was that the activities of the Energy Facility often raised attention on the sector at national level. It was strongly suggested by the evaluation not to lose the momentum created by the Facility and to try to upscale the most successful projects. However, a good number of shortcomings were also highlighted. There were a number of delays that affected projects\u2019 sustainability; also a lack of proper feasibility studies, high transaction costs and local management hampered some projects\u2019 development.

        "5 Location: Rural areas in Northern Uganda. Objective, target groups and concrete results: \u2022 Reduce poverty and improve the quality of life in rural areas of Northern Uganda. \u2022 Improve quality of social services, such as health and education. \u2022 Provide access to basic energy services (efficient biomass stoves, solar PV, pico and micro- hydropower) to rural households, social institutions and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the target districts. The project follows a commercial approach: All running costs will be covered by the end users benefiting from the project. Appropriate technologies and cooperation with micro-finance institutions allow even poorer households to get access to these technologies. \u2022 The first re-training for 140 instructors of solar technicians under the revived Solar Technicians Education Programme (STEP) has been completed. \u2022 A total of 700 solar home systems and solar lanterns were sold since 2009. \u2022 47 social institutions in six districts have been electrified with solar PV so far. \u2022 7,522 local stove builders in West Nile and Lango sub-regions have acquired energy efficient household stove construction skills. More than 190,000 households and 220 social institutions and SMEs were provided with improved cooking stoves. \u2022 15 stove artisans acquired skills in planning, design and construction of institutional rocket stoves. \u2022 Implementation of the community-based pico-hydro project in Gwere-Luzira (Moyo district) has been completed. Main activities: 1. Awareness campaigns; 2. Training of solar dealers and technicians (installation and maintenance of solar PV systems, marketing, business skills); 3. Training of local artisans and entrepreneurs in production and marketing of improved stoves and baking ovens in cooperation with local NGOs (training of trainers); 4. Development of financing mechanisms for solar PV systems and large stoves for social institutions; 5. Participative design and implementation of community-based pico- and micro-hydropower projects. \u201cOn the whole, the kitchen staff seem happy and excited with the new institutional stove constructed by the project. Meals are cooked promptly and the kitchen is always clean and tidy. It\u2019s unbelievable how little firewood we use these days! We save up to 50% on wood compared to when we used the three-stone technology which was wasteful\u201d Mr. Churchill Lacere Olanya, the Headmaster of Arua Public Secondary School Facts and figures Component: 1a \u2013 small scale infrastructure projects Country: Uganda Applicant: Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)/Germany EU Contribution: The total budget of the project is EUR3.96 M.

        "6 Location: Peri-urban areas in the CEMAC (Central African Economic and Monetary Community). Member States: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Chad. Objective and target groups: The objective of the project is to reinforce the regional integration of energy policies into the fight against poverty. The specific objective is to improve access to electricity in peri-urban areas in the CEMAC Member States. The action allows for the realisation of 57,000 connections and power purchase subscriptions of the populations in question. Beneficiaries are the inhabitants of the peri-urban areas, with a special focus on households, handicraft producers, traders, and social and public infrastructure in the areas. Concrete achievements: this project was able to make working together utilities and ministers of the 5 CEMAC countries, creating fruitful exchanges on concrete means of implementation of social connections in peri-urban areas. So far, the electricity networks have been built for 5,500 potential connections and 1,800 connections were realised in these pilot areas. The project has worked specifically on the cost for the connection (counting kit, 20m of cable, accessories, installation). It has been reduced at EUR 60 and allows most of the inhabitants to take a connection with saving phase. The tenders for 70% of the remaining 56,000 connections were already completed. Among the project results: 1. A re/engagement in poor peri-urban areas with cartography and formulas for improved performance management (including on grid densification, social connections specifications or combat against illegal connections); 2. The development of low cost innovative energy equipments and the identification of suppliers; 3. The development and adoption of a regional plan identifying priority interconnections and access zones in the CEMAC countries.

        "9 Energy Facility Calls for Proposals Calls for Proposals are open to the submission of proposals by several kinds of actors. These include ACP States and ACP/EU non-State actors. The latter includes NGOs, civil society, private sector organisations, communities and authorities, and public service bodies at national, local and regional level. International organisations are also eligible to apply. The proposals are also assessed in relation to specific Energy Facility Position Papers 4 , which provide an indication on the priorities of the EU vis-\u00e0-vis specific energy related issues such as: bio- fuels, biomass energy, good governance in the energy sector, private sector involvement and rural and peri-urban electrification. At the end of the evaluation process a list of proposals is drafted according to the scoring received. The proposals that receive a certain minimum score and fall within the allocated fund for the specific CfP will be awarded the grant. Projects funded under the calls for proposals In the two calls for proposals launched so far, a total of 139 projects (which have a duration spanning between 2 and 5 years) were selected for funding. This represents a total projects cost of EUR578.2 million with an EU contribution of EUR293.9 million. Overall, around 91% of the funds were awarded to projects aimed at increasing access to energy. Of these, 28% corresponded to pure grid extension projects, whereas 63% \u2013 or almost two-thirds of the total \u2013 were allocated to projects featuring decentralised solutions (both isolated power systems and mini-grids) of energy production, transformation and distribution. The vast majority of these used renewable sources, with solar energy being the most represented. The remaining 9% of the funds were awarded to governance and capacity building projects. Allocation of funds per type of recipient The largest share of funds was awarded to projects submitted by ACP and EU public entities (companies or bodies that are owned by the government but not managed by it, such as electrification agencies), in particular those from ACP countries \u2013 followed by ACP and European NGOs. NGOs have also the highest number of selected projects. Among categories such as local authorities, state actors and regional organisations, only those in the ACP are eligible to be applicants for Energy Facility funding. Source of funds of selected projects In terms of sources of finance, the Energy Facility contributed to about half of the amount of the eligible project costs. 53,93 19,71 22,73 13,86 84,70 22,85 10,41 30,80 22,44 12,50 N G O P u b l i c e n t i t y P r i va t e e n t i t y L o c a l a u t h o r i t y S t a t e a c t o r R e g i o n a l o r g a n i s a t i o n I n t e r n a t i o n a l o r g a n i s a t i o n EU ACP International 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Number of projects 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 4 http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/where/acp/ regional-cooperation/energy/cfp/cfp_en.htm Distribution of funds (M\u20ac) by type of recipient Fig. 1 Relevance: 25 points Sustainability: 25 points Financial and operational capacity: 20 points Methodology: 20 points Cost-effectiveness and economic impact: 10 points Fig 1 shows the criteria against which the Full Applications are evaluated and the maximum points awarded for each criteria.

Our commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to reaching the 0.7% ODA/ GNI target remains steadfast. Making good on that commitment will require a multifaceted approach: increased aid levels from developed countries; a renewed focus by developing countries on governance to ensure that all aid is well spent; and the high-impact aid we want to see become the rule, not the exception \u2013 aid that benefits citizens for generations to come, that acts as a catalyst for sustainable growth and development in which all can share\u2026\u201d Commissioner for Development Andris Piebalgs \u2013 \u201cHow to achieve coherence between energy security and development policies\u201d-\u2013 speech to the European Parliament - 9 February 2011 According to the Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic 7 (2009), the total financing need for Africa to solve the power supply crisis is about US$40 billion per annum. Currently, the region spends only about US$11 billion per annum, leaving a financing gap of about US$30 billion. It is clear that this financing gap cannot be filled by public financing alone. Private sector technology and investments, namely in the context of public-private partnerships, in ACP rural and peri-urban areas are important to ensure the financial sustainability of the energy access investments as well as for the economic development of these areas. Bearing this in mind, a Pooling Mechanism was created within the 10 th EDF Energy Facility. ",
        "14 Objectives: \u2022 Encourage private sector investments in the energy sector in rural and peri-urban areas in ACP states by bridging the funding gap between revenues and costs; \u2022 Maximise the impact of the Energy Facility grants through leverage of and blending with additional resources , such as private sector funding and loans; \u2022 Improve the coordination at EU level of available resources and expertise in the energy sector, by increasing the compatibility of the financial resources of donors and finance institutions as well as the synergies and exchange of knowledge between them. The Pooling Mechanism is intended for medium-sized, usually capital intensive projects (cost ranging typically between EUR10 million and EUR50 million), the scale and complexity of which go beyond the scope of Calls for Proposals. Supported projects target the main objective of the Energy Facility \u2013 increased access to energy services in rural and peri-urban areas of ACP countries \u2013 and have a wide impact on the beneficiary population. They should preferably rely on renewable energy solutions. Lead Financiers 8 will submit projects which are to be implemented by ACP-EU actors from the public and private energy sector. Regional Energy Integration In addition to the projects funded through the Calls for Proposals and the Pooling Mechanism, the Energy Facility has also devoted EUR10 million for technical assistance and institutional support in the context of the Africa \u2013 EU Partnership for Infrastructure. The partnership is based mainly on infrastructure allowing interconnection at continental and regional level in Africa including energy to allow network extension, distribution in rural areas and improvement of cross-border connections. The Energy Facility aims specifically to provide technical assistance and institutional support to the following African organisations: \u2022 African Forum for Utility Regulators (AFUR) \u2013 AFUR\u2019s mission is to promote effective utility regulation across all sectors including energy. The Energy Facility supported AFUR for the organisation of power market structure and model, comparison of electricity costs and prices in member countries and training on regulation concerning the quality of service. \u2022 West African Power Pool (WAPP) \u2013 the WAPP is a specialized institution under the ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States), whose main objective is to increase access to cheaper, more reliable energy in West Africa. The Energy Facility contributed to the WAPP essentially for cross- border transmission lines. \u2022 Central African Power Pool (CAPP) \u2013 the CAPP is a specialised body of the ECCAS (Economic Community of Central African States), focusing on coordinating the energy policy and increasing investments in energy within this region. The Energy Facility supported the CAPP for advice on network operations, development of regional markets and cross-border electrification. \u2022 East African Power Pool (EAPP) \u2013 the EAPP brings together companies in charge of power generation, transmission and/or distribution in East African countries. The Energy Facility contributed to the EAPP for the realisation of baseline and strategic business plans. \u2022 Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) \u2013 the SAPP seeks to optimise the use of available energy resources, namely in emergency situations, among its member countries in Southern Africa. Actions financed by the Energy Facility for the SAPP included capacity building for network operations, system planning and promotion of public-private partnerships. Partnership Dialogue Facility Created in 2004, the Partnership Dialogue Facility (PDF) of the EUEI is a flexible instrument designed to support the development of policies and strategies to promote access to energy at national and regional level, with a focus in Africa. It does so by promoting the dialogue between all relevant stakeholders, namely the partner countries, their regional organisations, EU Member States and the European Commission. The PDF aims to integrate access to energy services and energy considerations into national and regional development policies; support the development of policies and legal, fiscal and regulatory structures in the energy sector (namely by promoting institutional capacity building); improve the 8 See Pooling Mechanism guidelines: http://ec.europa. eu/europeaid/where/acp/regional-cooperation/energy/ documents/pooling_mechanism_guidelines_en.pdf Action Type EC Grant Minimum Maximum % Investment projects for access to energy services (including related capacity-building activities) EUR1 M EUR5 M Maximum of 25% Advanced preparatory studies EUR1 M Example of a Pooling Project: Fostering Access to Modern Energy Services in Rural Uganda - Investment Programme West Nile Total action investment cost in EUR: 41.1 M Grant amount requested in EUR: 3.5 M Lead Financier: KfW Entwicklungsbank on behalf of the Government of Germany (GoG) financing EUR24.6 million Co-Financiers: Government of Uganda / the private energy service company WENRECO Project Promoter: WENRECO, Uganda Electricity Distribution Company Limited (UEDCL), Uganda Energy Generation Company Limited (UEGCL) Activities: Construction of two hydropower plants (3.5 and 4.1 MW); installation of more than 200km of new electricity grids in the region that will provide reliable energy services to new customers for productive activities, social institutions as well as poor households.

The Energy Facility has contributed with EUR3.5 million to the PDF, which is also co-funded by a number of EU Member States. Between 2005 and 2010, the EUEI PDF funded more than 38 projects, with national projects in 20 different countries and 9 regional projects. It has contributed to improving the enabling environment, resulting in energy access investments. It has also conducted thematic studies on key energy issues such as biomass cooking energy and rural electrification agencies that have lead to innovative approaches. Examples of PDF support include: \u2022 Support to the development of a Biomass Energy Strategy (BEST) for Malawi, with the objective of ensuring a sustainable supply of biomass energy and promoting access to modern cooking fuels and efficient biomass combustion technologies; \u2022 Capacity-building for off-grid rural electrification planning at the regional and sub-regional level in Ethiopia; \u2022 Establishment of a framework for dialogue on the promotion of private investment and public- private partnerships in the energy sector in Mali; \u2022 Energy Policy Support to the Democratic Republic of Congo , with the objectives of developing a new energy policy, an electricity legal code and a rural electrification strategy. Monitoring, Networking and Visibility in the Energy Facility Networking The Energy Facility strongly encourages coordination and networking between the multiple supported partners and implementers and their respective activities. Exchanges of experiences among project implementing bodies are crucial. Regional meetings and seminars are announced on the Energy Facility website (http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/energy-facility) as well as on the website for the monitoring of the Energy Facility (www.energyfacilitymonitoring.eu). Knowledge sharing Thematic fiches have been prepared drawing on the knowledge gained from Energy Facility projects. These fiches highlight lessons learnt from experience and compare the implementation methodologies that were used. Seven fiches have been written on microcredit, solar PV, public- private partnerships, access and socio-economic development and improved stoves. Additionally case studies are shared as well as all deliverables provided by the projects (manuals, guidelines, films, courses or studies). All this information is available under the Energy Facility monitoring website and will be further developed as the implementation of the projects continues. Monitoring The global coherence, work progress and efficiency of the Energy Facility\u2019s projects are closely monitored together with EuropeAid, the EU Delegations and National Authorities in the countries where EF projects take place. The Energy Facility set up a dedicated system to monitor the projects (via external consultancy) and provide technical assistance on the projects to the EU Delegations. In addition to this monitoring, general reviews of the Energy Facility were performed in 2007 and 2011. These reviews made specific conclusions and recommendations on the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and governance of the Energy Facility. Visibility Besides the Energy Facility and Energy Facility Monitoring websites, visibility of projects and activities is assured by dissemination of news to mailing lists, publications and distribution of leaflets and brochures in seminars and meetings.
