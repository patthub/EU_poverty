        "II (Acts whose publication is not obligatory) COUNCIL COUNCIL DECISION of 14 October 2004 concerning the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (2006/507/EC) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Commu- nity, and in particular Article 175(1), in conjunction with the first sentence of the first subparagraph of Article 300(2), and the first subparagraph of Article 300(3) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament ( 1 ), Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 2 ), Whereas: (1) The promotion of measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems is one of the objectives of the Community's policy on the environment, in accordance with Article 174 of the Treaty. (2) In 1998 the Council authorised the Commission to participate, on behalf of the Community, in the negotia- tions on a Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme. The Commission participated in those nego- tiations together with the Member States. (3) The Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (Conven- tion) was adopted in Stockholm on 22 May 2001. (4) The Convention provides a framework, based on the precautionary principle, for elimination of production, use, import and export of the initial 12 priority Persistent Organic Pollutants, their safe handling and disposal and elimination or reduction of releases of certain unintentional Persistent Organic Pollutants. In addition, the Convention lays down the rules for the listing of new chemicals in the Convention. (5) The Community, the then 15 Member States and eight of the new Member States, signed the Convention during a Conference of Plenipotentiaries held in Stockholm from 22 to 23 May 2001. (6) The Convention is open to ratification, acceptance or approval by States and by regional economic integration organisations. (7) Under the terms of the Convention, a regional economic integration organisation must declare in its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession the extent of its competence in respect of the matters governed by the Convention. (8) The Community has already adopted instruments covering matters governed by the Convention, including Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and Council of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC ( 3 ), Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 of the European Parliament and Council of 28 January 2003 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals ( 4 ) and Council Directive 96/59/EC of 16 September 1996 on the disposal of polychlorinated biphennyls and polychlorinated terphenyls (PCB/PCT) ( 5 ). 31.7.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 209/1 ( 1 ) OJ C 87 E, 7.4.2004, p. 495.

Article 6 Measures to reduce or eliminate releases from stockpiles and wastes 1. In order to ensure that stockpiles consisting of or containing chemicals listed either in Annex A or Annex B and wastes, including products and articles upon becoming wastes, consist- ing of, containing or contaminated with a chemical listed in Annex A, B or C, are managed in a manner protective of human health and the environment, each Party shall: (a) develop appropriate strategies for identifying: (i) stockpiles consisting of or containing chemicals listed either in Annex A or Annex B; and (ii) products and articles in use and wastes consisting of, containing or contaminated with a chemical listed in Annex A, B or C; (b) identify, to the extent practicable, stockpiles consisting of or containing chemicals listed either in Annex A or Annex B on the basis of the strategies referred to in subparagraph (a); (c) manage stockpiles, as appropriate, in a safe, efficient and environmentally sound manner. Stockpiles of chemicals listed either in Annex A or Annex B, after they are no longer allowed to be used according to any specific exemption specified in Annex A or any specific exemption or acceptable purpose specified in Annex B, except stockpiles which are allowed to be exported according to paragraph 2 of Article 3, shall be deemed to be waste and shall be managed in accordance with subparagraph (d); 31.7.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 209/7 ",
        "(d) take appropriate measures so that such wastes, including products and articles upon becoming wastes, are: (i) handled, collected, transported and stored in an environmentally sound manner; (ii) disposed of in such a way that the persistent organic pollutant content is destroyed or irreversibly trans- formed so that they do not exhibit the characteristics of persistent organic pollutants or otherwise disposed of in an environmentally sound manner when destruction or irreversible transformation does not represent the environmentally preferable option or the persistent organic pollutant content is low, taking into account international rules, standards, and guidelines, including those that may be developed pursuant to paragraph 2, and relevant global and regional regimes governing the management of hazardous wastes; (iii) not permitted to be subjected to disposal operations that may lead to recovery, recycling, reclamation, direct reuse or alternative uses of persistent organic pollutants; and (iv) not transported across international boundaries with- out taking into account relevant international rules, standards and guidelines; (e) endeavour to develop appropriate strategies for identifying sites contaminated by chemicals listed in Annex A, B or C; if remediation of those sites is undertaken it shall be performed in an environmentally sound manner. 2. The Conference of the Parties shall cooperate closely with the appropriate bodies of the Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal to, inter alia : (a) establish levels of destruction and irreversible transforma- tion necessary to ensure that the characteristics of persistent organic pollutants as specified in paragraph 1 of Annex D are not exhibited; (b) determine what they consider to be the methods that constitute environmentally sound disposal referred to above; and (c) work to establish, as appropriate, the concentration levels of the chemicals listed in Annexes A, B and C in order to define the low persistent organic pollutant content referred to in paragraph 1 (d)(ii). Article 7 Implementation plans 1. Each Party shall: (a) develop and endeavour to implement a plan for the implementation of its obligations under this Convention; (b) transmit its implementation plan to the Conference of the Parties within two years of the date on which this Convention enters into force for it; and (c) review and update, as appropriate, its implementation plan on a periodic basis and in a manner to be specified by a decision of the Conference of the Parties. 2. The Parties shall, where appropriate, cooperate directly or through global, regional and sub-regional organisations, and consult their national stakeholders, including women's groups and groups involved in the health of children, in order to facilitate the development, implementation and updating of their implementation plans. 3. The Parties shall endeavour to utilise and, where necessary, establish the means to integrate national implementation plans for persistent organic pollutants in their sustainable development strategies where appropriate. Article 8 Listing of chemicals in Annexes A, B and C 1. A Party may submit a proposal to the Secretariat for listing a chemical in Annexes A, B and/or C. The proposal shall contain the information specified in Annex D. In developing a proposal, a Party may be assisted by other Parties and/or by the Secretariat. 2. The Secretariat shall verify whether the proposal contains the information specified in Annex D. If the Secretariat is satisfied that the proposal contains the information so specified, it shall forward the proposal to the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee. 3. The Committee shall examine the proposal and apply the screening criteria specified in Annex D in a flexible and transparent way, taking all information provided into account in an integrative and balanced manner. 4. If the Committee decides that: (a) it is satisfied that the screening criteria have been fulfilled, it shall, through the Secretariat, make the proposal and the evaluation of the Committee available to all Parties and observers and invite them to submit the information specified in Annex E; or L 209/8 EN Official Journal of the European Union 31.7.2006 ",
        "(b) it is not satisfied that the screening criteria have been fulfilled, it shall, through the Secretariat, inform all Parties and observers and make the proposal and the evaluation of the Committee available to all Parties and the proposal shall be set aside. 5. Any Party may resubmit a proposal to the Committee that has been set aside by the Committee pursuant to paragraph 4. The resubmission may include any concerns of the Party as well as a justification for additional consideration by the Committee. If, following this procedure, the Committee again sets the proposal aside, the Party may challenge the decision of the Committee and the Conference of the Parties shall consider the matter at its next session. The Conference of the Parties may decide, based on the screening criteria in Annex D and taking into account the evaluation of the Committee and any additional information provided by any Party or observer, that the proposal should proceed. 6. Where the Committee has decided that the screening criteria have been fulfilled, or the Conference of the Parties has decided that the proposal should proceed, the Committee shall further review the proposal, taking into account any relevant additional information received, and shall prepare a draft risk profile in accordance with Annex E. It shall, through the Secretariat, make that draft available to all Parties and observers, collect technical comments from them and, taking those comments into account, complete the risk profile. 7. If, on the basis of the risk profile conducted in accordance with Annex E, the Committee decides: (a) that the chemical is likely as a result of its long-range environmental transport to lead to significant adverse human health and/or environmental effects such that global action is warranted, the proposal shall proceed. Lack of full scientific certainty shall not prevent the proposal from proceeding. The Committee shall, through the Secretariat, invite information from all Parties and observers relating to the considerations specified in Annex F. It shall then prepare a risk management evaluation that includes an analysis of possible control measures for the chemical in accordance with that Annex; or (b) that the proposal should not proceed, it shall, through the Secretariat, make the risk profile available to all Parties and observers and set the proposal aside. 8. For any proposal set aside pursuant to paragraph 7(b), a Party may request the Conference of the Parties to consider instructing the Committee to invite additional information from the proposing Party and other Parties during a period not to exceed one year. After that period and on the basis of any information received, the Committee shall reconsider the proposal pursuant to paragraph 6 with a priority to be decided by the Conference of the Parties. If, following this procedure, the Committee again sets the proposal aside, the Party may challenge the decision of the Committee and the Conference of the Parties shall consider the matter at its next session. The Conference of the Parties may decide, based on the risk profile prepared in accordance with Annex E and taking into account the evaluation of the Committee and any additional information provided by any Party or observer, that the proposal should proceed. If the Conference of the Parties decides that the proposal shall proceed, the Committee shall then prepare the risk management evaluation. 9. The Committee shall, based on the risk profile referred to in paragraph 6 and the risk management evaluation referred to in paragraph 7(a) or 8, recommend whether the chemical should be considered by the Conference of the Parties for listing in Annexes A, B and/or C. The Conference of the Parties, taking due account of the recommendations of the Committee, including any scientific uncertainty, shall decide, in a precautionary manner, whether to list the chemical, and specify its related control measures, in Annexes A, B and/or C. Article 9 Information exchange 1. Each Party shall facilitate or undertake the exchange of information relevant to: (a) the reduction or elimination of the production, use and release of persistent organic pollutants; and (b) alternatives to persistent organic pollutants, including information relating to their risks as well as to their economic and social costs. 2. The Parties shall exchange the information referred to in paragraph 1 directly or through the Secretariat. 3. Each Party shall designate a national focal point for the exchange of such information. 4. The Secretariat shall serve as a clearing-house mechanism for information on persistent organic pollutants, including information provided by Parties, intergovernmental organisa- tions and non-governmental organisations. 5.

In undertaking action under paragraph 1, the Parties shall, within their capabilities: (a) support and further develop, as appropriate, international programmes, networks and organisations aimed at defin- ing, conducting, assessing and financing research, data collection and monitoring, taking into account the need to minimise duplication of effort; (b) support national and international efforts to strengthen national scientific and technical research capabilities, particularly in developing countries and countries with economies in transition, and to promote access to, and the exchange of, data and analyses; (c) take into account the concerns and needs, particularly in the field of financial and technical resources, of developing countries and countries with economies in transition and cooperate in improving their capability to participate in the efforts referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b); (d) undertake research work geared towards alleviating the effects of persistent organic pollutants on reproductive health; L 209/10 EN Official Journal of the European Union 31.7.2006 ",
        "(e) make the results of their research, development and monitoring activities referred to in this paragraph accessible to the public on a timely and regular basis; and (f) encourage and/or undertake cooperation with regard to storage and maintenance of information generated from research, development and monitoring. Article 12 Technical assistance 1. The Parties recognise that rendering of timely and appropriate technical assistance in response to requests from developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition is essential to the successful implementation of this Convention. 2. The Parties shall cooperate to provide timely and appro- priate technical assistance to developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition, to assist them, taking into account their particular needs, to develop and strengthen their capacity to implement their obligations under this Convention. 3. In this regard, technical assistance to be provided by developed country Parties, and other Parties in accordance with their capabilities, shall include, as appropriate and as mutually agreed, technical assistance for capacity \u2011 building relating to implementation of the obligations under this Convention. Further guidance in this regard shall be provided by the Conference of the Parties. 4. The Parties shall establish, as appropriate, arrangements for the purpose of providing technical assistance and promoting the transfer of technology to developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition relating to the implementation of this Convention. These arrangements shall include regional and sub-regional centres for capacity-building and transfer of technology to assist developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition to fulfil their obligations under this Convention. Further guidance in this regard shall be provided by the Conference of the Parties. 5. The Parties shall, in the context of this Article, take full account of the specific needs and special situation of least developed countries and small island developing states in their actions with regard to technical assistance. Article 13 Financial resources and mechanisms 1. Each Party undertakes to provide, within its capabilities, financial support and incentives in respect of those national activities that are intended to achieve the objective of this Convention in accordance with its national plans, priorities and programmes. 2. The developed country Parties shall provide new and additional financial resources to enable developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures which fulfil their obligations under this Convention as agreed between a recipient Party and an entity participating in the mechanism described in paragraph 6. Other Parties may also on a voluntary basis and in accordance with their capabilities provide such financial resources. Contributions from other sources should also be encouraged. The implementation of these commitments shall take into account the need for adequacy, predictability, the timely flow of funds and the importance of burden sharing among the contributing Parties. 3. Developed country Parties, and other Parties in accordance with their capabilities and in accordance with their national plans, priorities and programmes, may also provide and developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition avail themselves of financial resources to assist in their implementation of this Convention through other bilateral, regional and multilateral sources or channels. 4. The extent to which the developing country Parties will effectively implement their commitments under this Convention will depend on the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under this Convention relating to financial resources, technical assistance and technol- ogy transfer. The fact that sustainable economic and social development and eradication of poverty are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties will be taken fully into account, giving due consideration to the need for the protection of human health and the environment. 5. The Parties shall take full account of the specific needs and special situation of the least developed countries and the small island developing states in their actions with regard to funding. 6. A mechanism for the provision of adequate and sustainable financial resources to developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition on a grant or concessional basis to assist in their implementation of the Convention is hereby defined. The mechanism shall function under the authority, as appropriate, and guidance of, and be accountable to the Conference of the Parties for the purposes of this Convention. Its operation shall be entrusted to one or more entities, including existing international entities, as may be decided upon by the Conference of the Parties. The mechanism may also include other entities providing multilateral, regional and bilateral financial and technical assistance. Contributions to the mechanism shall be additional to other financial transfers to developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition as reflected in, and in accordance with, paragraph 2. 31.7.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 209/11 ",
        "7. Pursuant to the objectives of this Convention and paragraph 6, the Conference of the Parties shall at its first meeting adopt appropriate guidance to be provided to the mechanism and shall agree with the entity or entities participat- ing in the financial mechanism upon arrangements to give effect thereto. The guidance shall address, inter alia : (a) the determination of the policy, strategy and programme priorities, as well as clear and detailed criteria and guidelines regarding eligibility for access to and utilisation of financial resources including monitoring and evaluation on a regular basis of such utilisation; (b) the provision by the entity or entities of regular reports to the Conference of the Parties on adequacy and sustain- ability of funding for activities relevant to the implementa- tion of this Convention; (c) the promotion of multiple-source funding approaches, mechanisms and arrangements; (d) the modalities for the determination in a predictable and identifiable manner of the amount of funding necessary and available for the implementation of this Convention, keeping in mind that the phasing out of persistent organic pollutants might require sustained funding, and the conditions under which that amount shall be periodically reviewed; and (e) the modalities for the provision to interested Parties of assistance with needs assessment, information on available sources of funds and on funding patterns in order to facilitate co-ordination among them. 8. The Conference of the Parties shall review, not later than its second meeting and thereafter on a regular basis, the effective- ness of the mechanism established under this Article, its ability to address the changing needs of the developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition, the criteria and guidance referred to in paragraph 7, the level of funding as well as the effectiveness of the performance of the institutional entities entrusted to operate the financial mechanism. It shall, based on such review, take appropriate action, if necessary, to improve the effectiveness of the mechanism, including by means of recommendations and guidance on measures to ensure adequate and sustainable funding to meet the needs of the Parties. Article 14 Interim financial arrangements The institutional structure of the Global Environment Facility, operated in accordance with the Instrument for the Establish- ment of the Restructured Global Environment Facility, shall, on an interim basis, be the principal entity entrusted with the operations of the financial mechanism referred to in Article 13, for the period between the date of entry into force of this Convention and the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties, or until such time as the Conference of the Parties decides which institutional structure will be designated in accordance with Article 13. The institutional structure of the Global Environment Facility should fulfill this function through operational measures related specifically to persistent organic pollutants taking into account that new arrangements for this area may be needed. Article 15 Reporting 1. Each Party shall report to the Conference of the Parties on the measures it has taken to implement the provisions of this Convention and on the effectiveness of such measures in meeting the objectives of the Convention. 2.

Part IV: Definitions 1. For the purposes of this Annex: (a) \u2018 polychlorinated biphenyls \u2019 means aromatic compounds formed in such a manner that the hydrogen atoms on the biphenyl molecule (two benzene rings bonded together by a single carbon-carbon bond) may be replaced by up to ten chlorine atoms; and (b) \u2018 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins \u2019 and \u2018 polychlorinated dibenzofurans \u2019 are tricyclic, aromatic compounds formed by two benzene rings connected by two oxygen atoms in polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and by one oxygen atom and one carbon-carbon bond in polychlorinated dibenzofurans and the hydrogen atoms of which may be replaced by up to eight chlorine atoms. 2. In this Annex, the toxicity of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans is expressed using the concept of toxic equivalency which measures the relative dioxin-like toxic activity of different congeners of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls in comparison to 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. The toxic equivalent factor values to be used for the purposes of this Convention shall be consistent with accepted international standards, commencing with the World Health Organization 1998 mammalian toxic equivalent factor values for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls. Concentrations are expressed in toxic equivalents. Part V: General guidance on best available techniques and best environmental practices This Part provides general guidance to Parties on preventing or reducing releases of the chemicals listed in Part I. A. General prevention measures relating to both best available techniques and best environmental practices Priority should be given to the consideration of approaches to prevent the formation and release of the chemicals listed in Part I. Useful measures could include: (a) the use of low-waste technology; (b) the use of less hazardous substances; (c) the promotion of the recovery and recycling of waste and of substances generated and used in a process; (d) replacement of feed materials which are persistent organic pollutants or where there is a direct link between the materials and releases of persistent organic pollutants from the source; (e) good housekeeping and preventive maintenance programmes; (f) improvements in waste management with the aim of the cessation of open and other uncontrolled burning of wastes, including the burning of landfill sites. When considering proposals to construct new waste disposal facilities, consideration should be given to alternatives such as activities to minimise the generation of municipal and medical waste, including resource recovery, reuse, recycling, waste separation and promoting products that generate less waste. Under this approach, public health concerns should be carefully considered; (g) minimisation of these chemicals as contaminants in products; 31.7.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 209/23 ",
        "(h) avoiding elemental chlorine or chemicals generating elemental chlorine for bleaching. B. Best available techniques The concept of best available techniques is not aimed at the prescription of any specific technique or technology, but at taking into account the technical characteristics of the installation concerned, its geographical location and the local environmental conditions. Appropriate control techniques to reduce releases of the chemicals listed in Part I are in general the same. In determining best available techniques, special consideration should be given, generally or in specific cases, to the following factors, bearing in mind the likely costs and benefits of a measure and consideration of precaution and prevention: a) General considerations: (i) the nature, effects and mass of the releases concerned: techniques may vary depending on source size; (ii) the commissioning dates for new or existing installations; (iii) the time needed to introduce the best available technique; (iv) the consumption and nature of raw materials used in the process and its energy efficiency; (v) the need to prevent or reduce to a minimum the overall impact of the releases to the environment and the risks to it; (vi) the need to prevent accidents and to minimize their consequences for the environment; (vii) the need to ensure occupational health and safety at workplaces; (viii) comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have been tried with success on an industrial scale; (ix) technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding. (b) General release reduction measures: When considering proposals to construct new facilities or significantly modify existing facilities using processes that release chemicals listed in this Annex, priority consideration should be given to alternative processes, techniques or practices that have similar usefulness but which avoid the formation and release of such chemicals. In cases where such facilities will be constructed or significantly modified, in addition to the prevention measures outlined in section A of Part V the following reduction measures could also be considered in determining best available techniques: (i) use of improved methods for flue-gas cleaning such as thermal or catalytic oxidation, dust precipitation, or adsorption; (ii) treatment of residuals, wastewater, wastes and sewage sludge by, for example, thermal treatment or rendering them inert or chemical processes that detoxify them; (iii) process changes that lead to the reduction or elimination of releases, such as moving to closed systems; (iv) modification of process designs to improve combustion and prevent formation of the chemicals listed in this Annex, through the control of parameters such as incineration temperature or residence time. C. Best environmental practices The Conference of the Parties may develop guidance with regard to best environmental practices. L 209/24 EN Official Journal of the European Union 31.7.2006 ",

(2) In accordance with the Joint Declaration on Article 28 of the Agreement, the extension of the system of cumulation is desirable making it possible to use materials originating in the Community, Bulgaria, Romania, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland (including Liechtenstein), the Faeroe Islands, Turkey or in any other country which is a participant in the Euro \u2011 Mediterranean partnership, based on the Barcelona Declaration adopted at the Euro \u2011 Mediterranean Conference held on 27 and 28 November 1995, in order to develop trade and promote regional integration. (3) For the purposes of implementing the extended system of cumulation only between the countries which have fulfilled the necessary conditions and in order to avoid circumven- tion of customs duties, it is necessary to introduce new provisions concerning certification of origin. (4) For the purposes of implementing the extended system of cumulation and in order to avoid circumvention of customs duties, it is necessary to harmonise the provisions concerning the prohibition of drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties and the processing requirements laid down in Protocol 3 for non \u2011 originating materials to obtain originating status. (5) The extended system of cumulation of origin implies that the same provisions on rules of origin apply in the context of preferential agreements concluded between the countries concerned. (6) Goods in transit or storage on the day on which this Decision becomes applicable should be covered by transitional provisions allowing them to benefit from the extended system of cumulation. (7) Some technical amendments are required in order to correct anomalies in and between the different language versions of the text. (8) It is therefore appropriate, for the proper functioning of the Agreement and with a view to facilitating the work of users and customs administrations, to incorporate in a new text of Protocol 3 all the provisions in question, HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: Article 1 Protocol 3 to the Agreement, concerning the definition of the concept of \u2018 originating products \u2019 and methods of administrative cooperation, shall be replaced by the text attached hereto, together with the relevant Joint Declarations.

The exporter making out an invoice declaration or invoice declaration EUR-MED shall keep for at least three years a copy of this invoice declaration as well as the documents referred to in Article 22(5). 3. The customs authorities of the exporting country issuing a movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED shall keep for at least three years the application form referred to in Article 17(2). 4. The customs authorities of the importing country shall keep for at least three years the movement certificates EUR.1 and EUR- MED and the invoice declarations and invoice declarations EUR- MED submitted to them. Article 30 Discrepancies and formal errors 1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted. 2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document. Article 31 Amounts expressed in euro 1. For the application of the provisions of Article 22(1)(b) and Article 27(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than in euro, amounts in the national currencies of the Member States of the Community, of Jordan and of the other countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4 equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned. 2. A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of Article 22(1)(b) or Article 27(3) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the country concerned. 3. The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October each year. The amounts shall be communicated to the Commission of the European Communities by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The Commission of the European Communities shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts. 4. A country may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 %. A country may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15 % in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion were to result in a decrease in that equivalent value. 5. The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Association Committee at the request of the Community or of Jordan. When carrying out this review, the Association Committee shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro. TITLE VI ARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION Article 32 Mutual assistance 1. The customs authorities of the Member States of the Community and of Jordan shall provide each other, through the Commission of the European Communities, with specimen impressions of stamps used in their customs offices for the issue of movement certificates EUR.1 and EUR-MED, and with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying those certificates, invoice declarations and invoice declarations EUR-MED. 2. In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the Community and Jordan shall assist each other, through the competent customs administrations, in checking the authenticity of the movement certificates EUR.1 and EUR-MED, the invoice declarations and the invoice declarations EUR-MED and the correctness of the information given in these documents. Article 33 Verification of proofs of origin 1. Subsequent verifications of proofs of origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing country have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol. 2. For the purposes of implementing paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing country shall return the movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the invoice declaration or the invoice declaration EUR-MED, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting country giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the request for verification. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification. 3. The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting country. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.

        "4. If the customs authorities of the importing country decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary. 5. The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results thereof as soon as possible. These results shall indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned may be considered as products originating in the Community, in Jordan or in one of the other countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol. 6. If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within ten months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences. Article 34 Dispute settlement Where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 33 which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Association Committee. In all cases, the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing country shall take place under the legislation of that country. Article 35 Penalties Penalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products. Article 36 Free zones 1. The Community and Jordan shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration. 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, when products originating in the Community or in Jordan are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED at the exporter's request, if the treatment or processing undergone complies with the provisions of this Protocol. TITLE VII CEUTA AND MELILLA Article 37 Application of the Protocol 1. The term \u2018 Community \u2019 used in Article 2 does not cover Ceuta and Melilla. 2. Products originating in Jordan, when imported into Ceuta or Melilla, shall enjoy in all respects the same customs regime as that which is applied to products originating in the customs territory of the Community under Protocol 2 of the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Communities. Jordan shall grant to imports of products covered by the Agreement and originating in Ceuta and Melilla the same customs regime as that which is granted to products imported from and originating in the Community. 3. For the purpose of applying paragraph 2 concerning products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this Protocol shall apply mutatis mutandis subject to the special conditions set out in Article 38. Article 38 Special conditions 1. Providing they have been transported directly in accordance with Article 13, the following shall be considered as: (1) products originating in Ceuta and Melilla: (a) products wholly obtained in Ceuta and Melilla; (b) products obtained in Ceuta and Melilla in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in (a) are used, provided that: (i) the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 6; or that (ii) those products originate in Jordan or in the Community, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7; 31.7.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 209/45 ",

        "ANNEX I INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX II Note 1: The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 6 of the Protocol. Note 2: 2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \u2018 ex \u2019 , this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2. 2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1. 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4. 2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 is to be applied. Note 3: 3.1. The provisions of Article 6 of the Protocol, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a contracting party. Example: An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from \u2018 other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging \u2019 of heading ex 7224. If this forging has been forged in the Community from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value- calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the Community. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used. 3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not. 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \u2018 Manufacture from materials of any heading \u2019 , then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression \u2018 Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading ... \u2019 or \u2018 Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product \u2019 means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list. 31.7.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 209/47 ",
        "3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used. Example: The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both. 3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles). Example: The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals. However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture. Example: In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non- originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth \u2014 even if non- woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn \u2014 that is, the fibre stage. 3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non \u2011 originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply. Note 4: 4.1. The term \u2018 natural fibres \u2019 is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun. 4.2. The term \u2018 natural fibres \u2019 includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305. 4.3. The terms \u2018 textile pulp \u2019 , \u2018 chemical materials \u2019 and \u2018 paper-making materials \u2019 are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns. 4.4. The term \u2018 man-made staple fibres \u2019 is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507 Note 5: 5.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4.) L 209/48 EN Official Journal of the European Union 31.7.2006 ",
        "5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials. The following are the basic textile materials: \u2014 silk, \u2014 wool, \u2014 coarse animal hair, \u2014 fine animal hair, \u2014 horsehair, \u2014 cotton, \u2014 paper-making materials and paper, \u2014 flax, \u2014 true hemp, \u2014 jute and other textile bast fibres, \u2014 sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave, \u2014 coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres, \u2014 synthetic man-made filaments, \u2014 artificial man-made filaments, \u2014 current-conducting filaments, \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene, \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester, \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide, \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile, \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide, \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene, \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide), \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride), \u2014 other synthetic man-made staple fibres, \u2014 artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose, \u2014 other artificial man-made staple fibres, \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped, \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped, 31.7.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 209/49 ",
        "\u2014 products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film, \u2014 other products of heading 5605. Example: A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn. Example: A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric. Example: Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures. Example: If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product. 5.3. In the case of products incorporating \u2018 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped \u2019 , this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn. 5.4. In the case of products incorporating \u2018 strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film \u2019 , this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip. Note 6: 6.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product. 6.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles. Example: If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles. 6.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non \u2011 originating materials incorporated.
