        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 1 Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC European Implementation Assessment In November 2015, the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM) notified the EP Conference of Committee Chairs of its intention to draw up a report on the implementation of Directive 2004/113/EC of 13 December 2004 implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services. Agnieszka KOZ\u0141OWSKA- RAJEWICZ (EPP, Poland) was appointed rapporteur. Implementation reports by EP committees are routinely accompanied by European implementation assessments, drawn up by the Ex-Post Impact Assessment Unit of the Directorate for Impact Assessment and European Added Value, within the European Parliament's Directorate-General for Parliamentary Research Services. Abstract Directive 2004/113/EC is part of EU anti-discrimination law and sets a frame of minimum rules for ensuring gender equality in the access to and supply of goods and services. The present assessment critically describes the genesis and implementation of this Directive across EU Member States, in particular after the European Court of Justice \u2018Test-Achats\u2019 case of March 2011, which enforced gender equality in the insurance sector. The notion of \u2018indirect discrimination\u2019 requires increased awareness of multiple factual and legal cause-effect relationships. This appears to be of particular importance in the health sector, where insufficient consideration of female conditions could result in severe adverse consequences. Indirect discrimination in access to goods and services cannot be curbed by applying this Directive alone, but by pursuing equality in all policy areas and notably by consequent application of all other anti-discrimination instruments. Furthermore, the assessment explores the need to adapt the implementation of the Directive to new areas, such as the rapidly developing collaborative economy. The assessment recommends strengthening equality bodies in the Member States and raising awareness of the rights stemming from this and related directives. It also suggests that the Commission entrust the European Equality Law Network with the provision of a thorough and comprehensive update of its 2009 report on the implementation of Directive 2004/113/EC, which could take into account the questionnaire elaborated in the final annex of this European implementation assessment.

        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 4 1 Methodology and thanks This assessment of the implementation at EU and Member State level of Directive 2004/113/EC on the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services is based, inter alia , on the research paper on the implementation of this Directive, commissioned from Leicester Law School (Annex I), as well as on reports by the European Commission, by its Network of Legal Experts in the Field of Gender Equality and Non-Discrimination, by the European Network of Equality Bodies (Equinet), and on various related resolutions of the European Parliament. The kind advice of Susanne Burri from Utrecht University, at the beginning of this project, the requests and suggestions from Paulina Skorupa from the rapporteur\u2019s office as well as those from Willemijn De Jong, Angela Balan and Erika Schulze from the committee secretariats, the reflections and contributions from Eugenia Caracciolo di Torella of Leicester University, the assiduous compilation of statistics and other relevant material by Aida N\u2019Gom Jimenez, and the highlights from Amandine Scherrer and Isabel Daza Moreno from the European Parliamentary Research Service were all helpful and instrumental in the production of this European implementation assessment. Thanks to all who helped or commented. 2 Main objectives and scope of Directive 2004/113/EC The purpose of the Directive is to lay down a framework for combating discrimination based on gender in access to and supply of goods and services, \u2018with a view to putting into effect in the Member States the principle of equal treatment between men and women\u2019 (Article 1). The Directive applies to all providers of goods and services in the private and public sectors (Article 3(1)) and prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination based on gender; the various forms of harassment and instruction to discrimination are also considered \u2018discrimination\u2019 (Articles 2 and 4). According to Article 3, the Directive does not prejudice contractual freedom as long as the choice is not based on gender, and the Directive does not cover: - employment, occupation, or self-employment (as these areas are covered by other EU legislation), - media content, advertising content, 1 or education. As a reason for the latter exclusion, the Commission, in its ex-ante impact assessment of 2003, argued as follows: 2 \u2018Consideration has also been given to the possibility of wider legislative action, covering fields such as taxation, education and the media. Consultation with the stakeholders, 1 Article 3(3) \u2018This Directive shall not apply to the content of media and advertising nor to education\u2019 excludes media and advertising content from application under this Directive. Apart from this restriction, the access to and supply of goods and services in the media and advertising sectors may fall well under this Directive. 2 SEC(2003) 1213 of 5 November 2003, extended impact assessment, accompanying the \u2018proposal for a Council directive implementing the principle of equal treatment for men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services\u2019. ",
        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 5 examination of the legal possibilities offered by the Treaty and respect for subsidiarity has led the Commission to conclude that the evidence was less clear-cut or that it was not apparent that the difficulties could be resolved through legislative means. The Commission has decided therefore that other means would be more appropriate to deal with these issues. The Commission intends, for example, to continue its contacts with the media industries to explore how far voluntary action to contribute to reducing and eliminating damaging sex stereotyping from the media and advertising.\u2019 It is clear however that Articles 21 and 23 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU as well as Articles 3(3) TEU and 8 and 19(1) TFEU leave no doubt that any discrimination on grounds of gender is prohibited and that equality between men and women is to be promoted and ensured in all areas and in all activities of the Union. The Directive itself understands its rules as \u2018 minimum requirements \u2019 (Article 7), leaving room for Member States to \u2018introduce or maintain provisions which are more favourable to the protection of the principle of equal treatment between men and women than those laid down in this Directive\u2019 and also allows for \u2018 positive action \u2019 (Article 6) by Member States \u2018maintaining or adopting specific measures to prevent or compensate for disadvantages linked to sex.\u2019 Furthermore, the Directive includes and endorses particular protection in cases of pregnancy and maternity. 3 Provisions of the Directive on Member States The Directive instructs Member States to provide - judicial and administrative procedures for individuals to claim enforcement of their rights under this Directive and/or compensation if they have been wronged (Article 8(1) and (2), - that competent NGOs or other bodies may engage on behalf or in support of complainants under this Directive (Article 8(3)), - an inversion of the burden of proof (Article 9), - that possible victims are not further victimised in retaliation to their complaint (Article 10), - the promotion of the purposes of the Directive through dialogue with stakeholders (Article 11), - the infrastructure and promotion of the activities of equality bodies charged with the defence of equality rights, including possible assistance to victims, and conducting independent surveys and publication of reports and recommendations on discrimination (Article 12), - that any rules contrary to the principles of the Directive are to be abolished (Article 13), ",
        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 6 - that penalties applicable to infringements \u2018shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive\u2019 (Article 14), - that provisions relating to this Directive are made known to all persons concerned \u2018by all appropriate means throughout their territory\u2019 (Article 15), - and to communicate all information concerning the transposition and application of the Directive to the Commission (Article 14 last phrase, Article 16(1) and Article 17). The European Commission is required to report to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of this Directive; \u2018Where appropriate, the Commission shall accompany its report with proposals to modify the Directive.\u2019 (Article 16, see below 4.3.) 4 Genesis of Directive 2004/113/EC and the 2011 Test-Achats case 4.1. International and European provisions on gender equality The principles of gender equality and of the prohibition of discrimination on basis of gender are present in pieces of international law, e.g. at United Nations and Council of Europe levels. Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU 3 prohibits any discrimination \u2018based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation\u2019, and Article 23 underlines that \u2018equality between men and women must be ensured in all areas, including employment, work and pay\u2019 and provides room for \u2018positive action\u2019: \u2018The principle of equality shall not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex.\u2019 Article 3(3) TEU 4 requires the European Union, inter alia , to \u2018combat social exclusion and discrimination\u2019 and to \u2018promote social justice and protection, equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and protection of the rights of the child.\u2019 Article 8 TFEU 5 requires categorically that \u2018in all its activities, the Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between men and women.\u2019 Based on the founding Treaties of 1957 (Article 119 EEC Treaty and now Article 157(1) TFEU), the European legislator in 1975 began adopting various directives in order to 3 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf 4 Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A12012M%2FTXT 5 Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012E%2FTXT ",
        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 7 combat gender discrimination in employment; the most important legislation in this area is today covered by the Recast Directive 2006/54/EC. 6 4.2. Legislative activities leading to the adoption of the Directive On 10 September 2003, the Committee on Women's Rights of the European Parliament organised a public hearing on the issues concerning the upcoming possible proposals by the Commission for a directive on gender equal access to goods and services. The European Commission published its \u2018proposal for a Council directive implementing the principle of equal treatment for men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services\u2019 (COM(2003)657), accompanied by an \u2018extended impact assessment\u2019 (SEC(2003)1213), in which the Commission acknowledged: \u2018The European Union is founded on the principle of equality. Articles 21 and 23 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibit discrimination based on sex and enshrine the right to equality for men and women in all areas. Article 2 of the Treaty establishing the European Community defines the promotion of equality between men and women as one of the Community\u2019s essential tasks. Article 3(2) EC requires the Community to aim to eliminate inequalities and to promote equality between men and women in all its activities. There is already a very substantial body of Community legislation on equal treatment for men and women in the fields of employment and occupation. No Community action has been taken so far to prohibit sex discrimination in areas outside of the labour market, in contrast to the action adopted in 2000 to prohibit racial discrimination in a wide range of areas outside employment, including in access to all goods and services available to the public.\u2019 The impact assessment listed examples of discrimination on the basis of gender, concerning access to goods and services, and presented a survey of related legislation at the level of the EU Member States; it focused considerably on insurance issues. The 2003 legislative procedure 7 at the European Parliament concluded on 30 March 2004, with a European Parliament legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between women and men in the access to and supply of goods and services. 8 The Council Directive 2004/113/EC of 13 December 2004 implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services was published on 21 December 2004. 9 6 see the European implementation assessment on gender equality in employment and occupation. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/547546/EPRS_STU(2015)547546_ EN.pdf 7 Consultation procedure 2003/0265(CNS) http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?reference=2003/0265(CNS) 8 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&language=EN&reference=P5-TA- 2004-221 9 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2004.373.01.0037.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2004:373:TOC, OJ L 373 ",
        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 8 The deadline for transposition in the Member States was 21 December 2007. 4.3. Test-Achats case before the European Court of Justice and its consequences The Commission was required to submit, no later than 21 December 2010, its summary report to the European Parliament and to the Council, including \u2018a review of the current practices of Member States in relation to Article 5 with regard to the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits\u2019 (Article 16). However, before that date, the Belgian Cour Constitutionnelle referred to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in June 2009; a case which should become known as the \u2018 Test-Achats case\u2019 C-236/09, 10 on the question as to whether Article 5(2) of the Directive, enabling Member States to permit gender specific risk differences in the calculation of premiums and benefits of insurance services, was compatible with the Treaty on European Union. The European Court of Justice, in its decision of 1 March 2011, invalidated Article 5(2) of the Directive: 11 Summary of the Judgement European Union law \u2013 principles \u2013 equal treatment \u2013 equal treatment for men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services \u2013 Directive 2004/113 \u2013 actuarial factors (Council Directive 2004/113, Article 5(2)) Article 5(2) of Directive 2004/113 implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services is invalid with effect from 21 December 2012. It is not disputed that the purpose of Directive 2004/113 in the insurance services sector is, as is reflected in Article 5(1) of that directive, the application of unisex rules on premiums and benefits. Recital 18 in the preamble to Directive 2004/113 expressly states that, in order to guarantee equal treatment between men and women, the use of sex as an actuarial factor must not result in differences in premiums and benefits for insured individuals. Recital 19 in the preamble to that Directive describes the option granted to Member States not to apply the rule of unisex premiums and benefits as an option to permit \u2018exemptions\u2019. Accordingly, Directive 2004/113 is based on the premise that, for the purposes of applying the principle of equal treatment for men and women, enshrined in Articles 21 and 23 of the Charter, the respective situations of men and women with regard to insurance premiums and benefits contracted by them are comparable. Article 5(2) of Directive 2004/113, which enables the Member States in question to maintain without temporal limitation an exemption from the rule of unisex premiums and benefits, works against the achievement of the objective of equal treatment between men 10 Association belge des Consommateurs Test-Achats ASBL and Others vs Conseil des ministres (Reference for a preliminary ruling from the Cour constitutionnelle ) 11 http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62009CJ0236&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= ",

That provision must therefore be considered to be invalid upon the expiry of an appropriate transitional period. 12 Consequently, the Commission was called to elaborate guidelines in view of ensuring consistent implementation of this ruling throughout the Member States. On 13 January 2012 the Commission published guidelines on the application of Council Directive 2004/113/EC to insurance, in the light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-236/09 ( Test-Achats ). Subsequently, the Parliament\u2019s Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality produced a report, 13 and the European Parliament resolution on transposition and application of Council Directive 2004/113/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services was adopted on 16 April 2013. 14 In this resolution, the European Parliament, inter alia , \u20185. Welcomes the Test-Achats ruling, but considers that it has created ongoing uncertainty on the insurance market; expects the development of unisex criteria to result in pricing based on multiple risk factors which fairly reflects individuals\u2019 level of risk regardless of gender, and to detect any potential gender-based discrimination; 6. Considers that the guidelines published by the Commission \u2013 in the absence of a binding or legislative effect \u2013 have not fully dispelled this uncertainty; 7. Calls on the Commission to take practical steps to address the problem by proposing a new legislative text that is fully in line with the guidelines; 8. Notes that the insurance industry should keep making an effort to rearrange premiums in line with unisex criteria by applying actuarial calculations on the basis of other factors; ... 12. Calls on the Commission and the Member States closely to follow developments on the insurance market, and if there are any signs of de facto indirect discrimination, to take all necessary measures to address the problem and to avoid unjustified higher pricing; ... 14. Notes that the provision relating to the shift in the burden of proof has been implemented in most national legislation in the Member States; calls on the Commission to monitor the application of this provision in all Member States; 15. Calls on the Commission to take into consideration cases of discrimination in relation to pregnancy, planning of motherhood, and maternity as regards, for instance, the housing sector (renting) or difficulties in obtaining loans, as well as access to medical goods and services, in particular access to legally available reproductive healthcare and gender reassignment treatment; H Highlighting by the author 13 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?reference=2010/2043(INI) 14 T7-0118/2013 ",

Notes with disappointment that in some Member States women entrepreneurs, in particular single mothers, are frequently discriminated against when trying to secure loans or credit for their businesses and still often face barriers based on gender stereotypes; 20. Calls on the Commission to gather best practices and make them available to Member States in order to provide the necessary resources for supporting positive action and ensuring better implementation of the respective provisions at national level; 21.

Calls on the Commission to properly and accurately monitor the situation of the \u2018equality bodies\u2019 established following the entry into force of the directive, and to check whether all the conditions laid down by EU legislation have been met; places particular emphasis on the fact that the current economic crisis cannot be used as a justification for shortcomings as regards the proper functioning of equality bodies;\u2019 4.4. Transposition and application of the Directive in the Member States On 5 May 2015, the Commission published its Report on the application of Council Directive 2004/113/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services . 15 The Commission report addresses several aspects of the Directive but it does not address \u2018indirect discrimination\u2019 which is explicitly prohibited by Articles 2(b) and 4(1b) of the Directive. Cases of indirect discrimination may constitute the bulk of discrimination cases, although they are often hidden and can be detected only with an understanding of the cause-effect mechanisms involved.

(It is not intended to value both transposition techniques, both have their merits.) The \u2018 Test-Achats \u2019 column demonstrates whether national law respects the ECJ decision in the Test-Achats case, interdicting gender discrimination in insurance premiums. The columns \u2018Media and Advertising\u2019, and \u2018Education\u2019 show whether MS national law goes beyond the scope of the Directive and prohibits gender discrimination in areas of contents of media and advertising, and the education sector. 5 Directive 2004/113/EC within the context of EU anti- discrimination law 5.1. Dimensions of EU anti-discrimination law and its effects EU anti-discrimination secondary law was and is still being developed incrementally, on the basis of the Treaties (see chapter 4.1 above.), following the mutual agreement of the legislators. Due to the different legal bases and to the gradual approach by the legislators for factual and political reasons, EU anti-discrimination law can be classified in three dimensions: - by the type of discrimination tackled: by gender or by other types of discrimination, such as race, origin, religion and belief, disabilities, age, sexual orientation; - by policy area, such as employment and occupation; careers; position in boards of management; access to goods and services; media; education; as well as accessibility requirements; - by instruments such as legal recourse and remedies, burden of proof, prohibition of \u2018victimisation\u2019, role of equality bodies and competent NGOs, awareness measures, as well as legislation on positive actions, maternity leave and other related instruments. As a result, EU anti-discrimination law today is a patchwork where some important elements are still developing \u2013 or were withdrawn by the Commission, such as the 17 A comparative analysis of gender equality law in Europe 2016, gender equality law 2016, by Alexandra Timmer and Linda Senden, for the European network of legal experts in gender equality and non-discrimination, published by Commission DG Justice and Consumers, December 2016, http://www.equalitylaw.eu/downloads/3967-a-comparative-analysis-of-gender-equality-law-in- europe-2016-pdf-867-kb ",

Need for a recast A comprehensive recast of the patchy EU anti-discrimination law could enhance coherence, effectiveness and efficiency, not least of equality bodies. Likewise, heightened awareness of the issues among all concerned stakeholders could result. Many aspects of discrimination are closely interlinked by cause-effect relationships, as are anti-discrimination measures. These measures could become more effective if the cause-effect relationships are understood and the anti-discrimination measures applied in synergy. 18 A revision of the Maternity Leave Directive has not been completely abandoned, but the Commission committed to pursue the issue within the roadmap on a new start to address the challenges of work-life balance faced by working families, which the Commission maintains as an \u2018accompanying initiative\u2019 in the Commission work programme 2017. 19 In particular: European Parliament resolution of 20 May 2015 on maternity leave 20 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&language=EN&reference=P6-TA- 2009-211 21 i.e. the draft \u2018horizontal\u2019 anti-discrimination directive (Commission proposal of 2008) which is still pending in the Council, and which expressly covers education and access to and supply of goods and services which are available to the public (Article 3). 22 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2014/514088/IPOL- JOIN_ET(2014)514088_EN.pdf, by Milieu Ltd., January 2014 23 Progress report of 03 June 2016 http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9336-2016- INIT/en/pdf ; progress report of 22 November 2016 http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14284- 2016-INIT/en/pdf 24 https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV- 15&chapter=4&clang=_en#EndDec ",
        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 14 It should be noted that tackling discrimination is not the sole issue: providing products and services that really meet the different needs of women and men in terms of design, size, comfort, accessibility and respectful marketing is another challenge to be met. The potential of the \u2018female economy\u2019 is not yet being fully exploited in many sectors and can indeed boost the economy. This can be facilitated through an understanding of the various cause-effect relations of the different approaches. For instance, there is an improved chance to ensure goods and services fit and appropriate for women\u2019s needs if there are more women working at middle and top management levels of the enterprises involved in production and distribution, as awareness for the most appropriate design must also be present at the different management levels. 25 The following mind map of cause-effect relationships in discrimination is incomplete by far, but gives a glimpse of the complex multiple dynamic interactions of various discriminations. Other important factors like harassment, violence or taxation distortion, can have both obvious and hidden effects on the other factors. The arrows do not signify inevitable, but rather possible, effects; furthermore, the arrows do not show all the causes; any arrow would deserve a study on its own. 25 A good starting point for understanding the interconnectedness of the different elements, even in relation to other elements like gender budgeting, and the positive effects real gender equality can have on GDP, are the following publications: - Unlocking female employment potential in Europe : drivers and benefits; International Monetary Fund, March 2016, https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=43712.0 ; - The Female Economy, by M.

Article 2(b) of the Directive Article 4 (1.) \u2018 For the purposes of this Directive, the principle of equal treatment between men and women shall mean that (a) there shall be no direct discrimination based on sex, including less favourable treatment of women for reasons of pregnancy and maternity; (b) there shall be no indirect discrimination based on sex.\u2019 explicitly prohibits indirect discrimination. The multiple cause-effect relationships must be understood for the purposes of recognising and judging \u2018indirect discrimination\u2019 which according to Article 2(b) of the Directive happens \u2018 where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons of one sex at a particular disadvantage compared with persons of the other sex, unless that provision, criterion or practice is objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary \u2019. If access to certain goods and services is more difficult for women than for men, this can be evidence of \u2018a particular disadvantage compared with persons of the other sex\u2019. For example, access to and disembarking some trains, buses, underground trains, platforms which impose climbing steep staircases, can be extremely difficult, or impossible to access ",

Article 2(b) of the Directive may have to be applied here. But this example points also to the overarching importance of the proposed accessibility directive, also called the \u2018European accessibility act\u2019, currently in the legislative 26 process on the Commission \u2018proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States as regards the accessibility requirements for products and services\u2019 . This is also an important step for complying with the UN CRPD Convention mentioned above. The proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment, and the European Parliament\u2019s services have published studies on the subject. 27 The providers of any goods or services cannot necessarily be held responsible for each and every type of indirect discrimination \u2013 which should be assessed in fact on a case by case basis. However, the legislator, judges, and advisory bodies, as well as all stakeholders, should be made aware of all major cause-effect relationships that could result in indirect discrimination. Some of the scenarios or cases of indirect discrimination in access to goods and services cannot be resolved by mere application of the different rules of this Directive alone, but would need additional measures, such as under the accessibility act mentioned above. The following examples should further illustrate this reflection. To acquire a product or receive a service, financial resources and also time may be needed. However, financial resources and available time are not distributed equally between genders. Therefore, female poverty 28 is also an issue for gender equal access to goods and services, as are the gender pay gap and the pension gap. The time spent \u2013 mostly by women \u2013 in raising of children and care provision, also means that these women have less time available, not only for pursuing paid jobs but also for using services. Unpaid care provision for disabled or sick persons, the elderly, or children, as well as raising children and running households \u2013 all functions traditionally undertaken by women rather than by men \u2013 have indirect effects both in terms of reduced income and less time available. In these net-like, reticular, multiple cause-effect relationships, the availability of child care facilities is of outstanding importance: not only because this type of service, if it is not for free, is less accessible to those who have less financial resources available (mostly women) but also because access to this type of service, if of good quality, not only enhances early childhood development but also frees time for professional development \u2013 mostly needed by women and especially for single parent families. 26 Procedure 2015/0278(COD) 27 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/search.html?word=european+accessibility+act 28 see European Parliament resolution of 26 May 2016 on poverty: a gender perspective ",

Barcelona Targets What are the 'Barcelona targets'? In March 2002 the European Council, meeting in Barcelona, agreed common targets to improve the provision of childcare in the Member States. EU leaders agreed to \u2018remove disincentives to female labour force participation and strive, taking into account the demand for childcare facilities and in line with national patterns of provision, to provide childcare by 2010 to at least 90 % of children between three years old and the mandatory school age and at least 33 % of children under three years of age \u2019. These goals have since become known as the 'Barcelona targets' and their achievement is at the heart of Europe's economic growth strategies (the Lisbon Strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy). Are the Barcelona targets still valid today? In March 2011, Member States re-affirmed their commitment to the Barcelona targets in the European Pact for Gender Equality (2011-2020). The European Council has made improving labour market access for second wage-earners a priority in the annual growth survey, which sets the main priorities for action to improve economic performance. This is to be achieved through suitable tax incentives and affordable, quality childcare services. On 29 May 2013, under the European Semester, 11 Member States (Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Hungary, Italy, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and the United Kingdom) received country specific recommendations on female employment and on childcare availability/quality and/or full-day school places. In 2012, nine Member States (Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and the United Kingdom) received such recommendations. Back in 2011, seven of these countries had already received a recommendation (Malta and Slovakia were not part of the 2011 round). ... ",

        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 21 It can be concluded, on basis of these figures and data, that in EU and virtually all Member States: \uf0b7 single parents, mostly women, are by far more at risk of poverty than single fathers, and than couples with children; \uf0b7 single mothers are at a particular disadvantage, compared to single fathers (and also compared to most other categories of men) in accessing goods and services; \uf0b7 good childcare services are, in general, less accessible or affordable to the women in most need, also compared to single fathers; \uf0b7 these mothers are therefore at a disadvantage regarding developing a career, which imprisons them in a vicious circle, which could drive them further into the pay gap, and subsequently the pension gap; \uf0b7 affordable and quality childcare services are available in the different Member States at astonishingly variable levels; indirectly, and in conjunction with the different levels of income of women compared to men, this has the consequence that in some countries women are more disadvantaged, compared to men, in accessing childcare services, than in other Member States. This is not the full picture by far, but these examples may show how a conjunction of several cause-effect relationships can result in indirect discrimination. 7 Access to health related products and services: not always meeting women\u2019s needs 7.1. Access to medicinal products and services The most severe effects of indirect gender discrimination, judging from the outcomes, happen in the sector of access to medicinal products and procedures, in cases of risk for early death, life-long sickness or disability, or impaired offspring: This may occur through insufficient testing of medicaments or medicinal procedures for women, in pregnancy, or during breast feeding; and may also result from neglect or underestimation of female conditions, including by prescription of badly adapted medical dosage. On 30 April 2015, the Guardian published an article on \u2018The medical research gender gap: how excluding women from clinical trials is hurting our health, Large gender gaps in research limit how much we know about the difference between women\u2019s health and men\u2019s\u2019. 38 Recital 12 of the Directive \u2018 (12) To prevent discrimination based on sex, this Directive should apply to both direct discrimination and indirect discrimination. Direct discrimination occurs only when one person is treated less favourably, on grounds of sex, than another person in a comparable 37 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-490_en.htm?locale=EN 38 https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/30/fda-clinical-trials-gender-gap-epa- nih-institute-of-medicine-cardiovascular-disease ",
        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 22 situation. Accordingly, for example, differences between men and women in the provision of healthcare services, which result from the physical differences between men and women, do not relate to comparable situations and therefore, do not constitute discrimination\u2019 means that the provision of healthcare services to men and women should be differentiated according to the needs of men and women, with due respect to the physical differences between men and women. On the contrary, giving men and women exactly the same medical treatment when their physical constitution would require a different, adjusted, treatment, may constitute discrimination, e.g. when the treatment of the man is according to the state of the art for men and the treatment of the woman is of the state of the art for men but not for women. A fortiori , there is discrimination when a medical treatment that exists for women only is executed in a disrespectful way (see the case of defective breast implants below). Between 2007 and 2014, more than 14 000 women (in France) were prescribed D\u00e9pakine, D\u00e9pamide or D\u00e9pakote, drugs in which the active substance is valproate, prescribed for conditions of epilepsy, bipolar disorder or to prevent migraine headaches. As a consequence, thousands of children were born with serious health impairment, see e.g. Le Figaro of 14 September 2016. 39 On 15 November 2016, the French Assembl\u00e9e Nationale agreed unanimously 40 to the creation of a fund for the compensation of valproate victims. The fund covers the mainstream type of cases described above, in contrast to the cases of children injured (suffering severe dementia and autism) through direct treatment with valproate. Lessons may have been expected to have been learnt after the Thalidomide case, or the Contergan case, which in the second half of last century was prescribed against epilepsy, insomnia, anxiety or gastritis, but resulted in thousands of babies with malformed limbs. An Guardian article of 23 February 2015 reports that victims are still fighting for compensation. 41 A further example is the scandal of defective breast implants (PIP), upon which the European Parliament adopted its resolution of 14 June 2012 on defective silicone gel breast implants made by French company PIP (2012/2621(RSP) , calling on the Commission, inter alia , 'to develop an adequate legal framework to guarantee the safety of breast implants and medical technology in general'. 42 On 26 September 2012, the Commission proposed COM(2012)0541 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices, and COM(2012)0542 on medical devices, and amending Directive 2001/83/EC, regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, with a common impact assessment (SWD(2012) 273). 43 Parliament\u2019s resolutions of 2 April 2014 44 amended the proposals 39 http://sante.lefigaro.fr/actualite/2016/09/14/25396-depakine-cout-6-milliards-deuros 40 http://www.lemonde.fr/sante/article/2016/11/16/depakine-l-assemblee-donne-son-feu-vert- au-fonds-d-indemnisation_5031759_1651302.html 41 https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/23/german-thalidomide-survivors-continue- fight-for-compensation 42 T7-0262/2012 43 cf .

More effort in including good representation of the users of the drug in clinical trials, better PK/PD modelling of subgroup responses and meta-analyses in late phase development to increase power of detection is needed to ensure drugs will be safe and efficacious in female and subgroup populations. \u2019 46 However, the \u2018medical research gender gap\u2019 is only one aspect of indirect discrimination concerning access to health products and services. There are also other dimensions of gender specific access to health related products and procedures, in particular the aspects of self-determination and freedom of choice. In this context, attention is drawn to the World Health Organization recommendation of 7 November 2016, that \u2018pregnant women must be able to access the right care at the right time\u2019. 47 Denying care to pregnant women would constitute an infringement of this Directive, as explained above. It is up to the women concerned themselves, in the first instance, to decide which medical services they need and prefer to access, and in which circumstances. 7.2. Gender specific adverse effects: endocrinal disruptors and other chemical substances Products used in everyday life and for daily use should not adversely affect the health of people at all, but some products can be more detrimental to one gender than for the other. For example, if a deodorant cosmetic spray increases significantly the risk of breast cancer, then using this spray would put a woman at a \u2018particular disadvantage\u2019 compared with men, (cf. Article 2(b) of the Directive): in addition to the price for the product, she would \u2018pay\u2019 with an increased risk of getting cancer. Sale of such a product could fall under \u2018indirect discrimination\u2019, prohibited under this Directive. This is not fiction: A recent Swiss study 48 found that an aluminium salt frequently present in deodorant products can cause breast cancer, and this was widely reported in the presss. 49 45 EPRS Briefing on medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices, N. Scholz, January 2017. 46 https://pharma.elsevier.com/pharma-rd/women-minorities-clinical-trials/ 47 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/antenatal-care-guidelines/en/ 48 Aluminium chloride promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis in normal murine mammary gland epithelial cells, by Stefano J.

Many of the so-called \u2018endocrinal disruptors\u2019 i.e. substances with adverse effects on hormone systems, have different impacts on men and women. 51 Many of these substances, like Bisphenol A, are \u2018food contact materials\u2019 (FCMs) and are \u2018widely used in everyday life in the form of food packaging, kitchen utensils, tableware, etc. \u2019 52 The European Parliament adopted its resolution on the implementation of the Food Contact Materials Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 on 6 October 2016 and requested, inter alia , the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) \u2018to extend the concept of vulnerable groups to pregnant and breastfeeding women and to include the potential effects of low-dose exposure and non-monotonic dose responses in the risk assessment criteria\u2019; and regretted \u2018that EFSA, in its current risk assessment procedure, does not take account of the so-called \u201ccocktail effect\u201d or the effect of multiple concurrent and cumulative exposures from FCMs and other sources, which can cause adverse effects even if levels of the individual substances in the mixture are low, and exhorts EFSA to do so in future\u2019. Parliament also called on the Commission to consider identifying Bisphenol A as one of the substances classified as a substance of very high concern. Indeed, Bisphenol A acts as an artificial estrogen, it can disrupt the human hormone system and can cause breast cancer, prostate cancer, and infertility. For these and other reasons, France banned Bisphenol A in food contact as of 1 January 2015. Several Member States wish to equally assure protection of consumers\u2019 health and provide an equal level playing field for industry in the different Member States, i.e. to pursue public health 49 e.g. http://www.thelocal.ch/20160926/deodorants-could-cause-cancer-swiss-study-warns; http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3808077/Can-deodorants-cause-CANCER-Study- claims-aluminium-salts-trigger-tumours.html 50 see http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/precautionary_principle.html : \u2018The concept of the precautionary principle was first set out in a European Commission communication adopted in February 2000 in which it defined the concept and envisaged how it would be applied. The precautionary principle is detailed in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). It relates to an approach to risk management whereby if there is the possibility that a given policy or action might cause harm to the public or the environment and if there is still no scientific consensus on the issue, the policy or action in question should not be pursued. Once more scientific information becomes available, the situation should be reviewed. The precautionary principle may only be invoked in the event of a potential risk and can never justify arbitrary decisions. The EU\u2019s regulatory framework on chemicals (Regulation (EC) No 1907/EC \u2013 known as REACH) is based on the precautionary principle, as is its general regulation on food law (Regulation (EC) No 178/2002)).\u2019 51 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/endocrine/definitions/affect_en.htm 52 Food Contact Materials; Regulation (EC) 1935/2004; European Implementation Assessment, by Ekaterina Karamfilova, EPRS, May 2016 ",

On 15 December 2015, the General Court of the European Court of Justice declared \u2018that the European Commission, by failing to adopt delegated acts to specify scientific criteria for the determination of endocrine-disrupting properties, has failed to fulfil its obligations under the first subparagraph of Article 5(3) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products.\u2019 The Commission presented two draft legal acts \u2013 one under the legislation on biocidal products, the other under plant protection products legislation, on 15 June 2016 \u2013 which set the criteria for endocrine disruptor identification. 55,56 In the related impact assessment 57 the Commission included \u2018pregnant and nursing women, the unborn, infants and children, the elderly...\u2019 in the definition of vulnerable groups. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) published their common outline of draft guidance, document for the implementation of the hazard-based criteria to identify endocrine disruptors on 20 December 2016. 58 It is to be hoped that this will pave the way for a ban, or a much more cautious and safe approach to bisphenols, phtalates and the numerous other substances that can affect severely and differently the health of men and women. 8 Sharing economy: opportunities and threats 8.1. The provider-consumer relation: change of paradigm People are sharing goods and services increasingly via internet platforms which work \u2013 at first sight \u2013 like marketplaces, bringing together the offers and demands of a large number of people.

The \u2018potential economic gain linked with a better use of capacities otherwise under-used as a result of the sharing economy\u2019 was estimated at more than \u20ac500 billion per year across the EU-28. 60 In many economic sectors, traditional businesses that hitherto could be characterised by \u2018bilateral\u2019 relationships between provider and consumer tend to transmute into trilateral or multilateral relationships between platform providers, private service providers and individual consumers, with the \u2018platform\u2019 being a website offering a set of services, i.e. accessible \u2018remotely\u2019 via internet. Figure 7 \u2013 Change of paradigm from the conventional business model to the sharing economy business model: Source: EPRS Consequently, the individual consumer relates both to a platform provider and to an individual, possibly unknown, service provider, but also the individual service provider will be situated vis-\u00e0-vis a platform provider and possibly unknown consumers. An individual provider \u2018 shares \u2019 via a \u2018platform\u2019 and against a \u2018fee\u2019 a product or service to a consumer, and: An individual provider \u2018 collaborates \u2019 via a \u2018platform\u2019 (and against some remuneration) for providing consumers with products or services.

Regulatory issues Due to its economic and social relevance, the collaborative economy has raised regulatory issues at EU level as well as in EU Member States, for reasons of possible market imbalances and unfair competition in relation to traditional market players, because of non-regulated issues related to labour standards and rights, consumer protection, taxation, liability, quality of services and user safety. 61, 62,63 Whereas traditional business forms had time to develop, normally over decades, and checks and balances could evolve gradually, possibly involving syndicates, trade unions and/or legislators or a common understanding, the upcoming sharing business models are developing fast and hectically: the individual consumer is faced as a service taker with both the \u2018powerful\u2019 and remote platform provider and with one or more individual service providers; the individual service provider is faced with the \u2018powerful\u2019 and remote platform of which s/he is also a service taker, as well as with one or more individual consumers to whom s/he is providing an individual service. Platform providers set the rules alone, to their advantage, and according to their priorities. This means that provider\u2019s rules are designed so as to increase the platform owners\u2019 economic benefit and sustainability as well as their informational power over (and therefore also social entanglement with) both, the individual \u2018service provider\u2019 and \u2013 in different forms \u2013 the individual consumer.

Its conclusions are as follows: \u20184. Conclusion In view of the significant benefits that new collaborative economy business models can bring, Europe should be open to embracing these new opportunities. The EU should proactively support the innovation, competitiveness and growth opportunities offered by modernisation of the economy. At the same time, it is important to ensure fair working conditions and adequate and sustainable consumer and social protection. For this to happen, citizens and businesses should be aware of the rules and obligations applying to them, as clarified in this Communication. Member States are encouraged to clarify their national situation in a similar way. The Commission stands ready to work with Member States and relevant authorities to support them in this process. The guidance provided in this Communication aims at supporting consumers, businesses and public authorities to engage confidently in the collaborative economy. It will also support Member States to consistently apply EU law across the single market. The Commission will continuously review developments in the European collaborative economy, collect statistical data and evidence and work with Member States and stakeholders also to exchange best practices. The Commission looks forward to engaging in a dialogue with the European Parliament, the Council and Member States to ensure the best possible environment for citizens and businesses in the collaborative economy.\u2019 64 It is not always clear at first sight whether this can qualify for \u2018service\u2019 in the context of the Directive, and there are authors, who claim that collaborative platforms are only \u2018digital ",

Individual consumer and provider vis-\u00e0-vis the platform provider Given this constellation, both, individual consumer and individual service provider may be found in weak or even vulnerable positions vis-\u00e0-vis the platform provider. At stake are therefore, a priori , the following characteristics and aspects: \uf0b7 possible absence of adequate rules in favour, or protecting interests of consumers on the one hand, as well as of individual service providers on the other; \uf0b7 difficulty or impossibility for individual consumers to organise themselves with fellow consumers or to liaise with consumer protection organisations knowledgeable in the specific new business model; \uf0b7 difficulty or impossibility for individual service providers to organise themselves with peers, and at the same time competitors, in syndicates, trade unions or other, adapted forms of appropriate defence of interests; \uf0b7 a partial transparency and anonymity for individual service providers and of consumers, depending on the rules imposed by the platform provider, \uf0b7 in contrast to platform providers endowed with considerable power, economically and \u2018informationally\u2019 (i.e. as owner of the data of the private persons engaging with the platform as consumer or individual provider); \uf0b7 lack of rules for protection of individual service providers and consumers against overreach or harassment by fellow service providers or consumers; 65 \uf0b7 a lack of social guarantees for individual service providers, and build-up of credits and rights for unavailability periods for service requests (e.g. absence of clients, sickness, unavailability, pregnancy, obligations for child care; however, in contrast, some of the collaborative business models may be in favour and supportive of the latter aspect); marketplaces\u2019, not service providers, and that rules for service providers such as anti- discrimination rules are not applicable to platforms (Guido Smorto at the EP IMCO workshop of 8 November 2016). In contrast, at the same workshop, Natali Helberger affirmed that the (individual) service providers use brokering services, marketing and hosting of the platforms and that consumer law should protect them in using these platform services, see also background report on Protecting Consumers in Peer Platform markets: Exploring the Issues; OECD 25 May 2016. Eugenia Caracciolo di Torella writes (p.I-8) that, although the Directive does not define \u2018goods\u2019 or \u2018services\u2019, its recital 11 states that they should be taken to be those within the meaning of the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community (EC), and the services need not necessarily be paid for by those for whom they are performed. In fact, only the latter interpretation is coherent with the general anti-discrimination rules in the Treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. 65 For example, vandalism or other disrespectful behaviour of persons in the rooms they rented via the Airbnb platform; or harassment by a user of a shared car.

Furthermore, vulnerable people or people unaware of the risks, e.g. risks arising from the absent or insufficient data protection, may be more at risk of being lured into dependent relationships, which could eventually develop into forms of slavery, bondage and destitution. 8.4. Gender specific hazards Following all these considerations, it appears that upcoming sharing and collaborative business may be associated not only with opportunities, but also with quite some risks for vulnerable people. Women, in the average, may be more vulnerable and exposed to some of the risks mentioned, than men. It appears therefore questionable that the documents on the European Commission\u2019s European agenda for the collaborative economy 66 of 2 June 2016 do not address these aspects of vulnerability and particularly female vulnerability; given the Commission\u2019s commitment to gender mainstreaming in all policy areas, this question should have been addressed. This discourse is not merely theoretical, as cases of harassment, violence and vandalism by individual users against individual service providers have been reported. Therefore, and as argued in the research paper of Dr Caracciolo di Torella, the principle of non-discrimination for access to and supply of goods and services should be applied to new emerging areas such as the collaborative economy. As explained above, analysis and open-mindedness are needed for identifying constellations and cause-effect relationships that may result in scenarios of indirect discrimination. But what is the legal nature of the relation of the individual provider with the \u2018platform\u2019? This could be of relevance to the type of anti-discrimination law to be applied: 8.5. Individual providers : also a \u2018worker\u2019 or \u2018self - employed\u2019? Looking again at the figure on change of paradigm from the \u2018conventional\u2019 to the sharing business model, this time focusing on employees \u2013 the relationship between the \u2018provider\u2019 and his employees are governed by a set of labour law, complemented by social security law, tax law etc. in the conventional model. Whereas in the \u2018conventional\u2019 model the provider needs a sufficient number of employees for production of goods or provision of services, in relation to the demand from the consumers; in the sharing economy, the provider needs only a fraction of the number of direct employees, merely to 66 COM(2016)356 and annexes, see http://ec.europa.eu/growth/single- market/services/collaborative-economy_en ",

With the consequence that labour law becomes applicable? This would mean that the relationship between the private service provider and the platform provider \u2013 initially rather characterised by the private service provider using intermediary exchange services of the platform in view of contacting potential consumers \u2013 turns into a labour relationship with the platform. This means that the nature of relationship of the private service provider and the platform is blurred: it can range between: \uf0b7 the platform being a mere marketplace, 67 \uf0b7 and an \u2018access to services relationship\u2019 \uf0b7 to a labour relationship, 67 even a \u2018mere\u2019 online marketplace is a provider of services (information services and brokering services) ",

This has to be analysed and assessed on a case by case basis. 8.6. Court cases In this context it is therefore of great relevance to take note of a UK employment court ruling of 28 October 2016, 68 which after in-depth analysis of the UBER rules for drivers and the factual application of the rules on the ground, qualified UBER drivers not as self- employed but as workers, entitled to national minimum wage, holiday pay, pensions and other workers\u2019 rights. 69 Furthermore, on 29 November 2016, the European Court of Justice heard UBER in the case C-434/15 - Asociaci\u00f3n Profesional Elite Taxi , a case referred to the ECJ in 2015 by a Spanish judge. The question at stake is whether UBER is a transport company or a digital service. 70 The ECJ adviser is expected to give a non-binding opinion in the months to come, before the Court delivers a judgement. 71 Other requests for preliminary rulings (emanating from courts in France and Belgium), related to UBER, are pending at the European Court of Justice (C-526/15 and C-320/16). The outcome of these UBER cases may impact on other platform providers, for other collaborative businesses, and on their users. But the legal nature of the relation of the individual service providers with the platform provider has to be assessed on a case by case basis, analysing: \uf0b7 the rules the platform is imposing, \uf0b7 the algorithms the platform is applying, 72 \uf0b7 the way the platform provider is applying its rules, and \uf0b7 the factual scenarios on the ground. It is therefore possible that for some collaborative business, the individual service providers are indeed in a labour relationship with the platform provider, in other cases the individual service provider can be qualified as self-employed , and in yet other cases the individual service provider is neither a worker (in relation to the platform) nor self- employed, but merely a service taker (from the platform; as well as a service giver to the peer consumer). In some cases the lines between these natures of the individual service provider may be blurred, or all these three aspects may even be present simultaneously, 68 https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/aslam-and-farrar-v-uber-reasons- 20161028.pdf ; this judgement is subject to appeal. 69 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/uber-uk-tribunal-self-employed- status; see also http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/10/28/uber-awaits-major-tribunal- decision-over-drivers-working-rights/ 70 http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/economia/proteccionismo-economia-colaborativa- uber-los-tribunales-5659312 29 November 2016 71 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/29/uber-europe-court-case-pollution 29 November 2016 72 mostly the platforms\u2019 software, in conjunction with the dedicated apps on the users\u2019 smartphones.

The type of gender equality law applicable Concerning gender equality issues at EU level, in the first case, i.e. labour relationship (of the individual service provider to the platform provider) the Directive 2006/54/EU on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation (recast) would be applicable; in the second case Directive 2010/41/EU on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity would apply; and in the third case Directive 2004/113/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services applies. In any case, this Directive remains of relevance for the consumers of any collaborative business. Examples of undesired indirect effects in the housing sector The massive rise in renting rooms to tourists via sharing platforms appears to have considerably curbed the availability of housing space in several cities, with the particular effect of reduction of availability of low cost housing which would be of importance for vulnerable people like one parent families, which are mostly led by women . This is in addition to the negative effects on the hotel industry and to falling tax income. The dimensions of such effects induced several municipalities to take vigorous legal or administrative action or to negotiate with Airbnb and similar platforms restrictive rules: - Barcelona municipality intends to impose penalties of \u20ac600 000 against Airbnb and Homeaway for placing flats unlawfully, i.e. without licence and without paying the associated fees, after a first penalty of \u20ac30 000 imposed in December 2015 proved fruitless; 74 as reasons for this step were indicated, inter alia, \u2018houses and flats got unaffordable for most local people\u2019 and \u2018the fundamental right for accommodation is violated\u2019, as the mayor of Barcelona claimed. 75 - Amsterdam municipality agreed with Airbnb to limit the renting of flats to a maximum of 60 days per year, whereas London agreed a \u2018more lenient\u2019 deal: up to 90 days. 76 Critics claim that Airbnb is one of the sources of the rising cost of accommodation. 77 On the other hand it should be considered that Airbnb and similar platforms can enable tenants 73 Lawyers would then need to deliberate more in \u2018both and\u2019 categories than in categories of \u2018either or\u2019, i.e. adopting a more inclusive thinking. 74 http://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/dienstleister/airbnb-und-homeaway-barcelona- plant-hohe-strafen-fuer-wohnungsvermittlungsportale/14892790.html 24 November 2016 75 ibidem, http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2016/11/24/catalunya/1479976225_934881.html http://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20161124/412132887490/barcelona-multa- airbnb-homeway-pisos-sin-licencia.html 76 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/03/airbnb-regulation-london- amsterdam-housing 03 December 2016 77 http://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/dienstleister/airbnb-vermietungsdauer-in- amsterdam-auf-60-tage-begrenzt/14920730.html 01 December 2016 ",

Tax avoidance by prominent platforms of the \u2018gig\u2019 economy is reaching billions of euros. 8182 However, tax haven functions are not the only tangible privileges offered by certain countries which practice a sort of economic Darwinism at the expense of other countries: leniency for \u2018gig\u2019 platform positions in questions of consumer rights and data protection, anti-discrimination, labour rights and defence of fair competition. 83 The way forward therefore, also in the areas of shared economy, continues to be the community method, 84 which alone allows the EU economy to grow as a whole, and simultaneously protect individuals\u2019 rights, particularly on equality and anti- discrimination. Some examples of undesired effects in the housing sector are quoted in the box above, underlining the possible massive effects sharing economy platforms can have on the affordability of accommodation, notably for vulnerable people, a large section of which are single parents, who are mostly women, hence the link to gender equality.

It is, however, worthwhile considering that instruments from other policy areas may have impacts on gender equal access to goods and services: According to a recent study on \u2018gender equality in trade agreements\u2019, commissioned upon request from the FEMM committee, 87 trade agreements can impact on gender equality both in EU and in the trade partner countries, in particular concerning access to goods and services. For example, when a number of services traditionally provided by the public sector are now increasingly subject to competition from foreign companies. The key findings of the study mention that \u2018Trade affects various dimensions of gender inequality through three main channels: employment, consumption and public provision of services. ... Gendered effects related to possible changes in the quality of social services, and equity of access to them, are less understood and documented in the literature.

These bodies cooperate as EQUINET, the European Network of Equality Bodies, \u2018which are empowered to counteract discrimination as national equality bodies across the range of grounds including age, disability, gender, race or ethnic origin, religion or belief, and sexual orientation.\u2019 88 On 28 November 2016, EQUINET published its \u2018Perspective on Intersectionality\u2019, 89 in which it argues that \u2018The different grounds covered by equal treatment legislation intersect. People hold more than one of the personal characteristics that are used in defining each of the different grounds of gender, gender identify, age, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief or disability.\u2019 This EQUINET paper recommends: a) that the equality bodies \uf0b7 \u2018Stimulate exchange amongst themselves in order to build a shared understanding of intersectionality; \uf0b7 Build their own capacity and practice to view and review their work; \uf0b7 Establish a formal exchange on the research work being done; \uf0b7 Further support good practices by employers and service providers;\u2019 b) recommends to the European Union and its Member States under \u2018 Legislation\u2019: \uf0b7 \u2018Provision on multiple discrimination in equal treatment provides a vital stimulus for action on intersectionality,\u2019 and \uf0b7 \u2018Such provisions should be accompanied by enhanced sanctions.\u2019 88 http://www.equineteurope.org/-About-us-#stratplan 89 http://www.equineteurope.org/Equinet-Perspective-Innovating-at-the-Intersections-Equality- Bodies-tackling ",

The authors of the research paper and of this introduction therefore suggest to use a revised questionnaire, see Annex II below, for future research on the application of this and related Directives, inciting consideration of intersectionality 91 and multiple cause- effect relationships that could result in indirect discrimination of men and women in accessing goods and services. The Commission\u2019s Network of Legal Experts in Gender Equality and Non-Discrimination could be inspired by some of the ideas and questions formulated in Annex II, as well as on the basis of their own comprehensive research on this matter in the past years. 92 12 Further References A Comparative analysis of gender equality law in Europe 2016, by Alexandra Timmer and Linda Senden, for the European network of legal experts in gender equality and non- discrimination, December 2016, DG Justice and Consumers http://www.equalitylaw.eu/downloads/3967-a-comparative-analysis-of-gender- equality-law-in-europe-2016-pdf-867-kb European network of legal experts in gender equality and non-discrimination Gender equality law in Europe DG Justice and Consumers, December 2016 How are EU rules transposed into national law in 2016? 90 http://www.equineteurope.org/IMG/pdf/summary_- _equinet_intersectionality_perspective.pdf 91 \u2018intersectionality\u2019: i.e. paying attention to several types of discrimination or vulnerabilities being present in any case. 92 in particular the 2009 report on Sex Discrimination in the Access to and Supply of Goods and Services and the Transposition of Directive 2004/113/EC as well as its Annual Reports on Equality between Women and Men and its country reports which provide each year a thorough analysis of the transposition and effective implementation of the gender equality directives as well as a description of measures going beyond the minimum requirements of these Directives.

        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 I - 4 Executive Summary The purpose of this research is to further our understanding of the application of Directive 2004/113/EC (the Directive). 93 The Directive was adopted in December 2004 and is the first instrument that extends the principle of gender equality beyond the realm of the workplace to everyday areas of life. The idea behind such a Directive stemmed from the concern that, although undeniable progress had been made in the pursuit of gender equality in Europe, discrimination based on sex 94 continued to occur in many areas of life. It is thus emphasised that the fight against gender discrimination in the field of goods and services is an integral part of the wider gender equality principle. As such, it is as important as gender equality in the area of employment and should be co- ordinated with other EU gender equality Directives. This paper takes stock of how, after more than a decade, Directive 2004/113/EC has been implemented: to what extent has it affected the EU and the Member States\u2019 gender equality framework? Has it deepened or improved the application of the principle of gender equality across the Member States? This paper also aims to assess the gaps and the challenges which still exist. For various reasons, ranging inter alia from lack of awareness of the content of the Directive and accordingly the lack of case law, the impact of this specific Directive is arguably the most complicated of the EU equality instruments to assess. This paper reaches the conclusion that, despite significant achievements, work remains to be done. The level of progress in certain areas, such as the overall transposition of the Directive across the Member States and the effect of the Test Achats decision, 95 is certainly pleasing. It is, however, worrying that in other areas, such as the relationship between the use and supply of goods and services and pregnancy and maternity, too little has changed over the years. Furthermore, there are specific areas, such as the collaborative economy, that were not contemplated at the time of drafting the Directive. This research paper suggests that it would be advisable to have a new comprehensive report by the European Equality Law Network 96 on the implementation of Directive 2004/113/EC. This research paper is divided into three parts. Part I provides reflections on the evolution of the principle of sex equality in EU law and places Directive 2004/113/EC in this context. It also examines the content of the Directive with a view to highlight the overall importance of this instrument for the enhancement of the principle of gender equality in the EU. Part II analyses the state of its implementation in the Member States. Although at the time of writing this paper the Directive has been 93 Council Directive 2014/113/EC of 13 December 2004 implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services OJ L 373, 21.12.2004, p. 37-48. 94 For the purposes of this research paper, although the two concepts differ, \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csex\u201d are used interchangeably. 95 Case C-236/09 Association Belge des Consommateurs Test-Achats ASBL and Others v Conseil des ministres [2011] ECR I-00773.

        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 I - 6 1. Directive 2004/113/EC within the Context of EU Gender Equality Law I \u2013 Background Achievement of the principle of gender equality is one of the \u201cmissions\u201d, 97 an aim 98 and a task 99 of the European Union (EU). This commitment is further reinforced by Articles 8 and 10 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) which introduces the principle of gender mainstreaming. 100 There are also more specific provisions, such as Article 157 TFEU which establishes the obligation of equal pay between men and women. Article 157 TFEU also provides a general legal basis for the adoption of measures in the field of gender equality, which includes equality and non-discrimination on the ground of pregnancy and maternity within the workplace. In addition, Article 19 TFEU extends the principle of non-discrimination to several grounds, namely sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Finally, the EU Charter of 97 M. Bell , \u201cThe Principle of Equal Treatment: Widening and Deepening\u201d in P. Craig and G. de Burca (eds.), The Evolution of EU Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), pp. 611\u2013639. 98 Article 2 TEU states that the \u201cUnion is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail\u201d. 99 Article 3(3) TEU states that the Union \u201cshall combat social exclusion and discrimination, and shall promote social justice and protection, equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and protection of the rights of the child\u201d. 100 Article 8 of the TFEU guarantees that \u201dthe Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between men and women\u201d and Article 10 states that the Union shall aim to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation in defining and implementing its policies and activities. Key findings \uf0b7 Gender equality is a task and an aim of EU law. \uf0b7 Directive 2004/113/EC is the first EU instrument that brings gender equality outside the area of employment and occupation. \uf0b7 Directive 2004/113/EC is instrumental to the concept of gender equality. Thus it is as important as gender equality in employment and occupation. \uf0b7 The Directive, however, is rather narrow (as compared with, for example, Directive 2000/43/EC, the \u201cRace Equality Directive\u201d, which attracts greater protection). \uf0b7 There is generally little awareness of the content of the Directive. \uf0b7 One of the main difficulties in assessing the implementation and the effectiveness of the Directive is the lack of case law on this point.

        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 I - 7 Fundamental Rights firmly reiterates the importance of the concept of equality . 101 Over the years, the provisions in the TFEU have been further developed by a sophisticated array of secondary legislation to cover many aspects of the working relationship. These include, but are not limited to, Directive 2006/54/EC (Recast Directive) 102 and Directive 2010/41/EU (gender equality of self-employed). 103 Directive 2004/113/EC added a new element to this complex web by extending the principle of equal treatment of men and women beyond the strict confines of the workplace to the access to and the supply of goods and services in both the public and private sectors. 104 The idea was that, in order to be effective, the principle of equality could not be confined to a single area (employment) but needed to be applied to all aspects of everyday life. McColgan explained that the Directive had the potential for \u201cgap-filling.\u201d 105 At the time of its first drafting 106 the Directive was presented almost as a \u201chuman rights\u201d instrument and could have potentially included a vast range of areas, including sensitive areas such as social assistance, education, media, advertising and taxation. This (unsurprisingly) did not happen 107 and, when introduced, it received a mixed reception. Part of the doctrine saw it as a missed opportunity, 108 or as a \u201cdisappointing (\u2026) instrument addressing (non-controversial) areas that have a clear connection with the workplace\u201d; others saw it as a \u201ccurate's egg\u201d. 109 101 OJ [2010] C82/02; see in particular the Articles in Title III (Equality), Article 20 (equality) and Article 23 (gender equality). 102 Directive 2006/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation (recast), OJ [2006] L204/23.

        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 I - 8 The deadline for implementation was December 2007. In 2009 the first report on its implementation was produced. 110 Since then, other reports have been produced but none as comprehensive. The aim of this research paper is, therefore, to provide a critical assessment of its implementation across Europe over the past decade. II \u2013 The Scope of Application of the Directive Directive 2004/113/EC prohibits direct (Article 4(1)(a)) and indirect (Article 4(1)(b)) discrimination, including less favourable treatment of women for reasons of pregnancy and maternity (Article 4(2)), as well as harassment and sexual harassment (Article 4(3)) and instruction to discriminate wherever goods or services are offered or supplied (Article 4(4)). In line with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), the prohibition of discrimination is also extended to gender reassignment. 111 It applies \u201cto all persons who provide goods and services, which are available to the public irrespective of the persons concerned as regards to both the public and private sectors.\u201d 112 The Directive does not define \u201cgoods\u201d or \u201cservices\u201d, but recital 11 states that they should be taken to be those within the meaning of the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community (EC). Therefore, we rely on Article 57 TFEU (previously Article 50 TEC) which states that services are those \u201cnormally provided for remuneration, in so far as they are not governed by the provisions relating to freedom of movement for goods, capital and persons\u201d, and on the established case law of the CJEU which refers to goods as \u201cproducts which can be valued in money and which are capable as such of forming the subject of commercial transaction\u201d. 113 The European Commission has recently clarified that the economic nature of the activity does not depend on the national legal status of the provider. 114 Furthermore, the services need not necessarily be paid for by those for whom they are performed. 115 It has also confirmed that services can include health services. Media, advertising and education are expressly excluded from the scope of the Directive (Article 3(3)), while Article 4(5) provides that the Directive shall not preclude differences in treatment if the provision of goods and services offered exclusively or primarily to members of one sex is justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving it are 110 S.

        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 I - 9 appropriate and necessary. 116 In addition, Article 3(1) excludes from its scope those services directed to a small circle of individuals (e.g. family, friends and colleagues) by reason of their falling within the private rather than public sphere. It is unfortunate that the CJEU has not yet had the opportunity to rule on the above provisions. Furthermore, there is a limited amount of domestic case law, the outcome of which is not always consistent as it depends on the interpretation of the national equality bodies, which differs from State to State. 117 In practice, this causes difficulties when trying to assess on a case-by-case basis the justification and proportionality of a given derogation to the principle of equal treatment. There have been instances where Article 6 of the Directive, which provides the possibility for Member States to take positive actions to prevent or compensate disadvantages linked to sex, has been used to justify unequal treatment. Article 5 is the provision which has received the most discussion and which has had, so far, the most noticeable impact. Article 5(1) requires Member States to ensure that the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for the purposes of insurance and related financial services shall not result in differences in individuals' premiums and benefits. This principle is further reinforced by Article 5(3), which expressly prohibits the use of pregnancy and maternity as a way to discriminate in the calculation of premiums and benefits for the purposes of insurance and related financial services. Increased costs relating to pregnancy and maternity shall not result in differences in individuals' premiums and benefits. Originally, Article 5(2) contained an exception that allowed Member States under certain circumstances to differentiate on the basis of gender. This derogation was the subject of litigation and in the Test-Achats case the CJEU declared it invalid with effect from 21 December 2012. As a result, in all new insurance contracts concluded after 21 December 2007, the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits may not result in differences in individuals' premiums and benefits. III \u2013 Objectives and Methodology Using a gender perspective, this paper analyses the application of Directive 2004/113 in the 28 Member States 118 of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein (the European Economic Area (EEA) Countries) and four candidate 116 Note that the scope of application of Directive 2004/113/EC is more limited than the scope of application of Directive 2000/43/EC. On the one hand, Article 3 of the former states that: \u20181. Within the limits of the powers conferred upon the Community (...) to all persons who provide goods and services, which are available to the public irrespective of the person concerned as regards both the public and private sectors, including public bodies, and which are offered outside the area of private and family life and the transactions carried out in this context (...) 3. This Directive shall not apply to the content of media and advertising nor to education (...)\u2019 On the other hand, Council Directive 2000/43 has a broader scope of application. Art 3 states that: \u20181. Within the limits of the powers conferred upon the Community (...) to all persons, as regards both the public and private sectors, including public bodies, in relation to: (e) social protection, including social security and healthcare; (f) social advantages; (g) education; (h) access to and supply of goods and services which are available to the public, including housing\u2019. 117 See the discussion below at p. 31. 118 Despite the outcome of the referendum on 23 June 2016, at the time of writing the UK remains a full member of the European Union.

The Implementation of Directive 2004/113/EC I) The Implementation Process: Scope of the Directive 1) The Implementation Process \u2013 General Remarks Directive 2004/113/EC was enacted in December 2004 and Member States had three years to implement it. In 2009, a report by the European Network highlighted the relatively limited impact of the Directive. 123 Nearly a decade later, issues remain. Indeed, at the time of writing this paper, although the Directive has been transposed across 123 S. Burri , A. McColgan , Sex Discrimination in the Access to and Supply of Goods and Services and the Transposition of Directive 2004/113/EC, European Commission 2009. Key findings \uf0b7 Directive 2004/113/EC has been implemented in all the Member States. \uf0b7 Despite the fact that the Directive has been around for more than a decade, it is still difficult to assess its impact. \uf0b7 Its implementation varies across the Member States. Some have simply transposed the wording of the Directive with a \u201ccopy-out\u201d approach while others have developed their own interpretation. In either case, difficulties remain. \uf0b7 The most problematic area in the implementation of the Directive involves the different approaches taken by Member States towards those services which may be offered exclusively to one sex and the justification for that unequal treatment (Article 4(5)). \uf0b7 Since its implementation, ways in which goods and services are accessed and supplied have changed. It is important to consider whether the Directive could apply to situations which were not originally contemplated. \uf0b7 New and innovative services offered via the collaborative economy have challenged the traditional model of economy. It is important to evaluate the impact that this new form of economy has on how goods and services are accessed and supplied from a gender equality perspective. \uf0b7 There is a lack of awareness amongst the general public of the content and implications of the Directive. \uf0b7 This has led to a lack of reporting and thus a lack of case law. Sometimes the lack of case law is erroneously equated to a lack of problems. \uf0b7 The equality bodies potentially play a very important role and there is a need to find ways to strengthen their position. \uf0b7 Compensation awarded in the case of infringements of Directive 2004/113/EC is lower than compensation awarded for infringement of provisions in other Directives.

        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 I - 12 Europe, its implementation continues to vary considerably. In the main, national legislatures have adopted a \u201ccopy-out\u201d approach as regards both the principle and the exceptions allowed ( Austria , Croatia , Cyprus , Greece , Italy , Liechtenstein , FYR Macedonia and Poland ). The Spanish expert reports that although such an approach has meant that, formally, it can be said that the Directive has been correctly implemented, its impact remains rather limited. This is due to the lack of initiative on behalf of the domestic authorities, the lack of specific regulations outlining rights and obligations in the various areas and in contractual agreements, as well as the lack of legal claims concerning specific discrimination issues. The same conclusion was reached by the Slovenian expert, who described the national law as \u201ctoo broad\u201d. In some instances new legislation has been drafted for the specific purpose of transposing the Directive (e.g. Romania , 124 Lithuania ). When this is the case there may be issues regarding the correct transposition. 2) Goods and Services In some countries national legislation only prohibits discrimination in the provision of public services, but not goods ( Serbia) . 125 In Latvia , the provision for services between individuals is not covered. 126 A similar situation occurs in both Slovenia and Norway where neither \u201cgoods\u201d nor \u201cservices\u201d are defined. 3) Exceptions The national reports produced by the European Network show that it is not unusual for national legislation to go further than the requirements of the Directive and to cover areas explicitly excluded from its scope of application. This is so in the case of media and advertising, and education. 124 In this case, for example, the Romanian Government has adopted a separate piece of legislation exclusively transposing Directive 2004/113/EC: Ordonanta de Urgenta a Guvernului nr.61/2008 privind implementarea principiului egalitatii de tratament intre femei si barbati in ceea ce priveste accesul la bunuri si servicii si furnizarea de bunuri si servicii . 125 According to Article 17(1) of the Law on the Prohibition of Discrimination (LPD), discrimination occurs \u2018if a legal or physical entity, within the framework of its/his/her activities or profession, refuses to provide a service on the grounds of a personal characteristic of an individual or a group of persons, or if the said entity, in order to provide the service in question, requires the fulfilment of some condition that is not required of other individuals or group of persons, or if the said entity unwarrantedly gives priority to another individual or a group of persons when it comes to providing a service.\u2019 Article 17(2) LPD further specifies that everyone has \u2018the right to equal access to premises in public use (premises where the head offices of public administration organs are located, premises used in the sphere of education, healthcare, social welfare, culture, sports, tourism, premises used for the purpose of environmental protection, protection against natural disasters and the like), as well as public spaces (parks, squares, streets, pedestrian crossings and other public transport routes, etc. ), in accordance with the law.\u2019 126 Article 1(4) of the Law on the Protection of Consumer Rights does not cover goods and services which are publicly offered by natural persons outside commercial activities, for example, if a natural person publicly advertises the sale of his/her own apartment. This is because the Law on Protection of Consumer Rights only applies to transactions provided within the scope of commercial activities (see national report, 2016). ",
        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 I - 13 3.1 Media and Advertising Gender discrimination in the field of media and advertising is regulated in Belgium , Croatia , France , Ireland , Latvia , Lithuania, Luxembourg , Malta, and the United Kingdom (UK) . However, there are Member States, such as Bulgaria , where gender- biased or even directly sexist content in advertising is rather frequent. Good Practice In France the material scope of national law is broader as the exceptions have not been strictly implemented. National law does not exclude, as the Directive does, the non- discrimination principle for the content of media and advertising. Lithuanian legislation specifically prohibits humiliating advertisements and the encouragement of public attitudes that one sex is superior to the other. 3.2 Education When the Directive entered into force it was noted that the absence of education from its scope was particularly unfortunate, as it was likely to have a negative impact on the overall EU gender equality structure. 127 Education is in fact a key element in pursuing gender equality in many areas, but it particularly affects employment - and thus pensions. 128 In the UK at the time, it was noted that male and female choices of study were influenced by stereotyped patterns. 129 With that said, many countries regulate gender discrimination in education ( Belgium , Croatia , France , Hungary , Latvia , 130 Lithuania , Malta , the Netherlands , Slovakia , Sweden , Norway and the UK (although the latter permits single-sex schools)). Good Practice In Norway , section 16 of the Gender Equality Act 1978 states that all teaching materials in schools and education shall emphasise gender equality and non-discrimination based on gender. 127 See also K.

        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 I - 14 II \u2013 Implementation of Substantive Provisions 1) Equal Treatment 1.1 Sex Discrimination and Gender Reassignment As already mentioned in this paper, the scope of the principle of equal treatment and non-discrimination also applies to discrimination arising from a person's gender reassignment. At the time of writing this paper, only five Member States have explicitly incorporated gender reassignment as a specific ground of discrimination into their national legislation ( Belgium, Czech Republic, Sweden, Slovakia and the UK ). Of those, Belgium, Sweden and the UK make reference to the changing of or intention to change one's sex, while the Czech Republic and Slovakia make reference to sexual identification. Additionally, Ireland, Malta, Montenegro and Portugal prohibit discrimination on grounds of gender reassignment in employment. 131 While the remaining Member States have not expressly incorporated discrimination on grounds of gender reassignment into their national legislation, most claim that protection against this discrimination is or could be covered under national laws which prohibit discrimination on grounds of sex or gender. For example, Bulgarian legislation states that discrimination on the ground of sex encompasses cases of gender reassignment. The courts in Cyprus have come to the same conclusion, as did both the courts and the Institute for Human Rights in the Netherlands . The position has also been clarified by the High Authority (now Defender of Rights) in France and the Equality Tribunal in Ireland in the field of employment. Lack of case law in other Member States, however, does present a challenge in assessing the accuracy of those claims. 132 Conversely, discrimination arising from gender reassignment is not protected in Germany . 133 The equality bodies report that issues regarding the access of transsexual persons to services have emerged in relation to financial and health services. This is the case in France , where the change in civil status of transsexual persons has not been taken into account by bank services, and in Poland where the State is not financially covering access to healthcare in the transition from one sex to another. This is in contrast to Serbia, which extends compulsory health insurance to gender reassignment for medical reasons when the insured person can cover at most 65% of the cost of the health service. 134 131 Malta explicitly prohibits discriminatory treatment based on gender reassignment on grounds of sex, while Montenegro extends the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of gender reassignment also to self-employment and the exercise of rights to social care and other benefits. 132 Of those States which consider that discrimination based on gender reassignment could fall within the scope of the broader prohibition on sex or gender discrimination, the following reported a lack of case law: Denmark, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania, Slovenia and Spain . 133 Note that the Federal German Constitution Court in its decision of 6 December 2005; 1 BvL 3/03, considered both sexual identity and sexual orientation as being part of each individuals' autonomous personality. This has the effect of either encompassing discrimination based on gender reassignment within sexual identity, or of removing sexual identity from the principle of gender equality (on the basis that it is considered under personal autonomy instead). 134 See the Serbian legal expert's 2015 national report. Available at ",
        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 I - 15 At the time of writing this paper there is no case law of the CJEU concerning gender identity. Some Member States have, however, incorporated provisions into national legislation which include gender identity as a ground of discrimination. This sets a lower threshold for considering behaviour to be of a discriminatory nature, which may or may not include discrimination based on gender reassignment. The legal experts for Finland and Hungary both highlighted the application of gender identity to gender reassignment in their national reports. The Finnish expert proposed that gender reassignment involves gender identity; therefore gender reassignment is protected under that provision. On a similar vein, the interpretation of national legislation as stated by the Hungarian expert is that protection against discrimination based on gender identity is ensured, regardless of whether gender reassignment has taken place. 1.2 Sexual Harassment Article 4(3) of Directive 2004/113/EC clarifies that harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of the Directive constitute discrimination on grounds of sex and are therefore prohibited. 135 The 2015 Commission Report states that no specific difficulties in implementing Article 4(3) in the area of equal access to goods and services have been mentioned. However, the national reports of the legal experts of Cyprus, Germany, Iceland, Montenegro and Slovenia indicate that the prohibition of sexual harassment in these countries has not been implemented outside the field of employment and vocational training. This raises concerns as the prohibition of sexual harassment in the access to and supply of goods and services is as important to achieving gender equality as is its prohibition in the work environment. While legal implementation of Article 4(3) may have otherwise occurred without seemingly too much difficulty, the prohibition of sexual harassment in practice has proven challenging in certain sectors. This is especially so in relation to public transport services across large European cities, where sexual harassment occurs on an alarming scale on trains. A 2015 survey undertaken by France's High Council for Equality between Women and Men (HCEfh) found that 100 percent of the 600 women surveyed had experienced at least some form of gender-based sexual harassment while riding on the train. 136 A similar survey conducted by Transport for London in the UK found that 15 percent of Londoner's had experienced unwanted sexual behaviour on the railway transport http://www.equalitylaw.eu/downloads/3801-serbia-country-report-gender-pdf-1-11-mb 135 The definition of sexual harassment, as per Article 2(d) is: where any form of unwanted physical, verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature occurs, with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. 136 Haut Conseil \u00e0 l' \u00c9 galit\u00e9 entre les Femmes et les Hommes (HCEfh), \"Avis sur le harc\u00e8lement sexiste et les violences sexuelles dans les transports en commun\" (Report on gender harassment and sexual assault in mass transit), 16 April 2015).

        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 I - 16 network. 137 Due to the context of public trains, such as overcrowding on one hand and isolation on the other, it is difficult to control and prevent sexual harassment, despite national legislation providing for its prohibition. One issue which has arisen is that of liability. Often, neither the perpetrator nor the victim of sexual harassment is the provider of the service, yet the sexual harassment has arisen in the supply of that service. Questions have therefore arisen concerning the liability of the service provider for third party harassment. National legislation may or may not hold an employer liable for harassment or discrimination committed by a third party against an employee. For example, Germany requires employers to take suitable, necessary and appropriate measures to protect the employee in the event of third party discrimination, while Ireland holds the employer liable for third party sexual harassment unless the employer took reasonable steps to prevent the harassment. 138 Conversely, the UK repealed liability for third party harassment in 2013 as it was considered that EU law did not require such liability and that it constituted unnecessary regulation. 139 The repeal was enforced, despite a government-led consultation revealing opinions from trade unions in the transport sector that third party harassment provisions were undoubtedly of great assistance in protecting the health and wellbeing of employees. 140 Liability of employers for third party harassment against their employees is therefore clearly a matter for each Member State to determine. It is also for each Member State to determine when and to what extent liability for third party harassment may apply outside the employment relationship. 141 However, in the absence of a strong employment-like relationship or a relationship of control and subordination, permitting such liability would likely impose too great a burden on the service provider. This is so in the context of public transportation, where the service provider has very little control over those who use the service. This may similarly apply to situations involving the collaborative economy (to be discussed below).

        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 I - 17 to note, however, that many Member States hold perpetrators criminally liable for sexual harassment under national law, in addition to civil liability for sexual discrimination. 142 Victims may therefore be assured that sexual harassment does not go unpunished. 143 Some Member States have instead taken initiatives aimed at raising awareness and preventing incidences of sexual harassment in public transportation services. For example, the UK's Project Guardian aimed to reduce sexual assault and unwanted sexual behaviours on public transport in London. In addition, Transport for London launched a sexual harassment campaign in 2015 which aimed to increase reporting of unwanted sexual behaviours on public transport. 144 Similarly, France launched its awareness-raising campaign \"Stop - \u00e7a suffit\" in July 2015; a 12-point action plan designed to tackle sexual harassment on public transport. 145 Finland takes a different and more 'pro-active' approach by permitting police to issue on-the-spot fines to perpetrators of sexual harassment. 1.3 Pregnancy and Maternity Article 4(2) expressly states that \u2018\u2018this Directive shall be without prejudice to more favourable provisions concerning the protection of women as regards pregnancy and maternity\u2019\u2019. 146 The 2015 Commission Report seems to indicate that \u201c[n]o specific difficulty in implementing (it) has been signalled\u201d. 147 However, national legislation in some Member States does not make any reference to or include specific definitions of pregnancy and maternity as a form of gender discrimination in this field ( Lithuania, 148 Serbia and Portugal 149 ). In these Member States it appears that, for the purpose of pregnancy and maternity, national legislation relies on the general prohibition of sex discrimination in other legislative instruments. According to the Portuguese expert, this approach does not go far enough and legislation implementing the Directive should have addressed pregnancy 142 For example, Austria , Belgium and Finland and France make sexual harassment a criminal offence, as does Romania where sexual harassment occurs in relation to employment. 143 Note, however, that divergent interpretations of sexual harassment may mean that the behaviour is not prohibited in any given Member State. For example, Austria interprets sexual harassment as referring to sexual 'acts' without making reference to the effect that the behaviour has on the individual. This has resulted in police interpreting sexual harassment narrowly, so that it does not include, for example, an unwanted kiss. 144 See the campaign's website, available at http://www.btp.police.uk/advice_and_information/how_we_tackle_crime/report_it_to_stop_it.aspx 145 This was in response to a report on gender harassment and sexual assault in public transportation, issued by the High Council for Gender Equality in April 2015. The 12-point action plan is available at http://www.familles-enfance-droitsdesfemmes.gouv.fr/harcelement- transports/le-plan-national/ . 146 This provision reproduces the cryptic formula used by the amended Equal Treatment Directive in the field of employment. Regrettably, this clause perpetuates the idea that pregnancy and maternity are exceptions rather than integral to the concept of equality; see further A. Masselot , \u201cThe New Equal Treatment Directive: plus \u00e7a change \u2026\u201d 147 At p. 5. 148 Equal Opportunities Act for Women and Men. 149 Law n. 14/2008. ",
        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 I - 18 and maternity more clearly. Portuguese domestic law expressly prohibits any request for information from a woman requiring access to goods and services concerning her possible state of pregnancy, except for reasons related to the protection of her own health. The lack of a specific provision relating to pregnancy and maternity may create the wrong impression that these women are only discriminated against when treated differently in the areas specifically covered by law, namely access to information regarding pregnancy and clauses in insurance and financial contracts. 150 According to the Serbian national expert, this makes discrimination \u201cless visible and more difficult to tackle.\u201d The 2015 Commission Report rightly points out that there seems to be rather widespread practical problems concerning restrictions to breastfeeding on the premises of service providers or to access those services with a baby carriage. In Poland cases have been reported where women who were breastfeeding in public have been asked to leave the premises (e.g. shopping centres and restaurants). In Ireland the Equality Tribunal ruled that the insistence by a theatre that a mother breastfeeding a two year old child must pay for a second ticket was not discriminatory because the mother and child were not one and the same. 151 Perhaps because these issues are not perceived, strictly speaking, as legal, there is very little case law in this area. An exception is the case of Hungary , where moving around with a pram seems to be a challenge for parents, especially in the countryside. Here, there have been numerous cases where claimants have faced discrimination when trying to use services with small children sitting in a pram. In one case a mother initiated a procedure against a public transportation bus company which regularly caused hardship for her when she travelled with her child who used a pram. 152 In another case, the pharmacist requested the parents leave the pram outside the pharmacy, referring to non-existent hygienic regulations when asked about the reason for requesting so. 153 In both cases, the Equal Treatment Authority concluded that the parents suffered direct discrimination because of their motherhood/parenthood. The violators were accordingly issued with a fine. Good Practice In many Member States, clinical tests related to pregnancy are exempted from payment ( Italy , the UK ). Furthermore, in Italy , to have children is regarded as a preferential ground for gaining access to housing. In the UK , the Equality Act 2010 has made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place, such as a cafe, shop or public transport. 150 National report available at http://www.equalitylaw.eu/downloads/3779-2015-pt-country- report-gender. 151 Stevens v The Helix Theatre DEC \u2013 S2008 \u2013 033. 152 EBH/161/2014. http://egyenlobanasmod.hu/article/view/161_2014.

        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 I - 19 Overall, as was highlighted by a 2012 European Network Report, 154 it appears that there is very little discussion (and thus very little referral) regarding the relationship between Directive 2004/113/EC and pregnancy and maternity. In some Member States ( the Netherlands ), discrimination in relation to pregnancy and maternity in the goods and services context takes place mainly in the access to health services attached to insurance contracts. This is due to the widespread practice of establishing an initial period during which the contract has no effect; where this period may cover the duration of a woman's pregnancy. 155 Discrimination relating to pregnancy and maternity also extends to other relevant areas. In Poland , for example, there have been cases of refusals to rent flats to pregnant women. No such cases could be identified as having been brought to court. The 2012 European Network Report also highlights that a common complaint relates to a standard airline practice which imposes conditions on pregnant women travelling. Generally, pregnant women may fly after attaining 28 weeks of pregnancy only if they are in possession of a medical certificate stating that they are \u201cfit to fly\u201d. After a few more weeks there is a total ban. It was pointed out that the number of \u201cqualifying\u201d weeks varied depending on the airline policy, and thus also varies between Member States. Such a practice is often justified by an airline on grounds of health and safety, although there appears to be no clear research backing these policies. It would rather appear that airlines are merely trying to avoid the inconvenience of an accidental delivery while mid- air. In 2012 the practice was reported by all the experts, while the 2015 European Network National Reports do not contain a specific question on that issue. Its legality is, however, questionable under the Directive, although there has been no legal challenge to date. 2) Sectorial Implementation This section focuses on specific sectors with a view to exploring whether Directive 2004/113/EC may have an impact. 2.1 Sexual and Reproductive Health Services As mentioned above, recital 11 of the Directive defines services in accordance with former Article 50 TEC. This means that it would be permissible to rely on earlier case law on the free movement of services in order to determine those categories of health services which may fall within the scope of the Directive. 156 Indeed, the European Commission 154 A. Masselot , E. Caracciolo di Torella , S. Burri , Fighting Discrimination on the Grounds of Pregnancy, Maternity and Parenthood, European Commission 2012 and European Network of Legal Experts in the Field of Gender Equality (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender- equality/files/your_rights/discrimination__pregnancy_maternity_parenthood_final_en.pdf) 155 This was also highlighted by the national experts in the 2009 Report. 156 There are examples of case law relating to health-care services, such as that on patient mobility where you cannot receive the same treatment in your own Member State within a reasonable time (e.g. C-372/04, Y. Watts v. Bedford Primary Care Trust, Secretary of State for Health [2006] ECR I-325). ",
        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 I - 20 has recently confirmed that health services in general fall within its scope; 157 a position which is also reported by the majority of equality bodies. 158 Does the notion of health, however, also extend to sexual and reproductive health, which is a prominent aspect of public health? Sexual and reproductive health: \u201cimplies that people are able to have a satisfying and a safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. It also includes sexual health, the purpose of which is the enhancement of life and personal relationships, and not merely counselling and care related to reproductive and sexually transmitted diseases.\u201d 159 Implicit in this interpretation are the rights of men and women to be informed and to have access to safe, effective, affordable, and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice, as well as the right to appropriate health-care services that enable women to safely go through pregnancy and childbirth. Abortion and alternative reproductive technologies (ART) such as IVF and surrogacy are, arguably, included within the definition of sexual and reproductive health. In fact, by definition, sexual and reproductive health includes the capability and right to reproduce; the inverse being the right not to reproduce. Although in theory feasible, the application of Directive 2004/113/EC to sexual and reproductive health is somewhat complex. For instance, could it apply in cases where sexual and reproductive health services are refused to either sex? It is first crucial to identify whether abortion and ART can be identified as services. According to Article 3(1), the scope of the Directive includes the proviso \"[w]ithin the limits of the powers conferred upon the Community...\" This is based upon similar wording in Article 19 TFEU, the meaning of which has always been ambiguous. The recent Opinion of Advocate General Kokott in C 160 provided a discussion of the outer limits of Article 19 TFEU, where it was stated that EU law cannot extend outside the competences conferred to it by the Member States. While that case raised the issue of taxation and is therefore not directly applicable, it provides guidance that could be relevant in determining what may fall inside or outside the scope of the Directive. 157 2015 Commission Report, at p. 3. However, see the Preamble of the Directive where at Recital 12 it states that \u201cdifferences between men and women in the provision of healthcare services, which result from the physical differences between men and women, do not relate to comparable situations and therefore, do not constitute discrimination.\u201d 158 European Network of Equality Bodies (Equinet) , Equality Bodies and the Gender Goods and Services Directive , November 2014 (http://www.equineteurope.org/Equality-Bodies-and-the- Gender). 159 4th International Conference on Population Development in Cairo 1994, paragraph 7.2. 160 Case C-122/15 C [2016], Opinion delivered 28 January 2016. ",
        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 I - 21 In response to a motion on sexual and reproductive health and rights, 161 the European Parliament in 2013 passed a resolution confirming that the formulation and implementation of policies on sexual and reproductive health rights remain within the competence of the Member States. 162 It is therefore arguable that the Directive only applies in the field of sexual and reproductive health to the extent that the service provider complies with the national legislation; which may or may not discriminate on grounds of sex. So narrow an interpretation would, however, render the Directive nugatory in the entire field of sexual and reproductive health services. Furthermore, the CJEU has consistently held that even where the matter falls within the competence of the Member States, in situations covered by EU law the national rules concerned must have due regard to EU law. 163 As Directive 2004/113/EC is applicable to all goods and services provided against remuneration, 164 it is therefore unlikely that such a narrow interpretation would be adopted by the CJEU. In any event, the positions of each Member State towards sexual and reproductive health indicate a very diverse approach; 165 the regulation of which would ensure that the principle of gender equality is taken into consideration. Turning to case law, the case of Grogan 166 indicates that abortion, when performed in accordance with the laws of the Member States, can be a service for the purpose of free movement. Patient mobility case law indicates that remuneration can arise indirectly, such as where an individual pays for an operation in another Member State, even though the individual would not have had to pay directly for it in their home country. 167 This is consistent with the interpretation proposed by the majority of equality bodies, which consider that a definition of services which only covers those services provided for remuneration leaves too much space for potential discriminatory behaviours. 168 Rather, the equality bodies propose that a definition of goods and services ought to cover all health-care related goods and services, including those services funded publicly as well as by direct transfer from the patient. This would have the effect of pushing those sexual 161 Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, Motion for a European Parliament Resolution on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (2013/2040(INI)), 03 December 2013. 162 European Parliament resolution of 10 December 2013 on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (2013/2040(INI)) http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=- //EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2013-0548+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN 163 See, for example, Case C-135/08 Janko Rottmann v Freistaat Bayern [2010] ECR I-1486, at para 41. 164 2015 Commission Report, at p. 3. 165 The Family Federation of Finland - Global Development Unit, EU Member States' Positions on Sexual and Reproductive Rights Issues (02 April 2012), http://vaestoliitto-fi- bin.directo.fi/@Bin/ccdce814fb123c90796a8732df14afc5/1467024614/application/pdf/1740298/EU %20Country%20Positions%20on%20Sexual%20and%20Reproductive%20Rights%20Issues.pdf Accessed 28 June 2016. 166 Case C-159/90, Society for the Protection of Unborn Children Ltd (SPUC) v Grogan [1991] ECR I- 4685. 167 See for example case C-372/04, Y.

Moreover, the Directive specifically excludes education and media. Sexual and reproductive health services whose core service is education would therefore fall outside the scope of the Directive, as would advertisements relating to sexual health. This may raise issues concerning the access to which persons of either sex may receive sexual health information, and possible discrimination based on sex in the supply of that information. Should sexual and reproductive health fall within the definition of a service, a further issue is then raised in relation to who the service provider is discriminating against. It is questionable whether to deny a woman a reproductive health service would amount to less favourable treatment or direct discrimination, as the service is often only available to women (e.g. abortion, emergency contraception, IVF, cervical cancer or sterilisation). 170 It is at least arguable that this could amount to direct discrimination, even where no comparator is necessary, as this situation will only apply to one sex, thereby seemingly discriminating one as against the other. 171 However, there is also the possibility that the CJEU would not choose this path and that it would not wish to enter into these issues unless there was a clear difference in treatment between women and men. Moreover, recital 16 appears to allow for justifications of differences in treatment, while there is also Article 4(5) to be considered. In instances where one woman is refused the service while another woman in the same position is not, the difference in treatment may not necessarily relate so much to her sex than to other various factors. These could be factors relating to the service provider or to other internal or external factors relating to the individual seeking the service. Where the difference in treatment relates to the individual, a comparator would be the woman who the service was not refused - in which case their common feature is their female sex. Factors influencing the different treatment in that case may relate to health or religious belief rather than sex. In that context the less favourable treatment would not constitute discrimination based on sex and would therefore not fall within the scope of the Directive. It is important to note that the Directive prohibits discrimination between men and women , not between two women or two men. The individual would still have 169 For example, in Norway all women have access to an abortion free of charge, while in Sweden the National Health Insurance covers almost all the cost. Belgium reimburses the full cost of abortion where it is performed by an abortion clinic that has signed an agreement with the national institute for social security. 170 Similarly, sexual and reproductive health services may only apply to men on the basis of their sex, such as male infertility screening, testicular and prostate cancer, and vasectomy. 171 See the CJEU case law on discrimination on ground of pregnancy and maternity, Case C-177/88 Dekker ECR I-3941 , Case C-32/93 Webb v EMO Air Cargo (UK) Ltd [1994] ECR I-03567 and Case C- 207/98 Mahlburg v Land Mecklenburg-Vorpommen [2000] ECR I-00549 .

Thus, the question of whether the Directive can apply does not have a prima facie straightforward answer. Discrimination on the grounds of gender could perhaps be more successfully pursued in cases involving transsexual persons. A further possibility would be to invoke discrimination either on the basis of religion (but in this case this specific Directive would not apply) or on the ground of disability if a woman chooses IVF because she has medical difficulties in conceiving a child. 172 2.2 Insurance, Financial Services and Private Pensions Prior to the Test-Achats decision Article 5(2) of the Directive permitted, for the purposes of insurance and related financial services, differences in individuals' premiums and benefits where sex was used as a determining factor in the assessment of risk. Following the CJEU's decision, no derogations to Article 5(1) are permitted, thereby ensuring that individual's premiums and benefits are the same (the \"unisex rule\"). At the time of writing, all 28 Member States have amended their legislation to comply with the CJEU decision. 173 Germany exhibits a clear case of levelling down, having increased insurance rates for both sexes after 21 December 2012 to the disadvantage of both men and women. In Finland , the use of sex-based actuarial factors is only prohibited in policies sold to consumers and is still allowed in insurance schemes sold to employers, while Luxembourg removed sex as a differentiator in all new insurance contracts. The 2015 Commission Report does note, however, that questions have been raised regarding the extent to which some national legislation complies with the ruling, on which basis infringement proceedings for non-conformity could commence. Estonia currently permits insurance companies to use actuarial factors based on sex in the assessment of insured risks in sickness insurance, and to differentiate the insurance premiums between men and women based on those risks. Similarly, Hungary permits deviations from the unisex rule for group life, accident and sickness insurances, and where the insurance is regulated by the Act on Insurance Institutions and Insurance Business. Otherwise, the impact on the market appears to have been minimal and in any event it does not appear to have created any unjustified pricing. The case law of the CJEU is not directly applicable to Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, as members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Thus, a procedure for the possible adaptation of Annex XVIII of the EEA Agreement to the Test-Achats ruling was initiated on 30 January 2014 in order to ensure the coherence of legislation. 172 But see case C-363/12 Z v Government Department (2014). Here the CJEC opted for the very narrow definition of disability provided in the case C-335/11 Ring and Skouboe Werge . 173 Luxembourg was the final Member State to adopt the ruling by the Law of 12 April 2015, despite the implementation process commencing in 2012.

        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 I - 24 There seems to have been little legislative difficulty implementing Article 5(1) of the Directive, which also applies to private pensions; pensions which are related neither to employment nor to the statutory social security system, such as where a person takes out a pension policy with a financial services company. However, even if the Directive requires that equality is achieved when calculating the amount of annuity, this would only be one part of the solution. The real question that remains is why women have less money to invest in a pension policy? Directive 2004/113/EC simply does not address the causes for why women receive lower annuities or lower pension incomes. It fails to consider the problems that women face in the employment market, which are then reflected into their ability to access insurance and related financial services including private pensions. Instead, it requires a private service, namely the insurance industry, to provide a solution that can be artificial. If at best, this offers a sticky plaster; at worst, it introduces the dangerous precedent of justifying discrimination that has occurred for years. Thus a better alternative could come from focusing on the causes that may explain the lower annuities and pensions available to women. Women in fact have less retirement income to buy annuities. The reasons behind such a gap range from fewer years in employment and shorter working hours, therefore resulting in lower pay, to less access to occupational pension schemes and to an historical legacy of past pension scheme rules. In other words, the uneasy link between pension schemes, annuities and gender equality is shaped mainly by two elements: the inconsistent position of women in the employment market and the fact that this is still hindered by their involvement in (unpaid) caring work. Both these issues should be addressed by the traditional Equality Directives, namely Equal Pay and Equal Treatment before becoming a problem for the insurance industry. By requiring the insurance industry to adopt the principle of gender equality, exploration of the causes of inequality will be avoided, if not artificially hindered. The uneven coordination amongst the Directives highlights the lack of coherency in the overall gender equality framework. Of particular concern and interest regarding the pension gap, are the proposals by certain Member States ( Hungary , Germany , Poland ) to count those years that women are out of the employment market because of maternity leave (not only time officially allowed by law, but also additional years where women decide to stay at home and raise their children) as a part of the working experience required to receive a pension. While seemingly beneficial to women, such proposals would risk encouraging women to remain out of the employment market for a longer period of time. 174 Furthermore, 174 The CJEU, albeit indirectly, has already addressed this situation. In the case of Griesmar , the Court held that \u201cthe situation of a male civil servant and a female civil servant may be comparable as regards the bringing up of children.\u201d As a result of this case, the national legislation was amended to take into consideration periods of leave (such as maternity and paternity leave) for the purpose of calculating a retirement pension: however, as maternity leave is compulsory, this de facto gave an advantage to women. Case C-366/99, Griesmar , [2001] ECR I-9383. The outcome was recently challenged in the Leone case. Mr Leone, the father of three children, applied for early retirement with immediate payment of his pension tax credit and was unsuccessful. He argued that the provision discriminated against men. The Court held that, in order to benefit from such ",
        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 I - 25 although benefitting women as far as their pension-entitlements are concerned, discrimination may arise in other subtle ways: inter alia employers may be unwilling to hire them and the pay gap would increase. Therefore, de facto these proposals would encourage and protect women out of the employment market. It is, however, at least open to debate whether such proposals could be interpreted as preferential treatment of women, which may therefore be prohibited under the Directive. An alternative is to take into account the years that either parent is absent from employment to raise children (outside the periods expressly allowed by national legislation) in order to determine pension entitlements. Provided that this is gender neutral and women are not disadvantaged, it would not be a negative option. 2.3 Occupational Pensions Recital 15 of the Directive states that it \u201c should 175 apply only to insurance and pensions which are private, voluntary and separate from the employment relationship\u201d. Statutory and occupational pensions are traditionally dealt with under other legislative instruments, such as Council Directive 79/7/EEC 176 and Council Directive 86/378/EEC. 177 With that said, the 2015 Commission Report states that despite the fact that the Test- Achats ruling has no legal implications for occupational pensions, some Member States ( Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Denmark, Latvia and Sweden ) have applied it to occupational pension schemes to prohibit the use of gender in determining, for example, contribution rates, benefits and transfer values. 178 It is encouraging to see this progression in gender equality also underpinned by the CJEU in two instances that the use of sex- based actuarial factors in occupational pension schemes is permitted. 179 It follows thus, provision, the worker needs to demonstrate an investment in bringing up children and a detrimental impact on his/her carer; mere involvement in their conception is not sufficient in this respect. The decision in Leone will be controversial; indeed, it might have the consequence of removing maternity leave from the list of the qualifying periods of leave. However, it can also be regarded as a step towards equalising the position of men and women when it comes to parenthood.

This has now been repealed and incorporated in the Recast Directive. 178 Country reports of the legal experts indicate that many other Member States do not permit the use of sex-based actuarial factors in occupational pension schemes.

It involves three key actors: (i) the service providers , (ii) the users and (iii) the intermediaries that connect providers with users ('collaborative platforms'). Often provided and used by private individuals, it essentially involves borrowing or using assets owned by someone else. These assets can include vehicles, tools, food, a ride from A to B, short-term home swaps or renting in someone's private home. Two examples of collaborative platforms are Airbnb and Uber. Established in 2008, Airbnb is a global network that connects travellers with hosts who provide short-term accommodation in their private homes for a fee. For many travellers, it has become the first port of call when planning a holiday. In a similar fashion Uber connects riders with drivers, effectively wooing clientele who would otherwise catch a taxi. The company started out in San Francisco in 2009 but has since expanded to more than 320 cities around the world. The collaborative economy has the potential to offer significant benefits and opportunities for entrepreneurs, businesses and consumers alike. Driven by innovation, it enables entrepreneurs and businesses to offer new and extensive services, opening flexible employment opportunities and generating new sources of income. Consumers in turn benefit from new services, an extensive supply of existing services and, consequently, lower prices. With growth from collaborative platforms already occurring at a rapid rate across key economic sectors, the EU must be ready to embrace this model. While offering significant benefits, the collaborative economy has raised issues regarding the application of existing legal frameworks and the patchwork nature of regulations across the EU. As a result, the European Commission recently produced a Communication 180 where it addressed many of these issues, such as the type of market regulation that can be imposed, liability, consumer protection, and the relationship with employment law and tax regimes. One issue yet to be examined is whether and how gender equality could apply in this context. Uncertainty regarding the applicability and effect of Directive 2004/113 in this context has, however, been highlighted; 181 therefore a preliminary examination of how it may apply in this context is required. This section aims to provide that examination. It suggests, however, that the European Commission 180 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, A European Agenda for the Collaborative Economy , COM (2016) 356 final. 181 For example, during a conference in 2014 concerning the implementation of Directive 2004/113/EC, Austria raised a question regarding the liability of a service provider for third party harassment which occurs in cases of services provided within the collaborative economy.

One concern relating to the scope of the Directive is whether the service facilitated by the collaborative platform falls within the definition of \"service\". The Directive defines services as those within the meaning of Article 57 TFEU (previously Article 50 TEC), namely those normally provided for remuneration. Consistent with case law of the CJEU, a service must constitute an economic activity. 182 The difficulty lies in assessing whether services involving cost-sharing, facilitated via collaborative platforms, constitute an economic activity. As the essential characteristic of remuneration is that it constitutes consideration for the service, 183 the question is whether cost-sharing constitutes or amounts to consideration. Taking a broad interpretation, cost-sharing could constitute consideration for a service as the user shares the burden of costs in consideration for the service provided. However, the Communication notes that many Member States consider that pure cost-sharing activities do not involve remuneration and therefore do not constitute economic activities. 184 On this basis, ride-sharing activities facilitated by collaborative platforms such as BlaBlaCar would not fall within the definition of a service and would therefore fall outside the scope of the Directive. The Communication does, however, note that while the transaction between user and provider may not constitute an economic activity, their respective relationship with the collaborative platform may still form an economic activity. 185 Thus, liability for any discrimination or harassment in the provision of the \"service\" may still occur vertically rather than horizontally. Of particular concern is whether the Directive is applicable in any given situation where the collaborative platform has facilitated the supply of a service. As mentioned above, often both users and providers of services within the collaborative economy are private individuals. In their capacity as private individuals, more often than not providers are offering services on an occasional peer-to-peer basis rather than professionally. This means that individuals may offer services which fall close to or within their personal proximity, thus blurring the distinction between services offered in the public and private sphere. The Directive excludes from its scope services which fall within the sphere of private and family life. The Commission has interpreted this to cover situations where the proximity to the personal sphere of the service provider influences their choice rather than economic considerations, such as where the provider sublets a room in his or her private 182 See Case C-281/06 Hans-Dieter Jundt and Hedwig Jundt v Finanzamt Offenburg [2007] ECR I-12231 at para 32. 183 See Case 263/86 Belgian State v Ren\u00e9 Humbel and Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Edel [1988] ECR 1988-05365 at 2. 184 Communication from the Commission COM (2016) 356 final, see its footnote 6. 185 Ibid.

The challenge lies in assessing whether services provided under collaborative platforms such as Airbnb fall within the public or private sphere. As already mentioned, Airbnb connects travellers with hosts who provide short-term accommodation in their private homes. On one hand, the accommodation service would seem to fall outside the scope of the Directive as it arguably falls within the personal sphere of the host, being their private residence. On the other hand, many providers only use the collaborative economy as a means to gain earnings on an occasional basis. 188 In this respect, and in consideration of the fact that the host is receiving remuneration for the service, the host will likely be influenced more by economic considerations than by the proximity of the guest to their personal sphere. This is particularly so where the host leases out their entire house, either to persons travelling for leisure or to those travelling for business; the relationship being more like that between a tenant and landlord. In this context, the Directive would apply to the relationship between the host and the guest, thereby prohibiting discrimination on grounds of sex in both the access to and the supply of the accommodation service. Whether or not Airbnb could be held liable for any discrimination as occurs between the host and guest is questionable. As an example, a housing agent in Belgium was held liable for direct discrimination when the claimant's housing application was rejected on the basis that the landlords intended to reserve the residence for female tenants. 189 Although the relationship between a housing agent and landlord is not directly comparable to that between a collaborative platform and a service provider, the case illustrates that the facilitating platform is not necessarily exempt from liability for the landlord or homeowner's discrimination. As Airbnb provides a Host Guarantee for damage to property in the rare event of guest damage, it could be argued that Airbnb has assumed a relationship with the host which surpasses that of a mere facilitating platform, therefore they could be held liable for the host's discrimination. A recent case of sex discrimination has arisen in the United States where a transgender woman was denied accommodation by an Airbnb host on the basis of her gender; 190 however, no claim for liability against Airbnb has been reported. 186 2015 Commission Report.

        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 I - 29 Should, however, a service facilitated by Airbnb fall within the personal sphere of the host, the Directive would not apply to discrimination which may occur as between the host and the guest. Despite this, Airbnb anti-discrimination policy states that the platform: \"prohibit[s] content that promotes discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group...\" and that all users are required to comply with local laws and regulations. 191 As a result of the above sex discrimination, which was prohibited under United States anti-discrimination laws, Airbnb banned the host from using its services. Similarly, anti-discrimination laws of individual EU Member States would apply in this context, as would general obligations regarding non- discrimination under EU Treaties. Collaborative platforms, as providers of information society intermediary services, are exempt from liability for the information that they store under EU law. 192 Whether or not and to what extent collaborative platforms are liable under contractual and extra- contractual laws is to be determined by each Member State. This includes laws relating to vicarious liability and third-party harassment. In general, employers may often be held vicariously liable for the actions of their employees. 193 The circumstances under which an employer may be held liable inevitably varies across Member States, although common provisions require that the act is committed during the course of the employment and provide exceptions for where the employer took reasonable steps to prevent the employee from committing the act. 194 The UK has taken a broad interpretation of \"course of the employment\", which rests upon the existence of a \"sufficient connection\" between the position in which the employee is employed and the employee's discriminatory conduct. 195 Taking a narrower perspective, Denmark considers that as harassment is not part of an employee's position, the employer will not be held vicariously liable for an employee's harassment unless they have neglected to instruct their employees to avoid harassment. 196 Similarly, as discussed earlier in this paper, some Member States hold the employer liable for harassment or discrimination committed by a third party against an employee. Collaborative platforms acting purely as providers of information society intermediary services would not fall within the definition of \"employer\". However, the lines become blurred where the collaborative platform is also the provider of the service or has significant control over the service provider, such as in the case of Uber. In its 191 Airbnb's anti-discrimination policy is available at https://www.airbnb.co.nz/help/article/483/what-is-airbnb-s-anti-discrimination- policy?topic=250 192 Article 14 of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market ('Directive on electronic commerce') OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1-16. 193 This is the case in, for example, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the UK . 194 See, for example, Equality Act 2010 (UK) s109, Employment Equality Acts 1998-2011 (IE) s 15(1) and (3). 195 Mohamud v Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc [2016] UKSC 11. 196 Niels-Erik Hansen , Report on Measures to combat Discrimination: Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC: County Report Denmark , (2007), p. 35.

        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 I - 30 Communication, the Commission noted the increased blurring of lines within the traditional employment structure and set guidelines on determining when a service provider in the collaborative economy becomes a \"worker\"; the essential criteria being (i) the existence of a subordination link, (ii) the nature of the work and (iii) the presence of remuneration. To date the CJEU has not ruled on the relationship between a collaborative platform and a service provider. 197 Nevertheless, the rapid growth of Uber has sparked debate across Europe concerning whether Uber is merely a technology-service or whether it is an employer. 198 As mentioned above, the Directive excludes from its scope employment matters. This would not, however, remove from its scope vicarious liability of an employer for gender discrimination arising from the supply or access to a service, as between a user and a provider. Thus, in the event that Uber is considered an employer, any discrimination faced by a user of the service would be deemed discrimination by Uber. 199 On the other hand, where a driver faces discrimination or harassment from the passenger, Uber could be held liable for the third party harassment, depending upon the applicable national law. As mentioned earlier in this paper, it is for each Member State to determine when and to what extent vicarious liability or third party harassment may apply outside the employment relationship. 200 In the absence of a strong employment-like relationship or a relationship of control and subordination, permitting such liability would likely impose too great a burden on the collaborative platform. This is particularly so where the collaborative platform is merely providing intermediary services, as there is little to no element of control. In any event, in the absence of national law or guidance by the EU it would be for the national courts to determine liability on a case-by-case basis. Because of the uncertainty surrounding this area, it would be advisable for the Commission to look further into the collaborative economy. 197 Spain has however referred a question regarding Uber to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling, where it seeks to clarify the nature of the services provided by Uber. See Case C-434/15 (preliminary ruling not yet issued). 198 For example, the Labour Inspectorate of Catalonia has ruled that there is an employment relationship between Uber and its drivers, while the GMB (Britain's General Union) lodged a claim in the Central London Employment Tribunal in October 2015 where they claim Uber drivers are workers under UK law. 199 For example, where an Uber driver does not cater for mothers with young children, or a passenger is sexually harassed by a driver of the opposite sex, or a transgender person is refused the service on the basis of their gender. 200 Note that with the exception of liability within the teacher-student relationship, Belgium does not permit vicarious liability outside the field of employment.

        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 I - 31 3) Derogations from Equal Treatment The national reports echo the finding of the Commission, in reporting that the derogation(s) in Article 4(5) of the Directive are one of the most problematic areas in the implementation of the Directive. 201 This provision provides that the Directive shall \u201cnot preclude differences in treatment, if the provision of the goods and services exclusively or primarily to members of one sex is justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary\u201d. Problems have arisen concerning both the transposition into national law 202 as well as its interpretation in individual cases. In some Member States, the exceptions have been clearly formulated by domestic legislation. In the UK , the Equality Act (section 3, part 7) allows exceptions in circumstances where personal/healthcare is being provided, where service users will be in a state of undress, or to protect religious freedom. Similarly, in the Netherlands the General Equal Treatment Act permits exceptions to the prohibition of sex-segregated services where the segregation meets the criteria of preferential treatment, is necessary for the protection of women and maternity, or is a case where \u201csex is decisive\u201d. Dutch law determines examples of the latter and these include sanitary facilities, changing and sleeping rooms and saunas (insofar as facilities are equally available for both sexes), beauty and sports contests (insofar as there is a relevant difference in sex), life insurances entered into after 21 December 2012 where the premium depends on the life expectancy of men and women, and the protection from or fight against sexual violence and harassment, and aid for victims of sexual violence and harassment (insofar as it is necessary that the protection, fight or aid is provided for by a person of a specific sex). Under Belgium's Gender Act, certain goods and services may be reserved exclusively or mainly to person's belonging to one sex. These goods and services must be exhaustively listed in ancillary legislation in order for the exception to apply; legislation which, to date, has not been adopted. In the absence of such list, Belgian national courts do not have the power to assess justifications for differences in treatment, as from 21 December 2007. Federate authorities, on the other hand, are not bound by the time restriction and as a result discrepancies have arisen between the federal and national level. For example, a complaint based on gender discrimination made in relation to a fitness facility reserved for women was held by the Court of Appeal in Li\u00e8ge to fall within the notion of 'sport', thereby falling within the jurisdiction of that Court. 203 The Court assessed the proposed justifications for the different treatment as the morphological differences between men and women and the protection of privacy. On this basis, the justifications were held to be valid. Had this case fallen within the Gender Act, the Court would have had no power of 201 Problems were already highlighted in 2008; see S.

Overall, there appears to be a divergent approach among Member States and this creates legal uncertainty. 204 Additionally, in certain cases, Member States take too wide an interpretation of the derogation which de facto leads to a justification of unequal treatment. To date the Commission has opened one infringement proceeding against a Member State where the issue concerned too broad a scope in the national provisions implementing Article 4(5), and maintains dialogue with other Member States concerning the same issue. 205 More specifically, problems seem to repeatedly arise in relation to the question of whether the requirements for a legitimate objective under that provision are fulfilled. In addition, often suppliers of services accused of gender-based differential treatment between men and women (generally in the form of differential pricing) seek to justify the unequal treatment on the basis of Article 4(5), as transposed into domestic law - even where the service is not offered exclusively to members of one sex. This applies, for example, in cases where the goal is to reach a balanced number of members of each sex. Different interpretations seem to exist as to the admissibility of such practices, including within the national equality bodies themselves. This is particularly so in relation to women-only gyms, fitness and beauty clubs. 206 The Equinet report provides concrete examples as to the divergent interpretation. For example, in the case of women-only gyms or women-only spaces in fitness clubs, the Finnish Ombudsman for Equality has justified this sex-segregation on grounds of women\u00b4s potential embarrassment at exercising in the same area as men. The objective has been to promote women\u00b4s opportunities to use fitness facilities while the means (providing a separate space or opening hours, or clubs exclusively for women) have been seen as appropriate and necessary for achieving this objective. This principle can also be used to establish clubs or a separate space exclusively for men. By contrast, the opposite interpretation was reached by the French HALDE (now Defender of Rights), 207 which concluded that a case where a man who had subscribed to, and was regularly attending, a beauty clinic for more than two years, and was suddenly refused on the grounds that only women were then admitted, was an instance of gender discrimination. In Ireland, a male-only Golf club was considered to be non-discriminatory under the Equal Status Act because it fell within exemption provisions in Section 9 of the ESA. It was stated that a club: 204 2015 Commission Report, p. 6. 205 Answer given by Ms Jourov \u00e1 on behalf of the Commission in E-015796/2015: Application of the Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services in legal and practical terms , Parliamentary questions, 03 March 2016.

        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 I - 33 \"shall not be considered to be a discriminating club (\u2026) if its principal purpose is to cater only for the needs of persons of a particular gender [or] it refuses membership to other members\". 208 National practices may also vary considerably with regard to access to restaurants, clubs and hotels, in particular, by offering different prices and conditions to men and women. Some equality bodies interpret as an obvious case of direct discrimination based on sex or gender, the case where women have free access to restaurants and clubs while men must pay an entry fee. However, in Germany the General Equal Treatment Act has allowed this kind of differential treatment if there is no interest in enforcing equal treatment provisions. The rationale is that there is no interest in enforcing equal treatment as the result would be that the privilege (free entry for women) would be abolished, resulting in a situation where nobody would have free entry. Opposing views argue that this is a clear case of discrimination against both men (because they have to pay an entry fee) and women (because they are used as \u201dincentives\u201d to attract more (male) clients). The reservation by a hotel of a \"woman's only\" floor (20 rooms out of 814) was found by the Danish Board of Equal Treatment to be contrary to national non-discrimination laws. The Eastern High Court confirmed the decision of the Danish Board as the prohibition of men\u2019s access to the floor was not based on a legitimate aim, nor was it necessary in order to fulfil terms of privacy and decency or to counter real identified problems in relation to women\u2019s safety. The Finnish Ombudsman for Equality was asked to decide whether short-time discounts that apply for only one day, for example Women\u2019s Day, Mother\u2019s Day, and Father\u2019s Day, are permitted under the Directive, and whether the means chosen are appropriate and necessary for achieving the objective. It held that these discounts can be acceptable, as long as they are of minor monetary value. The same approach has been adopted for temporary discounts, but not for season tickets, offered for example by sports clubs. A further recurrent example is the different pricing for women and men at hairdressers and barbers for identical services. According to the Finnish Ombudsman for Equality, the provision prohibiting discrimination in the access to and supply of goods and services in the Equality Act does not affect the right of barbers and hairdressers to promote their services according to their respective business ideas, professional expertise and chosen tools regardless of sex and gender; as long as pricing is not based on gender. Acceptable pricing principles include the skill level, tools, and time required. In the same vein, the Austrian Ombud for Equal Treatment has published a recommendation on this issue. By contrast, there are cases from Denmark where it is stated that pricing at hairdressers cannot be based on gender. In some Member States ( Serbia , Norway , Italy ) there is no case law available. This may indicate that there is little awareness amongst the stakeholders and therefore cases do not reach the Courts. 208 Equality Authority v.

        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 I - 34 4) Positive Action Article 6 of the Directive states that the principle of equal treatment shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or adopting specific measures to prevent or compensate for disadvantages linked to sex, with a view to ensuring full equality in practice between men and women. More difficult to assess is the extent to which Member States have used Article 6 to introduce positive action to achieve better outcomes for equality between women and men. Most of the Member States have not adopted any positive action measure (e.g. Austria , Belgium ). Indeed, only a few have reported the existence of specific provisions on positive action allowing providers to differentiate between men and women in order to achieve a balance between both sexes in their access to goods and services. For example, in Cyprus Article 6 of Law 18(I)/2008 provides for positive actions in this area. However, to date there are no specific measures stated under the relevant domestic legislation, nor is there case law. In Slovakia , public authorities or legal entities may adopt temporary positive actions to eliminate disadvantages related to reasons of gender or sex, notably, with the aim of ensuring equal opportunities in practice. In the UK , a general positive action provision allows providers to target or tailor the delivery of goods and services at people of a particular sex, if there is evidence of disproportionately low uptake or participation. The situation is similar in Estonia where Article 5(2) of the Gender Equality Act provides the general basis for positive action measures in relation to the access to and supply of goods and services. In Estonia , there have been attempts to establish a Child Maintenance Guarantee Fund by the State, which primarily supports children and women as the majority of single parents are women. Regulations for the Fund have not yet been drafted. Some national courts have already ruled on the application of Article 6 to such differential treatment. For example, in Austria , a lower court held that cheaper tickets to football matches for women constituted positive action within the meaning of the Equal Treatment Act, in order to prevent or eliminate women\u2019s disadvantages. The CJEU has not yet ruled on the notion of positive action outside the specific area of access to employment. 5) Equality Bodies In order to ensure the implementation of the Directive, Article 12 209 requires Member States to designate bodies to ensure \u201cthe promotion, analysis, monitoring and support of 209 Article 12 of the Directive (Bodies for the Promotion of Equal Treatment) states that: 1. Member States shall designate and make the necessary arrangements for a body or bodies for the promotion, analysis, monitoring and support of equal treatment of all persons without discrimination on the grounds of sex. These bodies may form part of agencies charged at national level with the defence of human rights or the safeguard of individuals' rights, or the implementation of the principle of equal treatment. 2. Member States shall ensure that the competencies of the bodies referred to in paragraph 1 include: ",
        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 I - 35 equal treatment of all persons without discrimination on the grounds of sex.\u201d These bodies (Equality Bodies) have three main responsibilities, namely to provide independent assistance to victims of discrimination in pursuing their complaints of discrimination, to conduct independent surveys concerning discrimination, and to publish independent reports and make recommendations on any issue related to such discrimination. Moreover, they must be independent and effective. As recently reiterated by the European Commission in the EU Justice Agenda for 2020 , 210 equality bodies play a key role and their importance cannot be underestimated. They ensure and promote the effective implementation of the gender equality Directives and have a significant potential in assisting victims of discrimination, empowering civil society, supporting good practice by employers and service providers, raising awareness of rights and obligations, and contributing to quality public policy making. In other words, they are essential to ensure the move from \u201cthe law on paper to the law in practice\u201d, 211 and to build and support a culture of rights and equality across the Member States. The 2015 Commission Report states that all Member States have established equality bodies. However, the effectiveness of these bodies may vary. According to Equinet, there are significant differences in terms of competences, structure, operation and financial/human resources. For example, not all of the equality bodies can represent individuals through litigation, nor can all of them bring proceedings in their own name or make interventions in Court proceedings. There are also differences in terms of technical support: indeed most equality bodies do not have in-house experts to deal with very technical questions and have to outsource those issues. In some cases Equinet reported the lack of sufficient resources which were necessary to ensure further work in the area of goods and services. 212 In addition, in the specific field of goods and services, equality bodies face challenges because of both the difficulty in understanding the specific issues at stake, 213 as well as the lack of knowledge amongst the general public regarding the relevant legal provisions. As noted by Equinet, this may often be the result of complex notions of gender discrimination, coupled with the conflict between contract (a) without prejudice to the rights of victims and of associations, organisations or other legal entities referred to in Article 8(3), providing independent assistance to victims of discrimination in pursuing their complaints about discrimination; (b) conducting independent surveys concerning discrimination; (c) publishing independent reports and making recommendations on any issue relating to such discrimination. 210 Communication from the Commission, EU Justice Agenda for 2020 \u2013 Strengthening trust, mobility and growth within the Union , COM (2014) 144 final. 211 European Commission, Report on the application of Council Directive 2004/113/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services COM(2015) 190 final, at 11. 212 European Network of Equality Bodies (Equinet) , Equality Bodies and the Gender Goods and Services Directive , November 2014 (http://www.equineteurope.org/Equality-Bodies-and-the- Gender) 213 See for example the discussion on the derogations and the different way in which these have been discussed.

Lack of knowledge consequently leads to underreporting of incidences of discrimination, as individuals' are not aware that the discrimination they face is prohibited under EU law. Overall, it can be argued that this results in a patchy application of the provisions of the Directive. Considering the pivotal role of these bodies, it would be advisable to monitor their functioning and to develop a body of research in this area. The latest National Reports on gender equality 214 did not require legal experts to discuss the role of the equality bodies; therefore there is little recent material available on their activities in relation to Directive 2004/113/EC. Specifically, a study on the effectiveness of the equality bodies should be produced in the context of a comprehensive report on the implementation of the Directive. Within this context, it should analyse how equality bodies work, how they are perceived at national level, what their understanding is of the provisions in the Directive and how effective they are at communicating and addressing these issues. Such a report would build inter alia on the findings of the 2014 Equinet Report, and would highlight and encourage the sharing of best practices which ultimately would help provide consistency in the application of the Directive across the Member States. 6) Remedies: Compensation Finally, Chapter III of Directive 2004/113/EC addresses the issue of remedies and enforcement. According to Article 14, Member States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements. In particular, they shall provide compensation to victims and such compensation should be \u201ceffective, proportionate and dissuasive\u201d. 215 These provisions are formulated in the same way as in other Equality Directives. 216 However, the first comprehensive report on Directive 2004/113 in 2009 highlighted that: \"A considerable amount of differential treatment on the grounds of sex in the area of services in Sweden has become 'untouchable' because the Equal Opportunities Ombudsman refuses to take action where, as in one case involving differential pricing by hairdressers, the discrimination is seen as trivial. By contrast, Finnish legislation provides for a minimum 3.000 Euro compensation award, though this may be reduced or waived in cases in which the discriminator has made efforts to remedy the discrimination, and/or for reasons including those relating to the discriminator's economic standing.\" 217 214 These are available at http://www.equalitylaw.eu/country 215 See also Article 8 (Defence of Rights) and Recital 27. 216 In particular, Council Directive 2000/43 EC (Race Directive) and 2000/78/EC (Employment Equality Directive). 217 S.

        "Gender Equal Access to Goods and Services Directive 2004/113/EC PE 593.787 I - 37 In 2014, the Equinet report highlighted that seven 218 out of 15 of the equality bodies examined thought that compensation in the area of goods and services was lower than compensation in the area of employment. That report referred to the situation in Denmark , where compensation in cases of discrimination in employment may equate to between 6 and 12 months pay in the event of dismissal and 25.000 DKK if the person has been rejected for a job because of his/her gender. This is compared to compensation where there has been discrimination in the access to or supply of goods and services, where the compensation awarded is never higher than 2.500 DKK. Generally, the reason why compensation awarded in the area of access to and supply of goods and services is so low when compared to those awarded in the area of employment is because the denial of 'entrance into a restaurant' does not have the far-reaching consequences that employment discrimination has. In one instance the French Defender of Rights awarded compensation in a case relating to goods and services. The case related to the refusal of private housing and the tribunal awarded three times the amount of rent as compensation. However, the compensation for discrimination was awarded on the ground of nationality rather than gender. It can thus be questioned whether current sanctions are dissuasive, proportionate and effective. In a similar vein, in Sweden , an Ombudsman decision was challenged before the Court. The case at stake concerned a gym which enforced a ban against headgears for the members of the sport centre. The claimant was a Muslim woman wearing a head cloth/veil. The sport centre argued that the ban was applied because of health and safety reasons. The Court found that it was a case of indirect discrimination as it affected a specific group of people (namely, religious people). The woman received 5 000 SEK in damages (approximately 500 EUR). 219 It is worth noting that there is no discussion on the specific point of compensation in the 2015 national reports 220 and thus more research would be welcome. 218 Ombud for Equal Treatment, Austria; Institute for Equality between Women and Men, Belgium; Board of Equal Treatment, Denmark; Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency, Germany; Equality Authority, Ireland; Equality Ombudsman, Sweden; Equality and Human Rights Commission, UK- Great Britain 219 Case Ref. no T 3169-08. 220 These are available at http://www.equalitylaw.eu/country.

        "European Implementation Assessment PE 593.787 I - 38 3. Remaining challenges and suggestions The various national reports produced since the implementation of Directive 2004/113/EC provide evidence that, over the years, progress in this area has been made. Possibly the most obvious is the fact that, following Article 5 of the Directive and the Test Achats decision, the use of gender can no longer result in differences in insurance premiums. It is also encouraging to see that many Member States have gone further than the wording of the Directive and have included a prohibition on discrimination against gender in their domestic legislation in areas such as media, advertisement and education. However, there are also areas where progress has been lamentably slow. Access to goods (in particular when it comes to pricing, for example paying more for a pink razor) is at times unexplored because it is seen as trivial. Pregnant women continue to face discrimination when trying to access services, ranging from flying to using facilities in restaurants and shops. On occasion, young mothers have been denied the possibility to breastfeed and in many cases they still suffer stereotypes. Overall, the law is in place but in many cases there is little awareness of it. If a disabled individual cannot access a shop because of the lack of wheelchair facilities, they may well be aware that to have such facilities is a right protected by law. However, if a parent finds Key findings \uf0b7 Challenges: o Progress remains slow in some areas; o Issues reported in 2009 were again reported in 2015; o There are very few referrals and consequently there is very little case law; o Discrimination in goods and services is, sometimes, seen as \u201ctrivial\u201d. \uf0b7 Solutions: o To increase awareness of Directive 2004/113 amongst the general public and stakeholders; o To work closer with the equality bodies to disseminate policy work; o To develop a body of research; o To increase the level of compensation for a breach of the Directive; o To better coordinate Directive 2004/113 with other Equality Directives, in particular the Race Directive (2000/43/EC); o The European Commission should consider applying non-discrimination in the access to and supply of goods and services to new emerging areas such as the collaborative economy.

Thus, the first challenge is to raise awareness of the Directive amongst the general public and stakeholders. Only when individuals are aware of their rights will claims be brought before the national tribunal, and eventually they may reach the CJEU. The equality bodies are in the best position to raise awareness and should be further supported at national level. Another way to ensure the effectiveness of the provisions of Directive 2004/113/EC would be to strengthen the compensation for damages caused by non- compliance with its provisions. At the time of writing, compensation in this area remains much lower than compensation for violation of, for example, the Equal Treatment Directive. 221 This falls short of ensuring \u201creal and effective compensation\u201d (Article 8) and, more generally, it sends the message that there is a hierarchy between employment and the access to and supply of goods and services. This message is wrong. In order to gain a better understanding of the areas that need to be addressed, more research on the implementation of Directive 2004/113/EC is needed. The last comprehensive report by the European Network in this area is nearly a decade old. 222 Indeed, reports have since been written, in particular the 2015 National Reports on Gender Equality, but these dedicate only a few pages to Directive 2004/113/EC, which is not enough to get a clear picture. Furthermore, as the Directive is part of the broader concept of gender equality it needs to be better coordinated with the other Equality Directives. 223 The relationship between private/occupational pensions and the Directive exemplifies this point. As discussed in the section on the implementation of the Test Achats decision, it is vital to explore the causes as to why women have less money to invest in annuities. This necessarily involves an understanding of other equality instruments and how these and Directive 2004/113/EC fit into the overall context. 224 It follows from this discussion that it is also necessary to make sure that the principle of gender equality applies to new contexts. Finally, in addition to building a body of research, it is advisable that the European Commission, when legislating in new areas, take gender equality into consideration. In this respect, it is disappointing that the guidance recently produced by the European Commission on the collaborative economy does not include a clear and specific reference to gender equality. 221 Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of Equal Treatment between persons irrespective of racial and ethnic origin OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22-26 222 S.

This is particularly important in view of the fact that situations which were not previously considered might benefit from the application of the Directive. The following questions are to be considered as a starting point to trigger a more thorough analysis of the topic. General : 1. How has Directive 2004/113/EC been implemented in your Member State (has new legislation been adopted to implement elements, or has a \u2018copy-out approach\u2019 been used)?
