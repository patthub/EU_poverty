The Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions have been consulted on the file and have adopted their opinions on 17 October and 5 December 2018, respectively. 6. The European Parliament voted its first reading position on the ERDF/Cohesion Fund Regulation on 27 March 2019. II. STATE OF PLAY 7. Since the ERDF/Cohesion Fund Regulation is a proposal linked to the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), all provisions with budgetary implications or of a horizontal nature have been set aside (in square brackets) for the time being - and thus excluded from the negotiations - pending further progress on the MFF. This mainly concerns Article 3 (Thematic concentration of ERDF support). 8. Inter-institutional negotiations on this file started under Finland's Presidency. 4 technical meetings (14 and 17 October; 21 November; and 5 December) and 1 trilogue (12 December) with the REGI Committee took place, with the following Articles being examined: \u2012 Articles 1 (Subject matter); \u2012 Article 1a (Tasks of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund - EP amendment); \u2012 Article 2 (Specific objectives). ",

The ERDF must pay more specific attention to demographic change as a key challenge and priority area in devising and implementing programmes. In order to ensure coherent, strong and consistent support for solidarity and responsibility-sharing responsibility as well as sharing efforts between Member States in managing migration, the ERDF should provide support to facilitate the long-term cohesion policy could contribute to integration of processes of refugees and migrants under international protection by adopting an approach aimed at protecting the dignity and rights of them, not least in view of the mutually-reinforcing relationship between integration and local economic growth, especially by providing infrastructure support to cities and local authorities involved in implementing integration policies . [Am. 4] Recital (9): In order to support the efforts of Member States and regions in reducing disparities between levels of development and harmonise different situations of EU regions, facing up to social disparities, new challenges and ensuring inclusive societies and a high level of security for their citizens as well as the prevention of marginalisation and radicalisation, while relying on the synergies and complementarities with other Union policies, investments under the ERDF should contribute to security in areas where there is a need to ensure safe , modern, accessible and secure public spaces and critical infrastructure, such as communication, public transport , and energy and universal, high-quality public services which are vital to address regional and social disparities, promote social cohesion and regional development and encourage enterprises and people to stay in their local area . [Am. 5] Recital (10): In addition, investments under the ERDF should contribute to the development of a comprehensive high-speed digital infrastructure network, throughout the Union, including in rural areas where it is a vital contributor to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to promoting clean pollution-free and sustainable multimodal urban mobility with a focus on walking, cycling, public transport and shared mobility. [Am. 6] Recital (10a): Many of the greatest challenges in Europe increasingly affect marginalised Roma communities, who often live in the most disadvantaged micro- regions which lack safe and accessible drinking water, sewage, electricity, and which do not enjoy transportation possibilities, digital connectivity, renewable energy systems or disaster resilience. Therefore, ERDF-CF shall contribute to improving the living conditions of Roma and fulfilling their true potential as EU citizens, and Member States shall safeguard that the benefits of all the five policy objectives of ERDF-CF will reach the Roma as well. [Am. 7] Recital (12): In order to contribute to an appropriate governance, enforcement, cross-border cooperation and spread of best practices and innovations in the field of smart specialization and circular economy improve the overall administrative capacity of the institutions and governance in the Member States , including at the regional and local levels on the principles of multilevel governance, implementing the programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal, it is necessary to enable supporting promote administrative reinforcement measures under all of the of a structural nature in support of all specific objectives. Being based on measurable objectives and notified to citizens and businesses as a means of simplifying and reducing the administrative burden imposed on beneficiaries and managing authorities, it is possible for these measures to strike the right balance between the result-orientation of the policy and the level of checks and controls.

        "14958/19 NTC/AFG/cs 8 ANNEX ECOMP.2 EN 1. In accordance with the policy [no change] [no change] Provisional common understanding 10. Recital (13): In order to encourage and boost cooperation measures, within programmes implemented under the Investment for jobs and growth goal, it is necessary to enhance cooperation measures with partners including those at local and regional level within a given Member State or between different Member States in relation to support provided under all of the specific objectives. Such enhanced cooperation is additional to the cooperation under ETC/Interreg and should in particular support cooperation among structured partnerships with a view to implementing regional strategies as referred to in the Communication from the Commission \u2018Strengthening Innovation in Europe's Regions: Strategies for resilient, inclusive and sustainable growth\u2019 3 . Partners may therefore come from any region in the Union, but may also include cross-border regions and regions which are all covered by European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation, a macro-regional or sea-basin strategy or a combination of the two. [Am. 9] Recital (13a): The future cohesion policy may take adequate consideration of and provide support to the regions of the Union that are most impacted by the consequences of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the Union, in particular those that will, as a result, find themselves situate d on external sea or land borders of the Union; [Am. 10] Recital (14): The objectives of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund should be pursued in the framework of sustainable development, notably the highly importance of tackling climate change in line with the Union's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement, 2030 Agenda of the United Nations and the UN Sustainable Development Goals as well as and the Union's promotion of the aim of preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment as set out in Articles 11 and 191(1) of the TFEU, taking into account the polluter pays principle as well as focusing on poverty, inequality and a just transition to a socially and environmentally sustainable economy in a participatory approach in cooperation with relevant public authorities, economic, and social partners as well as civil society organisations. Reflecting the importance of tackling climate change and loss of biodiversity in order to contribute to the financing of necessary actions to be taken at EU, national and local level to fulfil in line with the Union's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, as well as to ensure integrated disaster prevention support linking resilience and risk prevention, preparation and response, the Funds will contribute to mainstream climate actions and to the achievement of an overall target of 25 % biodiversity protection by targeting 30 % of the EU budget expenditure supporting climate objectives. The Funds must contribute substantially to the achievement of a circular and low-carbon economy in all territories of the Union and fully incorporating the regional dimension. Operations under the ERDF are expected to contribute 30 % to at least 35 % of the overall financial envelope of the ERDF to climate objectives. Operations under the Cohesion Fund are expected to contribute 37% 40 % of the overall financial envelope of the Cohesion Fund to climate objectives. These percentages should be respected throughout the programming period. Therefore, relevant actions will be identified during the preparation and implementation of these funds, and reassessed in the context of the relevant evaluations and review procedures. These actions and the financial allocation reserved for their implementation are to be included in the national Integrated Energy and Climate Plans in accordance with Annex IV of Regulation (EU)2018/xxxx[new CPR] as well as long-term renovation strategy established under the revised Energv Performance of Building Directive (E) 2018/844 to contribute to the achievement of a decarbonised building stock by 2050, and attached to the Programmes. Specific attention should be paid to carbon-intensive areas facing challenges due to decarbonisation commitments, in view of assisting them in pursuing strategies consistent with the Union\u2019s climate commitment and laid down in the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plans and under the ETS Directive 2018/410 and to protect workers also through training and reskilling opportunities. [Am. 11] Recital (24 a): Specific attention should be paid to carbon-intensive areas facing challenges due to decarbonisation commitments, in view of assisting them in pursuing strategies consistent with the Union\u2019s climate commitment under the Paris Agreement that protect workers and affected communities alike. Such areas should benefit from dedicated support to prepare and implement plans for decarbonisation of their economies taking into account the need for targeted vocational training and reskilling opportunities for the workforce.
