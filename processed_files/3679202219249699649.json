        "From the European University institute Research Report Volume 2, No. 2 Florence, Winter 1992/3 Agnelli at EUi EC E c o - M o d e ls F l a w e d? European economic and monetary union is too slow, according to Sena tor Giovanni Agnelli, speaking at the EUI last November. The lengthy timescale proposed by Maastricht cre ated the instability behind the cur rency crisis, said Agnelli, president of FIAT, and die only way to smooth the process of integration is to speed it. Delivering the fifteenth Jean Monnet Lecture entitled \"Le Futur de l'Europe\", he argued \u00fciat monetary disputes are not die only problems unification faces. The end of the cold war, apprehensiveness about German hegemony and die questioned democ racy of European institutions all now obstruct integration. All are surmount able, he added, and should be over come to bring die benefits of a single currency and market. Agnelli continued the theme of die Jean Monnet lectures by overviewing current problems in the perspective of the longer-term project of unifi- (ctd. on page 6) Global Warming forecasting mod els developed for the European Com mission are seriously flawed, recent EUI research suggests. They fail to take account of appropriate economic reactions to proposed policy measures diat limit carbon emissions, according to two recent reports by the Global Wanning Policy Analysis Group. The reports emphasized the need to consider economic, social and po litical responses to potential environ mental change. The group, led by Professor Mark Salmon, is developing an improved model using dynamic game Uieory to incorporate die effects of interconti nental bargaining and of failures to implement agreements. The analysis also takes into account the role of uncertainty and risk, political rigidi\u00fces and learning processes in decision making. The final aim is to produce an analysis showing die costs and ben efits for various regions of die world of proposed greenhouse gas protocols which may help in for\u00fcicoming inter national negotiations.The reports have gone to DG XI of the European Com mission which began funding this interdisciplinary research team a year ago and has now extended its contract for a further two years.

The fact diat family laws in most European countries appeal\" to conflict widi some of die basic pre cepts of Islam adds to these pressures. At an EUI Workshop in Octo ber, Muslim representatives from Eng land and France spoke widi much feel ing of the indignities suffered by Mus lims when die legal systems of die host nation failed to respect the tradi tions and legal principles essential for dieir religion. Yet the issue was not a simple one, as participants at the workshop organ ised by EUI Fellow Michael King discovered. There are fierce contro versies among Muslims themselves over the interpretation of the Koran and S hari'a on matters such as the weaiing of the veil by women and the legal inequalities between men and women in marriage, divorce and in heritance. There are also important differences among die laws and poli cies of different European countries towards Muslims and other minority groups. Britain, for example pursues a policy of multiculturalism within a legal structure, but France operates a policy of integration of all citizens. According to some French speakers at the conference, this is close to an as similation policy. Demands for the application of Is lamic laws within Muslim communi ties in England and France face diffi culties. Many Muslim laws are un popular amongst women and some- (ctd. on page 5) ",
        "EUI Research Report Winter 1992/3 Editorial At the European University Institute, researchers in the de partments of History and Civili zation, Economics, Law, and Po- liucal and Social Sciences conduct applied and basic research into is sues with deep relevance to Euro peans. By publicizing the findings of EUI conferences and studies, Research Report hopes to pro mote die exchange of ideas - not only amongst academics, but also between academics, private organ izations and policy makers.

In die late 1980s, unskilled service jobs occu pied no more than 15 percent (the highest figure, in Sweden) of the ac tive labour force. This is one reason, says EUI research, that service work ers will not become a political force. Comparative figures from Western countries (mainly USA, UK, Ger many, and Scandinavian countries) show diat occupational structures are being upgraded. For this reason, ac cording to a recent study by the EUI's Professor Esping-Andersen, \"The spec\u00fce of a mass post- industrial serv ice proletariat seems unwarranted\". Not only is the unskilled service class small numerically. Its cohesion, crucial for c lass-based politics, is also low. This is so despite grievances - being underpri vileged and poorly paid - because workers are scattered in different work places, unable to com municate and coordinate. Few of diese workers, moreover, expect to stay in lowly jobs forever. They hope to move on, so they are not interested in class polit\u00edcs. Although chances of promotion vary (and edu cation makes the real difference eve rywhere), nobody plans to keep such a job for life. Actually, widi notable but rare exceptions (Germany and Brit ain), unskilled service workers soon move on: For instance, in the United States, the annual rate of outflow from these jobs is 12 percent. Thus un skilled service workers form a stand by class, not a real poli\u00fccal force. Reference: G. Esping-Andersen (ed.), \"Changing Classes: Post-Industrial Class and Mobility Regimes\", Sage, Beverly Hills-Lon don (forthcoming). What M i n i s t e rs R e a l ly Do Government in Western Europe is pretty hierarchical, especially when it is in the hands of single parties. Even in coalition governments which might be expected to go in for more collec tive decision-making, policies are of ten centrally decided by the ministers concerned. These are among die findings of a recent comparative project by EUI Professor Jean Blondel andF. Miiller- Rommel from L\u00fcneburg University. The study, die largest comparative research on top political elites ever done, focused on the main controver sies concerning decision making in Western European Governments: Are individual ministers die sovereigns of their departments or do they partici pate in a process of collective deci sion-making when an issue is raised in die cabinet? How much difference is diere in practice between single-party and coalition governments? Are there significant individual differences in political style among ministers? More than 400 interviews with former ministers in 12 European coun tries showed diat ministers are more departmentally inclined in coalition governments. Prime ministers are gen erally more forceful in single-party governments. Personal background also plays a substantial role. Ministers with a less technical qualification (eg, lawyers and teachers) are generally more likely to be interested and involved in gov ernmental business outside their de partments. Only 9 percent of the ex- ministers interviewed had been able to look after the matters of their de partments and, at the same time, par ticipate in the affairs of die whole government. In general, die collective character of European cabinets seems quite limited. In fact, die governments of West ern European countries are character ized by a strong tension between the ideal of collective decision making and the need for a streamlined struc ture for efficient rule. In theory, cabi nets are supposed to govern collec tively. In practice, according to the study, die political systems of West ern Europe have had to accommodate, more or less openly and consciously, a degree of hierarchy. For example, governments often set up smaller min isterial committees which reduce the role of the cabinet. In order to be efficient, governments throughout Europe have moved away from col lective decision making, coalitions or not. Reference: J. Blondel and F.

        "EUI Research Report Winter 1992/3 T he S e c o nd I n d u s t r i al R e v o l u t i on The dominance of huge businesses by families has hindered their success in countries as diverse as Italy and South Korea. This was just one of the points made in a conference at die EUI in early October, organized by Profes sors Albert Carreras and Peter Hertner, under the title of \"Global Enterprise. Big Business and the Wealth of Nations in the Past Cen tury.\" Historians and economists from around the world discussed the Sec ond Industrial Revolution. This was the wave of technological innovation which swept dirough the USA and Western Europe in die last two dec ades of die nineteendi century, tfans- forming the structure of industries and economies. Much of die discussion focused on die work of Alfred D. Chandler, who stressed die importance of \u00dciree fields of investment, technology, marketing and management in diat period. Pro fessor Carreras and Xavier Tafunell, traced die distortion of Spanish indus try following poor State inves\u00fcnent decisions, particularly in the 1930s and 40s. These disrupted marketing networks, used backward technology and hindered managers. Russian and Czechoslovak partici pants considered the effects of State planning on already existing large enterprises, while a Japanese account showed how postwar industry re shaped itself with new owners and capital and with die development of a highly competitive relationship among industrial groups. Papers can be obtained from die EUI Librar ian. Professor Peler Hertner. K e n n e dy a nd E u r o pe Participants and spectators seldom give the same account of great events. Historians are well aware of this: poli ticians less so. An illustration came when policy makers and historians of the Kennedy era met at the EUI last October to discuss Europe/US relations of that crucial period. Historians presented points of contention about what actu ally happened in the 1960s to the eye witnesses, asking for their versions. Sure enough, diey often disagreed. One historian asserted that British PM Macmillan had \"offered the Bomb\" to France in return for LLC membership. But die picture from eye witnesses was diat American pressure had prevented him from doing Ulis. Eyewitnesses were themselves divided on the seriousness of the threat of nuclear war at that time. Interestingly, the Europeans present - especially those in die shadow of the Iron Curtain - had been considerably more appre hensive than die Americans. In the impressive list of partici pants in the \"Kennedy and Europe\" conference wereMcGeorge Bundy and Cail Kaysen, respectively Assistant Secretary of State and National Secu rity Advisor in the Kennedy adminis tration. Also present were Ted Sorensen, Kennedy's biographer, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., J. Kenneth Galbraith, William Diebold and Miriam Camps. From Europe came Lord Jenkins of Hillhead and Etienne Burin des Roziers who was General de Gaulle's private secretary. The conference was jointly organ ized by Professor Richard Griffiths, the EUI's European Policy Unit, die US Jean Monnet Council and the Kennedy Library Institute. While his torians at last had access under the thirty-year rule to documentary mate rial on the early 1960s, the conference also gave diem the opportunity to profit from a raie chance to bring together American survivors of die \"Kennedy Generation\", many of them now into G e r m a ny Welcomed Migrants At a time of increasing racial tension in Germany, a new study shows that in the past, Germans have welcomed immigrants. Ren\u00e9 Del Fabbro, an EUI re searcher, has studied the experi ence of Italian migrant workers from 1870 to the First World War. He says that the view that Germa ny was an\u00fc-immigrant in this pe riod is based on the treatment of Polish migrants. Because of ten sions involving Poles in Prussia, Russia and Austria, Prussian pol iticians disapproved the develop ment of a large Polish minority. Del Fabbro found that Italian migrants, like the British and Dutch, were better received. Be tween 1900 and 1914, nearly 200,000 Italians moved to Germa ny. Perhaps because they did not form enclaves but were spread out in different parts of the country, they were not seen to be a social problem. On a personal level too, diey made more of an effort to in tegrate into German society, and so were better received. Reference: Ren\u00e9 Del Fabbro, \"Wander arbeiter oder Einwanderer?

Walt Rostow spoke about how the US had seen itself as a model for European integration, a theme that was mentioned in the final session of the conference. Asked to reflect on con temporary issues, participants called for die US and Europe to work to- gedier to promote integradon, and thus encourage stability. The conference papers will be gadiered into a volume \"Kennedy and Europe\" (R. Griffiths, ed.) to appear in late 1993. ",
        "EUI Research Report Winter 1992/3 C u r r e n c i es a nd P r i c es Debates For those of you who rushed to your FIAT or Ferarri dealer when Italy devalued the lire: The influence of exchange-rates on prices is not quite that simple, according to research by professors in die EUI's Economics department. Prices of commodities in various national markets do change when exchange-rates fluctuate, but how they do so depends on the struc ture of the market in which die goods are sold, amongst other factors. In reality, the influence of ex change-rate changes on prices is de termined by the degree to which each good is a substitute for its domesti cally produced rivals as well as die degree to which it is a substitute for its foreign rivals. As greater substitut- ability with its foreign rivals means diat die effect of a depreciation, which raises the prices of foreign goods in die domestic market, is felt more keenly, the degree of influence is greater. - Soin the example of FT AT, Italian cars will become a better deal in die Italian market after devaluation of the lire, if they are subsiitutable for odier foreign cars (a Renault, for in stance). If on the other hand, domestic goods are more substitutable among themselves (FIATs and Alfa-Romeos), the greater competition in the domes tic market means that the domestic price has less freedom to adjust. That is not all there is to consider, however. Odier factors determining how exchange rates affect pricing in clude the degree to which a firm per ceives its own product as a substitute for diose of its rivals and die concen tration of firms in bodi domestic and foreign markets. The research also suggests that die fewer domestic firms there aie in a market, the greater will be the influ ence of exchange rates on die domes tic market. As Professors Kirmanand Phlips illustrate, this could imply that mergers among home firms are one way of increasing die response of do mestic prices to exchange rates. References: A. Kirman and L. Phlips, \"Ex change Rate Pass-Through and Market Struc ture\". ElIIWorking Paper ECO No 92/3. S. Martin and L. Phlips. \"Product Differentia tion, Market Structure and Exchange Kate Passdirough\", EHI Working Paper (forth coming), Opening a debate on Maastricht and the Future of the European Monetary System on November 16, EUI President Emile No\u00ebl warned diat withoutinstitudonalprogress.enlarge- ment of die EC would lead to an im balance between strong monetary in tegration and weak political union. Expressing the fear that political divi sions would persist and that in case of further refusals of ratification the Maastricht Treaty would now turn out to be j ust a chiffon de papier, he added that in the near future earlier monetary union for countries with similar econo mies would provide the best chance of success for the EC. International sanctions against Bosnia should be lifted, according to Zoran Trputec of the University of Mostar, Bosnia, speaking at a debate about the Yugoslav crisis. The con sensus of the November 12 debate was that sanctions had been unequal in effect, and on balance had favoured die government in Belgrade at die expense of Muslims in Bosnia. At this late stage, the value and possibility of EC intervention were not highly rated. H ow R e c e s s i o ns S p r e ad Everyone knows that booms and slumps spread from country to coun try. How and why this happens is less well known. America's business cy cles aie much more likely to spread to Germany and Japan than vice-versa, according to an EUI study, and this is not because of trade between these countries, at least in the short tenn. Using GDP data on the diree coun tries (1960-1990), an asymmetric transmission between nations was found. Evidence shows that changes in US output strongly affect that of Germany and Japan, whereas the in ternational impacts of such economic 'shocks' arising in die latter nations aie much less important. Research by EUI Professor Fabio Canova suggests that only alter a lag of three years can a domestically gen erated shock be transmitted interna tionally through trade in goods. Thus removal of trade barriers is unlikely to affect die way the outputs of nations move together and how recessions spread in the first two years. The study also found some evi dence concerning the means through which business cycles are transmitted internationally. Apparently, die fluc tuations in trade that go with the booms and slumps do not transmit economic shocks in the short term. According to the study, business cycles become in ternational simply because shocks in productivity, or government spending occur at the same time. Shocks die out gradually, e.g. if a government spending cut isprotracted. Coupled widi feedback effects diis tends to prolong business cycles. Trade transmits business cycles more slowly. These two modes of transmis sion of business cycles lead to differ ent types of recession. Using simulations of economies to relate the shape of business cycles to how they are transmitted, it was found that transmission by contemporane ous shocks gives an initial recession which then dies away gradually. Shocks passed on through trade, how ever, tend to generate a persistent, longer-run recession, after the evapo ration of a temporary boom. Reference: F.

        "EUI Research Report Winter 1992/3 EC L a b o ur L aw A f t er M a a s t r i c ht R e g u l a t i ng the S i n g le Market Whatever happens to the Maastricht Treaty, it looks as diough the instru ments are now in place for a funda mental change in European labour law and industrial relations, according to EUI professor Brian Bercusson. In the future, directives and EC-level collective agreements may be imple mented widiin Member Suites dirough collective bargaining. Further, they may be enforced using techniques developed to enforce Community law. Apart from the continuing uncertainty over Maastricht, die question remains whedier die relevant organizations are capable of putting diem into effect. The key documents proposing these labour law changes were drafted by die Dutch Government when it held die Presidency of die Council of Min isters. Most of the substance of die Maastricht provisions in social policy, however, was the result of negotia tions between die European-level employers organizations (UNICE and CEEP), and ETUC, the European 'frade Union Confederation. Of great importance for future European la bour reladons is die Accord of 31 October 1991 between die ETUC and UNICE/CEEP on a new draft of arti cles 118(4), 118A and 118B of the Treaty of Rome. Looking at recent European Com munity legal policy on labour law and industrial relations, Professor Bercusson specifies diree outcomes of die Maastricht summit which may be of outstanding importance for die future of labour relations. First, the implementation of Com munity labour law through collective bargaining widiin Member States is now explicitly recognized. This will lead to results ranging from peak or ganizations requesting block exemp tion for whole industries (or even multi-industry agreements), to enter prises and work councils requesting authority to implement directives in dieir workplaces. Secondly, a role for die \"social partners\" (unions, employers, and in terested organizations) at EC level in formulating Community labour law is introduced. Collective bargaining will take place while die Commission is consulting social partners about so cial policy proposals. Thus demands may be made before or after die Com mission produces its proposal. Thirdly, if these social partners at EC level have reached agreements, it appears that Member States are obliged to implement diese agree ments within die national legal or ders. Agreements concluded at Com munity level shall be implemented dirough national practices and proce dures. It is still unclear precisely what kind of obligations are imposed on the Member States.

Now, more than ever, it is clear that the European Community's old insti tutional framework is quite unsuited to the task of regulating a Single Euro pean Market A new plan, the result of interdisci plinary research carried out at die EUI Law and SPS departments, suggests how it might be changed for the better. The plan is the work of Professors Dehousse, Joerges, Snyder, Majone and researcher Michelle Everson. It was the EUFs contribution to the Eu ropean Commission's \"High Level Group on the Operation of the Internal Market\" under the chairmanship of Mr. Peter Sutherland, former Vice-Presi dent of the Commission. The EUI team agrees on the need for innovative instruments which will improve the Community's co-ordi nation and control functions without either taking over tasks or weakening die degree of control exercised by the Member States. This improvement in regulation of the Single Market should involve streamlining cooperation between States and the Community at all levels, vertically and horizontally, according to die authors. At Community level, this could be achieved through an EC Administrative Procedures Act. Reference : R. Dehousse, C. Joerges, G. Majone and F. Snyder widi M.

The arguments of de vout Muslims diat these are God's laws and cannot be questioned are unlikely to cut ice among lawyers and politicians in Europe. A more likely area for compromise may lie in reforming the process of justice, rather than changing laws, according to Professor Lawrence Rosen of Princeton University. This is because the Muslim concept of jus tice differs from that of die West. Dr Bedawi of the Muslim College, Lon don, then described how Shari'acoun- cils in England had been successful in offering Muslims an alternative proc ess of resolving fiunily disputes to die English courts. If all parties agreed to use this Muslim process of justice, diey could do so, with a possible re version to English courts in the event (ctd. from page 1 ) of dissatisfaction with the outcome. This attempt to allow Muslim commu nities to regain some control over the resolution of disputes may help enable Muslims to preserve their identity and values.

Current problems with the ERM are part of a longer story was the central message, and Member States should remain aware of this. Italy, \"the weakest member of the Community\" should resist the return of trade barriers, he told die Novem\u00ad ber gathering. That would lead to higher interest rates and inflation. The best path would be a return to die EMS as soon as possible, but at a new parity that enables interest rates to be set at a level close to her competitors. Con\u00ad tinuing integration would, the Fiat boss added, enable Italy ' s \"slower and more complex\" institutions to benefit from confrontation widi other national sys\u00ad tems in a more open Europe.

        "EUI Research Report Winter 1992/3 E q u al R i g h ts 200 Years on In 1792 Mary Wollstonecraft urged that women be given the same rights as men on the grounds diat widi the same educational and professional opportunities all differences beyond the purely biological would disappear. This demand for equal righLs became die basis for two centuries of struggle to achieve parity between men and women. But to what effect? On 17th October a workshop, The Rights of Women, organized by Professor Ol we n H uf ton and die Working Group on Gender Studies, brought together a number of Euro pean experts to discuss how egalitar ian legislation has left unaffected large numbers of women. They are those still locked in a poverty trap with ill- paid jobs and minimal pension provi sion. The consensus was that demo cratic systems of law and government have not served women well as pri mary carers of children and the old and on issues such as domestic vio lence and abortion . P l u r al N a t i o n a l i ty Whereas previously having more than one nationality was seen as a bureaucratic and legal problem, plural nationality is now increasingly seen in a positive light. This was the theme of a conference organised by EUI Law professor U. D'Oliveira, held on June 15 & 16 at the EUI Culture Research Centre. The two-day workshop devoted sessions to plural nationality as a means of integration of migrants into host countries and to sexual equality as one of the major factors producing plural nationality. Other sessions looked into the perspective of minorities, and qualitative sociological research on nationality preferences expressed by migrants. Plural nationality was in some cases found to be an expression of special ties between different countries. Na tionality in (re)emerging States was discussed, as was plural nationality and international organizations. Reference: H.-U.

Recent events in Central and West ern Europe suggest that nationalism is on the rebound. The Fill's interdisci plinary research unit, the European Forum has responded with an intense programme of research on the theme. For more than a year a group of EUI researchers, fellows and professors have been researching the historical conditions (hat feed national loyalties. Workshops on such topics as the Sports Hero, National Heritage and the State, and Nations and Ethnic Identities have shown diat in the past as in the present, national feeling has been in competi tion with other regional, local, reli gious or political loyalties. EUI researchers argue that rather than analysing nationalism in more general terms, one should analyse die specific conditions which explain the rise of nationalism in a given time and place. By placing the national ques tion in a political and social frame work, it may be easier to diink of ways of checking its worst manifestations. Regional and national identities in the 19th and 20th centuries is die topic for the 1993/1994 European Forum, directed by Professor Heinz- Gerhard Haupt.
