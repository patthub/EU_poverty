        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 5 1. Executive Summary This report presents the results of the study \u2018Monitoring progress towards gender equality in the Sixth Framework Programme\u2019 for the activity areas \u2018Citizens and governance in a knowledge- based society\u2019, so-called Priority 7 (Social Sciences and Humanities) and the related \u2018Support for the coherent development of policies\u2019 actions, including the Priority 7 relevant \u2018policy-oriented research\u2019; as well as the \u2018Science and Society\u2019 activity area. The study aimed at providing an assessment of the mainstreaming of gender in the conception and management of the programme and projects, the participation of women in the programme and projects and the extent to which the EU-funded research in the above-mentioned fields meets the needs of both women and men and contributes to an enhanced understanding of gender issues. The study results indicate that under the research areas relevant for this study, a significant contribution has been made in FP6 in terms of progress towards gender equality. However, despite this important achievement, there remains much scope for improvements and more and continued efforts are required to realise further progress towards realising the objectives as stated at the start of FP6. The following positive findings can be noted : \u2022 In the conception of FP6, there have been various structural provisions relating to the integration of gender at the different stages of programme and project process, including in the tools that have been developed to enable the work of the various actors (e.g. Work Programmes, Calls, Guides for Proposers, Guidance notes for evaluators, etc.). The introduction in FP6 of the Gender Action Plans, which were mandatory in proposals for Integrated Projects and Networks of Excellence, has significantly contributed to the progress made. \u2022 The 40% target for women's participation in committees and panels of FP6 has been met or nearly met in the \u2018Science and Society\u2019 and Priority 7 research areas : the share of women in the respective Programme Committees have been 49% and 39%; in the Advisory Groups 39% and 33%; and among evaluators of proposals 51% and 42% respectively. \u2022 Those calls that included gender-specific topics and/or where gender relevant issues were explicitly suggested have had an immediate effect, both in terms of higher female participation rates in the projects and as regards more gender-aware research. \u2022 In total, 39 gender specific projects have been funded under the FP6 research areas that were reviewed in this study : 31 in the \u2018Science and Society\u2019 area, six in Priority 7 and two in the Priority 7 -related \u2018Scientific Support for Policies\u2019 field. In \u2018Science and Society\u2019, there have been two \u2018women and science\u2019 calls, under which the majority of the gender specific projects in this area have been submitted. These 39 gender specific projects will undoubtedly make an important contribution to an enhanced understanding of gender issues. \u2022 Excluding the projects that are gender specific, a further contribution to improving gender knowledge is made by those projects that have integrated gender to some extent in their projects : 25 % of the projects in the \u2018Science and Society\u2019 area and up to 60 % in Priority 7 (even though a majority of these demonstrated an incomplete understanding and treatment of the gender dimension). \u2022 There has been a clear impact of the negotiation on the quality of the Gender Action Plans (GAP) in projects : in one third of the cases, its quality improved from the proposal to the contract stage. ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 6 However, there were also important weaknesses identified : \u2022 There are important differences in the application of the agreed processes and the understanding and appreciation of gender issues by the various actors involved differ widely. Such inconsistent interpretations and appreciations indicate a clear risk of an unequal treatment of proposals and projects. For example, it should not have been possible that proposals for which a Gender Action Plan (GAP) was mandatory, but which did not contain a GAP, passed the evaluation stage. \u2022 The review of the proposal evaluations indicates that the assessment of gender by the evaluators has not been systematic and consistent. There are signs of uncertainty and a lack of understanding among the evaluators of the significance of the gender dimension to the design and quality of the research activities. \u2022 The Descartes Prizes, both for research and for communicating science, have failed to show progress towards gender equality during the FP6 period. The \u2018guidance notes for evaluators\u2019 of these Prizes contained no reference whatsoever to \u2018gender\u2019 and only four of all 27 Descartes Prizes were awarded to women (8%). This is significantly below the average proportion of women among the coordinators/authors participating in the Prize contest (15%). This specific case shows that gender needs to be explicitly included among the assessment criteria (e.g. under \u2018excellence\u2019) to ensure gender issues to be considered. \u2022 Despite their important role in the Framework Programme, the majority of the National Contact Points \u2013 even those responsible for the areas \u2018Science and Society\u2019 and \u2018Knowledge Society\u2019 \u2013 reported not to have taken any action in relation to gender mainstreaming in FP6. Their contribution to realising the Commission\u2019s objectives in terms of gender equality in EU funded research can therefore be considered as insufficient. The main explanatory factor is the low awareness among these actors (and individuals doing the NCP work) of the relevance of the issue. \u2022 Although the participation rates of women as coordinators and participants in projects seem positive, these shares remain below the share of female PhD graduates in the relevant scientific fields. In \u2018Science and Society\u2019, 41% of the coordinators of funded projects are female and 39% of participants in ranked proposals; in Priority 7 the share of women among the coordinators of funded projects is 29% and among the participants in funded projects 28%. These figures contrast with the average share of women among PhD graduates in 2003 in the EU25 in the fields of \u2018Humanities and Arts\u2019 (51.4%) and of \u2018Social Sciences, Business and Law\u2019 (43.1%). 1 \u2022 A significant number of projects (almost half in \u2018Science and Society\u2019 and one third in Priority 7 ) do not identify gender relevant issues for their work, and do no integrate gender in the project design. While the majority of these did include some reference to gender in their proposal, no provisions were foreseen to effectively deal with the issue, the mentioning of \u2018gender\u2019 thus only being lip-service. \u2022 The participation of women in the CREST expert panels remained significantly below the 40% target. \u2022 The central data management for FP6 at the European Commission has significant flaws. The data and tools which should allow an efficient and effective exploitation of data and monitoring of results have been insuffiently consistent, available and operational. 1 European Commission, DG Research (2006), She Figures 2006 , Women and Science Statistics and Indicators, Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities.

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 7 \u2022 The very low number of \u2018Science and Society Reporting Questionnaires\u2019 available in the SESAM 2 system by May 2007, the low quality and fragmented nature of the information provided in these as well as in the \u2018GAP Interim Implementation Reports\u2019 suggest that nobody in the Commission monitors the completeness and quality of this (mandatory) online reporting by project holders. Key recommendations for improving the consideration of gender issues in EU research programmes and projects include : \u2022 Ensure that among all groups of actors and at all levels in the preparation, management and implementation of the Framework Programme, there are participants with gender expertise. Only by doing so can gender be adequately addressed and integrated also at the EU level. \u2022 Maintain the efforts and further reinforce the stuctural provisions and formal requirements in the Framework Programme relating to the participation of women and the integration of gender issues in the research / activities. In particular : o Work Programmes and Calls should identify and include gender-relevant issues among the suggested research topics wherever possible. To enable this, it is suggested to involve gender experts, who are knowledgeable about the respective scientific fields, in the drafting of the Work Programmes. o Guides for Proposers should instruct proposers to demonstrate (efforts to realise) a gender balance in their teams, to indicate how gender is relevant to the research topic / action, how the project will address these issues and with which means. o Require that proposers (at the proposal stage) commit themselves to produce at least one output / deliverable devoted to the gender-related work. o Adapt the criteria and procedures for the evaluation and selection of proposals for funding, so that expert evaluators\u2019 judgements with respect to gender are reflected in the final evaluation outcome of the proposal. o Reintroduce Gender Action Plans in FP7 as mandatory in the research proposals. o Ensure that gender considerations are explicitly included in the selection criteria for the Descartes Research and Communication Prizes. \u2022 Raise the awareness and knowledge among all actors involved in the Framework Programme, including among project officers and EU research promotors (notably staff at National Contact Points), about the Community policy on gender equality and its significance in the context of scientific and research activities. \u2022 Instruments, tools and support should be available for all actors involved in the Framework Programme (proposers, proposal evaluators, independent observers, project officers, expert group members, staff at National Contact Points, etc.) to facilitate the mainstreaming and integration of gender at all stages : briefings or trainings, practical examples and tools, links to further information and possibly assistance. Furthermore, the uptake and effective use of such instruments and tools should not only be encouraged, but where possible also ensured and monitored. \u2022 Further monitoring and evaluation of progress towards gender equality is necessary also under FP7. To enable such work, it is necessary that consistent and relevant data are timely available and that effective data management and reporting tools are used by the European Commission. \u2022 Enhance the collection and availability of sex-disaggregated data : on coordinators of projects, participants and researchers in projects, but also on the compositions of expert panels, committees and Grand Juries for which sex breakdowns are still not systematically encoded. 2 The Commission\u2019s online reporting tool.

Introduction 2.1 Background to the study The present study finds its roots in the late nineties, when the European Commission adopted the Communication on \u201cWomen and Science : mobilising women to enrich European research\u201d 3 . In this Communication, the Commission recognised the threefold relationship between women and research : women\u2019s participation in research must be encouraged (research \u2018by\u2019 women), research must address women\u2019s needs (research \u2018for\u2019 women) and research should contribute to an enhanced understanding of gender issues (research \u2018about\u2019 women). The Communication further announced that gender impact studies would take place to assess how gender questions were treated in the 5 th Framework Programme, so that their results could contribute to an improved design of future EU research policies from a gender perspective. Building on the results of the gender impact studies, the Sixth Framework Programme (FP6) strives to promote gender equality in scientific research, both from the point of view of promoting the participation of women scientists and from the point of view of the integration of the gender dimension in the research agenda, where this is relevant. The 2003 work programme of the specific programme \u201cStructuring the European Research Area\u201d, in its \u201cScience and Society\u201d component, includes the objective of monitoring gender equality in FP6. The purpose of the present study is to fulfil this objective. This report concerns lot III which covers the following activity areas : (cid:190) of the specific programme \u201c Integrating and strengthening the European Research Area\u201d (2002-2006) : 1. \u201cCitizens and governance in a knowledge-based society\u201d, so-called Priority 7 , and which is implemented by Directorate K \u201cSocial Sciences and Humanities; Foresight\u201d (Dir K) of the Directorate-General for Research (DG RTD); 2. \u201cSupport for the coherent development of policies\u201d which is implemented, partly, by Directorate K \u201cSocial Sciences and Humanities; Foresight\u201d (Dir K) and partly by Directorate M \u201cInvestment in Research and links with other policies\u201d (Dir M) of DG RTD. The above activities also include the \u2018policy-oriented research\u2019 in relation with migration, crime, integration / sustainable development / competitiveness / trade policies and European statistics.

The contract for the present study was signed on 23 December 2004 and had a contract duration of three years. The work started early 2005 and the analysis of material was completed in September 2007, when the fourth and last working paper was submitted. 3 COM (1999) 76 final of 17.02.1999. ",

This includes an assessment of : \u2022 the mainstreaming of gender in the conception and management of the programme and project cycles, notably in the setting of priorities, in guidance to project proposers, in project evaluation and selection, in the definition of reporting requirements; \u2022 the participation of women in research as scientists/researchers and within the evaluation, consultation and implementation process; \u2022 the extent to which EU-funded research and innovation meets the needs of both its female and male citizens and contributes to an enhanced understanding of gender issues. In a first stage, a biblioghrapical review has been undertaken 4 to summarise the state of knowledge in the FP6 areas of research that are relevant for Lot III. The results of this review are included in annex 2 to this report. This was followed by an assessment of the extent to which the recommendations of the relevant FP5 gender impact study 5 had been taken into account by the Commission. Subsequently, three monitoring rounds have been undertaken in which the above mentioned elements for assessement were analysed and reported upon in individual working papers. These working papers also included practical recommendations for the short and medium term. As FP6 advanced, each working paper comprised an update of the previously undertaken work. The study has been based primarily on desk analysis of relevant data, reports and documents concerning FP6 in general and the research areas relevant for this Lot III in particular. This included i.a. the work programmes, guides for proposers and evaluators, the call texts, all evaluation reports and independent observer reports, evaluation summary reports, project proposals and technical annexes to the contracts of financed projects, activity and other project reports. Throughout the study, there have been regular contacts, meetings and exchanges with the Commission\u2019s liaison persons for the study who provided the study team with the required data. In the course of the study period, three coordination meetings have taken place in which the contractors of the various \u2018gender monitoring study\u2019-lots exchanged information on the progress of the work, on main findings and in which discussions took place regarding possible recommendations for the future of EU RTD. 4 This part of the work has been performed by Sara Clavero, Research Fellow at the Centre for the Advancement of Women in Politics, Queen\u2019s University Belfast. 5 Braithwaite, M.

Start-up of FP6 : improvements made by the Commission since FP5 In the Fifth Framework Programme (1998-2002) (FP5), gender impact studies have been undertaken. The terms of reference of the present study require the contractor to review the relevant sections of the report of the gender impact study \u201c Human Potential Study \u2013 Improving Human Research Potential and the Socio-economic Knowledge Base programme\u201d , and to check to which extent the recommendations of this study have been taken into account by the Commission. The mentioned FP5 study covers the former FP5 \u201cImproving human research potential and the socio-economic knowledge base\u201d specific programme (IHP). In FP6, the corresponding activities fall under three different areas, two of which concern the present lot III and the third one concerns lot V. For lot III, the sections on \u2018socio-economic knowledge key action\u2019 and \u2018raising public awareness\u2019 have to be taken into consideration. The table below lists the \u2018key recommendations for improving attention to gender in future research programmes and activities\u2019 as formulated in the relevant gender impact study, together with the actions taken by the Commission to implement the suggested improvements as they were identified by the study team. Table 3.1 Key recommendations following the FP5 gender impact study and corresponding recommendations made by the Commission Recommendations Improvements implemented by the Commission Strengthen the policy framework on \u201cgender and science\u201d, in particular to clarify and reinforce the gender mainstreaming approach in science and research. The Framework Programme strives to promote gender equality in scientific research, both from the point of view of promoting the participation of women scientists and from the point of view of the integration of the gender dimension in the research agenda, where this is relevant. This is stated in the Decision of the European Parliament and the Council concerning the adoption of FP6 6 , in the Council Decisions adopting the Specific Programmes 7 and in the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Rules for participation for the implementation of the European Community Sixth Framework Programme 8 . The concrete way through which this is implemented by the Commission services is presented in a Vademecum 9 . Make stronger reference to the importance of ensuring equality of participation of women and men in the guidance to proposals for all actions and calls. All calls for proposals contain the statement: \u201c The European Community has adopted an equal opportunities policy and, on this basis, women are particularly encouraged to either submit proposals for indirect RTD actions or participate in the submission of proposals for indirect RTD actions.\u201d The various Guides for Proposers contain as an annex the document entitled \u2018Integrating the gender dimension in FP6 6 OJ L232, 29.8.2002, p.1. 7 OJ L 294, 29.10.2002, P.1; OJ L 294, 29.10.2002, p.44. 8 OJ L 355, 30.12.2002, p.23. 9 VADEMECUM : Gender mainstreaming in the 6 th Framework Programme \u2013 Reference guide for scientific officiers / project officers.

Require project proposers to provide information on how they intend, concretely, to ensure gender equality in participation. Proposers for IP\u2019s and NoE\u2019s have to include a Gender Action Plan in their proposal. For the other instruments, the proposers are instructed : \u201cIf there are gender issues associated with the subject of the proposal, show they have been adequately taken into account\u201d. There is no instruction to demonstrate a gender balance in their team. Establish a more systematic and integrated system for encoding, collating and producing data on the participation of women and men. Evaluation reports include the gender breakdown of evaluation experts, participants in proposals evaluated and retained for funding. For Science and Society, the reports also include the gender breakdown of project co-ordinators. Thus, while data is asked and encoded on the sex of co- ordinators and participants, this data is not systematically communicated. Neither are figures always consistent (definitions underlying figures may be different). Data on the sex of researchers in projects has not been readily available, although should have been known to the Commission for the IP\u2019s and NoE\u2019s. There remain various actors in the FP6 (panels, committees, Grand Jurys) for which gender breakdowns are not encoded. Improve information and data on gender issues in relation to : mobility; science and technology, particularly concering education and awareness-raising; and scientific discourse and epistemology. Under FP6, Science and Society, call 10 contained the specific area \u2018Gender Research\u2019 (topic 4.3.5.2 of the Science and Society Work Programme) \u2013 the first and only call with this research area. It focussed on : a) benchmarking of policy measures for gender equality in science b) minimising gender bias in the measurement and evaluation of scientific excellence c) deepening and broadening the quantitative knowledge base on women and science in Europe Raise the awareness and knowledge of staff and project promoters about Community policy on gender equality and on gender mainstreaming as it applies to science, technology and research.

Ensure that work programmes reflect Community policy in their objectives and themes; The work programme for Science and Society refers to \u2018gender\u2019 in its objectives and in the themes addressed by this activity area. The work programme for Priority 7 does not refer to \u2018gender\u2019 under the part devoted to the \u2018overall objectives, structure and approach\u2019 of this activity area.

Topic 7.1.2 is devoted to gender issues : \u2018Gender and citizenship in a multi-cultural context\u2019. 2. Include clear definition of key concepts and identification of the human populations concerned in the quality criteria for proposals; 3. Clearly mention equal opportunities and gender mainstreaming in all calls and guides to proposers; The calls for proposals contain the standard statement, which has the purpose to encourage women to participate in FP6 : \u201c The European Community has adopted an equal opportunities policy and, on this basis, women are particularly encouraged to either submit proposals for indirect RTD actions or participate in the submission of proposals for indirect RTD actions.\u201d The Guides for Proposers contain the standard document \u2018Integrating the gender dimension in FP6 projects\u2019 which clearly explains the legal base for gender equality, the threefold relationship between women and research, and a list of examples of how gender difference or gender-specific needs can be relevant for research. 4. Adapt the criteria and procedures for ex-ante evaluation and selection of proposals; Evaluators are instructed to check the horizontal issues, among which gender, to be addressed, and to make recommendations where relevant. However, there are no marks to be given by the evaluators to express their judgement in this respect. Only for Networks of Excellence, the Individual Assessment Form contains under block 5 \u2018Organisation and management\u2019, which is to be marked, the following element to be assessed : \u201cthe extent to which there is a well-considered plan for promoting gender equality in the network\u201d . 5. And include gender aspects in project and programme monitoring and reporting. The Science and Society work programme mentions \u201cmonitoring women\u2019s participation and the integration of the gender dimension in the Framework Programme, in particular through the follow-up of the gender action plans of NoEs and IPs, through gender monitoring studies 10 ; and through the establishment of a strategic database, accessible to the public, comprising statistics on women\u2019s participation in the Framework Programme and gender action plans\u201d. 11 Ensure that all committees and expert groups are gender-balanced and contain an adequate level of expertise and experience in gender issues in the relevant domains. Efforts are undertaken to reach the 40% target of women in committees and panels, both in Science and Society and for Priority 7. Whether an adequate level of expertise and experience in gender issues in the relevant domains is ensured is unclear to the study team.

Gender assessment of the Science & Society activity area 4.1 Participation of women in the programme and projects The 40% target for women\u2019s participation in committees and evaluation panels applies in FP6. The Vademecum 12 states in this respect : \u201c When forming the panels, scientific officers should pay attention to this target. In 2001, there were 27% female experts, in 2002 only about 23%. There is a need to progress towards 40%. This also requires an increase of the number of women in the EMM database. Directorates should raise the attention of their stakeholders (programme committees, NCP\u2019s, EAG\u2019s, etc, ...) on the need to encourage women\u2019s applications to be expert- evaluator .\u201d The participation of women as experts has been promoted on the \u2018Women and Science\u2019 pages of the Cordis website 13 and also \u2013 although less visibly \u2013 on the \u2018gender mainstreaming\u2019 pages of the \u2018Women and Science\u2019 part of the Science and Society programme website 14 . Furthermore, on the Cordis FP6 homepage there has been a link to the \u2018FP6 Call for Experts\u2019 page 15 , without explicitly addressing women though. 4.1.1. Participation of women in the Science & Society activity area The target of at least 40 % female participation has been met in nearly all the cases : \u2022 The Advisory Group on \u2018Science and Society\u2019 counts 7 women (39%) and 11 men (61%). \u2022 As regards the experts participating in the evaluation of proposals, there were in total 570 experts involved, of which 289 (51 %) were women. This percentage has been above the 40% threshold, except for the third, 8 th,, 9 th and 15 th call (where women represented respectively only 32%, 38%, 38% and only 31% of the evaluation experts). The evaluation panels of calls that specifically focussed on women 16 had a significantly higher share of women. Especially for calls 10 and 17 (Women and Science) the difficulty to ensure a reasonable gender balance among the evaluators was noted. Looking per year, a decrease in the share of women in evaluation panels for Science and Society can be noted from 2003 to 2005, while 2006 has known again an increase : in 2003 55% of the evaluation panels was female; 49% in 2004; 44 % in 2005, and again 54% in 2006. \u2022 In the Programme Committee 17 , composed of national representatives, 49 % of the representatives were female 18 . Although the target only refers to \u2018committees\u2019 and \u2018panels\u2019, we also noted the following figures : 12 VADEMECUM : Gender mainstreaming in the 6th Framework Programme \u2013 Reference guide for scientific officers / project officers.

This results in 35 % of the sessions being observed by a female independent observer. It is recommended that efforts are made to raise this figure. Two men acted as independent observer for four different evaluation sesssions each. \u2022 For the Descartes Research Prizes (calls 3, 8, 12 and 18), the Grand Juries who selected the laureates from among the finalists - who were pre-selected by independent experts \u2013 comprised between 8 and 20 members, with a proportion of women that only in the last call met the 40% target : o Call 3 : 8 members, of which 3 women (38%) o Call 8 : 14 members, of which 4 women (29%) o Call 12 : 14 members, of which 3 women (21%) o Call 18 : 20 members, of which 11 women (55%) \u2022 For the Descartes Communication Prizes (calls 8, 12 and 18), the final selection of the winners was done by the panel presidents.

This figure hides important differences among the various calls. Whereas call 6 (European Platform for Women Scientists) and calls 10 and 17 (Women and Science) reach an impressive 86%, 82% and 89% of female co-ordinators respectively, the share of female co-ordinators is much lower in other calls, e.g. in call 14 it is only 21%, 23% in call 2, and in call 20 it is 25%. One can furthermore observe that the share of female co-ordinators among the ranked proposals is 42%, slightly higher than the initial 40% among the evaluated proposals, and 41% among the contracts signed. This indicates that women and men have been (almost) equally successful with their proposals under the Science and Society calls. Success rates were calculated for women coordinators, considering all proposals that were retained for funding as a basis. These success rates were calculated overall, per call and per instrument. Across all calls (Call 1 to 20, excluding the Descartes calls), the success rates of female and male co-ordinators have been the same : 16 %. However, success rates vary significantly per call. The table hereafter gives an overview of the success rates of female and male coordinators per instrument and per call in absolute figures and in percentages. The \u2018_F\u2019 indicates the number of projects financed, out of the total number of proposals submitted (the preceeding column). The basis of this table is the number of contracts signed. 21 Following the table are a set of charts visualising the success rates for female and male coordinators per instrument. 21 Figures must be interpreted with care, given the relatively low absolute numbers. A more accurate analysis of success rates per instrument should be possible if results from the various \u2018gender monitoring studies\u2019 are aggregated across FP6. ",

The female participation is therefore calculated on 78 proposals rather than on the total number of 85. 23 This percentage is calculated on 60 proposals because three proposals (ineligibles) did not specify a nominee. 24 There were 6 ineligible proposals, of which four did not specify their project coordinator. Female participation is therefore calculated on 61. 25 Some projects involved two authors. This is the reason why the percentage calculated is based on 88 authors. 26 For this report, \u2018finalists\u2019 is defined as those projects that make it to the final stage of selection by a Grand Jury after a pre-selection by a panel composed by the Commission. It is to be noted however that since the introduction in 2005 (Call 12) of a small monetary prize for five non- winners, the Commission uses the term \u2018finalists\u2019 for those research projects that make it to the final stage, are not selected as laureates, but do receive a small monetary prize. 27 This one project coordinated by a woman was not selected as winner, nor for a small monetary prize. 28 This percentage is calculated on a total of 6 laureates as one of the projects with a female winner was authored by both a man and a woman.

For the four calls, the proportion of projects coordinated by women is 12 %, a relatively low figure. The Commission might therefore consider to explicitly encourage the submission of proposals by women. Looking at the laureates, only one of the twelve research prizes was granted to a woman (8 %). The success rate of female co-ordinators for the Descartes Research Prize is 4 %, while the success rate of projects co-ordinated by men is 6 %. In 2005, a small monetary prize was introduced for five non-winners from among the short- listed proposals. Both in 2005 (call 12) and in 2006 (call 18), not only were there no female coordinators among the laureates of the Research Prize, also among the winners of the small monetary prize there were no women. For the Communication Prize, there were two women among the five winners of the small monetary prize in 2005, but none in 2006. Looking at the total of Descartes Prizes (both for research and communication), four of the 27 prizes were awarded to women (8 %). This share is significantly below the average proportion of women among the coordinators/authors (15%). This may be the indication of a gender-bias in the selection of winners. b) Sex of participants in projects The absolute and relative figures for the participation of women (coordinators and partners) in proposals evaluated and retained for funding are given in the next table.

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 23 the various calls can be noted : the share of women participating in proposals submitted under call 6 (European Platform for Women Scientists) and calls 10 and 17 (Women and Science) is much higher : 80%, 78% and 79% female participants respectively. The share of female participants is lowest in call 2 (European Science Week Initiative) : 25%. The overall share of female participants in the proposals retained for funding (39%) is about the same as the share of women participating in proposals submitted and evaluated (38%), confirming that success rates for women and men are the same across these Science and Society calls. Calls for Descartes prizes were analysed separately. This concerns Calls 3, 8, 12 and 18. The table below provides the absolute and relative figures of women\u2019s participation in consortia submitting proposals for Descartes Research Prizes.

Again, this may be the indication of a gender-bias in the selection of winners. Especially in call 8, it is concerning to see that the winning projects were all-male. 4.2 Conception and management of the Science & Society activity area 4.2.1. The Work Programme of the Science & Society activity area \u2018Science and Society\u2019 is an activity area within the second block of FP6 \u2018Structuring the ERA 29 \u2019. The \u2018Science and Society\u2019 activity area is structured along three axes, of which the first aims to bring research closer to society; the second is concerned with promoting responsible research and application of science and technology, while the third seeks to step up the science/society dialogue, and addresses also the role of women in science. The work programme states that the selection of the activities it contains was done with the help of the Advisory Group for Science and Society and the Helsinki Group on Women and Science, which brings together national civil servants and/or gender experts from the EU Member States and the countries associated with the FP, involved in promoting women in scientific research at national level. 29 ERA : European Research Area ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 24 Among the activities to be supported it lists \u2018gender research\u2019, i.a. comparative assessments, methodological development (including design of indicators), surveys, impact assessments, studies. In the technical descriptions of which topics can be supported under Science and Society, the Parts A and B (referring to the first two axes mentioned above) make no reference to gender issues. Nevertheless, the objectives of these parts contain general references to \u2018civil society\u2019 (topic 4.3.1), or in relation to ethics : \u2018diverse cultural backgrounds across the continent\u2019 or \u2018the fundamental ethical principles applied in the European countries\u2019 (topic 4.3.2) without explicitly stimulating (the investigation of) the involvement of the full diversity of societal actors, including women. Especially in the dialogue about ethical issues at European level, the explicit demand to involve women is felt as missing. Part C contains the task \u2018woman and science\u2019 (reference 4.3.5), of which the objective is formulated as follows : \u201cto boost gender equality in research, through stimulating the participation of women in science and technological development; and fostering the integration of the gender dimension throughout European research.\u201d 30 It specifies that \u2018Women and science\u2019 is to be understood in the broadest sense, ranging from natural to social science - including, but not restricted to, science, engineering and technology (SET) \u2013 and is of relevance to women scientists and researchers in both the public and private sectors. This task consists of three different topics : \u2022 Topic 4.3.5.1 deals with \u2018Stimulating the policy debate at national and regional level and mobilisation of women scientists\u2019, focussing on : o supporting the empowerment of women scientists and engineers and promoting public debate; o promoting the participation of women in science decision-making and policy definition. The aim is to stimulate mechanisms for involving women scientists more actively in research management and policy definition at national and European levels; o Mobilising more women for studies and careers in science, engineering and technology (SET). \u2022 Topic 4.3.5.2 deals with \u2018Developing a better understanding of the gender issue in scientific research\u2019, and focusses on : o benchmarking of policy measures for gender equality in science; o minimising gender bias in the measurement and evaluation of scientific excellence; o deepening and broadening the quantitative knowledge base on women and science in Europe. \u2022 Topic 4.3.5.3 deals with \u2018Promoting the enhancement of the Gender Watch System and associated activities to promote gender equality throughout the European Research Area\u2019, and focuses on : o practical tools for mainstreaming and monitoring gender equality; o mainstreaming the gender dimension in new or emerging strategic research areas. Apart from a few studies which follow the public procurement procedures, all these topics are to be covered through research projects for which proposals could be submitted in answer to two calls \u2018Women and Science\u2019 (FP6-2004-Science-and-society-10 and FP6-2004-Science- and-society-17). Under reference 4.3.4 of Part C \u2018Scientific and technological culture, young people, science education and careers\u2019, the only reference to \u2018gender\u2019 is made under topic 4.3.4.3, for actions 30 Work Programme : 2005-6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019, p. 13. ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 25 aimed at understanding and comparing the strengths and weaknesses of school science teaching practice and methodologies (taking into account gender specific actions). The other topics under this heading do not include references to a gender dimension, although these are relevant, e.g. for actions to increase \u2018public awareness\u2019 of S&T advances and their societal impacts; to increase dialogue between \u2018citizens\u2019 and the scientific community; to facilitate communication between \u2018civil society\u2019 and scientific research institutions; to improve communication between the scientific community and \u2018the public\u2019 on issues of European research, etc. An explicit recommendation to address the full scope of (sub-)groups within this \u2018public\u2019 would have better ensured the integration of the gender dimension. Also under Part C is the task \u2018Horizontal Actions\u2019 (reference 4.3.6), with as first topic \u2018Promoting the \u2018embedding\u2019 of science and society issues across the Framework Programme\u2019, aiming at inventorising the actions undertaken within the thematic priorities in FP6 to streamline the horizontal objectives of the Framework Programme, among which gender equality. This study would follow the public procurement procedures. 4.2.2. Calls for proposals and Guides for Proposers The Guide for Proposers is the main document containing the instructions to proposers on how their proposal should be presented and how the Proposal Form should be completed. The different Guides for Proposers all contain, as an annex, the one-page document \u2018Integrating the gender dimension in FP6 projects\u2019 which clearly explains the legal base for gender equality, the threefold relationship between women and research, and a list of examples of how gender difference or gender-specific needs can be relevant for research. Furthermore, the Guides for Proposers explicitly mention as example under consortium management activities the \u2018 overseeing the promotion of gender equality in the project\u2019 . In the Proposal Form 31 , gender issues are only suggested to be covered under the last section B.7 \u2018Other issues\u2019, phrased as follows : \u201c If there are ethical or gender issues associated with the subject of the proposal, show they have been adequately taken into account\u201d. This seems to imply that gender issues are not related to the other elements of the research project to be proposed : relevance to the objectives of Science and Society (section B.2), potential impact (section B.3), the consortium and project resources (B.4). Furthermore, for the Science and Society programme there are per definition gender issues associated with the research, a fact which is not recognised in how this instruction for section B.7 is phrased. A better formulation would be : \u201cClearly indicate how the proposal adequately takes into account the gender issues associated with the subject of the proposal.\u201d For the Descartes Prizes, the Guide for Proposers contains the instruction to proposers to clearly indicate in their proposal how gender issues are taken into account. The calls for proposals contain a standard statement, which has the purpose to encourage women to participate in FP6 : \u201c The European Community has adopted an equal opportunities policy and, on this basis, women are particularly encouraged to either submit proposals for indirect RTD actions or participate in the submission of proposals for indirect RTD actions.\u201d The language used in the Guides for Proposers is gender-neutral. The reader is addressed directly, using the second person form (\u2018you\u2019, \u2018your\u2019) and thus avoiding systematically mentioning \u2018he / she\u2019 or \u2018his / her\u2019. However, these terms are sometimes used when reference is made to the project co-ordinator. 31 This is the template on the basis of which proposers have to structure and complete their proposal, and which is explained in the Guide for Proposers.

The evaluation and selection of proposals Evaluation procedures The evaluation and selection of proposals is carried out by the Commission with the assistance of independent experts. These evaluators are selected by the Commission, whereby a balance is sought between the various competencies required for evaluating the proposals submitted for the various areas covered by the respective call, sex, nationality, etc. They are expected to be independent, impartial and objective, and to behave throughout in a professional manner. They conform to the \u201cCode of Conduct for independent experts appointed as evaluators\u201d which is appended to the \u201cGuidelines on proposal evaluation and selection procedures\u201d and must sign a confidentiality and conflict of interest declaration prior to beginning their work. Before starting their work, the evaluators are briefed by the responsible Commission staff on the various elements related with their evaluation work, including on the evaluation criteria. They also receive the call-specific documents published by the Commission, including the Guidance Notes for Evaluators, and the general Guidelines on Proposal Evaluation and Selection Procedures. Evaluators first individually assess the proposals according to a set of pre-defined criteria which are different according to the type of instrument. Evaluators examine the individual issues comprising each block of evaluation criteria and mark the blocks on a six-point scale from 0 to 5 (whereby 0 stands for \u2018the proposal fails to address the issue under examination or can not be judged against the criterion due to missing or incomplete information\u2019, 1 \u2013 \u2018poor\u2019, 2 - \u2018fair\u2019, 3 \u2013 \u2018good\u2019, 4 \u2013 \u2018very good\u2019, and 5 \u2013 \u2018excellent\u2019). Subsequently the evaluators discuss their individual judgements in consensus meetings. The discussion of the proposal will continue until a consensus is achieved i.e. a conclusion with which all agree regarding the marks for each criterion and the accompanying comments. For most evaluation sessions, the whole evaluation takes place in Brussels. However, in a number of evaluation sessions, the individual assessments took place by remote evaluation and evaluators came to Brussels only to have the consensus meetings. Finally, a panel discussion may be convened, if necessary, to examine and compare the consensus reports and marks in a given area, to review the proposals with respect to each other and to make recommendations on a priority order and/or on possible clustering or combination of proposals. During the evaluation session, Commission staff assist the evaluators without influencing the evaluation itself. The work of an evaluator is under the supervision of the Commission officials organising the evaluation. In consensus and panel meetings Commission staff may act as moderators, seeking consensus between the independent experts, without any prejudice for or against particular proposals or the organizations involved. Evaluation sessions may be attended and analysed by an external independent observer, who examines the evaluation process from the point of view of its working and execution. The role of the observers is to give independent advice to the Commission on the conduct, fairness and equity of the evaluation sessions, ways in which the procedures could be improved, the evaluation criteria used in the sessions and the way in which the evaluators apply these criteria. The independent observer should conform to the \u201cCode of Conduct for independent observers\u201d which is appended (Annex D) to the \u201cGuidelines on proposal evaluation and selection procedures\u201d, but there is no form or structure imposed for the report they have to ",

Nevertheless, it appeared that an unofficial model for such report (dated October 2003) has been provided to independent observers as an indicative outline at least in a number of cases. Guide for evaluators and evaluation criteria The Guides for Evaluators include the following references to gender issues : \u2022 Evaluators are instructed to check the horizontal issues, among which gender, to be addressed, and to make recommendations where relevant : \u201cGender \u2013 are there any gender issues associated with the subject of the proposal and, if so, have they been adequately taken into account?\u201d However, there are no marks to be given by the evaluators to express their judgement in this respect. \u2022 Consensus reports have to contain recommendations for the negotiation phase, including e.g. in terms of gender issues : \u201cThe Consensus Report provides scores and precise comments for each block of criteria as well as overall remarks highlighting strengths and weaknesses and providing recommendations for project negotiation, including recommended levels of resources, if relevant i.e. gender, (\u2026)\u201d \u2022 The Consensus report itself contains a section under \u2018horizontal issues to be addressed \u2013 but not marked\u2019 referring to gender issues. The question to the evaluators reads as follows : \u201cAre there gender issues associated with the subject of the proposal? If so, have they been adequately taken into account?\u201d Given the very nature of the Science and Society Activity, there are per definition gender issues associated with the areas covered by the different calls, and therefore a better formulation would be : \u201cDoes the proposal adequately take into account the gender issues associated with the subject of the proposal ?\u201d The Guide for Evaluators does not suggest anywhere that gender issues can / should (also) be considered by the evaluators under specific evaluation criteria as given in the Individual Assessment Forms, e.g. when assessing \u2018S&T excellence\u2019, or when the consortium / research team is assessed. In order to realise the objectives with regard to gender issues in research, it would be recommendable to have the proposals marked on their compliance with these objectives, either by having a separate mark for \u2018gender issues\u2019 (or for the various horizontal issues together if this is not realistic), or by integrating \u2018gender\u2019 as one of the constituent elements of the various other marked evaluation criteria. Descartes Prizes The \u2018Guidance Notes for Evaluators\u2019 contains no reference whatsoever to \u2018gender\u2019 . The note specifies explicitly (p. 6) : \u201cWhen examining proposals, evaluators may only apply the evaluation criteria which are set out in the Work Programme and shown on the evaluation forms. No other factors may be taken into consideration.\u201d \u2022 For the Descartes Research Prize, the selection was made according to two criteria: \u2018scientific excellence\u2019 and \u2018European Added Value\u2019. Although generally recognised that \u2018scientific excellence\u2019 is not possible without participation of women, no reference to gender issues was made in the Individual Assessment Form for the Descartes Prize for Research under call 8 32 . Rather, this form only mentions \u2013 without further specifications - under critieron 1 \u2018Excellence and quality\u2019 : 32 As included in the \u2018Guidance Notes for Evaluators\u2019 for call 8.

Both for Calls 12 and 18, the two selection critiera remained the same, but the description of the elements comprised by them has been slightly different (more specific) \u2013 although without reference to \u2018gender\u2019. Taking into account the fact that a possible gender-bias and an underrepresentation of women in the award-winning projects was identified, it would be recommendable to include a probe on gender under the criterion of scientific excellence, both in terms of participation of women in the research team as in terms of integrating the gender dimension into the research itself. \u2022 The three crtieria used for selecting winners under the Descartes Prize for Science Communication were : \u2018Excellence and quality\u2019, referring to (for Call 8) : (cid:190) Effectiveness of the communication for the promotion of science among the public, including young people; (cid:190) Accuracy of the scientific content; \u2018Relevance and impact\u2019 : (cid:190) Effectiveness of the activity in raising the profile of science, engineering or technology among the public (cid:190) Activity\u2019s contribution to science and society objectives (cid:190) Capability of the science communication action to address the main concerns and/or expectations of the European society \u2018European Added Value\u2019 : (cid:190) Capability of the science communication action or professional to represent a model for others across Europe. Again, for Calls 12 and 18, the criteria were the same, although the description of what was covered by them was formulated slightly differently. Also in this Form, it would be recommendable to include a reference to gender, or more specifically to \u2018women\u2019, e.g. under the first probe of the \u2018excellence\u2019 criterion, stating \u201c including young people and women in particular\u201d , or under the first probe of the second criterion \u2018relevance and impact\u2019 by drawing the attention to the various target groups within the broad notion of \u2018the public\u2019. The language used in the Guides for Evaluators is gender neutral. When referring to the evaluators, the terms used are \u2018his / her\u2019 observations, readings, judgements, etc. Briefing of evaluators About the briefing of evaluators, the Guidance Notes for Evaluators states : \u201cEvaluators will be provided with a briefing by Commission staff before the evaluation begins, covering the evaluation procedure, technical issues involved in the particular strategic objective/ research objective/ research topic and the horizontal issues to be taken into consideration in the evaluation.\u201d These briefings are given orally, supported by slides, and complement the documentation provided to the evaluators in printed form 33 . 33 As mentioned above : call text, Guidance notes for evaluators, General Guidelines on Proposal Selection and Evaluation Procedures.

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 29 The Women and Science unit of the DG Research, in its Vademecum 34 , points out to the scientific officers / project officers the importance of briefing the evaluators on gender issues. The Vademecum states notably : \u201c Evaluators should receive information about 1. what we mean by gender equality 2. how gender issues link with the Work Programmes and General Provisions, as well as the general objective of the Commission 3. where gender issues do/should appear in the proposals 4. how to handle gender issues in the evaluation\u201d To ease this task of briefing evaluators about the gender issues, a slide show was prepared by the Women and Science unit and its use highly recommended. This slide show is attached to the Vademecum. Review of all evaluation reports and independent observer reports indicates that evaluation sessions indeed always started with a briefing of the evaluators. None of these reports include any specific comments in relation to a/the briefing on gender issues. In order to verify whether and how evaluators were briefed on gender issues, all call co- ordinators of the first 13 calls were asked to answer a few questions in this respect. The results of this inquiry indicated that the gender-specific slide show prepared by the Women and Science unit has not been used in any of these calls for Science and Society. However, in general, gender was mentioned during the briefing as a horizontal issue. The exceptions are the calls for the Descartes Prizes (calls 8 and 12) and for the European Science Week (call 13) where gender was not mentioned at all; and the \u2018Women and Science\u2019 calls (10 and 17) and call 6 which were gender-specific. The independent observer receives his/her briefing together with the evaluation experts, and receive no other separate briefing. Neither the briefing, the description of the role of the independent observer, nor the unofficial model for the observer\u2019s report suggest that the independent observer should verify whether and to what extent the gender dimension (and more generally all the \u2018horizontal\u2019 Science and Society issues) is understood and taken into account by the evaluators during their assessments. It would be recommendable to instruct independent observers to pay attention to the understanding of the gender dimension by the evaluators, and whether and how they deal with it during their work. Reporting on the evaluations So-called \u2018 evaluation reports \u2019 are produced by the DG Research\u2019 responsible services in which each individual evaluation session is reported upon. Review of these reports in search of gender-related issues indicates that \u2018gender\u2019 is only addressed in quantitative terms in the majority of the evaluation reports : in respect of the number of women among the evaluation experts, and in annex : the gender breakdown of co- ordinators of proposals (evaluated and retained for funding) and of participants in proposals (evaluated and retained for funding). Nevertheless, three of the four evaluation reports of the first call also mention the number of proposals submitted that address gender issues (are gender-specific), of which two specify how many of these were also retained for funding. The evaluation report of the last call (call 20) includes figures on the female participation in the call (among coordinators and 34 VADEMECUM : Gender mainstreaming in the 6th Framework Programme \u2013 Reference guide for scientific officers / project officers.

It would be useful to include such figures systematically in all evaluation reports, whereby an easy-to-handle definition of \u2018gender-specific\u2019 could be : \u201ccontaining the words \u2018gender\u2019, \u2018women\u2019 and/or \u2018men\u2019 in the title of the proposal\u201d. Furthermore, it would be recommendable to systematically mention in the evaluation report whether an independent observer was present at the evaluation session, and whether this observer was a woman or a man. Evaluation sessions are also reported upon by the independent observer (if any) who attended and assessed the evaluation session. Such \u2018independent observer report\u2019 includes a review of the evaluation process and proceedings, of the understanding and application of the evaluation criteria by the evaluators, the results of the evaluation exercise, comments on administrative and logistical issues, as well as recommendations for the future. These \u2018independent observer reports\u2019 are useful sources for tracing difficulties and areas where improvement is possible in the evaluation process. Twelve independent observer reports were reviewed by the study team 35 . There were seven different authors for these reports, of which one person had written three. Of the twelve reports : \u2022 three contain no reference to gender whatsoever, \u2022 one refers only indirectly to gender when stating that the teams doing the consensus meetings were \u2018 well composed in terms of number, age, gender, nationalities\u2019 . \u2022 five mention the gender breakdown of the evaluation experts, of which one (reviewing two sessions running in parallel) expresses concern for the high share of women among these experts (70% and 100% were women for these respective sessions), while recognising the progress made by the Commission on gender balance : \u201c As one of the targets for activity in these areas is to develop a strategy to influence policy makers (of which inevitably many are male) it may be that inviting male policy makers to take part (provided that they understood women\u2019s issues) would be beneficial.\u201d Another one (reviewing the evaluation session of call 19, which was split in two \u2018sections\u2019 with different evaluation panels) points out the gender imbalance in favour of women in one of the panels : \u201cAs far as gender is concerned, there were more women than men in this section of the call but considering both sections the overall gender balance was good.\u201d \u2022 In the report referring to call 10 \u2018Women and Science 2004\u2019 the independent observer notes some difficulties related to the fact that this had been the first call for \u2018Gender Research\u2019 : a high number of proposals was received and a very broad range of backgrounds / compentencies was required among the evaluation experts. \u2022 The report relating to call 16 \u2018Science education and careers 2005\u2019 reports on the results from a brief questionnaire that was completed by the evaluators, and mentions two important remarks about gender issues : \u201cOne female evaluator stated that in her opinion gender issues have not been properly taken into account by all evaluators \u201d and : \u201c One evaluator suggested to give all experts a better briefing or a training in gender issues \u201d . \u2022 The independent observer in the session covering the second \u2018Woman and Science\u2019 call (Call 17) notes that efforts were undertaken by the Commission to have at least one man 35 According to the information available, seventeen evaluation sessions (calls 1 to 20, whereby call 1 had 4 evaluation sessions) were attended by an independent observer. One independent observer covered two sessions that ran in parallel (fourth cut-off date of call 1, and call 6) and produced one report covering his observations of both sessions. The independent observer reports produced for call 2 and call 15 were not available. ",

The independent observer further found \u2018 that the (few) man experts were less competent\u2019. 4.2.4. Assessment by proposal evaluators Given the very nature of the \u2018Science and Society\u2019 activity, the study team considered that for all projects submitted in response to Science and Society calls gender is of relevance, and hence that this relevance had to be recognised and adequately addressed by the proposers. Evaluation experts therefore had to assess to what extent and how gender was effectively addressed. The study team analysed all the proposal abstracts 36 and on this basis identified the gender specific projects. The Evaluation Summary Reports (ESR) of all proposals that were evaluated above all thresholds as well as of gender specific projects that failed were reviewed in order to identify how gender was addressed by the evaluation experts. In total, 433 ESRs were reviewed. For all 330 proposals that passed all thresholds in the evaluation, the review of the ESR included : \u2022 whether any reference is made in the evaluation summary report to gender issues; \u2022 when gender is mentioned in the ESR, whether it concerns the content of the project and/or the participation of women and men in the project team (qualitative and/or quantitative approach to gender); \u2022 whether the absence of any reference to gender in proposals is identified by the evaluators and whether this was held against the project. For 103 gender specific projects that failed 37 , the study team looked into the reasons for failing, and which were the assessment criteria that were considered as insufficiently fulfilled by the evaluators. Proposals evaluated above all thresholds (330 proposals) More than half of the ESRs (62 %) do not mention gender at all, suggesting that evaluators ignored the gender question. Even in cases where there are very obvious gender issues associated with the project, ESRs did not refer to gender. One project with 13 partners (of which 5 had female project responsibles) that got approved for financing (under call 14) aims to design a bioethical university education programme addressing as three main topics \u2018beginning of life\u2019, \u2018organ transplantation\u2019 and \u2018the end of life\u2019, and claims it will take a multicultural, multidisciplinary and multireligious approach. The ESR does not make any reference to the gender issues associated with the research subject. A project (funded under call 7) with an all-male project team (8 partners) aims to introduce the European youth in the world of science and technology by engaging school and university students and young science amateurs in innovative multidisciplinary \u2018Science Games\u2019. No reference to gender is made in the ESR of this proposal. 36 All 20 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 calls, excluding the Descartes Prize calls. 37 From 13 calls, including the two \u2018Women and Science\u2019 calls.

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 32 Among the 330 proposals passing all thresholds, 80 were gender specific - 59 of them submitted under the \u2018Women and Science\u2019 calls (call 10 and call 17). Even five ESRs of these gender specific proposals contained no reference to gender whatsoever. Of the 330 Evaluation Summary Reports of proposals that passed all thresholds, 126 (38 %) contain references to gender. Nearly half of these (45 %) are from proposals submitted in response to the two \u2018Women and Science\u2019 calls (calls 10 and 17). When filtering out the Women and Science calls, only 26 % of the ESRs from the other calls contain a reference to gender (while 95 % of the ESRs from the Women and Science calls did, quite logically, contain references to gender). Such remarks either referred to the participation of women in the project, to the research contents, or to both aspects. The vast majority (111, or 87 %) of the ESRs that refer to gender deal with the gender dimension in the research contents. The female participation in the project was referred to in 44 ESRs (35 % of those ESRs containing a reference on gender). Interesting to note is that in 17 cases where the ESR refers to gender in the research contents, a quantitative approach is taken to gender (looking at numbers of women as research objects or as target audiences). When ESRs contain a reference on gender, such statements are in about half the cases saying something positive or neutral (55 %). In a quarter of the cases containing a reference on gender, evaluators merely make a neutral observation. Nearly all of these were praising statements or simply recognitions that gender was addressed in the content of the project. About one third of them also recognised the participation of women in the project team. Some examples of such comments are : \u201cThe proposal gives great attention to the gender dimension.\u201d \u201cThe proposal also takes into consideration gender aspects which are well integrated in the proposed activities.\u201d \u201cThere is a high rate of participation of women, and in central positions.\u201d Only in 48 ESRs (38 % of those ESRs containing a reference to gender, or 15 % of all ESRs of proposals evaluated above all thresholds), critical remarks were given; sometimes following praising statements. 30% of these critical remarks were given in ESRs of proposals submitted under the \u2018Women and Science\u2019 calls (calls 10 and 17). This low occurrence of critical statements reflects an apparent uncertainty and lack of capacity of the expert evaluators with regard to the assessment of gender issues, rather than the true quality of the proposals in respect of how gender is addressed. A project approved for financing (under call 16) aiming to design and develop ICT- enhanced training modules on Material Properties for 10-15 year olds fails to address the gender issues associated with the project. The proposal receives an impressive 24 (out of 25) score, and the evaluators only point out under the overall remarks in the ESR that \u201cthe application would be even stronger if there was specific consideration of gender issues\u201d. Another (all-male) project approved for funding under call 14 deals with understanding of the ethical issues posed by emerging nanotechnologies and is completely gender-blind. The ESR states under the general comments :\u201cAs gender issues are relevant for the topics addressed it would be helpful to involve women in the consortium as well (all participants are male).\u201d Under the evaluation criterion ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 33 \u2018quality of the management\u2019, the ESR also points out that \u201cgender issues are not mentioned in the proposal\u201d. Critical remarks often identified specific areas in the research content where gender was not or insufficiently addressed (34 ESRs). A project receiving financing (under call 1) aims to develop capacity in clinical research ethics review in developing countries. The proposal poorly addresses the gender issues associated with the project, and this is identified by the evaluators. The ESR states : \u201cThe gender issue is poorly addressed since it is clear women are not only victims and or care givers to children, but are also key stones in progression of prevention ideas and organisation .The only quoted item in the proposal is to pay attention to the rate of female participation in the workshops. More attention has to be given to the qualitative aspects in the construction of the search for participating organisations, and to capacity building, since several attempts based only on medical bodies branches were again and again destroyed by the high turn over of responsibilities and professionals.\u201d Relating to a proposal for setting up and running a citizens\u2019 panel on brain science (also under call 1), the ESR states : \u201cGender issues should be given more consideration (female behaviour in debate situations but also the socalled \u2018female brain\u2019).\u201d In six cases, the ESR stated that gender issues were not addressed in the proposal. Another five ESRs mentioned that gender was poorly addressed. These account together for 8 % of the ESRs that refer to gender. Gender specific projects that failed (103 proposals) Under the reviewed calls, there were 103 gender specific projects that failed one or more thresholds and which were hence rejected. 64 of them were submitted under the \u2018Women and Science\u2019 calls (calls 10 and 17). \u2192 Main conclusions : (cid:190) A majority of the ESRs do not make any reference to gender, suggesting that evaluators often ignored the gender dimension despite the evident gender relevance of projects within the Science and Society activity area. (cid:190) The vast majority of remarks relating to gender deal with the gender dimension in the research contents. (cid:190) A high proportion of statements concerning gender in ESRs say something positive or merely make a \u2018neutral\u2019 observation. (cid:190) Only a minority of ESRs contain a critical remark concerning gender and / or the identification of specific areas where gender was not or insufficiently addressed in the research proposal. It is however positive that such ESRs making critical comments regarding gender identify areas for improvement, which allows to take up these points during contract negotiations. (cid:190) Overall, the ESRs reflect evaluators\u2019 uncertainty and suggest a lack of capacity among the evaluators to make a proper assessement of gender in the project proposal (participation of women, equal opportunities, integration of the gender dimension in the research contents).

Of the 103 rejected gender specific projects, 92 (or 89 %) did contain references to gender in the ESR, nearly all (90 out of the 92) referring to the research contents, while 19 (also) referred to the participation of women in the project team. In 57 cases (62 %), these were negative comments, while only 29 ESRs contained a positive comment in relation to gender. Negative comments generally criticised the project for its weaknesses in properly addressing the gender issues, which ought to be the focus of the project, it being gender-specific. In 45 cases (44 % of these rejected proposals), the expert evaluators identified specific areas where gender was not or improperly addressed in the project proposal. The ESR of a proposal submitted under call 17 states :\u201cThe project does not wholly address the objectives of the Call, as it addresses entrepreneurship in a general sense, and not with a focus on women in science.\u201d This result suggests that these rejected gender specific projects lacked quality in the research contents proposed, thus making them inapt for being selected for funding. Another important reason for the rejection of gender-specific proposals has been that results of previously done work or previous research is not being taken into account. Under call 16, for example, the ESR of a gender-specific proposals states : \u201cThe main weakness of the proposal is the fact that it does not respect already accomplished work in this area on the European level\u201d In other cases, the expert evaluators pointed out that the project team was inadequately composed in order to successfully realise the proposed project. \u201cThe consortiums\u2019 previous experience in the field of European research and women in science is not apparent\u201d (call 17) On average, two thirds of the rejected gender-specific proposals failed on more than one of the evaluation criteria or obtained an total evaluation mark below the overall threshold. 4.2.5. Science and Society Reporting All FP6 project holders (coordinators) are expected to complete an online questionnaire about the \u2018Science and Society\u2019 issues in their project. This \u2018Science and Society Reporting Questionnaire\u2019 covers the following issues : \u2018ethics\u2019; \u2018gender;\u2019 \u2018science education, training and career development\u2019; \u2018engaging with actors beyond the research community\u2019, and \u2018use and dissemination\u2019. The section on \u2018gender\u2019 only needs to be completed for CAs, SSAs and STREPS because the IPs and NoEs have to report separately on the implementation of their Gender Action Plan by means of an online GAP Implementation Report. \u2192 Main conclusion : These gender-specific projects were fairly evaluated. No bias against them could be found. ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 35 As the Science and Society activity area does not have IPs and NoEs, all projects funded under this area should complete the \u2018Science and Society Reporting Questionnaire\u2019 including the section relating to \u2018gender\u2019. By May 2007, only for 13 projects the \u2018Science and Society Reporting Questionnaire\u2019 was available in SESAM. This very low number raises some questions : on the useability of SESAM as well as on the use made of these reports by the European Commission. It seems as if there is nobody in the Commission who monitors the extent to which project holders respect this reporting obligation as well as the actual information provided through these reports. The study team found these questionnaires not useful for analysing the state of play within these projects as regards gender, for two main reasons : - the questionnaire design, with essentially closed \u2018yes/no\u2019 questions, does not allow a true insight into the reality of these projects. Ideally, such questionnaires should allow the identification of difficulties, success factors or key issues; - these questionaires in general, and the section on gender in particular, have been completed and responses provided by project holders in a very brief, mostly superficial way. \u2192 Main conclusion : If project holders are expected to invest time and efforts in reporting, which in itself is a legitimate demand from the part of the Commission, the tools provided should be both user- friendly and allowing an effective exploitation of the reporting results. However, this is not enough : the Commission also has the duty to check and monitor the reporting by the project holders. ",

The gender dimension in selected Science and Society projects This section reports on the findings from the review of a sample of projects financed under the total of twenty calls of Science and Society (excluding the Descartes calls). A total of 152 contracts were signed resulting from these calls. Of these, the technical annexes to the contracts of 75 projects 38 , selected through stratified random sampling, were analysed (49% of the selected proposals) following a standard review format. To do this analysis, the technical annex served as a basis. This information was compared with the ESR analysis performed. Of the sample of 75 projects, 19 (25%) are \u2018gender specific\u2019, all others are gender relevant. The share of gender specific projects in the sample is higher than in the total of approved projects : of the 152 projects approved under Science and Society, 31 (or 20%) are gender specific.

Promotion of female participation and equal opportunities Projects coordinated by women are more likely to take measures to ensure attention for gender and equal participation. They do however less often foresee gender expertise in the team, probably because they consider it sufficiently covered by the rate of female participation. A little more than 4 out of 5 projects mention gender as a relevant factor in their proposal (63 out of 75). The table below gives the split by research area. This proportion is almost 4 out of 5 for the gender relevant projects (44 / 56).

Our conclusion based on this small sample is that a female coordinator of a gender relevant proposal is not necessarily more likely to address gender issues in the proposal. Gender issues are mentioned in 2 out of 5 ESRs for the projects analysed. The table below shows that gender is more likely to be mentioned in the ESR if the issue is covered in the proposal. The 2 projects where gender is mentioned in the ESR and not in the proposal are cases where the evaluators identified the necessity to better cover gender in the proposal. Table 4.15 Gender mentioned in the ESR and in the proposal (N=75) Mentioned ESR yes Mentioned ESR no Mentioned in proposal \u2013 yes 28 35 Mentioned in proposal \u2013 no 2 10 Male/female balance in the team As mentioned above, 37 % of the projects have a female coordinator. This high number is biased by the \u2018Women in Science\u2019 projects, of which 13 out of 16 are led by women. Only 1 out of 3 project teams have a good male/female balance. This proportion is the same for gender relevant and gender specific projects. For gender specific projects this is because of nearly all female teams; for gender relevant projects, this is because of a dominance of male participants. When looking at the instruments, the CA have a better balance than other instruments (1 out of 2 have a good balance). Projects with a female coordinator are more likely to have a good gender balance: of the gender relevant projects, 40% with a woman as leader have a good balance against 29 % of those with a male leader. Of the gender specific projects led by women only 23% shows a good balance as these teams are often being nearly exclusively composed of women; whereas those few gender specific projects led by men (6 projects) tend to have a better gender balance. Availability of gender expertise in the team 40 % of the projects have gender expertise available in the research team. This is logically 100 % for the gender specific research projects, and 23 % for gender relevant projects. When looking at the type of instruments (only for the gender relevant projects), the CA appears as the instrument where gender expertise is more likely to be included in the team: 47 % of the projects compared to 17 % for Strep and 29% for SSAs. Regarding the sex of the coordinator, women coordinators of gender relevant projects in this sample are more likely to have foreseen gender expertise than the male coordinators (14 out of 28 compared with 16 out of 47 male). Measures taken in the team to ensure attention for gender issues Nearly half (49 %) of the projects foresee measures to deal with gender equality in the team structure. This includes all gender specific projects, as well as 32% of the gender relevant projects. Of those gender relevant projects ensuring gender equality in the team structure, most do so either by proposing the set up of a work package dealing specifically with gender issues, or including the monitoring of gender issues to one of the proposed work packages.

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 39 In the former case where one work package deals specifically with gender issues, it can be expected that gender issues will indeed be taken into account. One gender relevant project (call 5) aims at raising interest and improving public understanding of science among the young generation. It has six work packages, one of which is conceived as \u201ca horizontal topic affecting other work packages like content production and school related events.\u201d In the latter case, however, when gender issues are only part of the objectives of one of the work packages, it is questionable whether gender issues will indeed be of high relevance, or whether this is being introduced as a mere lip service. One gender relevant project (call 1) focuses on biomedics from a socio-cultural, governance and ethical point of view. It proposes 9 work packages with one work package generally dedicated to the realisation of focus groups. This work package will inter alia deal with the \u201cdevelopment of contents for focus groups concerning biomedicine and body concepts, religion, gender and their influences on identity and health-concepts.\u201d Another gender relevant project (call 1) aims at promoting research and public debate on biometric identification technologies. Its first of seven work packages will ensure the overall coordination of the project, including overseeing the promotion of gender equality throughout the project. However, it will also focus on eight other objectives, such as coordination of technical activities, knowledge management, financial security, establishing and maintaining the project website, etc\u2026 A gender relevant project from call 13 in the area of Science Communication through events states in one WP, which consists of the development of guidelines and a manual for the participants in the project, that all project activities \u201cwill meet high ethics and gender standards\u201d. However, there are no specifications whatsoever in the proposal on how the project will address the gender dimension and implement these intentions. A minority (3 out of 18) of the gender relevant projects ensuring gender equality in the team structure do so by appointing women to senior positions within the projects (e.g. in the steering committee). A gender relevant project (call 14) has appointed a Gender Equality Manager and attention will also be given to women\u2019s presence and participation during the project. Expertise on gender issues is also present among team members. For the gender relevant projects: STREPs score slightly higher than the two other instruments and projects with women as coordinator are much more often taking measures (63 % against 28 % for male). Measures taken to promote equal participation Only 8 % of the projects include organisations that have foreseen measures to deal with equal participation, i.e. organisations with gender-specific activities or organisations that have units that occupy themselves with gender issues, regardless of whether or not the proposed project will be approved. One gender relevant project (call 7) is submitted by a consortium of organisations.

Its members will be invited to give suggestions on a regular basis and specific moments of interactions are foreseen. The gender specific projects score slightly better as 3 of the 6 projects that took measures are gender specific. 4.3.2. The gender dimension in the research content Our team categorised all projects based on how gender is addressed. This is a conclusive categorisation. Table 4.16 Categorisation of projects based on how gender is addressed (N=75) No. of projects % of total Gender is relevant and mentioned, but not addressed 29 39% Gender integrated 19 25% Gender specific 19 25% Gender blind 6 8% Gender not mentioned, but only indirectly relevant 2 3% The table above gives the categorisation for the full sample. When the gender specific projects are excluded, it appears that 1 out of 3 projects have been categorised as \u201cgender integrated\u201d. This is a high score. The proportion of gender blind projects is very low with only 6 projects in that category. As all projects in S&S are considered as gender relevant, it is not surprising that the team categorised only 2 projects under the group \u201cgender not mentioned but only indirectly relevant\u201d. In half of the gender relevant projects, gender is assessed as \u2018mentioned but not addressed\u2019. This is the group where improvements can probably be achieved with the smallest effort. Transforming part of this group into gender integrated projects should be feasible with appropriate measures. All projects categorised as gender blind and those where gender is not mentioned are SSAs. Nearly half of the gender integrated projects is coordinated by a woman, whereas the share of female coordinators in the total sample of projects is significantly lower (37%). Two of the gender blind projects are coordinated by a woman. Approach taken to the gender dimension Our team analysed how gender is understood and treated in the project proposals (as included in the technical annexes to the contract). Six different approaches were defined. These categories partly overlap : \u2022 Sex disaggregation in figures (quantitative or statistical approach) \u2022 Acknowledgement of specific characteristics or requirements of women, therefore of specific issues to be addressed in the research. \u2022 Recognition of gender differences in roles and responsibilities which might be inter- related (gender relations). \u2022 Recognition of inequalities. \u2022 Recognition of gendered structures, systems and/or gendered constructs.

One gender relevant project proposal (call 5) claims that women need role models in science and states that \u201cTaking into account the gender-specific popularisation of science, girls must be addressed differently by discussing the reasons for the relatively low female participation in science in the past und present, as well as presenting \u201cpositive\u201d and stimulating female role-models.\u201d One gender relevant project (call 4) investigates the issue of the incorporation of ethics in S&T policy in terms of the methodologies used and their actual impact in decision making. The proposer states that \u201cgender is undisputedly a main differentiating factor in identifying the content and direction of ethical considerations.\u201d A gender relevant project from call 19 explores the role of Civil Society Organisations as actors in the European system of research and innovation. The proposal states (in a footnote) that there are differences in health diagnosis and ",

One gender relevant project (call 5, same as mentioned above) states that \u201cAlthough the lack of women in scientific institutions is increasingly criticised by the official authorities, although there have been broad initiatives to encourage girls to engage with traditionally \u201cmale\u201d domains, the methods of doing so have failed drastically.\u201d Nowhere in the proposal are statistics given on the lack of women in scientific institutions. One gender relevant project proposal (call 4, same as mentioned above) talks about the under-representation of women as subjects, researchers and at the higher echelons of decision-making, claiming that these three forms of under- representation raise serious ethical questions about gender justice and are linked. It then goes on to explain this link. \u2022 The proportion of projects that recognise the existence of gendered structures, systems and/or constructs is 9% of projects, and 10 % when excluding the projects that were considered gender blind or where gender is only indirectly relevant. Overall, the first calls issued under Science and Society contained more projects where gendered structures, systems and/or contstructs were identified, while in the calls 13 to 20 no gender relevant projects were found that recognise the existence of gendered structures, systems and/or constructs. One gender relevant project proposal (call 4, same as mentioned above) states that \u201cIt has been said that \u2018medical treatments for women are based on a male model, regardless of the fact that women may react differently to treatments than men or that some diseases manifest themselves differently in women than in men.\u201d Furthermore, the proposal claims that men and women look at science in a different way. One gender relevant project proposal (call 5, different as the one stated above) claims that the choice of education is gendered, as \u201cparents choose different types of education for their children according to whether the child is a boy or girl.\u201d Integration of gender in the project design As for the approach taken to gender, proposals were analysed with regard to project design. This analysis looks at different components of the project design and indicates whether gender is mentioned or taken into account in: the abstract of the proposal, the inputs (human, documentation, \u2026) the project activities, the expected outputs (results, findings) and in the intended impacts. Only a minority of gender relevant projects integrate gender in their project design. Of those who treat gender in their proposal (79%), 9 out of 10 have foreseen actions in their activities, while half of these have foreseen inputs and only one fourth describes outputs. This subject is not relevant for the gender specific projects which have by definition integrated gender in their project design and score almost 100 % positively on all these aspects. The chart below gives the results for the 56 gender relevant projects in the sample. ",

This is the case for 41 projects out of the 56, which corresponds to the share of projects that treat gender in their proposal. It is on other aspects of the design that results are lower, which is a sign of lack of real integration of gender, and illustrates the risk that activities are not really integrated in the project. Still, 11 of these 56 projects or nearly one in five have taken the gender dimension into account in the description of their intended impacts. Of the 19 gender relevant projects of which our team considers that they are \u2018gender integrated\u2019, still 11 of them did not integrate gender in the description of their intended impacts.

Participation of women in projects a) Sex of co-ordinators of projects There have been two calls for Priority 7, each consisting of three parts. In total, 787 proposals have been submitted under these two calls for Priority 7. Of these, 27 % were co-ordinated by a woman. The highest share of female co-ordinators was reached under the second call. Both for the second stage of CIT4 and for CIT6, the share of female coordinators reached 38 %. These figures remain significantly below the average share of women among PhD graduates in 2003 in the EU25 in the fields of \u2018Humanities and Arts\u2019 (51.4%) and of \u2018Social Sciences, Business and Law\u2019 (43.1%). 42 Table 5.2 Key figures for call 1 of \u2018Priority 7\u2019 Total CIT-1 CIT-2 CIT-3 Total Call 1 CIT- 4 43 CIT-5 CIT-6 Total Call 2 Number of proposals submitted 787 64 194 182 440 34 281 32 347 Female coordinators in submitted proposals (%) 208 (27%) 13 (20%) 60 (31%) 39 (22%) 112 (25%) 13 (38%) 71 (25%) 12 (38%) 96 (28%) Number of contracts signed 140 5 39 15 59 14 52 15 81 Number of contracts signed, with female co-ordinator 40 (29%) 2 (40%) 12 (32%) 3 (27%) 17 (29%) 4 (29%) 13 (25%) 6 (40%) 23 (28%) These figures show that the share of female co-ordinators among the successful proposals is 29%, just slightly higher than the initial 27% among the submitted proposals. This leads to the conclusion that female co-ordinators have been slightly more successful than men under these Priority 7 calls 44 . The share of female co-ordinators among the signed contracts is highest for CIT1 and CIT6 (40%), whereas they accounted for only 20% among the proposals submitted under CIT1. Success rates were calculated for women and men coordinators, considering all proposals which resulted in signed contracts as a basis. These success rates were calculated overall, per part of the call and per instrument 45 . Across Priority 7, the success rate of female co- ordinators has been 19% and of men 17%. 42 European Commission, DG Research (2006), She Figures 2006 , Women and Science Statistics and Indicators, Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities. 43 Only in stage 2. 44 It should be pointed out that these figures need to be interpreted with care because absolute numbers are relatively low. 45 For STREPS and CAs, the success rates could only be calculated for the first call (CIT2), as the data necessary to calculate the success rates per instrument for the second call of Priority 7 (CIT5) were not obtained.

It is however impossible to draw conclusions from this observation, not only because the data obtained has been incomplete (for STREPS and CAs, the success rates could only be calculated for the first call of Priority 7 as the necessary data relating to CIT5 was missing), but also because the absolute numbers underlying these figures are relatively small.

This share is relatively consistent across the three parts of call 1, as well as for CIT5 and CIT6. However, the share of women participating in proposals under CIT4 is significantly higher. This can be explained by the fact that the CIT4 call included for the first time a gender specific topic for IPs and NoEs (7.1.2 \u2018Gender and Citizenship in a multicultural Europe\u2019 47 ) in response to which large gender studies consortia submitted proposals. 46 Only in stage 2. 47 Cfr. the Priority 7 Work Programme 2004-2006 ",

Conception and management of Priority 7 5.2.1. The Work Programme for Priority 7 Framework Programme 6 has three main blocks of activities, in which block 1 \u2018Integrating and Strengthening the European Research Area\u2019 contains seven Priority Thematic Areas. \u2018Citizens and governance in a knowledge-based society\u2019 is the 7 th Priority of these thematic areas. The work programme of the thematic area \u2018Citizens and governance in a knowledge-based society\u2019 (Priority 7) is the key reference document for (potential) project proposers, indicating the eligible research areas and guiding the conception and design of projects. It lays out the objectives, structure and overall approach followed for this thematic area; demarcates the eligible research topics; presents the implementation plan for Priority 7 and gives the information for the individual calls planned under Priority 7, including the evaluation criteria that will be used for the evaluation of proposals. This work programme has been reviewed to verify whether this document reflects the Community policy in relation to gender equality in how the objectives and themes of Priority 7 are formulated. In the chapter devoted to the \u2018objectives, structure and approach\u2019 for Priroity 7, there is no reference to the gender dimension in the work programme, although the main objective is \u201c to mobilise in a coherent effort, in all their wealth and diversity, European research capacities in economic, political, social sciences and humanities that are necessary to develop an understanding of, and to address issues related to, the emergence of the knowledge-based society and new forms of relationships between its citizens, on one hand, and between its citizens and institutions, on the other.\u201d 48 The technical descriptions of the eight research areas and their research topics eligible for funding, however, do contain references to the gender dimension. Notably in research topics 2.1.1, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 3.2.1, 4.1.1, 6.1.1, 6.2.2, 6.2.3, and 7.2.1 include such references. More specifically, the work programme asks to include in the analyses \u2018gender aspects\u2019, \u2018gender perspectives\u2019 and \u2018gender roles\u2019, or also \u2018gendered approaches\u2019 to the subject of the research (e.g. democracy). Topic 7.1.2 explicitly addresses gender as a research topic : \u2018Gender and citizenship in a multi-cultural context\u2019. Annex 1 of the work programme contains a \u2018General Introduction to the Workprogramme of the Specific Programme \u201cIntegrating and strengthening the European Research Area\u201d\u2019. It explains the horizontal issues of concern, among which gender equality : \u201c This work programme attempts, where possible, to reinforce and increase the place and role of women in science and research both from the perspective of equal opportunities and gender relevance of the topics covered .\u201d The work programme also sets out the evaluation criteria against which the proposals are assessed.

If so, have they been adequately taken into account?\u201d Only for the evaluation of NoEs, one of the marked criteria \u2018organisation and management\u2019 contains the specific probe on whether there is a well-considered plan for promoting gender equality in the network. 5.2.2. Call for proposals and Guides for Proposers The call for proposals contains the standard statement, which has the purpose to encourage women to participate in FP6 : \u201c The European Community has adopted an equal opportunities policy and, on this basis, women are particularly encouraged to either submit proposals for indirect RTD actions or participate in the submission of proposals for indirect RTD actions.\u201d No other reference to \u2018women\u2019 or \u2018gender\u2019 is made in this call. The Guide for Proposers is the main document containing the instructions to proposers on how their proposal should be presented and how the Proposal Form should be completed. These Guides were reviewed in order to verify whether the proposers were given sufficient guidance as to what was expected from them as regards gender issues, both in terms of their research and the team, as in terms of how this should be presented in the proposal. The Guides for Proposers for the first call under Priority 7 contain a section \u2018Key recommendations for submitting a proposal to priority 7\u2019, which draws the attention i.a. to the importance of gender issues. It instructs proposers to clearly indicate the way in which these issues are taken into account and states that \u201cthe gender dimension is of particular relevance to the research topics addressed in Priority 7\u201d. Furthermore, the Guides for Proposers explicitly mention as example under consortium management activities the \u2018 overseeing the promotion of gender equality in the project\u2019 . Section B.10 of the proposal form is devoted to gender issues, and proposers are instructed to include in this section their Gender Action Plan (for the Integrated Projects and Networks of Excellence only), and to point out how they take into account gender issues associated with their research, if any. This is phrased as follows in the Guide : \u201c If there are gender issues associated with the subject of the proposal, show they have been adequately taken into account\u201d. This seems to imply that gender issues are not related to the other elements of the research project to be proposed : relevance to the objectives of Priority 7 (section B.2), potential impact (section B.3), the consortium (B.5) and project resources (B.7). Furthermore, the way in which this instruction is phrased (\u2018 If \u2026\u2019) seems to deny that for Priority 7, there are per definition gender issues associated with the research. A better formulation would be : \u201cClearly indicate how the proposal adequately takes into account the gender issues associated with the subject of the proposal.\u201d As an annex, the Guide for Proposers contains the standard document \u2018Integrating the gender dimension in FP6 projects\u2019 which clearly explains the legal base for gender equality, the threefold relationship between women and research, and a list of examples of how gender difference or gender-specific needs can be relevant for research. However, for Integrated Projects (IP) and Networks of Excellence (NoE), the two new instruments under the FP6, this document explains also what is expected from the part of the proposers as regards the Gender Action Plan they have to include in their proposal. The language used in the Guides for Proposers is gender-neutral. The reader is addressed directly, using the second person form (\u2018you\u2019, \u2018your\u2019) and thus avoiding systematically mentioning \u2018he / she\u2019 or \u2018his / her\u2019.

Provisions for the proposal evaluation and selection Evaluation procedures The evaluation and selection of proposals is carried out by the Commission with the assistance of independent experts. These evaluators are selected by the Commission, whereby a balance is sought between the various competencies required for evaluating the proposals submitted for the various areas covered by the respective call, sex, nationality, etc. They are expected to be independent, impartial and objective, and to behave throughout in a professional manner. They conform to the \u201cCode of Conduct for independent experts appointed as evaluators\u201d which is appended to the \u201cGuidelines on proposal evaluation and selection procedures\u201d and must sign a confidentiality and conflict of interest declaration prior to beginning their work. Before starting their work, the evaluators are briefed by the responsible Commission staff on the various elements related with their evaluation work, including on the evaluation criteria. They also receive the call-specific documents published by the Commission, including the Guidance Notes for Evaluators, and the general Guidelines on Proposal Evaluation and Selection Procedures. Evaluators first individually assess the proposals according to a set of pre-defined criteria which are different according to the type of instrument. Evaluators examine the individual issues comprised in each block of evaluation criteria and mark the blocks on a six-point scale from 0 to 5 (whereby 0 stands for \u2018the proposal fails to address the issue under examination or can not be judged against the criterion due to missing or incomplete information\u2019, 1 \u2013 \u2018poor\u2019, 2 - \u2018fair\u2019, 3 \u2013 \u2018good\u2019, 4 \u2013 \u2018very good\u2019, and 5 \u2013 \u2018excellent\u2019). Subsequently the evaluators discuss their individual judgements in consensus meetings. The discussion of the proposal will continue until a consensus is achieved i.e. a conclusion with which all agree regarding the marks for each criterion and the accompanying comments. Finally, a panel discussion may be convened, if necessary, to examine and compare the consensus reports and marks in a given area, to review the proposals with respect to each other and to make recommendations on a priority order and/or on possible clustering or combination of proposals. During the evaluation session, Commission staff assist the evaluators without influencing the evaluation itself. The work of an evaluator is under the supervision of the Commission officials organising the evaluation. In consensus and panel meetings Commission staff act as moderators, seeking consensus between the independent experts, without any prejudice for or against particular proposals or the organizations involved. Evaluation sessions may be attended and analysed by an external independent observer, who examine the evaluation process from the point of view of its working and execution. The role of the observers is to give independent advice to the Commission on the conduct, fairness and equity of the evaluation sessions, ways in which the procedures could be improved, the evaluation criteria used in the sessions and the way in which the evaluators apply these criteria. Guidance Notes for Evaluators The Guidance Notes for Evaluators, which is a generic document for all the Priorities of FP7, include the following references to gender issues : ",

The question to the evaluators reads as follows : \u201cAre there gender issues associated with the subject of the proposal? If so, have they been adequately taken into account?\u201d Given the intrinsic relevance of the gender dimension to the different topics of Priority 7, a better formulation would here be : \u201cDoes the proposal adequately take into account the gender issues associated with the subject of the proposal ?\u201d However, under FP6, it has not been possible to tailor individual assessment forms to better suit the purposes and nature of the Priorities. These forms are generic and applied across the FP6 to all Priorities. \u2022 The Consensus Report (for IP, NoE, STREP, CA) contains a section \u2018overall remarks\u2019, \u201c highlighting strengths and weaknesses and providing recommendations for project negotiation, including recommended levels of resources, if relevant. Include comments on the horizontal issues addressed in the evaluation i.e. gender, safety, public outreach, education.\u201d \u2022 For Networks of Excellence, the Individual Assessment Form contains under block 5 \u2018Organisation and management\u2019, which is to be marked, the following element to be assessed : \u201cthe extent to which there is a well-considered plan for promoting gender equality in the network\u201d . The Guide for Evaluators does not suggest anywhere that gender issues can / should (also) be considered by the evaluators under specific evaluation criteria as given in the Individual Assessment Forms, e.g. when assessing \u2018S&T excellence\u2019, or when the consortium / research team is assessed. In order to realise the objectives with regard to gender issues in research, it would be recommendable to have the proposals marked on their compliance with these objectives, either by having a separate mark for \u2018gender issues\u2019 (or for the various horizontal issues together if this is not realistic), or by integrating \u2018gender\u2019 as one of the constituent elements of the various other marked evaluation criteria (as is partially done in the Individual Assessment Form for NoE where the Gender Action Plan is to be taken into account in one of the marks given. Briefing to proposal evaluators About the briefing of evaluators, the Guidance Notes for Evaluators states : \u201cEvaluators will be provided with a briefing by Commission staff before the evaluation begins, covering the evaluation procedure, technical issues involved in the particular strategic objective/ research objective/ research topic and the horizontal issues to be taken into consideration in the evaluation.\u201d These briefings are given orally, supported by slides, and complement the documentation provided to the evaluators in printed form 49 . 49 As mentioned above : call text, Guidance notes for evaluators, General Guidelines on Proposal Selection and Evaluation Procedures.

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 54 The Women and Science unit of the DG Research, in its Vademecum 50 , points out to the scientific officers / project officers the importance of briefing the evaluators on gender issues. The Vademecum states notably : \u201c Evaluators should receive information about 1. what we mean by gender equality 2. how gender issues link with the Work Programmes and General Provisions, as well as the general objective of the Commission 3. where gender issues do/should appear in the proposals 4. how to handle gender issues in the evaluation\u201d To ease this task of briefing evaluators about the gender issues, a slide show was prepared by the Women and Science unit and its use highly recommended. This slide show is attached to the Vademecum. Review of all evaluation reports and independent observer reports indicates that evaluation sessions indeed always started with a briefing of the evaluators. None of these reports include any specific comments in relation to a/the briefing on gender issues. It has been checked whether the slide show prepared by the Women and Science unit had been used for briefing expert evaluators. It appeared that it had not been shown. The reason given for this is that the evaluators\u2019 briefing must be kept short and that the slide show of the Women and Science unit is considered too long. However, gender was effectively included in the evaluators\u2019 briefing, and its importance and elements to pay attention to during the evaluation were pointed out. The slide show of the Womand and Science unit had been used when preparing slides for these briefings. Below is an extract of the slide show presented to the evaluators of CIT4, CIT5 and CIT6 : Promote gender equality in research: (cid:190) aim at approx. equal participation of men and women in the project and in project management; encourage participation of young women (cid:190) research must address women\u2019s needs as much as men\u2019s needs (cid:190) research must be carried out to contribute to enhanced understanding of gender issues In addition, each Scientific Officer responsible for an evaluation panel was advised to address the issue in the panel-specific briefings. Reporting on the evaluations So-called \u2018 evaluation reports \u2019 are produced by the DG Research\u2019 responsible services in which each individual evaluation session is reported upon. Review of the reports of CIT1, CIT2 and CIT3 51 in search for gender-related issues indicates that \u2018gender\u2019 is only addressed in quantitative terms : in respect of the number of women among the evaluation experts and among the participants in proposals (evaluated and ranked list). The gender breakdown of co- ordinators of proposals was only included in the evaluation report of CIT3, while missing in CIT1 and CIT2. No qualitative references are made in relation to gender. The evaluation reports do not mention the number of proposals received or retained for funding that are gender-specific. Neither are comments made on the quality of the Gender Action Plans contained in the proposals (although these GAPs are new in FP6, as introduced with the new instruments). 50 VADEMECUM : Gender mainstreaming in the 6th Framework Programme \u2013 Reference guide for scientific officers / project officers.

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 55 Evaluation sessions are also reported upon by the independent observer who attended and assessed the evaluation session. Such \u2018independent observer report\u2019 includes a review of the evaluation process and proceedings, of the understanding and application of the evaluation criteria by the evaluators, the results of the evaluation exercise, comments on administrative and logistical issues, as well as recommendations for the future. These \u2018independent observer reports\u2019 are useful sources for tracing difficulties and areas where improvement is possible in the evaluation process. The independent observer reports from the two evaluation sessions 52 organised for the first \u2018Priority 7\u2019 call (CIT1, CIT2 and CIT3), as well as those of the two sessions 53 for the second call (CIT4, CIT5, CIT6) were reviewed. This analysis indicated that one of the independent observers (a woman) adequately and responsibly monitored how gender was treated during the evaluations, and did point out areas of concern. The other independent observers (two men and one woman) made only a general statement in relation to gender or to the sex of the evaluators. (cid:131) The independent observer of the evaluation exercise relating to CIT1 and CIT2 makes important comments in her report with regard to the treatment of gender issues in the evaluation. The observer notes (on page 8) : \u201c Another issue of concern is the extent to which important issues relating to gender and relevance to EU priorities are being given proper consideration in proposals. How can evaluators judge this? There is a tendency for proposers to just include the right key words to show that they are covering these issues. However, the extent to which these issues are properly worked into the overall project approach is not always so clear. A number of the Panel Meeting Reports propose more detailed application forms and guidance notes to ensure that key information for easy reference and proper evaluation of the proposals is provided by proposers in the appropriate format. These proposals should be given due consideration since they provide the means for improving proposal submission and related evaluation processes, particularly in the case of the new instruments.\u201d As a recommendation, the independent observer states (p.14) : \u201c An assessment of whether proper attention is being given to issues related to gender and relevance to EU priorities, is not an easy task for evaluators and more attention needs to be given to ensuring that these issues are not merely included as lip-service in proposals but that they are comprehensively treated throughout the proposal. The proposal template could be re- designed accordingly to move away from mere use of keywords to an appropriate inclusion/coverage of these issues in approach, dissemination and quality of the consortium .\u201d (cid:131) The independent observer of the evaluation exercise relating to CIT3 simply mentions in his report that \u201c during the different phases of the evaluation process the gender issue in the proposals was dealt with in a consistent way \u201d, a sentence which is not felt as saying much. (cid:131) The independent observer report of CIT4 (2 nd stage) points out that \u201cthe corps of evaluators seems to be an appropriate mix along age, gender and career dimensions.\u201d No reference is made to how gender issues were dealt with by evaluators. 52 Proposals submitted for CIT1 and CIT2 were evaluated during one evaluation sessions that took place between 16/06/03 and 04/07/03. 53 The evaluation sessions for the first stage of CIT4, CIT5 and CIT6 were run in parallel from June 15 to 21, 2005 and were attended by one independent observer. CIT4 was a two-stage evaluation process, so for the second stage evaluation, there has been a separate independent observer report. ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 56 (cid:131) Also in the report of the independent observer of CIT4 (first stage), CIT5 and CIT6, there is only a statement concerning the evaluators : \u201cThe Commission is advised to continue the practice of forming the evaluation teams that are heterogeneous by gender and academic backgrounds.\u201d This observation, especially when considering the results of the analysis of evaluators\u2019 assessment (as presented in the section below) gives rise to concerns whether all the independent observers effectively paid attention to whether and how gender issues were dealt with by the evaluators. 5.2.4. Assessment by proposal evaluators Given the very nature of the \u2018Priority 7\u2019 activity, the study team considered that for all projects submitted in response to Priority 7 calls gender is of relevance, and hence that this relevance had to be recognised and adequately addressed by the proposers. Evaluation experts therefore had to assess to what extent and how gender was effectively addressed. For all proposals submitted under both Priority 7 calls (containing CIT1, CIT2, CIT3, CIT4, CIT5, CIT6), the study team analysed the proposal abstracts and on this basis identified the \u2018gender specific\u2019 projects. Those projects having gender as their primary research topic and focus (and which usually contain the words \u2018gender\u2019, \u2018men\u2019 or \u2018women\u2019 in their full title) were considered as \u2018gender specific\u2019. 25 gender specific projects were identified. Of these, six got approved for funding (two under CIT4 and 4 under CIT5). The Evaluation Summary Reports (ESR) of all proposals that were evaluated above all thresholds as well as of those gender specific projects that failed were reviewed in order to identify how gender was addressed by the evaluation experts. In total, this comprised 210 cases for Priority 7: 194 proposals that passed all thresholds and sixteen gender specific projects that failed. For all 194 proposals that passed all thresholds in the evaluation, the review of the ESR included : \u2022 whether any reference is made in the ESR to gender issues; \u2022 when gender is mentioned in the ESR, whether it concerns the content of the project and/or the participation of women and men in the project team (qualitative and/or quantitative approach to gender); \u2022 whether the absence of any reference to gender in proposals is identified by the evaluators and whether this was held against the project. There were sixteen gender specific projects that failed. For these, the study team looked into the reasons for failing, and which were the assessment criteria that were considered as insufficiently fulfilled by the evaluators. Proposals evaluated above all thresholds (194 proposals) More than half of the ESRs (53 %) of the proposals do not mention gender at all, suggesting that evaluators ignored the gender question, even in cases where there are clear gender issues associated with the project. One project (NoE) with 13 partners (of which two have female project responsibles), approved for funding under CIT-1, aims to set up a network gathering \u2018science and innovation policy\u2019 specialists from four disciplines (economics, sociology, political ",

It intends to focus activities on ST&I indicators, training and interaction with stakeholders. There is no Gender Action Plan included in the proposal, although this is mandatory. The ESR does not make any reference to gender. A project, approved under CIT-2, focussing on public participation in policy-making (participatory governance) in the areas of medicine, health, food, energy, and environment, has obvious gender issues associated with its theme. The ESR does not make any comment as to how this is dealt with in the proposal. A STREP project approved under CIT-5 which looks at \u2018dynamic regions in a knowledge-driven global economy and the lessons and policy implications for the EU\u2019 does not address gender, while gender is relevant for the project. The ESR does not point this out, and does not make any reference to gender at all.

Nearly half of these (47 %) are from proposals submitted under the Citizens-5 part, which is also the part with the highest number of proposals evaluated above the threshold (92 out of 194). For Citizens-3, a very high proportion of the ESRs of proposals evaluated above the threshold (17 out of 22, or 77%) comments on gender. For Citizens-4, this share amounts to 10 out of 16 proposals (or 63%), while for Citizens-1 and Citizens-6 it is lowest (4 out of 14, and 4 out of 13 respectively). This observation reflects a higher awareness and sensitivity to the gender issue among the evaluation panels of Citizens- 3 and Citizens-4 than among the other panels. Remarks in the ESRs that relate to \u2018gender\u2019 either referred to the participation of women in the project, to the research contents, or to both aspects. The vast majority (78, or 85 %) of the ESRs that refer to gender deal with the gender dimension in the research content. The female participation in the project was referred to in 44 ESRs (48 % of those ESRs containing a reference to gender). Interesting to note is that in 12 cases where the ESR refers to gender in the research content, a quantitative approach is taken to gender (looking at numbers of women as research objects or as target audiences). When ESRs contain a reference on gender, such statements are in 49 % of the cases saying something positive or neutral, merely making an observation (29 %). About all of these were recognitions that gender issues were addressed in the proposal. One in two also recognised the participation of women in the project team. Some examples of such comments are: \u201cThe strength of the project lies in its focus areas i.e. comparative approach to diverse patterns of migratory flows and existing migration policy regimes and gender awareness .\u201d (CIT1) \u201cGender issues are addressed in sufficient detail. Also central figures of the project are females.\u201d(CIT2) ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 58 \u201cGender issues are considered in a serious manner. There is a good plan for promoting gender equality.\u201d (CIT3) \u201cThe implementation of gender issues is of the highest standard, considering gender not only mechanistically by counting men and women (approx. 50%-50%), but also reflecting on the impact of gender on many levels of content analysis\u201d (CIT4). \u201cThe majority of the lead researchers have considerable experience in both gender training for high level personnel and in advocacy training for minority groups.\u201d (CIT4) \u201cGender issues are at the heart of the project given the subject and the attention paid by researchers to that issue is great.\u201d (CIT5) When the evaluators explicitly comment in the ESR on the Gender Action Plan (which is compulsary in proposals for Networks of Excellence and Integrated Projects), these comments tend to be of a general nature (as opposed to other very precise and pertinent remarks given in the ESR in relation to other points). This can be a sign of some confusion and uncertainty about how to assess it. Comments made do not reflect much insight among evaluators about gender issues associated with the themes and subjects of the proposals. \u201cThe existing gender policy plan is very satisfactory considering the fact that there are not so many women involved in the field of Security Studies.\u201d(CIT1) \u201cThe plan is very general on questions of gender and the gender balance could be improved. There is a brief Gender Action Plan, but the ways and means of promoting gender equality could be spelled out.\u201d(CIT1) \u201cThe gender action plan is focused on the participation of women. However gender issues should be taken into account during the realization of the project and in relation to the content of the research activities.\u201d (CIT3) \u201cThis project has considerable potential for a gender action plan given the topics being covered, specifically soft location factors, and numbers of female creative entrepreneurs\u201d (CIT4). In 50 ESRs (54 % of those ESRs containing a reference to gender, or 26 % of all ESRs of proposals evaluated above all thresholds), critical remarks were given; sometimes in combination with praising statements. \u201cGender issues need to be reflected upon further. Ensuring gender parity in the samples is not enough.\u201d(CIT2) \u201cThe project needs to pay more attention to how more women should be integrated in the research teams.\u201d (CIT 4) \u201cThe aspect of gender has been touched upon but never fully taken into account in terms of actionable activities. A series of questions related to gender and knowledge production are outlined but they are never addressed either through the case study discussion put forth for each country or in the analysis and discussion proposed in the work-packages.\u201d (CIT5) A positive observation is that some ESRs identified specific areas where gender was not or was insufficiently addressed in the proposal, thus making it easier to take on these elements in a possibly following negotiation phase.

Gender issues are addressed but they concern exclusively how gender issues will be taken into account in relation to the Common Frame of Reference, but not in the future work of the network.\u201d \u201cAlthough gender equality is one of the three cross-cutting issues, there is no mention of which categories of people/individuals/women and men are to be considered as key variables when considering, for example, entitlement to resources, social rights, capabilities etc. Given the major significance of variables such as education, skills, age, and particularly ethnicity, etc. in access to resources, rights and capabilities with respect to the labour market and welfare this omission is of concern, and should be taken into account.\u201d CIT4 \u201cThe selection of countries is presented as a 'nice balance' but does in fact not include representatives from the earlier eastern, or transitional, states. One should consider to expand the consortium to include one or two such countries, as they would probably also expand the variation in the research issues (gender gaps in quality of life) and thereby add a quality to the study.\u201d (CIT5) \u201cIt is also important that gender issues are covered in the formulation of the research problem and in the intended analysis of the results.\u201d (CIT5) \u201cThe team needs to be strengthened, and done carefully, this could also solve the problem that there are no women involved in this project as it stands.\u201d (CIT6) Gender specific proposals that failed (16 proposals) Under Priority 7, there were sixteen gender specific project proposals that failed on one or more thresholds and which were hence rejected. Of these, fourteen contained remarks on gender in the ESR, all fourteen referring to the research contents, while nine also referred to the participation of women in the project team. \u2192 Main conclusions : (cid:190) More than half of the ESRs do not make any reference to gender, suggesting that evaluators often ignored the gender dimension despite the evident gender relevance of projects within the Priority 7 activity area. (cid:190) The vast majority of remarks relating to gender deal with the gender dimension in the research contents, which is a positive finding from the perspective of promoting gender-sensitive research. (cid:190) A high proportion of statements concerning gender in ESRs say something positive or merely make a \u2018neutral\u2019 observation. (cid:190) Only a minority of ESRs contain a critical remark concerning gender and/or the identification of specific areas where gender was not or insufficiently addressed in the research proposal. (cid:190) It is positive that ESRs making critical comments regarding gender identify areas for improvement, thus enabling to take up these points during contract negotiations. (cid:190) Overall, the ESRs reflect evaluators\u2019 uncertainty and suggest a lack of capacity among the evaluators to make a proper assessement of gender in the project proposal (participation of women, equal opportunities, integration of the gender dimension in the research contents).

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 60 In nine cases, these were negative comments. All nine criticised the proposal for its weaknesses in properly addressing the gender issues, which ought to be the focus of the project, it being gender specific. \u201cThe project does not develop the notion of gender as a proper framework.\u201d In seven cases, the expert evaluators identified specific areas where gender was not or was improperly addressed in the project proposal. \u201cThe proposal addresses the issue of gender in a somewhat one-dimensional fashion, ignoring, for instance, the multi-faceted meanings of motherhood in different national and social contexts.\u201d In one case of a proposal (CIT2) focussing on the participation of young males in society (\u2018men\u2019 being the object of the research) and which failed on 5 out of 6 criteria (all except \u2018relevance\u2019), a rather dubious comment is made by the evaluators in the ESR : \u201cThe general idea of the project is interesting in that it takes \u2018gender\u2019 seriously by including a male perspective instead of the usual conflation of gender and female.\u201d In the case of a NoE (under CIT1) aiming at forming a platform for interdisciplinary, transnational gender-sensitive research, the evaluators criticised the proposal for lacking a gender balance in the project team, it being predominantly female. This proposal did not fail any specific thresholds, but obtained a slightly below threshold total score (19.5 on 25, while the threshold is 20). Another reason for rejection of a gender specific proposal (under CIT3), aiming for conflict resolution between Greece and Turkey, has been that it was considered out of the scope of the call (and more generally out of the scope of the objectives of FP6). All sixteen rejected gender specific proposals obtained total scores below the overall threshold, and four of them even failed on four or more specific criteria. 5.2.5. \u2018Science and Society\u2019 reporting in Priority 7 All FP6 project holders (coordinators) are expected to complete an online questionnaire about the \u2018Science and Society\u2019 issues in their project.

The section on \u2018gender\u2019 only needs to be completed for CAs, SSAs and STREPS because the IPs and NoEs have to report separately on the implementation of their Gender Action Plan by means of an online GAP Implementation Report. By May 2007, no completed \u2018Science and Society Reporting Questionnaire\u2019 of Priority 7 CA, SSA or STREP projects could be made available to the study team, none apparently being in SESAM. \u2192 Main conclusion : (cid:190) The analysis suggests that the rejected gender specific projects lacked quality overall, thus making them inapt for being selected for funding.

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 61 There were 13 such questionnaires available for IPs and NoEs. In these questionnaires, the section on \u2018gender\u2019 was logically left blank : it did not have to be completed, a dedicated GAP Implementation Report was expected from these project holders. The GAP Implementation Reports are discussed further in this Working Paper (in section 3.4.4.). The fact that no \u2018Science and Society Reporting Questionnaire\u2019 were available in SESAM for Priority 7 CA, SSA or STREP projects raises some questions : on the useability of SESAM as well as on the use the European Commission intended to make of these reports. It seems as if nobody in the Commission monitored the extent to which the Priority 7 project holders respected this reporting obligation. Anyhow, the study team found the questionnaire design not useful for analysing the state of play within these projects as regards gender. The questionnaire, which is essentially composed of closed \u2018yes/no\u2019 questions, does not allow a true insight into the reality of these projects. Ideally, such questionnaires should allow the identification of difficulties, success factors or key issues. \u2192 Main conclusion : If project holders are expected to invest time and efforts in reporting, which in itself is a legitimate demand from the part of the Commission, the tools provided should be both user- friendly and allowing an effective exploitation of the reporting results. However, this is not enough : the Commission also has the duty to check and monitor the reporting by the project holders. ",

This represents 64% of the selected proposals. Of the sample, 4 projects are \u2018gender specific\u2019.

The analysis comprised the following elements : 1. whether gender was mentioned or treated as a relevant factor or variable at all in the project; 2. for those projects where gender was addressed, the analysis continued by looking at the approach taken to the gender dimension. The following categories were distinguished : (cid:190) the presentation of sex-disaggregated statistics (cid:190) the identification of specific gender issues to be addressed (based on specific characteristics / requirements of women) (cid:190) the recognition of gender differences in roles or responsibilities which might be inter- related (gender relations) (cid:190) the recognition of inequalities (cid:190) the recognition of gendered structures or systems (how the differences are (re-) produced or altered) (cid:190) the recognition of gender constructs (i.e. that key concepts are gendered) 3. Next, the extent to which gender was integrated into the project design was reviewed : (cid:190) in the abstract of the project proposal (cid:190) in the inputs (human, documentation, \u2026) (cid:190) in the project activities (cid:190) in the planned outputs (results, findings) (cid:190) in the intended impacts (contribution to Community policy and objectives) 54 This analytical framework has been largely based on the analysis tool developed by Dr. Mary Braithwaite, \u2018Gender Impact Assessment of the FP5 Specific Programmes \u2013 Improving human research potential and the socio-economic knowledge base.

Treatment of gender in the selected Priority 7 projects As mentioned before, given the nature of Priority 7 (Social Sciences and Humanities), the study team considered all projects as \u2018gender relevant\u2019. Despite this gender relevance of all research topics, there were 23 out of the 90 projects in the sample that did mention gender without effectively addressing it. Four projects were gender blind (i.e. did not even contain a reference to \u2018gender\u2019), and three projects did not mention gender, while it was also considered by the study team to be of indirect relevance only. Four of the 90 selected projects were gender-specific. The other 56 projects integrated gender, albeit to different degrees. The table below presents the number of projects according to the treatment of gender for the six parts under Priority 7. In interpreting these figures, one must take into account that CIT1, CIT3 and CIT4 were reserved for IPs and NoEs \u2013 for which a Gender Action Plan was mandatory, CIT2 and CIT5 were open for STREPs and CAs, and CIT6 was reserved for SSA. 55 For those projects where more than one research area was indicated, the first indicated area has been considered as the \u2018main\u2019 area.

This is clearly an enhancement in comparison to FP5 56 and can be considered as a positive result from the efforts made by the Commission in FP6, formally requiring the consideration of gender issues by the proposers. Nevertheless, still one out of three proposals did not address gender (30 out of 90 sampled projects), four of these being completely gender-blind. Although gender was mentioned in 23 of these proposals, it has not been taken into account in the project inputs or activities, the references made to gender apparently being mere lip-service. As can be seen in the table above, CIT5 and CIT6 contained the highest share of projects not addressing gender, indicating an apparent deterioration in the quality of the projects where gender is concerned towards the end of the Framework Programme period. In terms of instruments used, there were three NoEs where gender was mentioned but not addressed, three IPs, three SSA and fourteen STREPs. Looking at the sex of the coordinators, 19 of the 23 projects where gender is mentioned but not addressed are coordinated by men. This might suggest that men might have more difficulties in seeing the gender relevance for their project. This observation is consistent for both Priority 7 calls (6 out of 7 projects not addressing gender were coordinated by men under the first call; and 13 out of 16 projects under the second call). Table 5.18 Treatment of gender in selected Priority 7 projects, by sex of coordinator (N=90) Male coordinator Female coordinator Total sample Gender blind 3 1 4 Gender not mentioned, but only indirectly relevant 2 1 3 Gender is relevant and mentioned, but not addressed 19 4 23 Gender integrated 39 17 56 Gender specific - 4 4 Total 63 (70%) 27 (30%) 90 There are interesting variations between the thematic areas. Of the 27 proposals that are either gender blind or where gender is mentioned but not addressed, seven are from the first thematic area \u2018Improving the generation, distribution and use of knowledge and its impact on economic and social development\u2019 (out of the 12 projects in this area analysed), and eight are from area 8 \u2018Actions to promote the ERA in SSH\u2019 (out of the 15 analysed). 56 The final report from the FP5 Gender Impact Assessment study by Dr. Mary Braithwaite indicates that in the \u2018Socio-Economic Knowledge Key Action\u2019 only one out of five projects could be considered gender-integrated.

The reasons for this assessment have been that the GAP either contained statements of \u2018intentions\u2019 and/or that not a single element contained in the GAP was integrated in the other parts of the proposal, where one would have expected them to be mentioned (e.g. under the detailed description of the activities to be undertaken, the tools to be used, the deliverables, \u2026). In two of these six cases (one CIT1 and one CIT4 project), the GAP only contains elements as to female participation and equal opportunities, while in the whole proposal no issues of gender relevance connected with the research subject are identified. Although gender was mentioned in these proposals, the study team concluded that these projects could be categorised as \u2018gender blind\u2019 where their research subject is concerned. The CIT1 project (coordinated by a woman) deals with efficient and democratic governance in Europe : the \u2018concept\u2019 of democracy and representation, ways and means of enhancing democracy, gains and challenges of including civil society in governance, democratic norms of equal rights. While the gender relevance is obvious, this is not considered in the proposal. The GAP only mentions : \u201cWe will encourage the inclusion and development of research topics investigating or accounting for the gender dimension of European governance.\u201d The CIT4 project (also coordinated by a woman) aims to demonstrate that \u2018the linguistic diversity in Europe is potentially an asset rather than an obstacle\u2019. It points out that one of the preconditions for this to occur is that citizens become multilingual, foreign languages being one of the most important \u2018new basic skills\u2019 citizens need to acquire to take part in the creation of a European knowledge based society. The project fails to identify any gender issues related to this subject. It would however make sense to analyse any differences between the sexes in terms of opportunity for and access to language education and multilingualism. ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 67 The study team considered that it can be argued that three projects address subjects where gender has only indirect significance. These projects are a CIT5 STREP dealing with \u2018firms that are created around scientific knowledge generated in public research organisations\u2019, a CIT6 SSA dealing with \u2018modern Mediterranean architecture\u2019 and another CIT6 SSA about \u2018tax treaty law\u201d. For the projects considered as \u2018gender-integrated\u2019, it is relevant to look at the depth or \u2018seriousness\u2019 of this integration of the gender dimension by verifying in which parts of the project design gender is mentioned as relevant variable. Indeed, while for some projects gender is effectively fully embedded in the project design, the integration of gender has been rather shallow in other projects. The table below shows in absolute numbers and in percentages where gender was mentioned as relevant variable in the project design for the gender-integrated projects. Table 5.20 The integration of gender in the project design (gender-integrated projects, N=56) Number % In the abstract of the proposal 20 36 % In the inputs 38 68 % In the activities 53 95 % In the planned outputs 35 63 % In the intended impacts 22 39 % The results shown in the table above indicate that even in \u2018gender-integrated\u2019 proposals, where gender is effectively addressed to some extent, the gender dimension is not completely integrated into the project design. The inputs referred to are in most cases human resource inputs, where members of the team have gender expertise or where a specific person is to be appointed as responsible for the integration of gender considerations in the project. Where gender is included in the activities, this is in the vast majority of the cases as a relevant variable in the work to be performed in one or more of the work packages, as a criterion in the selection of samples for interviews/case studies/\u2026 or as criterion in the analyses. A majority of the gender-integrated proposals mentions gender in relation to outputs, referring in most cases to findings or study results relating to gender to be incorporated in reports. However, a few proposals also indicated deliverables that would be entirely devoted to gender. Four projects in the sample are gender-specific. All four projects have a female coordinator and gender is completely integrated into the project design. A CIT4 IP on \u2018quality in gender+ equality policies\u2019. The objective is to bring together and construct the knowledge needed for inclusive gender+ equality policies. Another CIT4 IP with as research subject \u2018gendered citizenship in Multicultural Europe\u2019. The strategic goal is to construct a model of gendered citizenship based on the contribution of women\u2019s movements in developing citizenship practices and policies. ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 68 A STREP under CIT5 dealing with \u2018the relation between major ageing and gender issues in Europe\u2019. The project seeks to reveal gender gaps and their factors by identifying and analysing indicators of quality of life among the population aged 65+. Another CIT5 STREP proposal with as research subject \u2018the debates, conflicts and regulations about Female Muslim headscarves in Europe\u2019. The main objectives are to compare the fundamental values and political principles expressed in the debates, and to explain the differences and similarities in the conflicting values as expressed in the policies on Muslim headscarves across European countries. 5.3.3. Promotion of female participation and equal opportunities As mentioned above, 27 out of the reviewed 90 projects have a female coordinator (one third), which is in line with the total universe of projects in Priority 7. Of the total sample, one third (31 out of 90) have a good (or acceptable) male / female balance in the project team. Considered as good (or acceptable) have been those project teams with not less than 40 % of members from the same sex. This assessment has been made on the basis of the sex of the persons representing the members of the partnership. The composition of the full scientific team might show different results, but was not systematically available. Moreover, even when the full scientific team is listed in proposals, information on the sex of the team members is not always mentioned. A positive observation is that in (at least) half the sample, gender expertise is available within the team. Indeed, in 46 out of the 90 projects there is an indication that the scientific team includes gender expertise. In some cases this is explicitly put forward, while in others this had to be deduced from the presentations or curricula vitae of the team members that were provided in the proposal. No significant differences can be noted in the proportion of project teams having gender expertise available when looking at the types of instruments used. However, when looking at the sex of the coordinators, it appears that teams led by women are more likely to have gender expertise available in the team : 19 out of 27 teams led by women (70 %) have gender expertise available, while this is the case only for 26 out of 63 teams led by men (41 %). In 46 projects (or 51 % of the sample), measures are foreseen within the team structure and/or project set-up to ensure that a balanced participation, equal opportunities and/or gender issues are taken into account. Here again, female coordinators are more likely to specify such measures than men : 18 out of 27 female coordinators (67 %) foresee specific measures against 28 out of 63 male coordinators (44 %). Typical examples of such measures are : (cid:190) a specific work package being devoted to \u2018gender\u2019 in relation to the main subject of the research; (cid:190) a gender expert (or \u2018gender coordinator\u2019, or even \u2018gender issues officer\u2019) being formally appointed as responsible, to ensure the integration of gender issues in the work performed; (cid:190) the explicitation that recruitment will aim at realising a better gender balance (at all levels) in the team. A few projects even set specific targets and/or are precise as to the proposed measures : not setting age limits, effectively applying positive discrimination, allowing part-time work. A good practice example is that of a project where not only a \u2018gender issue coordinator\u2019 will be appointed, but where also a \u2018gender guidebook\u2019 will be compiled. ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 69 This CIT3 project, a NoE coordinated by a woman, deals with\u2019 sustainable development in a diverse world\u2019. It integrates gender properly in the project considering the role of women in the public sphere, gender-specific migration waves, women as force for change, unequal power relations and social arrangements, etc. The \u2018gender guidebook\u2019 that will be developed will i.a. : (cid:190) develop a conceptual gender framework, conceptualising the gender issues in the context of the research activities and outlining guidelines for considering gender in the methodology (e.g. for data collection); (cid:190) propose long-term quantitative objectives for the participation of women in the activities (within the project, and in its \u2018outreach\u2019 activities) and define action and rules to realise the objectives (e.g. procedures for selection of participants to events / training courses; rules for gender balance in decision-making bodies; \u2026); (cid:190) include guidelines for using gender-neutral language in the research; (cid:190) include guidelines that the project website promotes gender equality; (cid:190) \u2026 5.3.4. The gender dimension in the research content The 56 \u2018gender integrated\u2019 projects clearly take into account gender as a relevant variable in their work, although gender is not the main subject or focus of the project. The study team has analysed the approach that has been taken to gender in these proposals. Table 5.21 The approach taken to gender in the gender-integrated projects (N=56) Number % Sex disaggregation in statistics 5 9 % Acknowledgement of specific characteristics of women / identification of gender issues to be addressed 26 46 % The recognition of gender differences in roles or responsibilities which might be inter-related (gender relations) 34 61 % The recognition of inequalities 28 50 % The recognition of gendered structures or systems (how the differences are (re-)produced or altered) 25 45 % The recognition of gender constructs 8 14 % A majority of gender-integrated proposals (three out of five) recognises that there are differences between the sexes in relation to certain topics being studied (e.g. that women and men demonstrate different forms of violent behaviour). Half of the proposals recognise gender inequalities (e.g. that women are more likely than men to occupy non-standard forms of employment, which puts limitations to their economic independence), while nearly half acknowledge that there are specific issues associated with one sex (e.g. that women in their role of mothers play a significant role in the transmission of aspects of culture to next generations). A positive finding is that in nearly one out of two proposals (in 45 %) gendered structures or systems are identified, i.e. the structures and systems that (re-)produce or can alter gender inequalities. Some examples of such structures that have been recognised are : (cid:190) apparently neutral policies with different impacts on women and men (in a NoE on European private law); (cid:190) recruitment, retention and promotion policies in organisations (in a proposal for a STREP that investigates professional knowledge in the health and education sectors); (cid:190) the role of culture (art, language, \u2026) in reinforcing gender images (in a NoE on European history and its relation to the future research agenda); ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 70 (cid:190) the gender division of labour (in a SSA on a dialogue between social scientists and non-academic actors); (cid:190) education and its impact on employability at older ages (in a IP on European welfare state interventions). Only eight proposals identified gender constructs, i.e. recognised that key concepts are fundamentally gendered. Examples are : \u2018part-time work\u2019; certain professions like \u2018teaching\u2019 and \u2018nursing\u2019; \u2018the public sphere\u2019; the discourse on \u2018universal human rights\u2019; the concept of \u2018citizenship\u2019; \u2018parenthood\u2019. Sex-disaggregated statistics have only been provided in five proposals. Important to note is that while the proportion of projects addressing gender is relatively high, there is still significant scope for further improvements. Indeed, only in about one third (17 out of 56) of the gender-integrated projects, the study team considers gender to be properly \u2018embedded\u2019 into the research design and work. In the other projects, there is recognition that gender is a relevant variable to particular aspects of the study and to particular components of the work programme, but the gender relevance is overlooked or ignored in other parts. Some examples : The proposal of a CIT1 NoE on \u2018international migration, integraton and social cohesion in Europe\u2019 mentions gender as criterion in relation to one work package on \u2018social integration and mobility, education, housing and health\u2019, but the gender dimension of other topics such as \u2018legal status, citizenship and political integration\u2019 is not mentioned. In a CIT2 project (a STREP), the research subject is \u2018participatory governance and institutional innovation\u2019, and the work is focussed on five selected \u2018politics of life\u2019 areas : medicine, health, food, energy and environment. While gender is recognised in the proposal as being a relevant variable in \u2018participatory praxis\u2019, it is only considered in the work on the \u2018food\u2019 area, but missing in other key work packages. There is e.g. no consideration of gender in the description of the work related to the discourse regarding human embryonic stem cell research and therapeutic cloning, genetic testing, \u2026 In a CIT4 project (IP) aiming to demonstrate that linguistic diversity and multilingualism in the EU are assets for the creation of a knowledge based society states that \u2018gender will be considered as a socio-linguistic variable\u2019 in the project. The potential or existing differences between the sexes in access to language education, linguistic competencies, multi-lingualism are ignored. Another IP in CIT4 analyses educaitonal strategies for their potential to overcome inequalities and to promote social cohesion (versus reinforcing social exclusion). In this project, women are considered as \u2018vulnerable group\u2019 for social exclusion, next to migrants, disabled, unemployed youth. Intersectionality and forms of multiple discrimination are felt to be insufficiently addressed, while also the potentially distinct role of women and men as \u2018actors\u2019 in the definition and implementation of educational strategies could have been considered. A STREP project in CIT5 on youth as actor of social change investigates three thematic areas : young parenthood, transitions to work, and civic participation. In these areas, \u2018gender\u2019 is integrated to different degrees. It is largely missing from the last area, where differences between the sexes in civic participation are ignored. Projects where gender is really embedded in the research design and work and that can serve as examples of good practice are : A CIT2 project (with a female coordinator) : a coordination action on human rights violations. The project investigates various types of interpersonal violence and how ",

In this, the research looks i.a. at violence against and by women, but also at men as perpetrators and as victims. Another CIT2 CA studying the insecure perspectives of the low skilled in the labour market distinguishes four variables in relation to \u2018low skilled\u2019 among which gender, as well as the occurrence of combinations of these factors. It considers \u2018part time work\u2019 as a gendered construct. A NoE under CIT3 focussing on the role of the EU in \u2018global governance\u2019, regionalisation and regulation fully integrates gender in its research design. Resources are made available and measures are foreseen to ensure the consideration of gender issues : a gender issues officer, a workshop on \u2018gender\u2019, the integration of gender in the work packages. One of the issues that will be studied is e.g. the gendered knowledge production in the economic transformation that is entailed by the globalisation process. This project has however a serious underrepresentation of women in the team (five out of 44 persons representing the members of the partnership). The coordinator is male. An IP (with a female coordinator) under CIT4 sets out to undertake a micro level analysis of violent mass conflicts. Gender is embedded in the research design, and various relevant gender issues are identified, e.g. different gender roles in situaions of conflict, gender identities being manipulated before and during violent conflicts, the need for the inclusion of women\u2019s voices in peace negotiations. In a CIT5 project (a STREP with a female coordinator) on social quality of work and life, gender is fully integrated..The project will analyse whether, to what extent and how gender matters in the relationship between well-being and public and organisational policies. All analyses will also be broken down by gender. 5.3.5. Follow-up of activity reports For the first Priority 7 call (with three parts: CIT1, CIT2 and CIT3), the most recent activity reports were analysed, as far as they were available, for the sampled projects. For most of these projects, the most recent report available was the second year reporting. The aim of this review was to assess the extent to which gender is effectively integrated in the project, and to compare such findings with what was originally put forward in the project proposal. \u2192 Main conclusions : (cid:190) The proportion of \u2018gender integrated\u2019 projects under Priority 7 is quite high (three out of five), which is a positive observation and a significant improvement in comparison to FP5. This positive result can certainly be attributed to the emphasis put by the Commission on gender. However, looking at the whole FP6 period, there has been a deterioration towards the end of the period. (cid:190) There is still much scope for further improvements : o the extent to which gender is addressed varies significantly : a majority of the projects demonstrates an incomplete understanding and treatment of the gender dimension; o one out of four projects does not address gender.

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 72 In total, the activity reports of 33 projects were reviewed: five from CIT1 (out of 5 sampled projects), 14 from CIT2 (out of 15 sampled projects) and 14 from CIT3 (out of 15 sampled projects). In CIT1, under which IPs and NoEs are funded, three out of the five activity reports do not mention (1 activity report) or address gender (2 activity reports) . This corresponds to how the study team categorised these projects in terms of their integration of gender, based on the proposal (included as technical annex to their contract with the Commission): as \u2018gender is relevant and mentioned, but not addressed\u2019. One NoE where gender was considered by the study team as poorly integrated in the project proposal, does seem to achieve some progress in the activity report: a paper on \u2018Gender, Migration and the European Labour Market\u2019 has been written and the gender balance in the team is taken into account.

A few examples : A CA project (with a female coordinator) having \u2018Human rights violations\u2019 as research subject: gender was a cross-cutting theme during an annual conference. Several papers and publications were produced including gender as the main subject. Gender is integrated in all work packages.

Gender is equally important in the project activity report as it was in the proposal. A STREP project (with a male coordinator) with \u2018Professional knowledge in education and health\u2019 as research subject considers gender is an important indicator for exploring links between work and learning. A case report containing gender statistics was produced. On the other hand, for six projects where gender was not addressed or poorly integrated into the project design as described in the proposal, gender is only briefly (four activity reports) or not at all mentioned (two activity reports) in the activity reports. This confirms the initial assessment. The activity report of a STREP project (with a female coordinator) with \u2018conflict resolution\u2019 as research subject mentions twice that one of the research subjects is \u2018the role of women and children in the conflicts\u2019, but without explaining how this is explored. Of the three remaining CIT2 projects where gender was considered integrated to some extent based on the proposal, gender is only briefly mentioned in two activity reports and not mentioned at all in the third activity report . A STREP project (with a male coordinator) where the research subject is \u2018Participatory governance and Institutional innovation\u2019 mentions gender only in the aims saying that there will be attention for \u2018inclusiveness\u2019 of participation in terms of gender.

Of these five activity reports, gender is embedded in three project proposals and is intergrated to some extent in two project proposals. An NoE project (with a female coordinator) focusing on sustainable development appointed a \u2018Gender Issues Coordinator\u2019, drafted a first report devoted to gender in relation to the research subject, the project website contains a page on gender issues; and gender differences are taken into account in several Work Packages. An IP project (with a male coordinator) with as research subject \u2018trajectories to the knowledge economy\u2019, produced a position paper on the gender dimensions of the knowledge economy and on the \u2018gender-mainstreaming of empirical research in the field\u2019 which will be the basis for the Gender Workshop that is upcoming. A specialist team on gender issues was appointed that will develop the gender dimension. Of five projects where gender was not addressed or only poorly integrated into the proposal, two activity reports briefly mention gender and three activity reports do not mention gender at all . One NoE (with a male coordinator) on European private law did mention gender in the GAP of the proposal, whereas gender is not mentioned at all in the activity report. For the remaining four projects, the study team appreciates the integration of gender in the project activities, but considers nevertheless that achievements could have been better . An IP project (with a female coordinator) focusing on \u2018the contribution system of the educational system to lifelong learning\u2019, states that \u201cthe final report will pay specific attention to the issue of gender inequality\u201d, whereas gender has not yet been addressed in the project activities. An NoE (with a male coordinator) working on the themes of economic change, quality of life and social cohesion will study gender inequality in employment conditions and in unemployment risks.

Only in exceptional cases, the activity report indicates a better treatment of gender than what appeared from the technical annex.

GAP analysis approach For the New Instruments (Networks of Excellence and Integrated Projects) under FP6, a Gender Action Plan was required to be included in the proposal. For the selected projects, the GAP was also included in the technical annex to the contract with the Commission. In total, 20 contracts for projects using new instruments have been signed under the first call of Priority 7, in which the parts Citizens-1 and Citizens-3 were entirely devoted to Networks of Excellence and Integrated Projects. Under the second call for Priority 7, the part Citizens-4 was open for these two instruments and 14 projects were approved under Citizens-4. The GAPs of all these 34 projects (5 from CIT-1, 15 from CIT-3 and 14 from CIT-4) as they were included in the submitted proposals have been reviewed and compared with the \u2018final\u2019 version of these GAPs as included in the technical annex to the contract. The aim of this comparison has been to assess the impact of the negotiation phase on the quality level of the Gender Action Plans. A first remark to be made relates to the interpretation of what is covered by the \u2018Gender Action Plan\u2019. Proponents were asked to include in their proposal a GAP, as well as to write a section on \u2018gender issues\u2019 associated with the subject of the research proposal and how these aspects have been taken into consideration. This has apparently led to some confusion as to what exactly needed to be covered under which section. For the purpose of this analysis, both sections have been included in the assessment of the \u2018GAPs\u2019, considering that the overall quality of the GAP is not depending on whether proponents have (or not) distinguished between both sections in the proposal. The study team considers nevertheless, to avoid confusion, it would have been better not to make a distinction and to have all gender aspects concentrated in the \u2018Gender Action Plan\u2019 section of the proposal. In assessing the quality of the GAPs, the following elements have been taken into account : \u2022 whether and how the GAP addresses the quantitative and qualitative dimension of the gender integration in the project (women\u2019s participation and equal opportunities on the one hand, and the contents of the research work on the other hand); \u2022 the extent to which specific issues with particular gender relevance in the subject of the research are indentified in the GAP; \u2022 the proposed measures, approaches and resources that are or will be mobilised in the project to effectively address the gender dimension, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Based on this assessment, the \u2018GAPs\u2019 have been categorised into four categories : \u2022 \u2018non-GAPs\u2019 : the (so-called) \u2018GAPs\u2019 contain none of the elements searched for, but only some noncommittal statements, merely for the sake of having a section that can be entitled \u2018GAP\u2019; \u2022 one star (*) : poor GAPs that do contain a few relevant elements, but remain superficial and rather noncommittal; not mentioning approaches, measures or means to realise \u2018intentions\u2019; \u2022 two star (**) : good quality GAPs that cover most or all of the required elements adequately; \u2022 three star (***) : excellent GAPs that cover all the expected elements, clearly presenting a diagnosis of the situation and concrete approaches and measures as to how the ",

Quality of GAPs in proposals and in technical annexes For Citizens-1, four out of the five proposals that were retained for funding did contain a Gender Action Plan (GAP), while one did not (although it was a formal requirement). However, this one proposal did contain a short section entitled \u2018gender issues\u2019 in which the existence of a \u2018gender plan\u2019 is mentioned, although this was not included in the proposal. Of the fifteen projects for which contracts were signed under Citizens-3, thirteen proposals contained a GAP. For Citizens-4, the study team could analyse the proposals of only nine out of the 14 approved projects. All these nine contained a GAP. As mentioned above, also the GAPs that were eventually included in the technical annex to the contract of these projects were assessed in order to identify the impact of the negotiation phase on the quality of the GAP. The results from this comparative assessment are shown in the table below. As higher in this section, projects are coded with numbers. Table 5.20 Quality of GAPs Project Instr.

IP \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 Loss of elements in T.A. \u2193 As can be seen in the table above, the quality of the GAPs as they were included in the proposals has been quite low for the first call (CIT-1 and CIT-3) : out of the 20 proposals that were selected for funding, eight GAPs were assessed as \u2018poor\u2019, one as a \u2018non-GAP\u2019, two proposals did not contain a GAP at all. Only one proposal contained a GAP that was assesssed as \u2018excellent\u2019. For the proposals resulting from the second call, an improvement in the quality of the GAPs has been noticeable : from the nine proposals analysed, only two were assessed as \u2018poor\u2019. A weak quality of GAP was in nearly all cases caused by a lack of specific issues being identified in the research subject of relevance to gender or by a lack of specific measures and/or activities to address gender (merely expressing some \u2018intentions\u2019) either in terms of female participation and/or in the research work. As regards the impact of the negotiation, the \u2018average assessment\u2019 of the 29 projects of which both proposal and technical annex were analysed can be taken as an indicator. For these projects, the average assessment was 1.6 stars for proposals and 1.7 for contracts. This is a (very) moderate improvement. It must however be pointed out that, notably for the first call, there have sometimes been improvements in a GAP without a change in score, which is why a column has been included in the above table on the impact of the negotiation. In general, the study team noticed less impact of the negotiation on the quality of the GAPs for projects approved under the second call for Priority 7, with for CIT-4 more GAPs being identical in the proposal and in the technical annex to the contract. This seems to suggest that in these cases, the GAPs were not discussed during the negotiation phase. A possible explanation can of course be the fact that the \u2018original\u2019 quality of the GAPs as included in the proposal was, on average, better than under the first call. However, this does not mean that there was no scope for further improvements. The analysis shows that in one third of the cases (nine of the 29 assessed) the quality of the GAP improved from the proposal to the contract stage. One can assume that these improvements are the result of the contract negotiations. This is a positive finding, although ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 80 the results show that a more significant impact could have been realised. These improvements took mainly place for projects that resulted from the first call, where eight of the 20 projects\u2019 GAPs assessed were of higher quality in the technical annex than in the proposal, while only one out of the nine projects approved under CIT-4 (and for which both proposal and technical annex were reviewed) had an improved GAP in the technical annex. As mentioned above, this could be explained by the fact that the GAPs in the proposals under the second call were in general of higher quality. A negative finding of the study has been that for five projects (of the 29), the quality of the GAP as included in the technical annex of the contract was lower than it had been in the proposal. These are situations that should not occur. Especially for those projects where the original GAP quality was \u2018poor\u2019, bringing these GAPs to a higher level by suggesting improvements would have been quite easy. Loss of quality in the GAP was in all five cases caused by the fact that elements were dropped in the final version of the GAP. The study team considers that five of the projects approved for financing contain an \u2018excellent\u2019 GAP in the technical annex to the contract (two from the first call, and three from the second call). With a view to FP7, the above analysis and resulting findings lead the study team to emphasise the need for (maintained) attention and efforts to improve the integration of gender considerations in the project design at all stages, from proposal preparation through to the the negotiation phase. The team indeed considers it indispensable that gender issues, female participation and equal opportunities issues are already addressed in the proposal (as mandatory elements) , so that there is a basis for negotiation. If the consideration of these elements is not made mandatory during the proposal stage, but as a whole \u2018postponed\u2019 to the negotiation phase, there is a real risk that gender is not adequately integrated anymore in the project design. Also, the shift of all gender considerations to the negotiation phase would constitute a major challenge and might pose considerable difficulties for the Commission staff that would have to lead these negotiations (e.g. for those proposals that passed the evaluation, but are completely \u2018gender blind\u2019). \u2192 Main conclusions : (cid:190) Two out of 20 proposals contracted under the first call were sent in without a GAP. (cid:190) An improvement in the (original) quality of the GAPs has been noticeable for the approved proposals resulting from the second call in comparison to those from the first call. While only half of the GAPs in approved proposals from the first call were of satisfactory quality and covered most or all of the required elements adequately, this share rose to seven out of nine for the assessed GAPs from the second call. (cid:190) There is an impact of the negotiation on the quality of the GAPs : in one third of the cases the quality of the GAP improved from the proposal to the contract stage However, there is still considerable room for further improvements. (cid:190) The study team emphasises the need for (maintained) attention and efforts to improve the integration of gender considerations in the project design during the proposal phase, evaluation phase and during the negotiation phase.

GAP quality as indicator of gender integration in the project The results of the GAP analysis for each project have been compared to the results of the assessment of the treatment of gender in these projects. The aim of this comparison has been to verify the consistency of these results. At the same time, it allows to check the usefulness of a GAP review to assess the overall quality of the project in terms of integration of the gender dimension. The table below presents the results of both analyses. Table 5.21 Correlation between quality of GAPs and quality of gender integration in the project \u2013 Priority 7 (N=34) Project categorisation One-star GAP Two-star GAP Three-star GAP Gender blind - - - Gender is not mentioned, but only of indirect relevance - - - Gender is relevant and mentioned, but not addressed 5 1 - High (embedded) 2 2 5 Medium 3 6 - Gender integrated low 2 6 - Gender specific - 2 - Total sample 12 17 5 Quite logically, as the inclusion of a GAP (\u2018gender action plan\u2019) in the project proposals for Integrated Projects and Networks of Excellence was mandatory, these proposals do mention \u2018gender\u2019. This is the explanation for the fact that the first categories (\u2018gender blind\u2019 and \u2018gender is not mentioned, but only of indirect relevance\u2019) are empty. The following observations can be made on the basis of the above table : \u00b0 All proposals with \u2018three star\u2019 GAPs were found to be integrating gender fully, and gender can hence be considered as \u2018embedded\u2019 in these projects\u2019 designs. \u00b0 The full review of the proposal proves in more than half of the cases that have a \u2018one star\u2019 GAP (7 out of 12) that these projects either poorly address gender, or not at all. This indicates that what is presented in these GAPs is just lip service. \u00b0 Projects that integrate gender to a high extent or that are gender specific do not necessarily reflect this quality in the GAP. Indeed, the analysis seems to indicate that the GAP might be considered as \u2018superfluous\u2019 by these project teams, or as a mere demand for repetition of elements that are elsewhere in the proposal elaborated and detailed. In summary, the findings of the comparative analysis suggest that one cannot a priori conclude on the basis of a low quality GAP that gender is not properly addressed in the project. On the other hand, excellent GAPs do seem to indicate the high level of integration of gender in the project. However, given the small number of projects with GAPs in lot III (34 in total), an analysis based on larger samples would be required to confirm this. ",

Implementation of GAPs In order to check on the implementation of the GAPs, the study team reviewed the completed GAP Interim Implementation Reports (or briefly \u2018GAP questionnaires\u2019) submitted by the project teams. This is a mandatory electronic reporting for project holders of IPs and NoEs, due at the end of the first reporting period. This reporting tool was conceived to be completed by the project coordinator for the whole of the project (in parts 1, 2, 5 and 6) and by each contractor for certain issues (parts 1, 3, and 4) 58 . Instructions on how to complete the questionnaire should be communicated to the project holders by the Commission Project Officer. The GAP questionnaires were available in SESAM for 13 of the 20 projects from CIT1 and CIT3 in the sample by May 2007. No GAP questionnaires were available yet for CIT4 projects as the contracts for these projects were only signed in the second half of 2006, early 2007. In general, the study team found it hard to draw conclusions as to the quality of the GAP implementation by the project holders on the basis of these GAP questionnaires for the following reasons : - there has apparently been confusion among the project holders on how and by whom these GAP questionnaires needed to be filled in : o for 6 of the 13 projects, only one questionnaire was submitted for the whole project and consortium. However, only one of these was complete. The five others missed the part on gender statistics in the work force and \u2018gender actions\u2019 in the project that needed to be completed by each contractor; o for the other 8 projects, the questionnaire part relating to the gender balance in the workforce (statistics) and \u2018gender actions\u2019 in the project was completed for all consortium partners individually (for one project, up to 42 separate sheets were submitted). - the feedback and data provided in these (sometimes partial) questionnaires appeared to be fragmented and of highly variable quality. This observation raises questions as to the useability of SESAM as well as on the use made of these reports by the European Commission. As the study team noted earlier 59 , it appears as if nobody in the Commission monitors the completeness and quality of the reporting by project holders. Nevertheless, the review of these 13 GAP questionnaires revealed that : - only 4 of these projects indicated to have a budget allocated to their GAP (ranging from 20000 euro to 170855 euro); - there are a few projects that demonstrate a positive situation or evolution in terms of gender integration in their project. For example : One NoE of CIT3, which was considered by the study team as poorly integrating gender in the project based on its technical annex, while its GAP was rated as a \u2018two star\u2019 GAP has been the only one to have submitted one, complete GAP report for the whole project and consortium. This GAP report was found to be of acceptable 58 As specified in the document \u2018Project reporting in FP6.

It indicated that a budget of 85000 euro was allocated to the GAP within the project. An IP from CIT1 which mentioned but did not address gender in its technical annex, and of which the GAP was rated as only a \u2018one star\u2019 GAP submitted a GAP report of adequate quality, in which the project team gives a fair view of the status as regards gender. They recognise that \u2018the gender dimension of the research could be enhanced\u2019, a fact that is duly taken on board by the project leaders. At the same time, they demonstrate to have undertaken various action in terms of equal opportunities. \u2192 Main conclusions : (cid:190) The GAP reporting system and design are inadequate for providing an easy or transparent view on the reality of the projects. (cid:190) While it is absolutely legitimate to require reporting from the part of the project holders, the reporting tools should be user-friendly and allowing an effective exploitation of the data provided. However, this is not enough : the Commission also has the duty to monitor and effectively exploit the reporting results. (cid:190) There are nonetheless clear signs that the efforts made towards gender equality in the overall FP6 conception and structure have had positive effects. Such effects would not have been realised without the efforts that were undertaken. It is however indispensable to maintain the efforts not to loose momentum. ",

Gender in the SSP Work Programme and Calls The Work Programme and Calls were reviewed to verify whether the descriptions of eligible tasks under areas 2.5 and 2.6 contained references to gender. Only for SSP 4, for area 2.5. were references to gender included in these documents. One of the four eligible tasks under this area focussed on women (\u2018Integration of Female Immigrants in their Host Societies\u2019). The other tasks under area 2.5 contained no references to gender, and neither did the tasks under area 2.6. Eligible tasks described under SSP 1 do not contain any specific references to gender, despite the fact that gender-relevant issues can be pointed out. For example : \u2022 sub-area 2.5 aims i.a. at bringing forward \u2018better sources for statistics for a better knowledge on migration flows to the EU\u2019 and would benefit from an explicit emphasis on the need to have sex-disaggregated data available; \u2022 sub-area 3.1 aims i.a. at clarifying the \u2018impacts of tax/benefits levels for the pursuit of sustainable development, employment, pensions, social cohesion\u2019, but does not point out that e.g. impacts on employment and pensions might be significantly different for women and men and hence should be assessed distinctly; \u2022 sub-area 3.7 aims at improving \u2018the quality and availability of statistics and indicators of the knowledge-based economy\u2019, but stresses nowhere the importance of consistently making available sex-dissagrageted statistics. Also for SSP 5A, gender relevant issues were ignored in the description of eligible tasks. For example, sub-area 2.5 emphasises the need for \u2018reliable statistical or other empirical data highlighting the illegal immigration phenomenon\u2019 but does not mention that such statistical data should be sex-disaggregated. There is no mention of gender under sub-area 2.6, gender also being of indirect relevance only. 6.1.3. Participation of women and equal opportunities in SSP projects (Lot III) In total, 24 projects have been approved under the sub-areas relevant for Lot III as a result of the SSP calls.

As can be seen in the table below, one out of five SSP projects under the sub-areas relevant for Lot III are co-ordinated by women (or 21 %).

Of the total sample, only one out of six project teams (four out of 24) has a good (or acceptable) male / female balance. Considered as good (or acceptable) have been those project teams with not less than 40% of members from the same sex. This assessment has been made on the basis of the sex of the persons representing the members of the partnership. The composition of the full scientific team might show different results, but was not systematically available. Moreover, even when the full scientific team is listed in proposals, information on the sex of the team members is not always mentioned. The same share applies to the available expertise on gender within the team. In six out of the 23 projects for which the technical annex could be reviewed 61 , there is an indication that the 61 The analysis is based on a review of 23 technical annexes, as for one of the 24 SSP projects the technical annex has not been available to the project team.

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 87 scientific team includes gender expertise. In all cases this is deduced from the presentations or curricula vitae of the team members that were provided in the proposal. When looking at the sex of the coordinators, it appears that gender expertise is available in three teams led by women and in three teams led by men. In six projects, measures are foreseen within the team structure and/or project set-up to ensure that a balanced participation, equal opportunities and/or gender issues are taken into account. Here again, there is an equal division between male and female coordinators. Typical examples of such measures are: (cid:190) the project management will promote the involvement and commitment of women in the research team; (cid:190) special attention will be given for the equal treatment of women and men throughout the implementation of the project; (cid:190) a gender coordinator being formally appointed as responsible, to ensure the integration of gender issues in the work performed; (cid:190) a work package being devoted to \u2018gender\u2019 in relation to the main subject of the research. 6.1.4. Treatment of gender in SSP projects (Lot III) From the 24 SSP projects relevant for Lot III, 23 are STREP\u2019s and 1 is a CA. Two projects are gender specific. The study team reviewed the technical annexes to the contracts of 23 projects. 62 Both gender-specific projects addressed sub-area 2.5, and were submitted in response to the gender-specific eligible task outlined under SSP4. Both projects have a female co-ordinator. As mentioned before, because of the nature of the \u2018Social Sciences and Humanities\u2019, the study team considered all projects as \u2018gender relevant\u2019. Despite the gender relevance of all research topics, there were six out of the 23 projects in the sample that mentioned \u2018gender\u2019 in their proposal, however without effectively addressing it. Table 6.6 Treatment of gender in SPP (N=23) SSP Male coordinator Female coordinator Total % Gender blind 1 1 4 % Gender not mentioned, but only indirectly relevant 7 7 30 % Gender is relevant and mentioned, but not addressed 6 1 7 30 % Gender integrated 4 2 6 26 % Gender specific 2 2 9 % Total 18 5 23 As can be seen in the above table, the proportion of proposals where gender is not mentioned, but only indirectly relevant is quite high (seven out of 23 projects), while the number of proposals where gender is \u2013 to a certain extent \u2013 integrated is eight out of 23 projects. 62 As mentioned above, the technical annex of 1 project had not been available to the study team. This project is a STREP with a male coordinator of Italian nationality. It is not a gender-specific project. ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 88 The study team considered that it can indeed be argued that seven projects address subjects where gender has only indirect significance. Examples of such cases are: the integration of research and standardisation, financial integration, legislative and product crime proofing. The study team concluded that one proposal (of the only CA under these 24 SSP projects) could be categorised as completely \u2018gender blind\u2019 where the research subject is concerned. Gender was not mentioned at all in the project. This SSP project (coordinated by a man) deals with tax/benefit systems and growth potential of the EU: one of the project aims is to analyse the link between tax/benefit systems and (un)employment in the EU. The fact that there are obvious gender issues related to this subject is not recognised nor addressed in the proposal. Looking at the sex of the coordinator, five of the six projects where gender is \u2018mentioned, but not addressed\u2019 are coordinated by men. For the projects considered as \u2018gender-integrated\u2019, it is relevant to look at the depth or \u2018seriousness\u2019 of this integration of the gender dimension by verifying in which parts of the project design gender is mentioned as relevant variable. Indeed, while for three projects gender can be considered to be \u2018embedded\u2019 in the project design, the integration of gender has been rather shallow in the other projects. The table below shows in absolute numbers and in percentages where gender was mentioned as relevant variable in the project design for the gender-integrated projects. Table 6.7 The integration of gender in the project design (gender-integrated SSP projects, N=6) Number In the abstract of the proposal 1 In the inputs 4 In the activities 6 In the planned outputs 3 In the intended impacts 1 The results shown in the table above indicate that even in \u2018gender-integrated\u2019 proposals, where gender is effectively addressed to some extent, the gender dimension is not completely integrated into the project design. The inputs referred to are in most cases human resource inputs, where members of the team have gender expertise or where a specific person is to be appointed as responsible for the integration of gender considerations into the project. In all proposals gender is included in the activities, this is in the vast majority of the cases as a relevant variable in the work to be performed in one or more of the work packages or as a measurement indicator. Two gender-integrated proposals mention gender in relation to outputs, referring to findings or study results relating to gender to be incorporated in reports. ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 89 6.1.5. The gender dimension in the research content in SSP projects (Lot III) The approach taken to gender in the proposals where gender was \u2018integrated\u2019 or the main focus of the work (\u2018gender-specific\u2019) has been analysed. The six \u2018gender-integrated\u2019 projects take into account gender as a relevant variable in their work, although gender is not the main subject or focus of the project. Table 6.8 The approach taken to gender in the gender-integrated projects (N=6) Number Sex disaggregation in statistics 2 Acknowledgment of specific characteristics of women / identification of gender issues to addressed 2 The recognition of gender differences in roles or responsibilities which might be inter-related (gender relations) 2 The recognition of inequalities 1 The recognition of gendered structures or systems (how the differences are (re-)produced or altered) 2 The recognition of gender constructs 0 The way in which gender is considered is equally spread over the different approaches, except for the recognition of gender constructs that can not be found back in any project. Two proposals offer sex-disaggregated statistics (e.g. women unemployment versus total unemployment). Two proposals acknowledge that there are specific issues associated with one sex (e.g. to explore the particular consequences of migration for women (\u2018feminisation of migration\u2019)). Two proposals recognise that there are differences between the sexes in relation to certain topics being studied (e.g. gender differences in the labour market experience and gender- specific jobs) and one proposal that there are gender inequalities (e.g. women\u2019s dependence and lack of decision-making power). Two proposals recognise gendered structures or systems, i.e. the structures and systems that actually (re-)produce or can alter gender inequalities (e.g. the division of labour and caring activities). In three of these six gender-integrated projects, the study team considers gender to be adequately \u2018embedded\u2019 into the research design and work. This indicates that further improvements are still possible. Indeed, while in the other projects there is recognition that gender is a relevant variable to particular aspects of the study and to particular components of the work programme, the gender relevance is overlooked or ignored in other parts. Some examples: In a STREP proposal, the research subject is \u2018international statistics on international migration\u2019. While gender is recognised as being a key variable that will be fully considered in the project and final recommendations as it plays an important role for explaining immigration behaviour, no further explanations are given as to how the research will proceed in measuring the gender variable. A similar remark can be made for a STREP proposal with \u2018organised crime\u2019 as research subject. Gender is proposed as a key variable, important for the promotion of a gender perspective in crime prevention policies and for the methodology to be developed. However, no further explanations are given in the project activities on how gender will be integrated. ",

The project will examine how undocumented migration touches particularly migrant women. A second STREP proposal (with a female coordinator), also submitted under the topic 2.5. One of the objectives here is to explore the particular consequences of migration for women, as there is a \u2018feminization\u2019 of migration. A specific focus will be put on women migrants taking into account all gender-dimensions of immigration. As regards the two gender-specific proposals, both acknowledge that there are specific issues associated with one sex (e.g. life-chances and expectations of immigrant women concerning immigration and integration in the host country) and recognise gendered structures or systems (e.g. policies that affect the integration of migrant women). One of the two proposals also recognises inequalities (e.g. differences between migrant men and women in policies and theories) and a gender construct (the male breadwinner model).

The activities implemented by other services are covered by Lot IV 64 . An overview of the activities that have taken place in the whole of FP6 under the above- mentioned subareas is included in annex to this document. As can be seen on this overview, these activities have been implemented through various mechanisms and approaches : public procurement (calls for tenders and existing framework contracts), expert groups, calls for proposals, and various arrangements with other Bodies (JRC, European Investment Fund). 6.2.1. The treatment of gender in the work undertaken A first observation that can be made when reviewing the activities undertaken is that none is gender specific. Under subarea 3.1 (\u2018monitoring and analysis of science and technology foresight and indicator activities\u2019), a study on SSH indicators 65 was launched. The study team reviewed the Terms of Reference (ToR) for this study. As background for the study, these ToR state (on page 2) : \u201cThere are relatively few indicators for R&D expenditure and human resources in the field of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) by comparison with the other fields of sciences. Yet, it is important to fill in existing gaps in statistical information on Social Sciences and Humanities R&D expenditure and human resources and to improve the quality of information in order to compare performances. Furthermore, there is a need to examine whether research activities in the Social Sciences and Humanities differ from those in the area of natural sciences and engineering upon which the existing technical definitions and concepts of the traditional Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) indicators are largely based.\u201d However, while the description of the tasks includes \u201c an assessment of the gender dimension in Social Sciences and Humanities research across the individual countries compared to the other fields of sciences\u201d (p. 5), the need for sex-disaggregated data and statistics wherever relevant is not stated. This is perceived as a major shortcoming by the study team. Indeed, it is highly 63 The Directorate K \u2018Social sciences and humanities; foresight\u2019 existed under FP6 till October 2006 and was either fully (3.1) or jointly (3.2 \u2013 3.4) in charge of the implementation of these activities. In October 2006, a unit named \u2018Research in the economic, social sciences and humanities\u2019 under the then formed Directorate L \u2018Science, economy and society\u2019 was created instead. 64 Terms of reference, page 3, footnote 13. 65 Code: INDICATORS IN SSH \u2013 2005 \u2013 01 ",

An important part of the work undertaken under the subarea 3.2 \u2018benchmarking research policies\u2019 consisted in activities to support the Open Method of Coordination in favour of the Barcelona research investment objective (the so-called \u201c3% objective\u201d) 66 . The CREST report on the first cycle of the implementation of the OMC to the 3% objective 67 contains 30 recommendations grouped in five areas, corresponding to the themes on which the respective expert groups had worked (cfr. below): (cid:190) Public research spending and policy mixes (cid:190) Public research base and its links to industry (cid:190) Fiscal measures and research (cid:190) Intellectual property and research (cid:190) SMEs and research This overall report does not contain any reference to gender. Reviewing the reports on the first cycle of the individual experts groups, it appears that gender issues have hardly been addressed, if at all, by these various expert groups. Nevertheless, some gender relevant issues could be identified, e.g. : (cid:190) the expert group working on \u2018public research spending and policy mixes\u2019 drew up a state- of-the-art about present national policy mixes, but ignored in this picture the place and importance of the gender dimension in these national policy mixes; they debated i.a. about appropriate indicators for measuring progress, assessing impact and setting targets at EU and national levels, but again omitted to explicitly mention the need for gender- disaggregated statistics; (cid:190) the group working on \u2018fiscal measures\u2019 considers the positive effects of fiscal measures on the attractiveness of research careers and recommends that countries, using measures in this field, monitor and evaluate such results. An additional request to assess any gender differences in this respect has been found missing. The study team found no references whatsover to gender issues in the work of the expert groups on \u2018SME and research\u2019, \u2018the public research base\u2019 and on \u2018IPR and research\u2019, but recognises that the topics addressed by these groups were only of indirect gender relevance. 6.2.2. Participation of women in expert groups Various expert groups have been set up in the context of the \u2018Support for the Coherent Development of Policies\u2019 activities relevant for Lot III. One set of expert groups concerns the so-called CREST expert groups, which were set up to support CREST in the application of the Open Method of Coordination in favour of the Barcelona research investment objective. Data about the composition of these five expert groups (for the first and second cycle 68 ) are presented in the table below. These tables show that the share of women in the CREST expert groups (26 % on average) remains significantly below the 40% target. 66 The Barcelona objective aims at increasing R&D investment in the EU to 3% of GDP by 2010. 67 CREST 1206/04, Brussels, 14 October 2004. 68 A first cycle (5 groups) was concluded in June 2004; a second cycle (5 groups) started in January 2005.

Results of the survey among National Contact Points 7.1 Introduction National Contact Points (NCPs) play an important role as a communication channel towards potential participants in the Framework Programme. Their role is essentially to act as a relay between the European Commission and potential proposers. They organise awareness raising actions, information actions related to calls and often also offer in addition to information services, advisory services depending on their host\u2019s organisation strategies. The profile of NCPs is very diverse, and even if they have a relationship with the European Commission, they are normally appointed by the Member States. Because of their important role, it was decided from the start of the monitoring studies to involve them. For practical reasons, and reasons of efficiency, it was decided to organise one central survey instead of having all contractors for the different lots organise their own survey. The questionnaire was prepared by the coordinator of the different gender monitoring studies. Input was asked from the contractors of different lots. We have noticed that the input provided by our study team was not taken into account in the questionnaire design. The survey was organised in October \u2013 November 2005. It was a web-based questionnaire (self-completion by the respondent) with as many open questions as closed questions. The results of the survey were made available by the coordinator in May 2006 to the contractors of the different lots. This analysis is based on the data received. Two sets of data were received: - the full information on 86 questionnaires in the form of an excel table - the sub-set of information for a sample of 32 questionnaires from the NCPs in charge of the domains covered by our lot (lot III). The analysis below is essentially a comparison between the group of 32 respondents in charge of our domains (Knowledge Society and \u2018Science and Society\u2019) in comparison to the \u2018other\u2019 NCPs who do not have this responsibility (a group of 54 respondents). This section is split into four parts: - a first part covering the sample and profile of the NCPs - a second part covering the actions undertaken linked to gender mainstreaming - a third part covering more qualitative subjects and opinions of the NCPs - and some conclusions from the survey ",

Of these: o 29 said to have Knowledge Society as part of their responsibility o 29 said to have Science and Society among their responsibility o 32 said to have either one or both domains under their responsibility. It is difficult to define the universe because the universe is unclear, in order to estimate the response rate. Based on the \u2018official\u2019 NCPs for both domains, we have a response rate that should be around 40 % which is high for this type of survey. In practice, the response rate is much lower as there are more potential respondents than the \u2018official\u2019 universe. To give an example, for one organisation acting as NCP, the official contact person did not answer the questionnaire, but two of the colleagues within the same NCP have answered the questionnaire, and indicated they are in charge of one of the domains. The overall impression is that the response rate is \u201cas could be expected\u201d from a self-completion survey, with a rate that is between 10 and 20 %. The highest number of responses comes from Germany (10/86). There are four countries from which no response was received (Luxembourg, Hungary, Slovakia and Israel). For our lot (III), the country coverage is less good and NCPs from some large countries have not responded (e.g. France and Spain).

NCPs for lot III are also much more centralised organisations than other NCPs. Nearly all NCPs not covering Knowledge Society and Science & Society, said they had a decentralised structure with multiple contact points (48 out of 54) against half of the NCPs from the sub- sample in covering lot III.

This section starts with a question \u201cHas your NCP dealt with the issue of gender mainstreaming to date ?\u201d If the answer was positive, the other questions in the section were asked, if not, the whole section was skipped, including unfortunately a number of questions that would nevertheless have been relevant.

This result is probably the most important result of the survey: it means that slightly less than 1 out of 3 NCPs have actually dealt in a way or another with the gender mainstreaming issue when promoting FP6 or assisting the various target groups. We can assume that the sample is positively biased, as NCPs having taken action are more likely to have answered the questionnaire 69 . Based on this assumption, the real proportion of NCPs having taken action is probably significantly lower than this one third result from the survey. This figure is on the one hand low, but on the other hand relatively high as well. The survey done among NCPs of INFSO came up with the result that none of the NCPs had actually dealt with the subject. The proportion of lot III NCPs having dealt with gender mainstreaming is significantly higher (41 % against 26 %), but the importance is also higher as can be seen from the following table.

Two informations are provided: 69 This is one of the disadvantages of self-completion questionnaires: there is self-selection by the respondent, and it is impossible to know the bias this creates. 70 This is an assumption, as the way the questions were formulated one cannot be completely sure how they were interpreted by the respondents.

This is provided by the number of valid responses. The NCPs that did not use an activity are reported as n/a. - how important this activity is in their overall activities. The importance is provided by a score, where 5 is very important. The first table gives the results for the full sample. The second table only for the NCPs covering lot III domains. These results confirm that NCPs for lot III are more active than other NCPs. This is the case across all types of activities. The difference is however highest on the last activity mentioned in the table which covers gender in the research content: 11 of the 16 NCPs reporting activity on this subject are from the Lot III group. The results also show that Lot III NCPs attach more importance to the activities they undertake.

The types of queries received are mainly: - how to integrate gender into the project application (8) - how to draw up a gender action plan (5) With regard to the promotion of gender mainstreaming, a question was asked on the prominence placed either on boosting female participation or on integrating the gender dimension in the research content.

The highest need is for specific information tools and training. The Vademecum on gender mainstreaming in FP6 is a specific tool that was developed by the Women & Science unit. It is a tool destined to scientific officers, but is known outside the Commission. Half of the NCP sample says to know the Vademecum and their assessment on the tool is very positive. The awareness of the tool is much higher among the NCPs from lot III. This makes sense as they are much more likely to be in contact with the Science & Society Directorate and therefore having had access to the document.

The same small group of 27 NCPs having said to have dealt with the issue of gender mainstreaming had to answer a question on the extent to which the NCP network itself had been useful as an awareness-raising mechanism about gender mainstreaming in FP6.

We have limited our analysis to the 32 questionnaires of NCPs responsible for Lot III domains and have not compared with the other lots. The analysis is essentially qualitative and should be interpreted with caution because of the limitations of the method and the small size of the sample. Whenever meaningful, we compare two sub-samples: on the one hand the group of 13 respondents who said they have \u201cdealt with the issue of gender mainstreaming\u201d and the group of 19 NCPs who answered no to that same question. The first question asked to the NCPs in this section was: What are the key issues / main obstacles in your view in increasing female participation rates in the thematic area covered by your NCP (and in FP6 overall if you have thoughts)? Analysing the texts, answers can be grouped in three main categories: - those who consider there are no obstacles, or that this is not an issue for FP6; - those who have an opinion and give an answer to the question (other than the one above) - those who do not reply or have no opinion. Regarding the first set of answers, this can sometimes be long responses as they can be very short. An example of a short reply is \u201cthere are no obstacles\u201d, or \u201cmy country does not have a gender problem\u201d. Long replies can sometimes be very extensive, with real testimonios of personal experience of the type \u201cmy wife is a scientist and there is no discrimination\u201d, and with justifications for a conclusion that \u2018this is not an issue\u2019 with arguments like: - \u201cequality is important, but, if a male would deal with an issue more competently than this should be considered\u201d - \u201c\u2026 So I consider the female participation rates as a kind of artificial problem\u201d. - \u201c \u2026 if the appropriate researcher who has the knowledge for that project solution, is a man, how to transform him into a woman ?\u201d Table 7.16 Grouping of answers to the question \u201ckey issues / main obstacles for female participation\u201d \u2013 N=32 Total sample lot III (n=32) Sub-sample \u201cdealt with gender\u201d (n=13) Sub-sample \u201cdid not deal with gender\u201d (n=19) No obstacles 17 4 10 Other answer 8 7 8 No reply 3 2 1 The second question was similar but dealt with the content of the research.

Still, in these domains, a majority of NCPs has not taken any action whether proactive or reactive. The actual proportion of NCPs having dealt with gender mainstreaming is difficult to estimate. A reliable source is the survey conducted for INFSO where none of the NCPs interviewed were active. For Lot III NCPs covering Knowledge Society and Science and Society, the proportion would be 40% based on the self-completion survey results. For the other domains (NCPs not covering lot III), the proportion is 25 %. We do however consider it is probable that responses are positively biased (proportionately more NCPs who took action on gender have answered the survey than those who did not take action). The reasons of this situation need to be further analysed through other means. Based on the analysis of this survey results, the two main hypotheses as to the reasons are (complementing each other): - the fact NCPs consider gender mainstreaming is not relevant for their scientific domain; - the opinion of a majority of the NCPs that female participation and gender mainstreaming of the research content are irrelevant issues . Factors linked to the demand from the market are impossible to judge based on this survey. NCPs who have been active on gender mainstreaming: - have been able to handle all the questions they received; - have had no training on gender mainstreaming; - consider they need training and could use additional tools.

Conclusions and recommendations Main findings from the Gender Monitoring Study (Lot III) Conditions have been created for a significant potential impact of gender equality and gender mainstreaming in FP6 compared with FP5 Looking at the whole programming and implementation cycle, many improvements have been made in comparison to the previous FP5: the vademecum, inclusion of clear messages on gender equality and gender mainstreaming in most of the communication, etc. Most of the recommendations made in the relevant FP5 gender impact study have been implemented by the Commission. However, the uptake and use of available instruments to facilitate the gender mainstreaming in the processes and projects could have been better. Overall, the results of the monitoring work demonstrate a significant improvement in terms of progress towards gender equality in FP6 in comparison to FP5. This positive effect results from the clear efforts made under FP6 to mainstream gender throughout the Framework Programme. The positive effects weakened towards the end of the FP6 period. This observation underlines the need to maintain the efforts and to be persistent in the striving for gender equality in the research area. The fact that the effects in terms of gender weakened towards the end of the FP6 period shows that continued efforts are necessary to keep up the results. In total, 39 gender specific projects have been approved for funding under the FP6 research areas relevant to this Lot III (\u2018Science and Society\u2019, Priority 7 and the SSP calls related to Priority 7). (cid:190) There are 31 gender specific projects in the \u2018Science and Society\u2019 area. (cid:190) There are 6 gender specific projects in Priority 7. (cid:190) There are 2 gender specific projects in the Priority 7- related SSP field. The 40 % target for women participation in committees and panels of FP6 is (nearly) met, and overall, statistics are good in terms of gender balance. The table below presents a selection of key quantitative results of the review.

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 106 There are important differences in the application of the agreed processes, and the understanding and appreciation of gender issues by various actors involved differed widely The way gender issues have been handled by proposal evaluators, by independent observers, by project officers, etc. has not been consistent. These differences can lead to an unequal treatment of proposals. Furthermore, this situation underlines that meeting quantitative targets is not enough. The \u201cDescartes Prizes\u201d have failed to show any progress towards \u2018gender equality\u2019 in their area during FP6. The Descartes Prizes have consistently shown negative results : the \u2018Guidance Notes for Evaluators\u2019 contained no reference whatsoever to \u2018gender\u2019, and only four of all 27 Descartes Prizes for research and communication under FP6 were awarded to women (8%). This share is significantly below the average proportion of women among the coordinators/authors (15%). This specific case shows that when gender is not explicitly included among the evaluation criteria (e.g. under \u2018excellence\u2019), it tends not to be considered at all. National Contact Points are under-utilised in creating awareness for gender mainstreaming. The main barrier to increase their role is the low awareness of individuals inside the NCP organisation about the relevance of the issue. A modest investment in training and support could already have a very significant impact. The findings from the ESR (Evaluation Summary Reports) analysis indicate that the assessment of gender (participation of women, equal opportunities, integration of the gender dimension in the research contents) by the evaluators has not been systematic and consistent. There are signals of uncertainty and lack of capacity among the evaluators to deal with this. (cid:190) A majority of the ESRs do not make any reference to gender, suggesting that evaluators often ignored the gender dimension despite the evident gender relevance of projects within the Science and Society activity area and within Priority 7. (cid:190) The vast majority of remarks relating to gender deal with the gender dimension in the research contents, which is a positive observation. (cid:190) A high proportion of statements concerning gender in ESRs says something positive or merely make a \u2018neutral\u2019 observation. (cid:190) Only a minority of ESRs contain a critical remark concerning gender and / or the identification of specific areas where gender was not or insufficiently addressed in the research proposal. Projects coordinated by women are more likely to take measures to ensure attention for gender and equal participation. This is the case for \u2018Science and Society\u2019, as well as for Priority 7. (cid:190) Female coordinators in Science and Society do however less often foresee gender expertise in the team, probably because they consider it sufficiently covered by the rate of female participation. (cid:190) In Priority 7, female coordinators are more likely than men to foresee gender expertise in the team. ",

(cid:190) The ways to address gender which are most common among the gender relevant projects are: acknowledging specific research issues (38%) and recognising inequalities (21 %). (cid:190) The proportion of projects that recognise the existence of gendered structures, systems and/or constructs is 9 % of the gender relevant projects (or 10 % when excluding the projects that were considered gender blind or where gender is only indirectly relevant). (cid:190) Only a minority of gender relevant projects truly integrate or \u2018embed\u2019 gender in their project design. Of those who treat gender in their proposal (79% of all gender relevant projects), 9 out of 10 have foreseen actions in their activities, half have foreseen inputs and only one third describes outputs. For Priority 7 (Social Sciences and Humanities) : The proportion of \u2018gender integrated\u2019 projects is quite high (six out of ten). However, one out of three projects does not address gender, and a majority of those that do address gender demonstrates an incomplete understanding and treatment of the gender dimension. There is hence much scope for further improvements. (cid:190) The fact that the proportion of \u2018gender integrated\u2019 projects is quite high is obviously a positive observation and a significant improvement in comparison to FP5. This positive result can certainly be attributed to the emphasis put by the Commission on gender in FP6. (cid:190) Even in gender-integrated proposals, the gender dimension is not completely integrated into the project design : while nearly all gender-integrated proposals have integrated gender in their activities, only about 70% of them also make provisions in relation to gender in the inputs of their project. (cid:190) The recognition of gender differences in roles or responsibilities is the most frequently occuring approach taken to gender (in six out of ten gender-integrated projects). (cid:190) It is encouraging that nearly half of the gender-integrated projects also recognise gender structures or systems (i.e. how the differences are reproduced or altered). GAPs can be considered as an adequate tool to integrate gender in projects and manage the gender dimension. Still, it is underutilised at all levels, and there have even been projects approved for funding that did not include a GAP in their proposal. There is confusion among proposers and evaluators as to what elements are to be covered in a Gender Action Plan. Nevertheless, six out of 10 GAPs in proposals that have been approved for funding can be considered of satisfactory quality. On the other hand, proposals without GAP, while the inclusion of a GAP was mandatory, should never have passed the evaluation stage. It can even be questioned whether these should have entered the evaluation stage, as they were not in compliance with the formal requirements. ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 108 There is a clear impact of the negotiation on the quality of the GAPs : in one third of the cases, the quality of the GAP improved from the proposal to the contract stage. However, there remains significant scope for improvement. 65 % of the GAPs in technical annexes are of satisfactory to excellent quality. Nevertheless, in five cases (out of 29 cases, being 17 %) the quality of the GAP is considered to have decreased. Success rates of female and male proposers are approximately equal, both in the Science & Society activity area and for Priority 7. The \u2018Science and Society\u2019 and GAP reporting system and design are inadequate for providing an easy or transparent view on the reality of the projects. While it is absolutely legitimate to require reporting from the part of the project holders, the reporting tools should be user-friendly and allowing an effective exploitation of the data provided. This has not been the case with the tools used under FP6. Apart from the share of female coordinators in financed projects, the results for the SSP (Scientific Support to Policies) areas that are related to Priority 7 are in line with the Priority 7 findings.

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 109 8.2 Recommendations on integrating gender in Programme and Projects First and foremost, the study team strongly emphasises the need to maintain efforts towards gender equality also in FP7 in order not to loose momentum. The results in terms of \u2018progress towards gender equality\u2019 in FP6 show a significant improvement in comparison to FP5, resulting from the clear efforts made under FP6. It is however indispensable to maintain, and even further reinforce, the efforts under FP7. Otherwise, these positive effects will quickly be lost. Based on the study findings, a number of specific recommendations and suggestions for improvements are put forward : \u2022 It is suggested to ensure that among all groups of actors and at all levels in the preparation and management of the Framework Programme, there are participants with gender expertise. Only by ensuring the availability of gender expertise at all stages in the conception, preparation and implementation of the Framework Programme can gender be adequately addressed and integrated also at the EU level. \u2022 Structural provisions and formal requirements in the Framework Programme are indispensable for realising advancements towards both participation of women and integration of gender issues in the research content : - the Work Programmes and Calls are very important instruments and should include the identification of gender-relevant topics. As the study demonstrated that those calls that include gender-specific topics and/or where gender relevant issues are explicitly suggested have had an immediate effect (in terms of higher female participation rates in the projects and more gender-aware research), it is important to involve gender experts in the drafting of Work Programmes so that the gender-relevant issues can be identified and included among the suggested research topics; - Include in the Guide for Proposers a clear instruction to proposers to demonstrate (efforts to realise) a gender balance in their management and research team, and to indicate not only how gender is relevant to the research topic / action but also how the project will adddress these issues and with which means (in terms of budgetary and staff resources). - It is suggested to require that proposers (at the proposal stage) commit themselves to produce outputs / deliverables devoted to the gender-related work, results and findings. Such deliverables should be included in the deliverables list. Making at least one gender-specific output / deliverable mandatory for each project would be an additional encouragement for projects to take gender seriously, instead of providing just lip-service. - As regards the evaluation of project proposals, there should be provisions to ensure that expert evaluators\u2019 judgements with respect to gender are reflected in the final evaluation outcome of the proposal (with the exception of Networks of Excellence, gender issues are not reflected in the marks given to proposals). Especially when judging the \u2018scientific excellence\u2019 of a project, the relevance and adequacy of the coverage of gender issues should be one of the factors to be considered. - In FP6, mandatory Gender Action Plans (GAPs ) have clearly had a positive effect and have largely contributed to raising awareness and competence. It is therefore highly recommendable to re-introduce GAPs as mandatory in the research proposals. It is indispensable that gender issues, female participation and equal opportunities issues are already addressed in the proposal, so that there is a basis for negotiation. If the consideration of these elements is as a whole \u2018postponed\u2019 to the negotiation ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 110 phase, there is a real risk that gender is not adequately integrated anymore in the project. Also, such shift to the negotiation phase poses a major challenge and might cause considerable difficulties for the Commission staff that have to lead these negotiations (e.g. for those proposals that passed the evaluation, but are completely \u2018gender blind\u2019). - \u2018Gender\u2019 considerations should be explicitly included in the selection criteria for the Descartes Research and Communication Prize. \u2022 Further monitoring and evaluation of progress towards gender equality, also under FP7, is necessary. To enable such work, it is necessary that consistent and relevant data are timely available, and that effective data management and reporting tools are used by the European Commission : - the standardisation of the \u2018Evaluation Reports\u2019, with systematic integration of a set of gender-related items, would be a significant improvement. These evaluation reports, produced by the DG Research\u2019 responsible services, report upon each individual evaluation session. These reports should include sex breakdowns of the evaluation panel; indication of the sex of the independent observer; sex breakdowns of coordinators and of participants in proposals that were evaluated, as well as in proposals that were evaluated above all thresholds. Ideally, it should also indicate the number of gender specific proposals that were evaluated and those that were retained for funding. - reporting tools for project holders need to comprise elements to monitor and evaluate the state-of-play and the progress. (Online) reporting tools imposed on project holders should be more user-friendly, allow an effective exploitation of the data provided, and instructions as to how to complete them should be clear and unambiguous. - However, the above is not enough : the Commission also has the duty to monitor and effectively exploit the reporting results, and project officers should review all the reporting, including the online reporting, submitted by the project holders (as there are clear signs that this has not been the case). \u2022 The collection and availability of sex dis-aggregated data can be enhanced : - while data on the sex of coordinators and participants is asked and encoded by the European Commission, this data should be included in reports (more) systematically; - data on the sex of researchers in projects should be asked to project holders, should be centrally stored, monitored and periodically reported upon by the Commission services, per scientific field and ideally also per instrument; - there remain various actors in the FP6 (panels, committees, Grand Juries) for which sex breakdowns remain to be encoded systematically. \u2022 Central data management at the European Commssion can be improved : - the data and tools available at the European Commission for managing the Framework Programme have been insufficiently consistent, available and operational to allow an effective exploitation of data; - figures and tables produced and used by the Commission\u2019s responsible services should be consistent (as underlying definitions are sometimes different). \u2022 Instruments and tools are needed to facilitate the mainstreaming and integration of gender in the Framework Programme process and projects : - while for key actors gender briefings / trainings should be provided, support should be available for all actors in the Frameowrk Programme, at all stages; ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 111 - providing good practice examples is an effective way to convince all actors and to avoid the \u2018lip service\u2019 practice; - access to further information, tools, and possibly assistance should be readily available; - the existing tools, i.a. those produced by the responsible unit in the DG Research 71 , should be used more systematically by all actors, including the various responsible Commission services. Specifically in relation to the Gender Action Plan (GAP) , the study team makes the following recommendations : (cid:190) it is suggested not to distinguish between GAP and \u2018gender issues\u2019 in the required sections for the proposal : if a GAP is required, this should cover both the efforts made or planned towards a balanced participation of women and towards equal opportunities, and the integration of gender issues in the research work; (cid:190) (only) for gender specific projects, a GAP should not be required : the project focus being gender, a GAP seems superfluous for these projects. However, it could still be required to specify the efforts made or planned towards a \u2018balanced participation\u2019; (cid:190) require that elements contained in the GAP, related to gender issues and contents of / approaches to the work, are integrated in the relevant parts of the proposal : in many proposals, the elements that are contained in the GAP are not integrated in the relevant sections of the proposal (objectives of the work, description of activities under the various work packages, e.a.). This gives rise to concerns whether these elements will effectively be addressed, or whether they are merely \u2018lip service\u2019. If gender issues are really embedded in the research, they should therefore be elaborated upon throughout the proposal; (cid:190) improve the \u2018Guide for Proposers\u2019 as to the contents of the GAP : a clearer listing of elements that are expected to be contained in a GAP would certainly help proposers to produce better and more comprehensive GAPs. The study team proposes to require the following elements to be set out in the GAP : \u2022 how the project addresses women\u2019s participation and equal opportunities : in terms of composition of the research team, of management and decision-making structures, as participants in training, mobility and dissemination activities; \u2022 in relation to the contents of the (research and other) work : the identification of specific issues with particular gender relevance in the subject of the research and how these will be integrated in the work; \u2022 in terms of methodology and tools for research and other activities (such as communication) : how gender sensitivity of research instruments, methods, tools, sample and case study selection, data analysis, as well as gender-neutral language in communications will be ensured; \u2022 the GAP should be as specific as possible with regard to the proposed measures, approaches and resources that are or will be mobilised in the project to effectively address the gender issues (in terms of participation, equal opportunities, gender issues related to the subject of the work). Furthermore, any gender-specific outputs should be specified in the GAP. 71 The former \u2018Women and Science\u2019 unit in the DG Research. ",

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 117 Gender issues within the activity\u2018Science and Society\u2019 The main objective of this activity is \u201c\u2026to develop structural links between institutions and activities concerned with the dialogue between the scientific community and society at large \u201d (FP6 in Brief). The \u2018Science and Society\u2019 activity comprises the following three actions: 1) Bringing research closer to society - Science and governance: analyse and support best practice, develop new consultation mechanisms - Scientific advice and reference systems: exchange of experience and good practice; monitoring the production of scientific advice worldwide b) Responsible research and application of science and technology - Ethics: networking between existing bodies and activities, promotion of dialogue in a global context, awareness raising, training, research on ethics in relation to science and technology - Uncertainty, risk and the precautionary principle: analysis and best practice c) Stepping up the science-society dialogue and women in science - Public awareness of science and science communication - Awards for scientific achievement, collaboration and communication - Promoting young people\u2019s interest in science and scientific careers - Women and science It should be noted that, although \u2018women and science\u2019 constitutes a specific theme within the Science and Society activities, all themes in this activity have a strong gender dimension and are, therefore tightly connected with women and science issues. Given this, this bibliographical review will take a broader perspective than one that is narrowly focused on the under-representation of women in science and scientific decision-making. This is done in order to consider issues concerned with gender biases in: i) the values, methods and content of science; ii) the teaching and dissemination of scientific knowledge; iii) the criteria of scientific excellence (and therefore the appointment and promotion processes); iv) science organisations, such as universities and research councils; v) scientific leadership; v) the ethics of science. The gendered patterns of participation in science and scientific research have received a great deal of attention in academic research. What follows is a review of the literature from the period Jan 2000-May 2005, with an aim to update the literature review undertaken by Mary Braithwaite in this area of research, as part of her report on the gender impact assessment of the FP5 Programme \u201cImproving the human research potential and the socio-economic knowledge base\u201d. Recent published data on the participation of women in scientific research in the European Union clearly show the extent of women\u2019s under-representation in this field. Despite recent improvements, European women continue to be considerably under-represented as PhD graduates, as researchers, as senior academics, and as members of scientific boards. The data also clearly reveals both horizontal and vertical patterns in the under-representation of women in science. Thus the proportion of women working in the natural sciences, mathematics and ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 118 computing is significantly lower than that in other fields of research, such as the humanities and the social sciences. At the same time, women scientists are concentrated in the lower positions of the hierarchical system of scientific organisations while the top positions (including management and leadership positions) are mainly filled by men. This is quite evident with regard to data on the proportion of women in senior academic positions in the natural sciences, which tends to be lower than 10% in the majority of the countries for which data is available. (European Commission, 2003, SHE Figures, Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities). Studies on the gendered patterns of participation in science have multiple foci of attention. These can be roughly divided into the following categories: \u2022 Conceptualising the relationship between gender and science \u2022 Understanding the origins and causes that are responsible for gender biases in scientific participation \u2022 Formulating strategies for action Given the prominence given to issues of citizenship and democracy in FP6, the term \u2018participation in science\u2019 is here broadly understood, taken to refer not only to issues of representation in scientific research and leadership but also to issues of participation by the broader public. A key concept in this literature review, is thus the \u2018democratization of science\u2019 \u23af a process consisting in making citizens (men and women equally) the principal beneficiaries of science, and to promote a dialogue between them and scientific research and institutions. The democratization of science is, in sum, about giving citizens the opportunity to reflect, anticipate, and negotiate on new directions in science and technology. However, such processes of democratisation are also deeply gendered. This is particularly obvious in some areas of medicine and biology \u23af such as genetics and reproductive technologies, amongst others \u23af that affect women in particular, and which have become contested areas for women and feminist groups. Other issues related to gender and democracy in science are: i) the inclusion of women in research, especially biomedical research, and ii) their participation in ethical debates in relation to scientific research, such as bioethics. Conceptualising gendered patterns of participation in science and scientific decision-Making There are various ways in which the phenomenon of gendered participation in sicience has been conceptualised, and it has not necessarily always regarded as a \u2018problem\u2019. Thus, according to Siann and Callahan (2001) gendered patterns of participation are primarily a function of women\u2019s positive choices and consequently not something to be concerned about In cases where such patterns are regarded as a problem, there is not a uniform sense of the nature of the problem, and there is instead a significant level of divergence with respect to the kind of problem it is considered to be. Thus Palomba and Menniti (2002: 11) represent the problem of women in science as having been conceptualised in three different ways: \u2022 As a \u201csocial\u201d problem, according to which women in the scientific world are seen as disadvantaged people who need to be \u2018protected\u2019; \u2022 As a problem of equity, according to which there are rights that are being disregarded to a greater or lesser extent, which in turns affects the democratization of the scientific world; \u2022 As a problem of a waste of talent (by universities, research institutions and companies) in the scientific development of different countries.

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 119 However, other authors do not see that the under-representation of women constitutes the primary problem and therefore do not regard increasing the number of women in science as the principal policy goal. Instead, such authors represent the issue as a problem of the gendering of scientific research per se. This, it has been argued, constitutes one important explanation for persistent under-representation of women. However, others criticise this approach for its failure to make a distinction between the concept of \u2018sex\u2019, and that of \u2018gender\u2019. From this point of view, the problem is a socially constructed gender problem and not simply (or primarily) a problem of the numbers and proportions of women in science (Gilbert and Calvert 2003). Accordingly, different ways of conceptualizing the problem generate different research questions and distinct research methods, which in turn have implications regarding policy responses Factors that explain the gender-gap in science The vast majority of studies on women and science examine the factors that contribute to the gender-gap in the participation and representation of women in science. These factors constitute a set of interrelated issues, which are included here under the broad categories of science education and science institutions, together with other (more specific) issues such as standards of scientific quality, reconciling work and family life, and the role of networks. It should be noted that gender stereotyping is often regarded as a key element that underlies all these issues, and this is something that is acknowledged (either explicitly or implicitly) in most of the literature reviewed in this section. However, since gender stereotyping is usually considered to be a factor sitting on a deeper level than the other ones, in this review it is not examined in isolation but as part of the review of each of the different issues identified in the literature. Overall, much of the research on women and science that is reviewed here takes a gender, rather than a woman\u2019s, perspective. This implies the recognition that science, far from being neutral, is gendered, and that such gendered dimensions are socially constructed. This perspective is important, insofar as it carries an implicit criticism of a framework according to which the problem is located not in science per se, but in women. Another important feature of recent literature on gender and science is the increasing attention paid to its institutional and organisational aspects. Thus, a large body of research focuses on the gender impacts of recent university reforms. Science Education The prevalence of gender stereotyping in education, including science education, was identified by the EU funded project EQUAPOL (Braithwaite 2005) as one of the major challenges for an EU strategy of mainstreaming gender equality. Nevertheless, this is an area that appears to beunduly neglected by EU policy, despite the fact that a significant number of studies contend that the continuous attrition among women all along the science \u2018pipeline\u2019 can be partly attributed to how science is taught and practiced. Why are women deterred from pursuing a scientific career in the first place? Common factors examined in the literature include the design of the science curriculum, teaching and learning materials and strategies, as well as teaching practices and behaviours. Regarding the science curriculum, a number of studies point out that it tends to be primarily designed for boys since it is based on their interests and experiences while ignoring those of girls. For example, a recent research project carried out in the UK found that while girls and boys have similar levels of interest in science, they are interested in different aspects of it, withgirls found to be more concerned than boys about the ethical issues surrounding the subject (Haste 2004). This issue of the gendered nature of the science curriculum is explored by Hughes (2001), Gilbert (2001) and Lett (2001), all of which offer an anti-essentialist account of women and science ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 120 and advocate a reform of the curriculum that allows women to participate in science education as \u2018women\u2019 rather than as \u2018substitute men\u2019. Another criticism of \u2018essentialist\u2019 accounts of women and science is provided by a study on the attitudes of Scottish girls and boys over the age of 10-18. This study found that, while attitudes towards science are equally positive among girls and boys towards the end of primary school, by the end of the second year of secondary school there is a marked decline of girls\u2019 attitudes towards science relative to that of boys. (Reid 2003). In explaining this phenomenon the study observed that the actual character of the applications of physics has a differential appeal for boys and girls at school level. Thus girls are much more drawn to those themes that are perceived to have a high social relevance, while boys tend to be more attracted to those themes that are perceived to have a high mechanical or practical relevance. The study concluded that the physics syllabus needs to be gender-balanced so that in includes both the interests of both boys and girls. The gendered nature of learning materials and classroom learning activities are also issues examined in the literature on gender and science education. In relation to the former, important forms of gender bias in texts and other curriculum materials include lack of gender inclusive language; masculine images and the exclusion of the feminine in course content and images; sexist assumptions; de-contextualisation and lack of reference to the social relevance of science and to domains of interest to women; lack of connection to the students' world; lack of reference to the community of distinguished female scientists and of science careers for women; representation of women in passive, subordinate or decorative roles. Zittleman and Sadker (2002) report on the results of a content analysis of 23 recently published teacher education textbooks. They discovered that \u2018[d]espite decades of research documenting gender bias in education and the creation of resources to respond to such bias, these 23 teacher education texts devote only about 3 percent of their space to gender\u2019 (Zittleman and Sadker 2002: 59). The three science methods texts included in the survey, all published between 2000 and 2001, avoided presenting the kind of \u2018overt and harmful stereotypes\u2019 that might have been promoted 20 years previously, yet devoted just 1.1% of their space to gender issues and mentioned no female scientists. Science textbooks also tend to provide an individualistic image of science while its communal aspects tend to be invisible. Thus they fail to contextualize scientific inquiry in our society. This fact not only constitutes a significant barrier to any process of democratizing science, but it also has a gendered impact, as evidence shows that girls are more interested in science when scientific inquiry is taught as a human activity embedded in society (Knain, E. 2001). The gendered impacts of learning strategies is another issue that has been investigated in the literature. One common strategy is the study of science through group work, where \u201clearners are encouraged to collaborate with others to perform many of the tasks, whether intellectual or practical, they are required to undertake in order to further their science understanding\u201d (Scanlon 2000: 464). These studies reveal that the strategy of mixed boys/girls groups may have a negative impact on the science learning of girls. This is because girls tend to be less confident in putting forward solutions and thus tend to defer their problem-solving to boys. In addition to studies focusing on school science education, there are other studies that analyse the gendered phenomenon of university student attrition in science degree studies. Such studies reveal the importance of role models, the presence of a \u2018critical mass\u2019 of women professors and students, and a departmental culture that is not dominated by traditional male cultural norms (Ferreira 2003). Similar results are reported in Steele et al. (2002). Finally, Trolley\u2019s historical study of science education is quite illuminating insofar as it uncovers the broader cultural, economic and institutional factors that influence the gendered character of science education. According to her study, science was originally considered a \u2018girl\u2019s subject\u2019 in the early nineteenth century, with a greater percentage of girls\u2019 schools ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 121 offering equally sophisticated courses in physics, astronomy and chemistry than comparable institutions for boys. However, the science curriculum content and science values began to shift along with larger cultural, institutional and economic changes. Science Institutions In recent years, research on the gendered patterns of participation in science has increasingly turned its attention to the nature of science institutions, and how institutional culture, structures and procedures are gender-biased. This is considered to exert a profound (negative) impact on the career paths of women scientists, in particular their opportunities for appointment and promotion. Although these institutions include universities as well as research councils and private firms, a large body of this research focuses on universities, as these constitute the institutional setting where the majority of scientists carry out their work. A very comprehensive overview of the situation of women in European universities, as well as the main issues affecting them, is provided by Zimmer (2003) in the final report of the EU funded project \u201cWomen in European Universities\u201d, which aimed at assessing the professional status of women in academia and analysing the reasons for the under-representation in positions of authority in European universities The reform of higher education institutions, and its gender impacts, has generated a large body of literature on the topic. In broad terms, this is a reform consisting in a dual process of privatisation and marketisation, which began in Anglo-Saxon countries and is being introduced in other parts of the Western world as part of the wider process of globalisation. Under the label of \u2018new managerialism\u2019, or \u2018new public management\u2019, this reform is giving rise to a new model of higher education organisation \u23af a model that is highly focused on efficiency, effectiveness and excellence. According to some experts, this new model of higher education organisation has been driven, among other factors, by a decline of government funding and the need to secure new sources of finance, as well as the move to a mass higher education system (Deem 2001: 11). Such decline on government funding has been accompanied by a change in employment structures whereby academic and research staff are increasingly on short-term, low-paid contracts, though especially pronounced among research staff. For example, in Britain\u2019s universities there are over 40,000 researchers who are employed on short-term contracts, some as short as one month. And, if we focus on the area of science and technology, around half of all researchers are on short-term contracts (BBC News, 2002). A number of research studies reveal that, far from being \u2018gender neutral\u2019, new managerialism in higher education is having a significant impact on the work, experiences and attitudes of women academics, as well as on their opportunities for career advancement, when compared to those of men. In addition, new managerialism in academia is marking a shift on the discourse and values of equal opportunities, as well as on the progress in equal opportunities that have been so far achieved. Indeed, the \u2018new managerialism\u2019 in higher education institutions has been criticised by a number of experts for its promotion of a highly masculinised institutional culture based on the values of efficiency, \u2018rugged\u2019 individualism, and competition, which is hostile to a genuine egalitarian culture based on collegiality and collaborative work. Furthermore, according to Walsh (2000), the new managerialism has undermined the social justice values from which equal opportunities have grown, as equal opportunities has been sidelined and reduced to a mere public relationsR mechanism. In a similar vein, Blackmore (2002) notes how new managerialism in universities has been accompanied by a change from a language of \u2018equal opportunities\u2019 and \u2018social justice\u2019 to a language of \u2018managing diversity\u2019, which in turn is linked to notions of productivity rather than with notions of social justice, as it is primarily about \u2018capturing gender, racial, cultural and other differences, to create a more dynamic and competitive organisational culture\u2019 (Sinclair 2000, 239). Given this situation, some authors argue that if the co-optation of equal ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 122 opportunities by a discourse of \u2018productive diversity management\u2019 is to be avoided, then equal opportunities needs to be integrated to the core of institutional culture, rather than staying in the periphery as a mere formal procedure, isolated from the \u2018mainstream\u2019 of organisational processes and activities (Saunderson 2002). Another cluster of academic articles explore the impact of \u2018new managerialism\u2019 on the work and experiences of women academics (Davies and Robyn, 2002; Thomas and Davies 2002). These works highlight how \u2018new managerialism\u2019 encourages a culture of long working-hours, which stem from an emphasis on research output against which performance is judged. For women academics, these new demands are increasingly difficult to meet, as many of them have to combine work and family responsibilities. As a result, they report to have constants feelings of stress and guilt. Moreover, such focus on quantified research output, and the difficulties that women experience in meeting the demands associated with it, also acts to reinforce existing gendered hierarchies, whereby the majority of female academics tend to occupy the lower positions and are mainly responsible for (low-valued) teaching work, while the higher ranks are mainly occupied by male academics, who remain in charge of (high- valued) research managing. In short, the new managerialist structures in higher education institutions are profoundly gendered, as they reward single-minded, competitive academics who can dedicate long hours to do research work (mainly men), while punishing those who are involved in other aspects of academic work, such as servicing the students, as well as those who have family and caring responsibilities (mainly women). Furthermore, the new managerialism in higher education institutions is introducing a divisive two-tier system of opportunities, as it is generating an increased numberof short-term, low-paid, research and teaching contracts, the majority of which are held by women (Griffin 2002). Women Scientists in the Industry Sector Although most of the literature on women in scientific institutions concentrated on academic organisations, there are some new EU publications dealing with the issue of women in industrial research. The publication of these reports is something to be highlighted especially given the fact that we did not find any other studies related to this topic in our bibliographical research. This finding is supported by those in the European Commission statistical report on women in industrial research, which stated that \u201cacross the European countries almost no studies exist on the specific conditions of women in industrial research and their personal feelings about their situation\u201d (Meulders, et al., 2003: 93). A recent study published by the European Commission revealed much higher levels of female under-representation in industrial research in the EU when compared with universities and the public sector. Though the report did not expressly examine the barriers (cultural and institutional) to women\u2019s participation in industrial research, its recommendations show that such barriers are presumed to be very similar to those faced by women scientists in other institutional settings, such as universities. These include: gender biases in hiring practices; lack of information and support; unequal pay; under-representation in decision-making posts; a working culture dominated by masculine values and gender-stereotypes; and finally, the gendered nature of care \u23af which is reflected in difficulties in combining home and work responsibilities. Standards of Scientific Quality A cluster of studies focus on the standards of scientific quality as an important barrier to the participation of women in science, as these standards are gender-biased in different ways. Gender-biases in scientific standards in turn affect the scientific productivity of women researchers and their possibilities for career advancement. According to a recent report on ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 123 Gender and Scientific Excellence (European Commission 2004) gender bias in standards of scientific excellence can occur in the following: \u2022 The characterisation of scientific excellence; \u2022 The criteria used to assess it; \u2022 The choice of the explicit and implicit indicators for scientific excellence; \u2022 The way the criteria are applied to men and women; \u2022 The failure to integrate women in scientific networks; \u2022 The procedures through which criteria are applied to people Benschop and Bronus (2003) describe in more detail how both the definition of scientific quality and in its attribution are gendered. In relation to the way standards of scientific quality are defined, they argue that it is gender-biased, as the criteria for assessing this usually include such items as the number of publications in international journals, international activities, and age. However, these criteria apply to all scientists irrespective of whether they work full-time or part-time and, therefore, fail to take into account the fact that, due to care responsibilities, women work part-time to a much larger extent than men and, therefore, tend to have less publications than men. Equally, these criteria fail to take into account the fact that women tend to publish more in national, rather than in international, journals. Finally, it fails to take into account that women do not engage in international activities to the same extent as men do, as it is more difficult for them to travel and work abroad due to family commitments. This means that when the quality of women\u2019s scientific work is measured by these standards, usually by male professors, they are more or less condemned to a \u2018mediocre\u2019 position. There is also gender-bias in relation to the attribution of standards of scientific quality, which is linked to deep-seated gender stereotypes about the notion of \u2018scientific excellence\u2019 as being an attribute of men, rather than women. According to these authors \u201cthe idea of excellence fits better with representations of masculinity than of femininity, especially in an academic context\u201d (ibid, p. 205). This is clear when analysing measurements of the scientific quality of both women and men who have an equal level of scientific achievements. Thus, the quality of women\u2019s scientific work tends to be undervalued (when measured by the same standards than men). The authors also criticise the lack of neutrality of the peer review system, which is a widespread mechanism for judging scientific quality in making decisions in relation to publications and proposals for research funding. This is confirmed by a British study examining gendered patterns in the allocation of research funding, which found that for all the British Research Councils (except for the one for economic and social research, ESRC) women were less likely to fulfil the eligibility criteria than men. The results of this study indicate that women applicants are evaluated differently from male applicants depending on the discipline. These findings are similar to the findings of a different study on the allocation of research funding in the Netherlands (Brouns 2000), which found that not only were women were not discriminated against in all disciplines, but, moreover, that in some disciplines they were positively advantaged. One of the main conclusions of these two studies is that gender matters in assessing scientific quality, but it matters in different ways within different disciplines. All of these studies on the gendered nature of scientific standards of quality highlight that this is a gender, rather than a women\u2019s, issue. Consequenlty, they call for the integration and mainstreaming of gender within science, including such matters as how scientific standards of quality are defined and applied. This, in turn, requires a critical reflection of the socially constructed nature of any conception of scientific quality. ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 124 Reconciling Work and Family Life Although there are quite a number of studies on the issue of reconciling work and family life, there are not so many that focus on how this affects the participation of women in science in particular. However, the studies that are available clearly document the extent to which family responsibilities act as a factor in the gender differentials evident in research productivity and in the career paths of scientists. An American study of 11,231 PhDs in the fields of science, engineering and technology working in academia found that productivity is higher for PhDs with children less than 11 when both women and men academics are taken into account, yet is relatively low for women academics with young children. The study concluded that while children are not a strong predictor of productivity when both women and men scientists are taken into account, the influence that they do have follow a gendered pattern (Stacks 2004). Moreover, the career outcomes of female academics are not only influenced by the presence of young children, but also by the timing of children. Thus, an analysis of the employment patterns of PhD graduates at the University of California, Berkeley (based on data from the National Faculty Survey), found a large gap in achieving tenure between women and men who have children early in their careers \u23af a gap which is especially marked in the sciences, where the overall gap between men's and women\u2019s rates of having achieved tenure twelve to fourteen years after receiving the Ph.D. reaches 24 percent (Mason and Goulden 2002). Not surprisingly, the research also found that academic women in the sciences are twice as likely as academic men to remain single. The situation in European Universities is quite similar, as revealed by Zimmer\u2019s study on Women in European Universities. According to this study, while the majority of male senior academics enjoy a traditional family life with a partner that takes care of family and housework, a very high proportion of their female counterpart live alone and are childless (Zimmer 2003). Very similar findings regarding the influence of the timing of children were found by Gjenberg (2003) in a study of the impact of children on the careers of female doctors in Norway. There are other family-related issues that can explain the gender gap in academic careers. Thus in a study carried out by Probert (2005, it was found that other factors influenced gender-specific career paths, including rates of separation and divorce, and far higher rates of partnering among men than women, and the impact older children\u2019s needs., However, strategies for reconciling work a family life are also dependent upon the age of the women academics studied. According to a research project carried out in a UK university, while older academics weave their career developments around those of their husbands and the caring of their children, younger women tend to fit their family lives around their careers (Ledwith and Mandefi, 2000). The role of networks The importance of networking and, more generally, of social capital, as a factor influencing the success of women as scientists has been well documented. Lack of social capital affects women\u2019s scientific productivity and visibility. According to the European Commission\u2019s report on Gender and Excellence (2004), networks play an important role in information exchange, agenda setting, control, and implicit decision-making. As a general rule, however, women scientists find it difficult to become part of scientific networks in a scientific community where men form the overwhelming majority. The role of cultural gender stereotypes and a male-dominated scientific tradition where informal \u2018old boys networks\u2019 have played an important role as sources of information exchange and access to power, are important factors explaining such an exclusion. Women scientists still tend to be perceived as \u2018the other\u2019 and they usually report feelings of social isolation (Winkler 2000). ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 125 A large number of studies looking at the gender differentials in scientific productivity cite lack of professional networks and international contacts as a major factor affecting the productivity of women scientists (Etzkowitz et al. 2000; Fox 2005; Prpi \u0107 2002;Winkler 2001). Women\u2019s Relationship to Science Feminist academics in the fields of the philosophy of science and epistemology, psychology, sociology and history have uncovered the gendered nature of scientific knowledge and scientific inquiry. A central tenet of these studies is that, despite its claims to universality and objectivity, scientific knowledge and practice reflects the particular perspectives of the subject, which are socially and culturally constructed. Given that this subject is, and has been, predominantly \u2018male\u2019, scientific knowledge and practice is gender-biased (Harding 1991). According to this view, scientific knowledge and practice disadvantage women in a variety of ways, namely: (1) by excluding them from inquiry, (2) by denying them epistemic authority, (3) by denigrating their \u201cfeminine\u201d cognitive styles and modes of knowledge, (4) by producing theories of women that represent them as inferior, deviant, or significant only in the ways they serve male interests, (5) by producing theories of social phenomena that render women's activities and interests, or gendered power relations, invisible, and (6) by producing scientific knowledge that reinforces gender and other social hierarchies. On this account, the entry of women into scientific disciplines will not only represent a social advance, but will also have an impact upon scientific knowledge and practice, generating new questions, theories and methods. The relationship between science and culture, and the different ways in which they are bound together, is the subject of a recent study by Segal (2003). In it, she argues that it is not only the natural sciences which have been considered as \u201cmasculine, authoritative, distanced from women\u2019s natural inclination and interests\u201d(ibid, p. 3) but that the social and human sciences, in seeing themselves as part of that very same scientific project and in adopting the same scientific methodology as the so-called \u2018hard sciences\u2019, are highly biased as well. Segal goes onto provide a number of examples, drawn from historical evidence advanced by a number of studies, of how the \u2018masculinist\u2019 construction of science, knowledge and rationality relegated female and feminine attributes as \u2018soft\u2019, \u2018wolly\u2019 and \u2018superstitious\u2019 (ibid, p. 4), which resulted in the exclusion of women from science. Indeed, in recent years, an increasing number of feminist historians have explored the cultural constructions of masculinity in the sciences, especially during the Victorian period (Harrison, 2001; Scott 2003; Luckhurst & McDonagh, 2002; White 2003). Some of these works draw on the work of Schiebinger (1989), who traced women's contributions to the development of early modem science, while at the same time elucidating the issue of how gender structures knowledge. According to this author, the scientific revolution brought a scientific understanding of biological sex and sexual temperament (what we today call gender), which portrayed female nature as \u2018unsuited\u2019 for the world of science, thus pushing them to the sidelines. The topic of masculinities in scientific inquiry has also been studied by scholars working in the field of psychoanalysis. Thus, in Psychoanalysis, Science and Masculinity (2000), Karl Figlio carries out a psychoanalytic exploration of the need to know in Western culture, which is seen in terms of a masculine intrusion seeking to invade, dominate and colonize (mother) nature. Finally, some theorists draw on developmental psychology to argue that women have a different way of knowing, or different cognitive styles to men. According to these studies, while the masculine cognitive style is abstract, theoretical, disembodied, emotionally detached, analytical, deductive, quantitative, atomistic, and oriented toward values of control ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 126 or domination, the feminine cognitive style is concrete, practical, embodied, emotionally engaged, synthetic, intuitive, qualitative, relational, and oriented toward values of care (Kimura 2000; Rhoads, 2004; Sax 2005). These studies argue that women and men differ not only in physical attributes and reproductive function, but also in the way they reason and solve problems. These differences are explained in terms of biological differences (e.g., sex hormones) and their effects on brain organization. Furthermore, some of these scholars criticise education policies that ignore these biological sex differences, advocating that boys and girls should be educated separately. Formulating Strategies for Action A number of studies surveyed in this review identified significant cross-national differences in relation to their gendered patterns of participation in science, as well as the factors explaining this phenomenon. Given these differences the type of actions required to tackle these issues vary according to the national contexts. This is particularly important for the integration of a gender perspective in EU research policy. If such policy is to be gender- sensitive as well as sensitive to cross-national variation, then it needs to be firmly grounded in a body of knowledge and evidence that recognises the specificities of national cases and contexts. This requires the following: \u2022 Statistical information about the situation of gender/women in science in all EU states. \u2022 A methodology for researching gender and science issues in different EU member states, including indicators. \u2022 A mechanism for exchanging information on national policies and identifying best practice. \u2022 The promotion of studies on gender/women in science as a tool to aid the formulation and evidence-based support of future policy-making in the area. In recent years there have been some developments on all those 4 points. Knowledge-gathering on the situation of women in science in different European countries has been greatly improved by the work of the Helsinki Group of Women and Science in collected sex-disaggregated statistics and building gender-sensitive on women in science as well as gathering and coordinating information on national policies. As a result of this work, three important publications have seen the light in the past three years. The first is a statistical report on women in science in collaboration with the European Commission DG Research (European Commission 2003). The second is a report on national policies on women and science in 30 countries (Rees, 2002). The third is a report on the situation of women in science in the new EU member states of Central and Eastern and accession countries. Apart from this, there are a number of research studies on gendered patterns of participation in scientific research and science decision-making in specific EU countries. These are listed in the bibliographical list provided below. The statistical report on women in science represents an important development since the previous Gender Impact Assessment Report (Braithwaite, 2001) in which the author, following the ETAN of the report complains of \u201cthe lack of systematically collected, analysed and published statistics, suitable for international comparisons and disaggregated by sex\u201d (p. 16) and the difficulties that this poses for reviewing the position of women in science. The report represents the most detailed collection of statistics and indicators yet available and is therefore a valuable tool for monitoring progress. The main findings presented in these report are that, despite recent improvements, European women continue to be considerably under- ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 127 represented as PhD graduates, as researchers, as senior academics, and as members of scientific boards. The data also reveals a marked pattern of both horizontal and vertical segregation in the participation of women in science. The Helsinki Group report on national policies on women and science is a survey of national policies on women in science in 30 countries (the current EU 25 plus Bulgaria, Iceland, Israel, Norway and Romania). The report found considerable diversity among the countries in terms of scientific infrastructure, equality measures, and the climate for women seeking to pursue scientific careers. Despite such diversity it nevertheless found a common factor that hindered the participation of women in science in all the countries examined, viz. the lack of gender balance in decision-making structures regarding both science policy and scientific standards of quality. Such significant degree of variation was also found in relation to the national policies used to tackle the problem of the under-representation of women in science, and the gender-biases in science and scientific research cultures, institutions and procedures. Thus, many countries have instituted positive action measures to support women and science. These include supporting networks of women in science, encouraging the development of role model and mentoring schemes, and in some cases, establishing targets and quotas. A few countries have experimented with earmarking academic chairs, research funds and prizes for girls and women in science. These range from legislation and positive action measures, to gender mainstreaming strategies and tools (including the development of statistics and indicators) and the development of women and gender studies. A third development in knowledge-gathering on the situation of women in science in Europe is represented by a report on the current situation in the new EU member states of Central and Eastern Europe and accession countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia). The study revealed strong horizontal and vertical patterns of segregation of women in science in these countries, despite higher proportions of women among researchers than in their western European counterparts (EU-15). The report also highlighted the gender impacts of the transition process in scientific research. Thus, although this process was accompanied by a sharp decline in funding allocated to science and a decrease of the research population which affected male and female scientists equally, the consequences of the transition, the report argues, have left women scientists in a more vulnerable situation. Finally, the report identified the lack of consistent data on the distribution of men and women in science at all levels of the hierarchy, together with the lack of research on women in science issues as a key barrier to the incorporation of a gender perspective in science and research policies (Blagojevi \u0107 et al. 2004). Apart from the development indicators of gender and science, there has been some progress in the development of general research methods in this field. In this regard, the report Minerva\u2019s Daughters needs to be highlighted (Palomba and Mennitti, 2002). The objective of this report is to present a working method to study scientific careers from a gender point of view. In broad terms, it is a \u2018how to\u2019 manual, which addresses issues of problem definition, measurement and indicators. Gender, Science and Democracy One of the objectives of the European Commission\u2019s scientific and research policy is to support and promote the democratisation of science through measures aimed \u201cto bridge the gap between science and society\u201d (http://europa.eu.int/comm/research/science- society/index_en.html). This implies, amongst other things, the promotion of transparency and democratic input into processes for deciding funding and research priorities. It also implies the promotion of an independent science that is primarily geared towards the benefit ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 128 of European citizens. The democratization of science is being accompanied by new forms of science governance, such as an increased involvement of civil society in the shaping of science policy. In this sense, the European Commission has made a commitment to improve democratic governance in the EU and this includes the governance of scientific research (European Commission 2001a; 2001b). However, such processes of democratisation and new governance structures in relation to science have, inevitably, a number of gender issues, although the European Commission failed to mainstream gender into the White Paper on Governance (Shaw 2001) or the Science and Society Action Plan (where gender quality measures are separated from broader science democracy and science governance measures). Gender matters to the process of science democratisation in several respects. Firstly, the participation of women in scientific research is much lower than that of men. Secondly, key decision-making positions regarding the setting of priorities for future scientific research as well as decisions regarding the allocation of research funding, are mainly occupied by men. Thirdly, the gendered nature of current scientific epistemologies acts as a barrier against women\u2019s active engagement in science and science debates in society, with the result that their levels of knowledge, understanding, awareness and interest in scientific matters is generally lower than that of men. In sum, the democratisation of science cannot be complete unless women participate on equal terms as men in scientific research and decision-making, as well as in science policy and public debates on science. Achieving this is not just a matter of increasing the numbers of women in science and scientific decision-making, but it is also a matter of making science and scientific institutions \u2018gender-sensitive\u2019. The participation of women in ethical debates in relation to science is also an important element of the democratization process and key to the process of mainstreaming gender into scientific research and science policy. Although the contribution of women to debates in bio- ethics has not been prominent (Lindemann, 2002) nevertheless there have been important contributions from a number of women and feminists organisations. And though feminist organisations working in the field of bioethics vary in relation to their objectives, in general, their main aim is to ensure that women\u2019s voices, health, and life experiences are brought to bear on ethical issues in health care and biotechnology. Feminist contributions to the field of bioethics have mainly concerned reproductive issues such as abortion and reproductive technologies while their involvement in more general bio- ethical concerns that are relevant to women, such as the exclusion of women in medical research, the individualistic conception of personal autonomy in current bio-ethical thought or the negative portrayal of women affected with HIV, have been much less prominent (Wolf 1996). In recent years, however, a number of feminist bioethicists have focused their attention on the rapid development of genetic research, raising issues in connection with sex selection techniques, genetic ties to children, disabilities, genetic testing and screening and human cloning. These bioethicists are particularly concerned with the burden that genetic interventions impose on women to produce \u201cperfect\u201d babies and the social inequalities that these interventions will produce (Rothman 2001; Mahowald 2000; Davis 2001, Parker & Ankeny 2002). For example, a central feature of Mahowald argument (ibid) is that men and women are, and will be, differently affected by genetic interventions by virtue of differences of both biology and social situation. The results of prenatal testing for a chromosomal anomaly, for example, might equally devastate or reassure both prospective mothers and fathers; however, the needle of amniocentesis enters only the woman's body, and she must consent to or refuse its use. Similarly, Davis (2001) focuses her attention on the tough pre- conception moral choices that many women have to make as the result of developments in genetic research - such as, e.g., pre-natal testing, pre-implantation diagnosis, and sex- selection. In his book, he emphasises the importance of parental autonomy in making these ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 129 decisions, although he argues that a case needs to be made for the prospective child to give her/him a future. In addition to these works on the differential impact of developments in genetic research upon women and men, a recent anthology on feminist bioethics (Tong, Donchin & Dodds) examines the interrelationship between and among feminist bioethics, human rights, and global development, addressing global concerns about inequalities in the context of health care, medical research, and population health. Some articles in this volume examine the ways in which national policy, reproductive therapies and foreign policy shape women\u2019s reproductive choices and alternatives in different parts of the world. Other articles explore the possibilities and risks of developments in genetic research showing, for example, how women in developing countries will be excluded from diagnostic benefits such as screening for the breast cancer gene. Finally, the processes of the democratisation of science require the adequate and effective communication to the wider public of scientific advances, including a discussion of their benefits as well as their areas of most concern. This involves communicating science not only as \u2018hard facts\u2019 but also communicating those facts in relation to their social, political, ethical and cultural contexts. A study on science communication carried out in Britain (OST, 2000) found significant ways in which science communication is gender biased. A key finding of this research is that science communication activities tend to be skewed towards activities that provide facts about science rather than activities that highlight the ethical and policy issues raised by science. This finding has important gendered implications because, as previous research has claimed, women tend to be more interested in ethical and policy issues in relation to science while men are more interested on the so-called \u2018hard\u2019 facts. This study lends further support to this claim, as it showed that men are more likely than women to trust scientists as a source of information while women are more likely than men to trust health campaigning groups (ibid: 32). The media is a powerful vehicle for communicating science, but studies have shown that this communication is not free of gender bias. The hypothesis underlying those studies is that gender is likely to be an important factor in the way that science is communicated by the media because of the gendering of science itself. Thus, studies analysing the existence of gender biases in television science programmes have found that gender stereotyping continues to be a feature of such programmes, alongside race stereotyping. For example, a recent American study analysing four different TV science education programmes for children (Long et al . 2001) found that male characters significantly outnumbered female characters, while ethnic minorities where significantly less likely to be labelled as scientists. Today\u2019s media includes not only the traditional printed and audiovisual forms (such as newspapers, magazines, radio and television and so on) but also new emerging forms such as computer-based multimedia. This latter vehicle is thought to reinforce gendered patterns of science to a larger extent than the traditional media does, especially given the fact that the use of computer-based technologies is highly gendered as well (Mellor 2001). In conclusion, all these studies point at different ways in which science communication is gender biased. They show that the question of who communicates science, what is communicated, how it is communicated and through what medium it is communicated, is gender-relevant and, therefore, something which needs to be taken into account by policy- makers in their efforts to gender mainstream both the governance of science and scientific research.

The main objective of this thematic priority is: \u201cthe mobilisation of European research in economic, political, social sciences and humanities that are necessary to develop an understanding of, and to address issues related to, the emergence of a knowledge\u2013based society and new forms of relationships between its citizens, on the one hand and between its citizens and institutions, on the other\u201d (FP6 In Brief).

Each of the gender issues identified in relation to this thematic area is briefly described below, together with relevant bibliographic references. Given that many of these issues coincide with those already identified by Mary Braithwaite in her literature review for the Gender Impact Assessment of FP5, and in order to avoid duplication, our literature review covers the years since that review was published (i.e. 2000-2005) and concentrates upon new issues, debates, data and/or studies that have emerged in the interim. In that sense, this review should be considered as an update and extension of the preceding one. In the present literature survey, gender issues in relation to the theme \u2018Citizens and Governance in a Knowledge-Based Society\u2019 are clustered around the idea of change \u23af (which includes economic, political, social and cultural changes that the EU is currently undergoing) \u23af and the differential impact of these changes upon women and men. The reasons for clustering these issues around a few categories (in contrast to the 28 categories identified in Braithwaite\u2019s literature review) are twofold: First, to avoid intersection among categories as much as possible, and second, to reflect more accurately the objectives of the 6 th Framework Programme. Organisational change An important theme of gender research has been organisational change, much of which has emerged from the coming together of feminist theory and institutionalist analytic frameworks. A core concern of such research is with the analysis of organisational structures and practices as gendered, and in the context of current organizational changes, it directly addresses questions concerned with the character of these changes as leading to organisations that are more, or less, gender-biased, and increasingly, or decreasingly \u2018women friendly\u2019. Britton (2000) identifies three ways in which organisations are gendered, namely: \u2022 Organisations are inherently gendered to the extent that they have been defined, conceptualised, and structured in terms of a distinction between masculinity and femininity, and presume \u23af and will thus inevitably reproduce \u23af gendered differences. \u2022 Organizations or occupations are gendered to the extent that they are male or female dominated. \u2022 Organizations are gendered in that they are symbolically and ideologically described and conceived in terms of a discourse that draws on hegemonic notions of masculinity and femininity. In general, organisational change is viewed as an imperative for organizations in the context of a multitude of economic changes \u23af increased capital costs, intensified competition, new technologies \u23af and geared towards generating overall gains in productivity. Such changes can have both positive and negative impacts upon the gender-power structures in organisations, depending on the nature of the organisational re-structuring and, more importantly, whether a gender dimension has been actively taken into consideration. In short, a gender equality perspective needs to be incorporated into the process of organisational change, otherwise the reform will in all likelihood leave the existing gendered structures and practices intact, and in some cases, reinforce or exacerbate them. This constitutes the central thrust of Abrahamsson\u2019s argument in her study of organisational change in Sweden (Abrahamsson 2002). In her view, organisational change carries \u23af in theory at least \u23af the promise of challenging the traditional gender order as institutionalised in prevailing organisational structures, particularly as this concerns principles of gender segregation and hierarchy. In contrast to such models of organisations, the new models are ",

In addition, the new organisational models encourage participation, democracy and empowerment for both women and men. Nevertheless, a major finding of this study is that these positive aspects of organisational change were not realised in practice, as the organisations studied re-instituted older patterns based on gendered hierarchies. The study concludes that the transformation of gendered organisational structures and practices into organisations that are free of gender biases cannot be done from a gender-neutral perspective. Rather, such a transformation requires a level of awareness of, and sensitivity to, gender issues, as well as an active gender equality strategy. In her own words, \u201cwith a deeper knowledge of the gender order, one can more easily handle \u2018resistance to change\u2019 and try to achieve a real change in the organisation and the learning organisation\u201d (ibid, p. 556). There are many types of organisational change and each of them may have different gender effects. Mergers are a special case of organizational change; insofar as the ostensibly only involve direct change at management level, though typically precipitate significant shake-ups in the wider newly amalgamated workforce(s). Consequently, there may be particular ways in which mergers are gendered that are distinct from other forms of organisational change, and these have received attention in much recent scholarship research (Collins, 2005; Collins & Wickham, 2002; Tienary & Quack, 2000; Tienary, Quack & Theobald 2002). One such study on the gendered nature of mergers (Collins, 2005) found that mergers are indeed, strongly gendered, and this for several different reasons. Firstly, mergers are gendered because the places in which women work, and the contracts that they have secured, are frequently different from those of men, rendering them exposed to the disruptive consequences of merges in different ways. Secondly, mergers are gendered to the extent that the nature, pace and/or location of work is changed as a direct consequence of a merger, thus impacting upon gender-differentiated workforces in gender-specific ways. Thirdly, women may view mergers as riskier than men do, and may therefore be more apprehensive and stressed about the changes but simultaneously less well-placed to voice their concerns. Finally, the recent trend towards mergers in the interests of rationalisation, reducing unit costs, and/or maximising shareholder-value, is regarded as imposing a particularly masculine language of economic rationality upon the workforce, while suppressing alternative understandings drawn from work experience as opposed to that of human resource accountancy. A different cluster of research studies focuses on the gender dimensions of New Public Management structures, which have been introduced as part of the organisational reform of public institutions. A review of the literature on this issue and especially, on the introduction of New Public Management structures in higher education institutions, has been undertaken in the \u2018Science and Society\u2019 section of this report (see p. 117 below) Finally, a different aspect of gender and organizational change that has been the focus of recent research is the potential that women working in organisations have in resisting, or \u2018taming\u2019, the most negative aspects of change through forms of workplace organisation and experiments in collective action aimed at protesting against such changes and minimising the fallout of mergers upon women in the workforce (Coleman and Rippin, 2000). Welfare State Reform In the past 15 years, the welfare states of the developed world have undergone a process of profound structural reform as the result of both external and internal pressures. Such reform, which has been commonly described as \u2018retrenchment\u2019, has been the subject of much scholarly analysis into its causes and nature. ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 133 However, this process of welfare state reform has hugely important implications for women given that the new welfare state model that is emerging from this reform process is primarily based upon principles of entitlement to benefits as being derived from active participation in the labour market. Such a model, whilst promoting economic autonomy for women, tends to ignore the unequal division of unpaid care work as well as underestimating the extent of women\u2019s unequal position in the labour market \u23af itself often a function of the gendered division of welfare and care work. A number of studies on gender and welfare state reform on the impact of such reforms upon women\u2019s entitlement to pensions and other employment related benefits, such as sickness and unemployment benefits. For example, Gough (2001) argues that factors relating to part-time working, career patterns, and types of occupation and employment, contribute not only to keeping women\u2019s income lower than men\u2019s during their working lives, but also to reduced entitlements to benefits from occupational pension schemes after retirement. Furthermore, when the effects of women\u2019s longevity are also taken into account, a picture emerges of an increasing number of women faced with a lengthy period of poverty in old age. Another development that affects women differently to men is the privatisation of retirement income. According to Smith (2001) this significant gender difference arises on account of the gendered assumptions built into the legal forms adopted in the course of privatisation, particularly those that assume a 40-year continuous working life, which is predominantly a male experience. However, in relation to maternity-leave benefits and childcare programmes there are few signs of welfare retrenchment, but there are instead considerable moves towards expanding provision in these areas. Henderson and White\u2019s study (2004) provides evidence of an ongoing expansion of these types of benefits in all the countries surveyed. The promotion of equality between women and men through policies aimed to reconcile work and family life have, however, been the subject of much controversy, given that these policies tend not to challenge the prevailing gendered dimension of care work (Guerrina, 2002). Indeed, in many countries, policies aimed at reconciling family and work responsibilities have been driven less by gender equality objectives than by demographic and/or productivity concerns, and consequently have been designed and sustained with at most an incidental focus upon the relief of the gendered division of welfare tasks and the transformation of prevailing gender inequalities in the sphere of welfare and care. The gendered impact of welfare state reform in Central and Eastern European countries has also attracted increasing attention in recent years. This has been particularly concerned with the gender equality aspects of the reforms of the social security regimes as they restructure the legacy of Soviet social security systems (e.g. Pascall and Manning 2000). Fultz and Steinhibler (2004) provide a comparative study of these changes as evident in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. Finally, a number of studies have emerged that argue for the need to recognize, re-value and reward care work whilst also promoting equality in the share of work and care responsibilities between women and men (Cantillon et al. 2001; Lister 2002). This is considered as a necessary complement and corrective to dominant understandings of the \u2018problem\u2019 as a matter of facilitating the re-allocation of care work in order to release the maximum amount of female labour onto the labour market. Migration Migration has been steadily increasing across the world since the 1980s, and especially within Europe after 1989. The enlargement of the EU to include many Central and Eastern European countries has further changed the dynamics of migration within the EU. Combined with increased migratory flows from non-EU countries of origin to EU member states, these ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 134 factors have occasioned increases in overt racism and xenophobia, and have increased the salience of immigration policy in member states\u2019 domestic politics. Migration has a very significant gender dimension. In the first place, women migrants tend to outnumber male migrants in many EU countries, on account of reductions in the demand for male labour in receiving countries, following the shift from industrial to post-industrial economies where the demand for female labour in the service sector tends to increase significantly. Yet apart from gender differences in migrant populations, migration itself also poses a number of important gender issues. One specific issue around gender and migration concerns the status and conditions of work of migrant women. To begin with, the kinds of work that women migrants engage in is heavily \u2018gendered\u2019 in the sense that it tends to cluster around low-skilled occupations that reproduces traditional domestic female roles and to involve tasks such as washing, cleaning, cooking, sewing, and taking care of children and the elderly. As the bulk of such work is carried out in the informal sector, it typically involves precarious working conditions and limited protection and security. Consequently, most women migrants working in these environments experience low wages, long shifts, unhealthy and/or dangerous conditions, and, sometimes, psychological, physical and/or sexual aggression as well. In addition, the (gendered) nature of work that women migrants perform tends to put them in a much more vulnerable position in comparison to the male counterparts. So while male migrants have traditionally worked in groups, as for example in construction or agriculture, women are often employed in individualised work environments such as domestic service or contract cleaning, in which the there is much greater isolation and a significantly lower likelihood of establishing networks of information and social support. The issue of domestic service has received a great deal of attention in the literature on gender and migration, most commonly within the wider context of globalisation. From this vantage point, the work provided by migrant women is represented as serving the growing demands for cheap domestic workers on the part of full-time (women) workers in the host countries, in order to facilitate the process of reconciling work and family life for host country citizens. However, as numerous studies repeatedly highlight, the pressures to reconcile work and family life for those in receiving countries have very high human costs, to the extent that their increased leisure time crucially depends upon on the informal and low-paid labour of women migrants working in highly insecure conditions without insurance or social protection. Regarding this issue, Ehrenreich and Hochschild\u2019s study (2003) focuses on how and why some women are moving globally in order to provide childcare and domestic work for other men and women, whilst providing a forceful critique and challenge to the ways in which care work is organised in contemporary Western and European societies. Similarly, Salazar- Parrenas\u2019 study, which is largely based on interviews with migrant domestic workers, portrays the larger economic picture as domestic workers from developing countries increasingly come to perform the menial tasks and occupy the least desirable occupational positions available in Western and European labour markets. The study focuses upon the costs of globalisation such women, as they experience the splitting of their own families, significant levels of social exclusion from the host countries, as well as downward mobility and lack of opportunities for a \u2018brighter\u2019 future. A second major issue concerns the relationship between forms of migration and the nature of work/care strategies adopted by migrants in their host society. First generation unskilled migrant families tend to suffer from the absence of close-kin networks to support childcare whilst also being subject to strong pressures to work and additional pressures from the kinds of work undertaken, as for example in occupations demanding long and/or atypical hours. In addition, they typically experience various integration problems such as social isolation, lack of information of services, and housing problems. Given the lack of extended family or kin connections to fall back on to help manage the childcare load and the fact that they are often not entitled to the childcare benefits of their host state, there are additional stresses upon these ",

(Wall and Jos\u00e9, 2004). In any case, despite these increased pressures and demands upon women migrants, there is a very narrow margin for the renegotiation of care-giving responsibilities available to them, as they continue to play a major role in the transmission of cultural values in their own ethnic communities (Spitzer et al. 2003). Some studies, however, focus on the advantages that migration to knowledge-based economies and societies can bring to women migrants with the requisite skills. Thus, Kofman (2004) argues that, while most of the literature focuses on socio-economically disadvantaged female migrants \u23af especially those undertaking domestic and sex work \u23af the opening of skilled migration in developed countries, particularly in increasingly feminised welfare sectors, is benefiting the skilled and educated women from developing countries. Indeed, the author argues for the need to question the relegation of female migrants to the subordinate circuits of globalisation, in order to extend the analysis of gender and migration to include skilled migrants. Such extended analysis can, in her view, add a counter-narrative to current conceptualisations of the knowledge economy and society \u23af which tend to be focused on science and technology sectors \u23af to include the special kinds of knowledge involved in the caring and educative occupations. Kofman contends that the assumption of a neat division between a purportedly masculine high-tech sector, and a feminine and menial \u2018other\u2019, fails to do justice to the complexity of current gendered migratory flows. This complexity is further illustrated by Ragrhuram and Kofman (2004), who document and re-classify the nature and forms of female migration. They note how women migrate not only as unskilled domestic servants and sex workers, but also as skilled workers in the (highly masculine) IT sector and the (highly feminised) nursing sector. Furthermore, they note how women migrate not simply as workers (highly or lowly skilled), but also as women who move as wives and mothers in family migration; as professionals who seek to get their skills recognized in the countries to which they migrate; and as students trying to overcome gender discrimination at home, by gaining new skills abroad. A third key gender issue with respect to migration concerns sexual coercion, prostitution and the sex trade and, in particular, the increasing levels of trafficking in women from Central and Eastern Europe and from the developing countries since 1989. The trafficking of women and girls has recently gained increased attention by the media and general public, over 500,000 women estimated as being \u2018processed\u2019 through trafficking networks across Europe each year. The research focus has been divided into a number of areas. Some research has concentrated on issues connected with the conceptualisation of trafficking (i.e., what kind of problem it is taken to be). Other studies focus on identifying and investigating the factors contributing to this phenomenon, while still more draw attention to and explore the social situation and life experiences of trafficked women. Despite this \u2018split focus\u2019, it is nevertheless usual for such studies to investigate the issue of trafficking from within the context of the new economy and globalization. Of particular focus and relevance here, are studies centred upon the problem of trafficking women from Central, Eastern and Southeast Europe in the after the fall of the Berlin wall (Goodey, 2004), and also in the aftermath of the war in former Yugoslavia (Rathberger, 2002; Corrin, 2004) A final issue concerns questions of cultural assimilation of migrants in receiving countries. These have been crystallised sharply in recent political controversies in France and Britain over aspects of Islamic culture, particularly as they concern the presumed misogynistic cultural and religious norms of Islamic migrants. Killian (2003) has explored this issue in depth as it concerns the so-called \u2018headscarf affair\u2019 in France, and notes the contradictions in popular representation of the controversy, particularly as it concerns women. For one, the chief protagonists in the controversy were overwhelmingly male, with limited participation of women to be found amongst either the French defenders of robust secularism in the school system, or amongst Islamic defenders of the headscarf as a non-negotiable rule of Islam. Furthermore, her study of Maghrebin women showed that there was no clear correlation ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 136 between the practice of wearing the veil and that of adaptation to French society. (See also Read and Bartkowski 2000 for similar findings in the different context of the USA.) The most assimilated migrants were capable of defending the practice in terms borrowed from a European political discourse of rights, liberties and multi-culturalism. Simultaneously, the least integrated and poorly assimilated were capable of opposing the practice of wearing scarves in schools as contrary to the religiously sanctioned requirements to respect French authorities and willingly adapt to the demands of the host society, and/or as not becoming a \u2018good Muslim woman\u2019. The study therefore shows that not only must research on the topic of migration recognise the gendered dimensions to the process, and the range of gender-specific issues associated with it, but that it must also be alert to the gendered nature of the research conducted upon the topic, lest researchers cast a conceptual veil over such issues and neglect to study the female participants implicated in the substantive issue. Democracy and New Forms of Governance The processes of democratisation taking place in the European Union raise a number of gender-related issues. Adopting a broad notion of democracy that include both representative as well as participatory forms of democracy, these issues concern not only the well-documented issue of the under-representation of women in politics, but they also embrace wider issues concerning the participation of women in decision-making processes in society. Of especial relevance here is the wide arena of civil society, alongside the more circumscribed field of formal politics. Deepening European democracy through the promotion of participative democracy is one of the objectives of the European Union, and this commitment to participatory democracy is enshrined in the new European Constitution (Article I-46). Such democratisation processes are being facilitated by the introduction of new forms of governance, which, in encouraging participation and dialogue, offer women new opportunities to influence the political agenda. Holford and Edirisingha (2000) provide a review of the literature on the evolution of governance in the European context. They highlight the shift from \u2018government\u2019 to \u2018governance\u2019 as one of the major conceptual and institutional innovations reflected in, and promoted by, the process of European integration. Thus while \u2018government\u2019 as a concept and practice has typically been associated with top-down planning and bureaucratic control mechanisms, the concept and practice of \u2018governance\u2019 refers to a \u2018softer\u2019 notion of management and regulation, and furthermore, one that is both more inclusive and actively invites participation on the part of the \u2018governed\u2019. Tied to this notion is the recognition of governance as involving many agencies, and consequently supportive of more decentralised forms of management and regulation, with a strong focus on lateral communications across and between organisations working in a co-operative manner towards a common goal (ibid, p. 8). Such participative democracy may be facilitated by new developments in the governance structures of the multi-tiered EU polity, including such developments as the transfer of power to regional and local levels of government. In this context, Breitenbach\u2019s work (2003) focuses on the impact of the UK devolutionary process on the participation of women in shaping the political agenda of the new devolved governments of Scotland and Wales. This provides a case study of how processes of decentralisation, regionalisation, and political restructuring, may create new opportunities and fresh challenges to women\u2019s organisations, thus altering their capacities to influence the political process. However, the concrete realisation of the model of participative democracy presupposes that certain general social and economic conditions be in place in order for it take hold and develop satisfactorily. Furthermore, these conditions have important gender dimensions. Civic participation requires certain levels of knowledge, awareness of political issues, and important organisational, informational, and political skills on the part of would-be ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 137 participants. It also requires adequate resources in the form of social capital, time, and requisite expertise. Yet it is by no means obvious that these are gender-neutral, and research suggests that such conditions have differential impacts on women and men, as well as amongst different groups of women. For example, one innovative form of participative democracy currently being promoted with enthusiasm is the notion of \u2018e-democracy\u2019. This is regarded as an approach that increases, and improves the quality of, citizen participation in democratic processes, and is in turn a component of more general e-government initiatives aimed to enhance wider access to, and the delivery of, government services. Yet availing of such opportunities requires certain levels of IT skills (Fuller 2004), and alongside the kinds of awareness, education and skills required for participation in such forums, participatory democracy also demands certain level of economic and material resources. This is shown by Einhorn and Sever (2003) in their analysis of the civic participation of women in Central and Eastern Europe. In exploring the material and ideological conditions that affected women\u2019s ability to mobilize and to form political and/or feminist identities, these authors concluded that the absence of a women\u2019s movement in the region after the fall of the Berlin Wall can be explained by the social and economic hardships of the transition period. The conditions for the effective participation of women in civil society is also a theme in Weinberger and Jutting (2001), who contend that this participation is primarily an opportunity open to, and availed by, middle-class women, while poorer women are largely excluded on account of the high opportunity costs that accompany participation, which in turn is particularly pronounced in the case of low-income working women. This same line of argument is pursued by Preece (2002), who questions the relevance of concepts such as \u2018dialogue\u2019 and \u2018partnership\u2019 for marginalised groups of women in conditions where institutional systems and practices do not create opportunities for their voices to be heard. The gendered processes of democratisation in Central and Eastern Europe have been the focus of attention of a large body of scholarly work. According to La Font (2002) the new democratic systems in these countries, rather than diminishing gender discrimination, have instead widened the gender gap through declines in women\u2019s political representation and increases in women\u2019s unemployment and underemployment. This is also a central theme in an EU funded research project on Enlargement, Gender and Governance in Central and Eastern European Countries (HPSE-CT-2002-00115). Preliminary findings from this research show the limitations of the formal measures to promote equality that were introduced during the state-socialist regime (such as the application of quotas), thus illustrating the role of economic, social and cultural factors in the development of an adequate participative democracy underpinned by the principle of gender equality (www.qub.ac.uk/egg). Although most of the research literature operates with the broader notion of participative democracy in exploring the relations between democracy and gender, the issue of representative democracy and its gender dimensions continues to generate sustained interest. Investigation of the recently introduced parity system in France (Millns and Diaz Mateo, 2004) constitutes the focus of a number of smaller of studies noting the potential and limitations of such measures in counter-acting the under-representation of women within the upper echelons of formal governmental institutions. One final development deserves mention in this connection. This concerns recent developments in the field of social and environmental regulation and governance, particularly as it relates to the relationships between, and the respective roles of, governments and large private corporations. Though as yet a minor development, nonetheless the EU has itself begun to encourage developments in this direction, as for example in the Commission\u2019s 2002 Communication on \u2018corporate social responsibility\u2019 (CEC 2002). Yet the issue and core concept remains contested and poorly defined. Some, such as Hertz (2001) and Monbiot (2000), consider it to refer to a project aimed at rendering corporations accountable for (some of) the social and/or environmental consequences of their operations and activities. Others ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 138 consider it to refer to a project that involves the transfer of social functions from the State to large corporations, such that it raises questions of the nature of corporations as special kinds of \u2018citizens\u2019 (e.g. Moon 2002, 2004; Moon et al. 2005). Each has specific and distinct implications for gender issues. The latter in particular is particularly relevant to the issue of gender mainstreaming, with one study (Grosser and Moon 2004) investigating the relationship between internal gender mainstreaming initiatives within a socially responsible corporation, and the everyday practices and routine operations of the corporation in its ordinary course of affairs. This study found that whilst gender mainstreaming was in principle compatible with such socially responsible corporations, and potentially a means through which corporations could realise social responsibility on gender equality issues, nevertheless in practice the adoption of gender mainstreaming left much to be desired and was very slow in promoting progressive change within the corporation. Employment Opportunities and Work in the Knowledge Society The concept of the \u2018knowledge society\u2019 has largely succeeded the notion of the \u2018information society\u2019 that dominated the 1980s and 1990s, subsuming within it the earlier focus upon information technologies and their revolutionary potentials in the spheres of industry, services, finance, and organisational changes. However, the newer concept additionally focuses upon knowledge as a vital social and economic resource of a given population. It is required in order to avail of the new opportunities presented by the ICT revolutions, and is increasingly indispensable as a means of adaptation to the rapidly changing conditions of societies in which ICT has assumed central social and economic importance. Within in this context, the notion of \u2018lifelong learning\u2019 has acquired increased salience, replacing prior notions of \u2018adult education\u2019 and/or \u2018continuing education\u2019. Yet its accessibility and benefits to women remain in doubt. Frequently represented as the chief avenue through which women can attain full membership of the knowledge society, some studies question whether training and education systems operating under the lifelong learning label successfully recognise the specificities of women\u2019s experiences and conditions in their provision of educational opportunities. For example, one study questions whether the institutionalised instrumentalism of lifelong learning policies that are devised as adjuncts to labour market policy adequately recognise the distinctiveness of women\u2019s learning strategies. (Gouthro 2005) To the extent that these learning strategies are substantially nurtured within the context of the home \u23af as is frequently the case for those women chiefly targeted for lifelong learning courses \u23af questions arise as to the adequacy of lifelong learning curricula for such women, many of whom will also carry caring responsibilities with them into the new educational environment. (Green Lister 2003) This theme recurs in magnified form in the context of training in the use ICT, with studies noting the persistence of the notion of technology as gender-neutral in the construction of ICT training programmes. (Clegg et al 2003) Furthermore, the determinate gender-specific skills that women commonly bring with them to such training \u23af e.g. administration skills \u23af are typically unrecognised or under-valued in formal and informal accreditation. (Clegg and Trayhum 2000) The disadvantaged position of women with respect to full participation in the knowledge society is also evident in the field of employment in the IT sector. As a specific occupational sector, this is not simply a classical male preserve in which women are under-represented, but it is also one in which conventional career pathways and opportunity structures are especially pronounced, thus favouring the advancement of men as against that of women. (Raghuram 2004) In addition, though commonly represented as a sector in which more hospitable and gender-neutral working conditions prevail, some studies note the emergent gender segregation within the sector. (Robertson et al 2001) Furthermore, this segregation appears to show pronounced tendencies to reproduce the gendered patterns evident in other employment ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 139 sectors, i.e. where women are clustered on the lower rungs of the occupational structure, and in insecure conditions with low wages and limited prospects. (Fenwick 2004; Webster 2004) Certain common themes emerge from these studies with regard to policy. Firstly, the closely related issues of curricular design, pedagogy, assessment, and \u2018marketing\u2019 of ICT education and training projects is frequently identified as in need of reform to counter-act its inherent male biases. Secondly, questions surrounding the \u2018ethos\u2019 and informal networking that constitutes the \u2018sub-culture\u2019 of the ICT world \u23af both in educational and occupational contexts \u23af are raised as matters to concern policy-makers and practitioners. Thirdly, the classification and grading of ITC skills such that \u2018hard\u2019 (male) IT skills such as low-level programming or systems analysis are privileged over others is highlighted as an area that may benefit from reform. Finally, mention needs to be made of a dedicated EU-funded project on employment and gender mainstreaming in the context of the knowledge society. Entitled \u2018From Welfare to Knowfare: A European approach to employment and gender mainstreaming in the Knowledge Based Society\u2019, this project (HPSE-CT-2002-00119) aims to provide comparative and multidisciplinary analyses of the transition towards the Knowledge Based Society (KBS) from employment and gender perspectives. It involves a comparative study of 7 EU member states with a view to identifying whether \u2018knowfare\u2019 policies that promote investment in individuals and social cohesion reflect the main characteristics of divergent welfare models (e.g. Continental and Nordic), or generate a convergence around a European approach towards the KBS. Its reports are available at http://www.bifrost.is/wellknow, and these include a valuable report on the implications of moves towards a knowledge society for women in employment. (Serrano-Pascual and M\u00f3sesd\u00f3ttir 2003) Labour Market Changes in the Knowledge Society The concept of the \u2018knowledge society\u2019 is frequently used inter-changeably with that of the \u2018knowledge-based economy\u2019, understood as one that is \u201cdirectly based on the production, distribution and use of knowledge and information\u201d (OECD). This in turn is commonly represented as a \u2018new economy\u2019 defined by the preponderance of high-tech investments, industries and increased labour skills, and is typically associated with notions of new \u2018flexible\u2019 and/or deregulated labour markets The gendered dimensions of these developments have recently come to be scrutinised, with the notion of labour market deregulation presented as failing to recognise the simultaneity of the process of \u2018re-regulation\u2019 of labour markets, particularly as it concerns women. One major attempt to rectify this oversight is to be found in the work of Walby (2000, 2002). Walby argues that with respect to gender, the \u2018deregulation thesis\u2019 encounters difficulties accounting for the ways in which deregulation processes frequently accompany re-regulation with respect to gender participation in the labour market. These are most conspicuous in moves towards enhanced maternity provisions, gender equality policies, and working-time regulations that impact directly upon women. Thus the notion of \u2018flexible\u2019 labour markets is itself an inadequate concept to capture the kinds of regulation instituted with the lives of working women in mind. Walby also maps out a concrete research agenda through which to investigate these processes more thoroughly. She identifies four distinct areas for empirical research interested in identifying the nature of these changes as they concern women, which may be summarised as follows: \u2022 Are labour market changes affecting the content of work for women? \u2022 Is work being organised in a more flexible way?

        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 140 \u2022 Are these changes in the organisation of work leading to an improvement or deterioration of the quality of women\u2019s working lives? \u2022 What are the key factors leading to these changes in the organisation of women\u2019s work? Drawing upon a detailed analysis of statistics provided by the Labour Force Survey in Britain, she concludes that analyses of the changes in the workplace need to distinguish gender and class dimensions, as some aspects of employment relations have been affected not only by globalisation but also by changes in gender regimes. See also: Employment Opportunities and Work in the Knowledge Society; Organisational change Resolution of Conflict and Restoration of Peace The last few years have seen increased international attention to the issues of women, peace and security. For example, the United Nation's Security Council passed a groundbreaking resolution (1325) in October 2000 that recognized that maintaining and promoting peace and security required women\u2019s equal participation in decision-making and called on all actors to adopt a gender perspective. Gender is increasingly recognized as central to the study and analysis of the traditionally male domains of war and international relations. There is an expanding body of literature that explores the role of gender in peace research, conflict resolution and international politics (Skjelsboek and Smith 2001). Such literature explores the way in which the different aspects and phases of armed conflict \u23af from conflict prevention, outbreak of conflict, to conflict resolution and post-conflict transition \u23af is gendered. This literature looks at the differential impact that armed conflict has on women and men. In the first place, in situations of conflict, many women and girls are victims of gender violence such as rape and other forms of sexual violence (often in the hands of peacekeepers and occupying forces) as well as being victims of trafficking (Hansem 2001). The restoration of peace can also have a differential impact on women, as there are cases where peace results in the curtailment of many of women\u2019s rights including reproductive rights, participation in the labour market, choice of style of dress, amongst other things. The literature also looks at strategies of resistance and the role of women in peace building. This research highlights the extent to which women tend to play only a minor role in post- conflict negotiations and policy-making. In addition, reconstruction programmes can be also gendered in that they give priority to the needs of the male population, failing to recognise women\u2019s and girls\u2019 needs. According to one common line of argument, women play important roles in maintaining social cohesion \u23af building coalitions across communities divided by violence \u23af and are therefore ideally positioned to play an essential role in reconciliation, rehabilitation and peace-building in the aftermath of war (Anderlini 2000). Statistics and Indicators Gender-disaggregated statistics and indicators are an essential tool for making gender inequalities in society visible, as well as for monitoring and evaluating gender equality policies. In the European context, the availability of gender-disaggregated statistics and indicators is also crucial for making cross-national comparative analyses of the situation of women and men in EU member states, as well as facilitating an assessment of the differential impact of EU gender equality strategies. Gender equality indicators are also important as benchmarks in progress towards equality. ",
        "Monitoring progress towards gender equality in FP6 \u2018Science and Society\u2019 \u2018Citizens and governance in the knowledge-based society\u2019 141 A key priority in the development of gender equality indicators is the need to clearly define the concepts and objectives in relation gender equality, given that the quality of these indicators derives from the definition of concepts and objectives. Gender sensitive indicators, however, have some limitations. The first limitation is that while pointing to gender differences in different sectors of society they do not account for such differences. Thus, the reading of gender indicators must be accompanied by a gender analysis that examines the structural inequalities that lie at the root of those gender differences. Another limitation is that indicators may not be comparable across countries as the definitions of key terms often vary from country to country. Another element that needs to be taken into account when using indicators is that indicators, far from being \u2018objective\u2019 are shaped by political, cultural and ideological factors. Moreover, a number of experts in gender studies have argued that indicators by themselves are insufficient to capture gender inequalities in our society, and call for the need to pay more attention to women's experience, towards which indicators can be only a \u2018pointer\u2019. In recent years, the European Commission has put increased efforts into the development and collection of gender-disaggregated statistics and indicators in areas other than employment and education, such as women in decision-making and women in science. Such progress is illustrated by the development of a new database on women and men in decision-making, now available at the European Commission\u2019s website at: http://europa.eu.int/comm/employment_social/women_men_stats/index_en.htm. In addition, the publication of a report on statistics and indicators of women in science (European Commission 2003) represents the most detailed collection of statistics and indicators in this area available to date. Other online databases of gender-disaggregated statistics and indicators are those provided by the UNECE and the World Bank. The UNECE site contains a comprehensive database of gender-disaggregated statistics and indicators in the areas of crime, education, employment, families and households, health, population, public life and decision-making, and work and the economy (http://w3.unece.org/stat/scriptsdb/Presentation.asp). This project was launched at the UNECE/UNDP Workshop on Gender Statistics for Policy Monitoring and Benchmarking and the Work Session on Gender Statistics in Orvieto (Italy) in October 2000. The World Bank also maintains an online database of gender-disaggregated statistics in the areas of poverty, education, health, access to economic resources, the labour force, and political participation (http://devdata.worldbank.org/genderstats/home.asp).

The studies examine both the participation of women in FP6 activities and the gender dimension of the research content, the aim being to assess the success of current gender mainstreaming strategies and to provide recommendations for future activities in this field. This report presents the results of the study for the activity areas Citizens and Governance in a knowledge-based society; Support for the coherent development of policies (including related policy-oriented research) and Science and Society. The study results indicate that under the research areas relevant to this study, a significant contribution has been made in FP6 in terms of progress towards gender equality. However, there remains much scope for improvement. "
