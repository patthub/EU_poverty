        "M. whereas the European Union's external financial instruments, such as the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI), the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) and the Instrument for Stability (IfS), all offer significant possibilities for providing support for democratic governance and institution- and capacity-building, N. whereas the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) is a key financial assistance instrument in the area of human rights and democracy, being global in scope, able to operate without host-country consent, and directly supporting civil society organisations; whereas EU Election Observation Missions (EOMs), financed by the EIDHR, are an essential element of the EU's contribution to democratic institution-building, which includes, in particular, follow-up to the recom\u00ad mendations made by such EU EOMs, O. whereas civil society can play an important role in the Union's external democracy-building efforts, as shown by the contribution of volunteers to peace and democracy-building programmes, P. whereas there is a need for a better overview of the democracy support currently provided by the EU, of how the EU's large arsenal of tools and instruments to support democracy worldwide delivers in partner countries, and of how those various instruments and actors operate, complement and connect with each other, Q. whereas its above-mentioned resolution of 31 March 2004 concerning the Commission's Communi\u00ad cation on Governance and Development stressed \u2018the importance of pursuing electoral and parlia\u00ad mentary reforms, beyond the establishment of multi-party electoral systems, to ensure more extensive and effective political activity among the population\u2019, 1. Shares the view that there is a need for a more coherent and uniform framework to make EU support for democracy-building, and, above all, the promotion of democratic values and respect for human rights throughout the world, more effective; 2. Welcomes the efforts by former and current EU Presidencies to implement a cross-pillar initiative on democracy-building in EU external actions with the aim of refining EU policy and strengthening its action and the coordination of its efforts, and underlines the need for sustained action in this field as part of the Council Conclusions to be adopted in November 2009; stresses, in this respect, that some key principles, such as transparency, access to documents, consultation and accountability, must be duly taken into consideration by the Council in addressing this issue; 3. Recommends that the upcoming Council conclusions should include concrete and practical suggestions for improving the coordination of democracy-building measures in EU foreign, human rights and development policy instruments; reiterates that the adoption of a Country Strategy on Human Rights and Democracy, to be regarded as a reference document establishing country-specific priorities in this field and mainstreamed into all relevant external EU policies and instruments with the third country concerned, could substantially improve the consistency, coordination and effectiveness of EU external action; 4. Reiterates that democratisation and good governance are not only ends in themselves, but are also vital for poverty reduction, sustainable development, peace and stability; points out that, as demonstrated by the EU's internal integration process, democracy helps to deliver not only political and civil rights, but also economic, cultural and social rights, including solidarity; 5. Calls on the Commission and the Member States, when designing the new external action service, to ensure the effective mainstreaming of human rights and democracy-building in all policy areas and to draw lessons from current processes and experience with a view to translating them into progress on the ground in promoting democratic values; 6. Takes the view that the embedding of democracy and democratic processes in third countries offer the best prospects for developing effective policies on global issues which are also of concern to EU citizens; points out that democratic systems can, for instance, combat transnational crime, illegal immigration and trafficking more effectively, protect the environment, maintain an open global trading system and secure sustainable and competitive energy supplies; EN C 265 E/6 Official Journal of the European Union 30.9.2010 Thursday 22 October 2009 ",
        "7. Urges the EU, with a view to strengthening concerted worldwide action to promote democracy, to publicly endorse the UN General Assembly's 2005 definition of democracy as the reference point for its own democratisation work; 8. Stresses that democracy cannot be exported or imposed from the outside and that a successful strategy for democracy promotion must be based on dialogue and entail broad efforts to strengthen civil society and raise democratic awareness in developing countries; underlines the EU's continued commitment to the principles of ownership of development strategies and programmes by partner countries; points out, however, that these processes can be supported by all the various EU instruments, adapted to the specific situation of each country; 9. Stresses that the EU must develop strategies to support the development of civil society and demo\u00ad cratic structures and that political foundations, non-governmental organisations and academic institutions play important roles in such contexts and should be supported; 10. Proposes that the Council and Commission proceed with a comprehensive, detailed analysis of all forms of EU support for democracy in a sample of partner countries, with a view to making practical recommendations; 11. Recommends that the Council and Commission implement the OECD Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action in their democracy support work, and suggests, in particular, that joint EU democracy assessments, joint EU programming and burden-sharing be introduced with a view to increasing the impact and visibility of the EU's work to support democracy; 12. Underlines the importance of the human rights clauses already contained in EU agreements; reiterates, in this context, that such clauses should first be applied consistently in existing agreements, in preference to a process of devising new agreements incorporating additional conditions; 13. Suggests that the Commission should systematically include a section on the state of democracy and human rights in the Country Strategy Papers, incorporate recommendations from relevant EU EOMs, and, wherever appropriate, mainstream democracy support in programmes with partner countries; 14. Underlines the need for better coordination of the activities carried out under the various external financial instruments and for the complementarity between geographical and thematic instruments to be fully explored; 15. Urges the Council and Commission to carry out broad-based, comprehensive consultation with all EU and third-country stakeholders, including institutional and regional and local actors, human rights defenders and independent civil society groups, before launching new democracy-building initiatives; 16. Encourages the Commission to involve democratic institutions at all levels, particularly parliaments and regional and local authorities, more systematically in the preparation and implementation of country-specific instruments, such as agreements between the EU and the country concerned and Country Strategy Papers; 17. Requests that the Commission consider the establishment of a volunteer European Peace Corps, while taking into account the positive experience of the European Voluntary Service (EVS); 18. Underlines the need for EU democracy support to be comprehensive, addressing all issues covered by the above-mentioned UN General Assembly resolution on the 2005 World Summit Outcome, and to take a long-term approach in its delivery; sees the EIDHR as a key financial assistance instrument in this regard, and calls for support to be maintained and strengthened; EN 30.9.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 265 E/7 Thursday 22 October 2009 ",
        "19. Welcomes the positive contribution made by EU EOMs in strengthening democratic processes, enhancing respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, good governance and the rule of law, and, in particular, strengthening electoral processes around the world, but stresses the need to ensure a coherent post-electoral policy, paying particular attention to convergence between technical and political follow-up and input from civil society, so that development support is consistent with democratic principles and democratic governance values; 20. Calls on the Commission to build further on its successful cooperation with the UN on election observation missions and to strengthen common strategy-building and project design with the UN and other regional organisations, such as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the African Union, in connection with the promotion of democracy and human rights; 21. Stresses that the EU's democracy-building efforts should more systematically include a special focus on the role of elected representatives and political parties, an independent judiciary and the media and on the strengthening of women's participation in political and public life; underlines, further, the importance of supporting political foundations, non-governmental organisations and academic institutions; 22. Recommends the introduction of a specific strategy to support newly democratically-elected parliaments with a view to permanently entrenching democracy, the rule of law and good governance; calls, further, for the development of a peer-to-peer instrument involving parliamentarians of different nationalities with a view to determining what constitutes efficient and effective representation of the interests of the electorate, efficient and effective oversight of the executive and ways and means of main\u00ad taining a flow of information between all parts of the governance system; 23. Confirms its own determination to contribute to the strengthening of democratic processes by enhancing its involvement in election observation, follow-up to EU EOMs and parliamentary capacity-building; calls, in that connection, on its Office for Promotion of Parliamentary Democracy (OPPD) to present a comprehensive action plan to the relevant parliamentary committees which should necessarily include a clear mechanism for cooperation with interparliamentary delegations and joint parlia\u00ad mentary committees; underlines, further, the importance of involving parliamentary assemblies, such as the ACP-EU, EUROLAT, EUROMED and EURONEST assemblies, in this process; 24. Encourages the Commission delegations to work in partnership with the OPPD when considering or initiating parliamentary support programmes; 25. Recommends that an action plan be included in the November Council conclusions and that a review of the progress made be carried out by the end of 2010; requests the current and forthcoming EU Presidencies to present the outcome of the General Affairs and External Relations Council meetings to its committees responsible; 26. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
