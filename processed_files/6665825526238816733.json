        "5 1. KEY OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES The ACP-EU Partnership is centred on the objective of reducing and eventually eradicating poverty, consistent with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP States into the world economy (Art. 1 of the Cotonou Agreement). The EU maintains privileged political, trade and development cooperation relations with ACP countries, including Sub-Saharan Africa. The European Development Fund (EDF) is the main instrument for providing Union aid for development cooperation to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States and Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs). The EDF supports actions in the ACP countries and the OCTs in the following key areas for cooperation: (I) economic development; (II) social and human development; (III) regional cooperation and integration; (IV) thematic and cross-cutting issues, such as gender issues, environment and natural resources, institutional development and capacity building. This instrument, combined with the bilateral activities of various EU Member States in the region, constitutes the most important source of development cooperation for the ACP countries and regions. Under the 11 th EDF, the EU cooperation finances: \uf0b7 Bilateral programmes (47 beneficiary countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa, 15 respectively in the Caribbean and the Pacific) \uf0b7 Regional programmes (6 regions: Southern Africa (SADC), Central Africa, West Africa and Eastern and Southern Africa- Indian Ocean (ESA-IO), Caribbean, Pacific, plus PALOP) \uf0b7 Intra-ACP programmes, aiming to address the shared challenges facing ACP States through operations among which support to global initiatives is foreseen (e.g. African Peace Facility) The below tables are extracted from the Annual Activity Report 2015, annex 11.

        "6 GENERAL OBJECTIVE: Fostering the sustainable and inclusive development in partner countries and regions and the promotion of democracy, the rule of law, good governance and the respect of human rights as foreseen in the TEU, with the primary aim of eradicating poverty. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE 1: Poverty reduction and fostering sustainable economic, social and environmental development. INDICATOR 1: MDG 1.2 Poverty gap ratio at $1.25 a day (2005 PPP), percentage Baseline Target (2015) \u2022 Sub-Saharan Africa 21.1% (2010) \u2022 Caribbean: 6% \u2022 Pacific: 52% (1990) \u201cHalve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than $1.25 a day\u201d \u2022 Sub-Saharan Africa: 12,68% \u2022 Caribbean 6% \u2022 Pacific: target already achieved (initially set at 26%.

        "7 largest over the past two decades. The under-five mortality rate has fallen from 179 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 86 in 2015. Yet the region still faces an urgent need to accelerate progress. Not only does sub-Saharan Africa carry about half of the burden of the world\u2019s under-five deaths\u20143 million in 2015\u2014 but it is also the only region where both the number of live births and the under-five population are expected to rise substantially over the next decades. This means that the number of under-five deaths will increase unless progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate is enough to outpace population growth. \u2022 Caribbean: the rate in Latin America and Caribbean was reduced by 69% since 1990.

        "10 2. KEY RESULTS: MONITORING AND EVALUATIONS 2.1. Key results Following the Staff Working Document SWD (2013)530 \"Paving the way for an EU development and cooperation results framework\", the Commission issued on 26 March 2015, a further SWD \"Launching the EU international cooperation and development results framework\" (SWD(2015)80). The latter translates the approaches set out in the 2013 Staff Working Document into operational terms, includes the mechanisms in support of the reporting process and details the indicators of the EU RF against which DG International Cooperation and Development will report annually as of 2015 to demonstrate how funds spent contribute to the achievement of the policy objectives. A results framework is a tool that is used to measure results achieved against strategic development objectives; and which should be understood as an articulation of the different levels of results 4 expected from the implementation of a strategy. With this in mind, the list of development sectors covered by the EU RF has been defined to reflect the policy priorities of the EU international cooperation and development assistance as set out in the Agenda for Change in particular. It covers twelve areas and sectors 5 and is associated to 16 out of 17 SDGs corresponding to EU policy priorities 6 . In that context, the Commission has also been looking at synergies that could be created to facilitate reporting on overall key results of EU funded actions at the level of individual countries. Furthermore, the Commission\u2019s services have continued to work on the preparation and implementation of reforms of project monitoring and reporting which aim to improve quality and accountability during and at end of project implementation. This relates both to monitoring and reporting by the Commission services and EU Delegations and external technical assistance used by them. A first set of reforms, which relate to external technical assistance, was rolled out over the first half of 2015. The assistance is provided through the new Results Oriented Monitoring (ROM) system. The new system is characterised by the selection of projects based on risk and those in need of support through the system. It also applies greater attention to project results during ROM reviews of ongoing projects and programmes and provides specific support to end of project results reporting linked to the reporting on the basis of the Results framework. The 2014-2020 country, regional and thematic multi-annual programming documents have been systematically reviewed in order to ensure expected results and indicators are of appropriate (measurable) quality and a manageable number. 4 The results terminology used in this document follows the OECD DAC definition, where the term results should be interpreted as covering the results chain from outputs to outcomes and impact. 5 Inclusive and sustainable growth and poverty reduction; Good Governance; Agriculture and Food Security; Energy; Public Finance Management; Education; Health; Natural Resources and Climate Change; Transport; Employment and Social Protection; Trade Private Sector Development; Conflict Prevention and Security 6 This means that for several indicators contained in the EU RF a corresponding SDG target can be identified. ",
        "11 For the preparation of new individual actions, a new Action Document template was adopted by end of year to be in force as of 1 January 2015, which puts a stronger focus on results to ensure that expected results and indicators are properly included in Action Documents. Specific provisions on results oriented reporting by EU implementing partners have been added in the course of 2014 in the new templates for the Administration Agreement (with the World Bank) and of the PAGODA Agreement (covering all pillar assessed organisations \u2013 including UN agencies). This should help to ensure greater availability of results data in progress and final reports transmitted by EU implementing partners. Second Report on Selected Results of EU-funded projects and programmes DEVCO has recently published the second detailed report on selected results of projects and programmes financed by the European Union as part of its Annual Report 2016. The report is based on the new EU International Cooperation and Development Results Framework launched by the European Commission in March 2015. This Second Report on Selected Results on data collected between July 2014 and June 2015 presents in particular the aggregated results to which the EU contributed through projects and programmes that ended between mid-2014 and mid-2015 and were funded mainly by the DCI, ENI and EDF instruments. Here below, an extract is provided on EDF-funded projects and programmes. EU contributions to results in partner countries: aggregated results Results by sector Good Governance EU Results Framework indicator Total results Number of human rights defenders who have received EU support 1,000 Number of elections supported by the EU where the electoral process is perceived by independent observers as free and fair 2 Number of individuals benefiting directly from justice, rule of law and security sector reform programmes funded by EU external assistance programmes 49,200 Number of people directly benefiting from legal aid programmes 47,130 Good governance is vital for inclusive and sustainable development. EU support in this sector is focused on partners\u2019 commitments to democracy, human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and to meeting their peoples\u2019 demands and needs. In Mauritius , EU support consisted of technical assistance to the administration focussing on developing operational skills amongst Mauritian officials to ensure that the elections ran smoothly. There was increased voter turnout ( over 73 %, compared to the 53% of registered voters who had voted in the 2010 Presidential elections) in the parliamentary (Nation Representatives) and municipal elections held in early 2015. In 13 municipalities of the North-East Department of Haiti over the period 2013-2014, 45,000 members of 853 community-based organisations were reached by targeted awareness-raising activities on the rights of women, children and people with disabilities ",
        "12 under the Project for Strengthening the Action Capacity of Civil Society Organisations. Such activities sought to educate marginalised groups as well as competent authorities on decisions and strategies for the protection of the rights of women, children and people with disabilities, as well as to develop a set of specifications on the needs of women of the community that would serve as an advocacy document guiding public policy. In a region where trafficking, violence against women and children and discrimination against disabled individuals has increased in recent years, EU support under this project made a valuable contribution to educating civil society actors and helping them develop clear common ideas about the needs of marginalised groups and the social protection framework. Conflict Prevention EU Results Framework indicator Total results Number of individuals benefiting directly from EU-supported programmes that specifically aim to support civilian post-conflict peace building and/or conflict prevention 2,600 The purpose of the EU\u2019s development, foreign and security policy initiatives is to create a more coherent approach to peace, state-building, poverty reduction and the underlying causes of conflict. Where conflict has occurred, the EU aims to contribute to a smooth transition from humanitarian aid and crisis response to long-term development cooperation and is moving forward on an integrated security and development approach such as in the Sahel. Sustainable Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition EU Results Framework indicator Total results Agricultural and pastoral ecosystems where sustainable land- management practices have been introduced (in hectares) 5,010 Number of people receiving rural advisory services 150,980 Number of people who have secure tenure of land 2,200 Number of women of reproductive age and children under 5 benefiting from nutrition-related programmes 1,052,000 Number of food insecure people receiving assistance through social transfers supported by the EU 1,265,000 In agriculture, the EU aims to support sustainable practices, including safeguarding ecosystem services, prioritising locally developed practices and focusing on smallholder agriculture and rural livelihoods, the formation of producer groups, the supply and marketing chain, and government efforts to facilitate responsible private investment. The EU continues to work on strengthening nutritional standards, governance of food security and reducing food-price volatility at international level. Land tenure is important in rural development interventions which emphasise building people\u2019s endowments of assets so that they can enjoy sustainable livelihoods. Property rights to land, together with labour, form the most common endowments used to produce ",
        "13 food for home consumption as well as cash crops that allow the family or individual to pay for other needs, such as health and education. In Gogrial East County (Warrap State) in South Sudan 4,200 people from 600 vulnerable households participated in various cash-for-work activities, such as production of bricks for the construction of community buildings (e.g. seed bank, school) over the period 2012-2015. The cash-for-work scheme enabled most of the beneficiaries to transition from depending on hand-outs to earning a living through their labour. Payments were made before the start of the planting season, so as to facilitate the purchase of food items and seeds, and to increase beneficiaries' food security and prospects for agricultural income. Vulnerable households were also able to acquire assets such as goats and sheep, which enhanced their ability to withstand adverse climatic events such as droughts or floods that destroy agricultural production. Malnutrition has negative effects on children's cognitive development and school attendance, as well as their productivity as adults. In Madagascar extreme poverty rates in some regions are as high as 97%, and food insecurity rates as high as 65%. Over the period 2013 -2014 the EU supported 220,000 primary school children and teachers from food insecure areas in the regions of Atsimo Andrefana, Anosy and Androy, who received approximately 38 million school meals. This increased beneficiaries' food security, but also maintained school attendance in the affected regions. Energy In energy, the EU aims to offer technology and expertise focusing on three main challenges: price volatility and energy security; climate change, including access to low- carbon technologies; and access to secure, affordable, clean and sustainable energy services. In Madagascar , the Ihosy region has faced frequent power disruptions in the past. Over the period 2008-2014 the EU supported a project to provide access to electricity to 20,000 inhabitants of the Ihosy region, as well as street lighting and basic public services. The reliable supply of electricity will also benefit the development of small businesses as well as other new economic activities. Education EU Results Framework indicator Total results Number of children enrolled in primary education 3,160,000 Number of children enrolled in secondary education 450 Support for basic (primary and lower secondary) education is the foundation for future learning and skills development. However, in 2013, the number of children and young adolescents out of school stood at 124 million 7 . Many of these children live in conflict- 7 UNESCO: http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/fs-31-out-of-school-children-en.pdf EU Results Framework indicator Total results Kilometres of transmission/distribution lines built or upgraded 1,600 ",

In Zambia, the EU supported up to 3,135,000 primary school children (1,567,000 girls and 1,569,000 boys) to be enrolled in school. Over the lifetime of the project, the proportion of children completing primary school rose from 53 per cent to 64 percent. Health EU Results Framework indicator Total results Number of births attended by skilled health personnel 2,921,000 Number of 1-year-olds immunised 44,000 The EU is taking action to develop and strengthen health systems, reduce inequalities regarding access to health services, and increase protection against global health threats so as to improve health outcomes for all. A key policy area is enabling women to have access to skilled health personnel during pregnancy and childbirth, to ensure prevention, detection and management of complications. Assistance provided by trained health personnel with adequate equipment is key to lowering maternal deaths. In Somalia , over the period 2011-2014 20,000 births were attended by skilled health personnel. Under this project, training was provided to 18 midwives and other health staff, which improved their capacity to manage routine emergency obstetric and neonatal cases as well as to make referrals of complication to a higher tertiary level of patient care. This resulted in lower maternal and child mortality. Another policy priority is the immunisation of children under 1 year old, as this is an essential part of reducing under-5 mortality rates. It is also one of the specific actions to increase protection against global health threats. Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change EU Results Framework indicator Total results Number of countries/regions with climate change strategies either developed and/or implemented with EU support 4 Number of hectares of protected areas being managed 274,000 Number of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) applying sustainable consumption and production practices 240 One of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) is to promote the transparent management of natural resources, including raw materials and maritime resources. The EU is also promoting a \u2018green economy\u2019 that can generate growth, create jobs and help reduce poverty by giving value to and investing in natural capital. This includes supporting market opportunities for cleaner technologies, energy and resource efficiency, low-carbon development while stimulating innovation, the use of information and communications technologies, and reducing the unsustainable use of natural resources.

Often, roads are the only way of reaching most rural communities, and they provide a means of transportation that is readily accessible to the most disadvantaged sections of the population. However, the development of road networks frequently outstrips the resources available to properly maintain them \u2013 resources that are estimated at approximately 5-10% of the operating budgets of many partner country governments. The EU supports not the building but also the rehabilitation and maintenance of the road network in our partner countries. Employment and Social Protection EU Results Framework indicator Total results Number of people who have benefited from VET/skills development and other active labour market programmes with EU support 8,000 Through capacity-building and exchange of knowledge, the EU supports vocational training to enhance employability, productivity and competitiveness, especially among the young, who are more likely to be unemployed because of a lack of appropriate skills that match the demands of the current labour market. Trade and Private Sector Development EU Results Framework indicator Total results Number of firms with access to credit 640 Number of quality certifications issued 38 Number of countries where the business environment has improved 3 The EU supports the development of competitive local private sectors, including by building local businesses and institutional capacity, promoting SMEs and cooperatives, supporting legislative and regulatory framework reforms and their enforcement, and facilitating access to business and financial services. This enables partner countries, especially the poorest, to harness the opportunities offered by globally integrated markets. The EU is helping SMEs to achieve quality certification standards so that their goods and services meet international standards and they can reap the benefits of the multilateral trading system. Results by country The aggregated results achieved with EU support divided by country have been included in Annex B. ",
        "16 2.2. Outlook over evaluations Review of the work programme The DEVCO Evaluation Unit manages strategic evaluations, 8 covering geographic, thematic and sector programs, and aid delivery mechanisms. Evaluations are carried out by independent external consultants who follow a standardized methodology. All evaluation reports and the responses to their recommendations are public. 9 As for what concerns the regions covered by the EDF, in the period 2014-2015 the following reports were published: Budget Support evaluations for Mozambique and Uganda, country evaluations for Cameroon, Kenya, Haiti, Democratic Republic of Congo, Togo, Lesotho, Timor-Leste, Madagascar and the Pacific Region and a joint evaluation of the cooperation with Burundi. Furthermore, were also published a Study on uptake and a Synthesis of the evaluations of General and Sector Budget Support undertaken in five countries (Mali, Zambia, Tanzania, South Africa and Mozambique) over 2010 \u2013 2014, a Strategic evaluation of the EU support to environment and climate change in third countries (2007-2013), a Review of evaluations of EU Private Sector Development Support to Third Countries and a Strategic evaluation of EU Support to Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in Partner Countries. Overall, the relevance of the EU cooperation is considered as appropriate and responding to partner country\u2019s needs. The evaluations recognised the overall contribution of the EU to poverty reduction and demonstrate how it has addressed core development needs, achieving different degrees of performance. The way EU operate in fragile countries is positively assessed, notably its capacity to stay flexible and keep sight of the shorter and longer term approaches, addressing both core development problems and emergencies. Budget support (BS) is recognised as having contributed to positive achievements of targeted development results. In this context, the recent synthesis of BS evaluations confirmed that there is strong evidence of the contribution of budget support to improvements in public service delivery, within Public Finance Management systems and with regards to regulating economic activities. Improvements are to be made in particular as regards policy dialogue and the utilisation of potentials of capacity development. It also underlines that budget support is not correlated with policy leverage, thus confirming the earlier findings from the pilot cases, that BS cannot 'buy' reforms.\" Several evaluations emphasise the need for stronger context and risk analysis, as well as the analysis of the politics and policies shared among donors in order to continuously adjust our assistance and the use of various aid modalities. They also recommend paying more attention to the political developments. 8 Strategic evaluations analyse EU strategies from conception to implementation, assessing the results of EU funded activities. These evaluations are complex, covering several programmes and instruments over a significant period of time. They are conducted at several levels: country, region or sector; they can also assess the procedures and instruments DEVCO uses to provide aid. Strategic evaluations help understand why in a specific context development strategies have been successful or not, and provide recommendations to the decision-makers for the future programming and implementation 9 http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/how/evaluation/evaluation_reports/index_en.htm ",
        "17 Synthesis of key lessons learned Main findings and lessons learned from Budget Support evaluations The synthesis of the five evaluations of General and Sector Budget Support undertaken in the relevant countries (Mali, Zambia, Tanzania, South Africa, Mozambique) shows the main contributions of Budget Support: Increased provision of Public Goods and Services in agreed priority sectors (in particular health, education and roads); Improved non- income poverty reduction; Strengthened PFM systems; and Improved Policy Dialogue on Sector Reforms and Systems. Main conclusions for Budget Support: 1. As Aid Modality Budget Support is best aligned with criteria laid down in the Paris Declaration, Accra Agenda and Busan. 2. Budget support is no panacea and not applicable in all circumstances (for example with an absence of sector strategies; direct improvements of service delivery at local level; or local government development), 3. Budget support is most effective in situations of partnership based on trust and confidence. 4. Budget support allows for wider and deeper policy dialogue and eliminates a \"piecemeal approach.\" Lessons learnt from evaluations in fragile countries Overall, there have been good results at sector level , but the impact and sustainability of EU interventions are at risk and do not allow for deep societal changes. For the future, the EU should undertake more rigorous in depth contextual analysis including institutional constraints and risk assessment and focus more on strengthening political and policy dialogue . It should adopt a comprehensive and flexible approach in order to respond to emerging needs and it should be more realistic on the objectives to be achieved. Its interventions should focus on capacity building and state strengthening in line with the New Deal principles. Evaluation of the Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA) An evaluation of the Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA) 10 carried out in 2014 showed a good level of achievement. In most cases, GCCA funds and policy support worked in synergy with climate change initiatives led by EU MS and multilateral agencies at national level, therefore providing quicker results and lower transaction costs. The unique complementarity between global, regional and national foci further differentiated the GCCA from other climate actions and added value to national programmes and capacities. The GCCA has also led to improved dialogue on climate change, both within target countries, and at regional cooperation and global levels and made an important contribution to learning and public awareness. Other benefits came from increased practical cooperation for reducing poverty and vulnerability. The evaluation has also identified some room for improvement e.g. in using more fully the potential of policy dialogue, including the coordination of European support provided to climate change negotiations, Improved policy dialogue is needed given that support for 10 http://www.gcca.eu/ The GCCA operates in ACP countries (such as Samoa, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, Jamaica, Guyana, Haiti, and several countries in Africa) through programmes at different levels: National, Regional, Multi-country, as well as Intra ACP Technical Assistance. ",
        "18 climate change negotiations is widely scattered between national, regional and global actions, and the division of responsibilities is not made clear. A positive outcome would be a stronger regional and national ownership of the climate-change agenda. Evaluation of the FLEGT Facility 11 The evaluation of the FLEGT Facility in the sector of forest law enforcement, governance and trade, concluded that the facility\u2019s work is highly relevant and that there are clear links between the progress observed in partner countries and the support provided by the facility. The Facility plays a key role in providing expertise and in managing and sharing knowledge in support of the FLEGT Action Plan implementation. Its set-up allows it to respond flexibly and swiftly to the needs and demands of partner countries. FLEGT processes are complex and seek to address difficult technical and governance issues requiring a mix of skills, few of which are present either with EU Delegations or partner countries. The Facility is instrumental to support partner countries in tackling these matters. In general the quality of the expertise and knowledge provided is globally recognized. The evaluation recognizes however that cost-effectiveness can be further improved. Evaluation of MIEUX 12 In the area of migration, an evaluation of the programme, while mentioning good practices such as South-South cooperation and peer-to-peer coaching (Programme \"MIEUX\" \u2013 EUR 8M aimed at enhancing migration management capacities of partner countries), pointed to several weaker aspects, e.g. the need to increase the capacity of institutions and civil society organisations to better handle the multi-dimensional link between migration and development. Enhancing migration governance is a shared responsibility requiring strengthened policy coherence as well as effective partnerships between countries of origin, transit and destination. Strengthening migration management capacities of partner countries is essential in order to increase the efficiency of their migration policies and support them in meeting their responsibilities towards the citizens and migrants they host. This should be done in a comprehensive manner covering all relevant areas including labour migration, migration and development, international protection, addressing smuggling and trafficking and protection of migrants' rights. A synthesis on performance information contained in evaluations can be found in annex B.1. Annex B.2. lists all evaluations and studies carried out in the reference period. 11 http://www.flegt.org/ Among ACP countries, those where FLEGT projects have been implemented are: Suriname, Guyana, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo DRC, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar.

        "43 Annex D. Implementation of the Bridging Facility for the ACP Balance of 10th EDF and de-commitments in 8th, 9th and 10th EDF The 31/12/2013 de-commitments from the 8 th and 9 th transferred to the reserves amounted 924,155,413.95 \u20ac. With the balances of the 10 th EDF (73,715,210.30 \u20ac) the total available at the beginning of the Bridging Facility was 997,870,624.25 \u20ac . By mid-2013 we forecast a rhythm of de-commitments of 35 M\u20ac per month, on the basis of the trend registered during the last months, assuming that the possible decrease in de-commitments of 8 th EDF would be balanced by the new and growing de-commitments from the 10 th EDF. In consequence, de-commitments have fed the Bridging Facility gradually, but in a quite irregular way during 2014 and first two months of 2015. A total amount of 1,630,467,849.91 \u20ac has been reached by 28 February 2015 , after a last \u2018cleansing\u2019 operation of de-commitments in former EDF. This is the maximum theoretical amount that could have been committed during the transition period, although for the last recovery of near 23 million there was practically no time to have them legally committed under the facility. Out of that total potential amount, 1,598,118,000 \u20ac have been allocated from the Bridging Facility to different budget lines to finance priorities within the pipeline. Pipeline for the Bridging Facility ",
        "44 A pipeline of actions was established at the beginning of 2014 on the basis of the priorities identified by the Delegations and corresponding geographical units. It was adopted in consultation with the EEAS and validated by Commissioner Piebalgs in March 2014 . The pipeline over programmed by 10 % the projected resources, assuming that a certain number of actions would have a high risk of being finally delayed. The bridging facility allowed the funding of priority actions that could not be postponed until the entry into force of the 11th EDF. It covered: \uf0b7 The African Peace Facility; \uf0b7 Intra-ACP joint institutions and ACP secretariat; \uf0b7 Unforeseen needs such as ECHO and Ebola; \uf0b7 Support expenditure in Headquarters and Delegations; \uf0b7 High priorities within national/regional programmes ACP/OCTs. It was subsequently reviewed in order to adapt to evolving needs, taking into account the available resources and the readiness of the actions. A reviewed pipeline was validated in October 2014 , taking also into account actions to be funded in early 2015. Sound Financial Management of the Facility First amounts from the BF were allocated in March 2014, to fund mainly ECHO, the APF, and support costs. From May 2014 we started to allocate funds for the national, regional and Intra- ACP programmes. Also in May 2014 , in view of the low rhythm of de-commitments in former EDF from the beginning of the year, we launched a call in HQ and Delegations to accelerate and close faster pending dossiers involving de-commitments . As a result, we recovered much of the funds we would need in the aftermath. However, the summer break had again a negative effect, slowing down drastically the rhythm of de-commitments in September, when we were close to run out of reserves (see graphs above). In October 2014 , a revision of the pipeline as mentioned above and a new call to resume efforts in HQ and Delegations led to a quick and impressive recovery of the rhythm of replenishment of the Bridging Facility. Since many programmes were ready for commitment we entered completely in a tense \u2018cash-flow\u2019 dynamic to manage the bridging facility. We have managed to find a balance in order to comply with different principles : - Ensure availability of credit and a reserve for contingencies (10-20 M\u20ac). - Plan a calendar of allocations, depending on the preparation of actions to finance and on inflows to the facility from on-going de-commitments. - Keeping the objective of financing properly and fairly the priorities. - Ensuring a final level of commitment as close as possible to the final availability of funds. As a result, credit appropriations have been used in an optimal way, with a soft \u2018landing\u2019 of the bridging facility at the end of its life: ",
        "45 Final results of the Bridging Facility Out of the total allocated amount from the BF during the transition period, we have committed a total of 1,591,572,259.89 \u20ac for the ACP 13 . The following table shows the breakdown of allocations and commitments according to the origin of funds: Total Origin 8-9 EDF Origin 10 EDF Allocated 1,598,118,000.00 1,399,597,882.39 198,520,117.61 Committed 1,591,572,259.89 1,399,597,882.39 191,974,377.50 It has been decided to use first all the funds of 8 th and 9 th EDF origin. The non-allocated balance in the bridging facility belongs therefore to the 10 th EDF and it will be allocated back to the Performance reserve of the 11 th EDF (see schema in annex 1 for better understanding). In overall, the Bridging Facility has funded 83 actions in the ACP area.
