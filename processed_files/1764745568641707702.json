        "3 1. INTRODUCTION Foreword The European Commission\u2019s Competence Centre on Microeconomic Evaluation (CC-ME) was founded on May 19, 2016 to support the evaluation function in the European Commission. CC-ME is part of Unit JRC.I.1 \u2018Monitoring, Indicators & Impact Evaluation\u2019. CC-ME builds on the experience of the Centre for Research on Impact Evaluation (CRIE), which started as a joint project of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the European Commission Directorate-General Employment, Social affairs and Inclusion (DG-EMPL) in 2013. CRIE is now an integral part of CC-ME. This brochure reports highlights of CC-ME activities in 2019.

        "5 1. INTRODUCTION Counterfactuals WHAT IS COUNTERFACTUAL IMPACT EVALUATION? Counterfactual Impact Evaluation (CIE) compares the outcomes of individuals participating in a programme or firms / regions subject to a specific regulation (the treated group) with the outcomes of a comparison group, similar in all respects to the treated one but for participation to the programme (the comparison or control group). The comparison group helps addressing the question: \u2018what would have happened to the treated individuals (or firms/regions) had they not participated to the programme?\u2019 known as the counterfactual case. WHY DO WE NEED COUNTERFACTUAL IMPACT EVALUATION? One basic goal of an evaluation is to learn to which degree the policy objectives were achieved. CIE is the best tool to establish a causal link between policies and their effects, relying on data available both for the treated and the control groups. ",

        "22 3. EVENTS Workshops & Communities COMMUNITY OF PRACTICIES ON CIE FOR THE ESF The Community of Practices (CoP) is active since 2016 in collaboration with DG EMPL, to foster the use of CIE to evaluate the impact of the interventions funded through the European Social Fund (ESF), and to create an environment where to share experience about CIEs. The CoP in 2019 was held in Dublin on June 7 th . The CoP focused on the theme of data provision for evaluation, and specifically tacked the following questions: \u2022 which evaluation questions can be answered about the policy to be evaluated; \u2022 what are the ideal data needed to address such questions; \u2022 which are the main limitations that the Managing Authorities encounter in the data provision process. The topics of the CoP allowed focusing on future data needs and issues related to the use of different types of data (survey and administrative registers), so as to best prepare for the evaluation of future interventions. NETCIEX NetCIEX is a multilateral Collaboration Agreement, which aims to foster research collaboration between the CC-ME and several academic and institutional partners in order to contribute more effectively to the understanding of effects of policy and to resolving scientific issues in the field of CIE. In 2019 the following Universities were participanting to the Network: Cattolica Univerisity of Milan, Insubria University, University of Milan, University of Genova, Universit\u00e1 della Svizzera Italiana.
