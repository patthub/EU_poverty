        "E. whereas the past four years \u2014 2015 to 2018 \u2014 were the four warmest years on global record and 2018 saw a record high in global carbon emissions; whereas July 2019 was the hottest month on record and the year 2019 continues the current trend, putting 2015-2019 on track to be the hottest five years on record, according to the WMO; F. whereas according to the WMO, global CO 2 concentration was 407,8 parts per million (ppm) in 2018, 2,2 ppm higher than in 2017, and CO 2 concentrations are on track to reach or even exceed 410 ppm by the end of 2019; G. whereas climate strikes have taken place in 185 countries across the world as part of a global movement, with a record 7,6 million people taking to the streets in September 2019 for the largest climate mobilisation in history; H. whereas the preamble to the Paris Agreement recognises the \u2018importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans\u2019, and Article 4(1)(d) of the UNFCCC stresses that the Parties thereto shall promote sustainable management, and the conservation and enhancement of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases, including biomass, forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems; I. whereas Chile, as the incoming Presidency of COP25, has already indicated that it will highlight the role of the oceans in combating global warming, a decision that is all the more judicious after the publication by the IPCC of an alarming new report on ocean warming; J. whereas forests contribute substantially to climate change mitigation and adaptation; whereas around 10 % of the EU\u2019s GHG emissions are absorbed by growing forests; whereas deforestation accounts for nearly 20 % of global GHG emissions, and is driven in particular by expanding industrial production of livestock, soy and palm oil, including those destined for the EU market; whereas the EU should reduce its indirect contributions to deforestation (\u2018embodied deforestation\u2019), for which it bears a responsibility; K. whereas Parliament has now asked the Commission several times, including in its resolution on climate change of 14 March 2019, to examine CO 2 pricing in sectors that are not yet covered by the EU emissions trading system (ETS); L. whereas climate change disproportionately affects developing countries, despite the fact that they emit far less CO 2 than developed countries; 1. Recalls that climate change is one of the most important challenges facing humanity and that all states and players worldwide must do their utmost to fight it; underlines that timely international cooperation, solidarity and a coherent and unwavering commitment to joint action is the only solution to fulfil our collective responsibility of safeguarding the entire planet; 2. Acknowledges that the serious risks of climate change are at the heart of people\u2019s concerns; recalls that according to the 2019 Eurobarometer survey, 93 % of EU citizens see climate change as a serious problem; welcomes the fact that people across the world, and the younger generation in particular, are increasingly active in fighting for climate action; welcomes their calls for greater collective ambition and swift action in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and not to overshoot the 1,5 o C limit; urges national, regional and local governments, as well as the EU, to heed these calls; 3. Acknowledges that public support is indispensable for the success of ambitious and inclusive EU climate policy and measures; considers that this should be reflected in the EU\u2019s efforts to tackle climate change; C 232/32 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.6.2021 Thursday 28 November 2019 ",
        "4. Acknowledges that the burden of climate change is already, and will continue to be, overwhelmingly on the countries of the Global South, that the countries of the Global South are more vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change than the Global North, are already experiencing losses and damages, and also have less capacities to adapt, and that the countries of the Global South have contributed to the climate crisis considerably less than the Global North; 5. Recalls that the preamble to the Paris Agreement acknowledges the \u2018right to health\u2019 as a key right; underlines that Article 4(1)(f) of the UNFCCC states that all Parties thereto should employ \u2018appropriate methods, for example impact assessments, formulated and determined nationally, with a view to minimising adverse effects on the economy, on public health and on the quality of the environment, of projects or measures undertaken by them to mitigate or adapt to climate change\u2019; considers that health should be included in national adaptation plans and national communications to the UNFCCC; 6. Regrets the fact that the indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for climate change do not include health; notes, nonetheless, that the situation is being remedied in academic research initiatives by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and by the Secretariat of the UNFCCC; welcomes the adoption of the UN high-level political declaration of 23 September 2019 on universal health coverage; 7. Recognises that it will be next to impossible to achieve most of the SDGs unless the climate and environment ambitions agreed to at COP21 are met; 8. Highlights that the direct impacts of climate change are already being felt; underlines that according to the report by the Global Commission on Adaptation, climate change could push more than 100 million people into poverty by 2030 and crop yields could fall by 5-30 % by 2050, leaving especially vulnerable areas food insecure; 9. Stresses that unmitigated warming is expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes by 23 % by 2100 and widening global income inequality; emphasises that in contrast to prior estimates, expected global losses are approximately linear in global mean temperature, with median losses many times larger than leading models indicate ( 4 ); Scientific basis for climate action 10. Underlines that the IPCC 1,5 o C special report represents the most comprehensive and up-to-date scientific assessment of mitigation pathways in line with the Paris Agreement; emphasises that according to the report, in order to have a good chance of keeping the global temperature increase below 1,5 o C by 2100 with no or limited overshoot, net-zero global GHG emissions will need to be achieved by 2067 at the latest, and annual global GHG emissions will need to be reduced to a maximum of 27,4 Gt CO 2 eq per year by 2030; stresses that in the light of these findings and in line with the Paris Agreement, the EU, as a global leader and together with other major global economies, needs to strive towards reaching net-zero GHG emissions as early as possible and by 2050 at the latest; 11. Stresses that the IPCC special report on climate change and land underlines the particularly dramatic effects of global warming on land; expresses concern that human-induced land degradation, due mostly to unsustainable agricultural practices, and increasing land-use disturbances such as forest fires are further diminishing the capacity of land to act as a carbon sink; underlines that these dramatic consequences are expected to get worse if the prevailing global trends continue; 12. Highlights the fact that the IPCC special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate underlines that climate mechanisms depend on the health of the ocean and marine ecosystems, which are currently affected by global warming, pollution, the overexploitation of marine biodiversity, rising sea levels, acidification, deoxygenation, marine heatwaves, the unprecedented melting of glaciers and sea ice, and coastal erosion; stresses, in addition, the report\u2019s findings 16.6.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 232/33 Thursday 28 November 2019 ( 4 ) Burke, M. et al., \u2018Global non-linear effect of temperature on economic production\u2019, Nature , Vol 527, pp. 235-239. ",
        "with regard to the aggravated risks to marine ecosystems, coastal communities and livelihoods; recalls that the ocean is part of the solution to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change; underlines that COP25 will be the first ever \u2018Blue COP\u2019; calls for the EU, therefore, to put the ocean high on the agenda of the European Green Deal and at the forefront of ongoing international negotiations on the climate; 13. Expresses concern at the findings of the UNEP\u2019s 2018 emissions gap report, most notably the fact that current unconditional NDCs are not remotely sufficient to keep to the Paris Agreement warming limit of well below 2 o C, and are instead projected to lead to estimated warming of 3,2 o C ( 5 ) by 2100, assuming that climate action continues consistently throughout the 21st century; highlights the high risk that with warming of 3,2 o C, certain tipping points are passed and massive additional warming is induced; 14. Expresses concern at the findings of the high-level synthesis report (\u2018United in Science\u2019) convened for the UN Climate Action Summit 2019, notably the fact that the growth of coal emissions resumed in 2017 and that annual growth of CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels reached a new high in 2018, leading to alarming and unprecedented GHG concentrations in the atmosphere; 15. Stresses that the current level of NDC ambition would need to be increased fivefold in order not to overshoot the 1.5 o C limit; highlights that this global ambition is still technically feasible, and would bring about numerous co-benefits for the environment and public health; 16. Underlines that according to the WHO, climate change affects the social and environmental determinants of health \u2014 clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food and secure shelter \u2014 and that 250 000 additional deaths, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress, are expected every year between 2030 and 2050, with extreme high air temperatures contributing directly to deaths from cardiovascular and respiratory disease, particularly amongst the elderly and vulnerable individuals; stresses that through flood, heatwaves, drought and fires, climate change has a considerable impact on human health, including undernutrition, mental health, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and vector-borne infections; stresses that poorer standards of hygiene and limited access to drinking water and to health services are jeopardising the health of women, especially during pregnancy; 17. Stresses that the IPBES 2019 global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services, the IPCC special report on climate change and land, the IPCC special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate, and the Global Commission on Adaptation\u2019s flagship report recognise climate change as one of the main direct drivers of biodiversity loss and land degradation; underlines that the negative effects of climate change on nature and biodiversity, on ecosystem services, and on oceans and food security are projected to become increasingly significant in the decades to come; 18. Reiterates that the strict conservation of high-carbon ecosystems such as peatlands, wetlands, rangelands, mangroves and intact forests is a response option with an immediate impact that can under no circumstances be replaced by afforestation, reforestation and restoration of degraded land, as these do not have an immediate impact; 19. Points out that according to the IPBES global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services, one million species are now threatened with extinction; recalls the crucial role played by biodiversity in enabling humans to combat and adapt to global warming; is concerned about the impact of reduced biodiversity on our levels of resilience; underlines that the loss of biodiversity is not only an environmental issue, but also has wider societal and economic impacts; C 232/34 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.6.2021 Thursday 28 November 2019 ( 5 ) UN Environment Programme, emissions gap report 2018, p. 21.

        "An ambitious EU climate policy: the EU\u2019s NDC and the long-term strategy 20. Calls on all Parties to the UNFCCC, in cooperation with regions and non-state actors, to contribute constructively to the process to be put in place by 2020, when the NDCs will need to be updated to ensure that they are compatible with the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement; acknowledges that current pledges are not sufficient to reach the goals of the Agreement; stresses, therefore, that global GHG emissions should peak as soon as possible and that all Parties, especially the EU and all G20 nations, should step up their efforts and update their NDCs by early 2020, as envisaged by the Paris Agreement; 21. Welcomes the launch of the Climate Ambition Alliance during the UN Climate Action Summit 2019, which includes 59 Parties to the UNFCCC that have signalled their intention to submit enhanced NDCs by 2020, as provided for in the Paris Agreement, and 65 Parties, including the EU, that are working towards achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2050; deplores the fact, however, that not all EU Member States were ready to support an increase in the level of ambition of the EU\u2019s NDC, in spite of the European Parliament\u2019s demands; 22. Stresses the importance of the EU having an ambitious and inclusive climate policy in order to act as a credible and reliable partner on the global stage, and of maintaining the EU\u2019s global climate leadership; underlines the need, therefore, for the EU to invest and make significant advances in research and industrially applicable innovations; 23. Urges EU leaders once again, when meeting at the European Council on 12 and 13 December 2019, to support the EU\u2019s long-term objective of attaining domestic net-zero GHG emissions as soon as possible and by 2050 at the latest; calls on the country holding the Presidency of the Council and the Commission to communicate this objective to the UNFCCC Secretariat as soon as possible thereafter; stresses that in order to reach domestic net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 in the most cost-efficient manner, and so as not to have to rely on carbon removal technologies that would entail significant risks for ecosystems, biodiversity and food security, the 2030 ambition level will need to be raised; underlines that nature-based solutions are a key tool for the EU to reach its GHG emissions reduction objectives; rues the September 2019 UN Climate Summit as an opportunity missed by the EU to set higher ambitions and show leadership for the achievement of the Paris Agreement; deems it of the utmost importance for the EU to send a clear message at COP25 that it stands ready to enhance its contribution to the Paris Agreement; 24. Supports an update of the EU\u2019s NDC with an economy-wide target of a 55 % reduction in domestic GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels; calls on EU leaders, therefore, to support an increase in the level of ambition of the EU\u2019s NDC; believes that this should be done while enshrining in EU law the target to reach climate neutrality as soon as possible and by 2050 at the latest; calls on other global economies to update their NDCs in order to bring about global effects; 25. Expects the European Green Deal to set out a comprehensive and ambitious strategy for achieving a climate neutral Europe by 2050 at the latest, including the target of a 55 % reduction in domestic GHG emissions by 2030; calls on the Commission to adapt all of its relevant policies accordingly, in particular those on climate, agriculture and cohesion; 26. Stresses that concrete implementing measures and enforcement at national and EU level are needed in order to realise the objectives of the Paris Agreement, such as the effective implementation of the 2030 renewable energy and energy efficiency targets; 27. Emphasises that all climate policies should be pursued in line with the principle of a just transition and in close cooperation with civil society and social partners; considers, therefore, that stronger social partnerships and civil society engagement at both national and EU level are fundamental to achieving climate neutrality across all sectors of society in a fair, inclusive and socially sustainable manner; is of the opinion that nature-based solutions and the restoration and conservation of ecosystems and biological diversity are vital enablers of climate change mitigation and adaptation; 16.6.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 232/35 Thursday 28 November 2019 ",
        "28. Believes that as a means to ensure greater stability for markets, it will be beneficial for the EU to establish a further interim emissions reduction target by 2040, as this would provide additional stability and ensure that the net-zero GHG emissions target is met by 2050; recalls the need to regularly update such targets to ensure that they comply with the implementation of the Paris Agreement; 29. Considers that the work on developing a reliable model for measuring climate impact based on consumption should be continued; takes note of the conclusion in the Commission\u2019s in-depth analysis that the EU\u2019s efforts to reduce emissions from its production are somewhat levelled off by imports of goods with a higher carbon footprint, but that the EU has nevertheless contributed significantly to the reduction of emissions in other countries because of the increased trade flow and improved carbon efficiency of its exports; 30. Highlights that a stronger international framework is needed in order to protect global biodiversity, to arrest its current decline and to restore it as much as possible; believes that such a framework should be based on targets and firm commitments, comprising NDCs and other appropriate instruments, financial commitments and improved capacity-build- ing assurances, as well as a five-yearly review mechanism, with an emphasis on an upward trajectory of ambition; COP25 in Madrid, Spain 31. Recognises the achievements of COP24 in Katowice, which reinforced the momentum for climate action and, with the completion of the Paris Agreement Work Programme (the Katowice Rulebook), delivered operational guidance for the Paris Agreement; notes, however, that some unfinished business from Katowice must be completed at COP25, namely on mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement; considers, in addition, that several implementation decisions will need to be taken at COP25, specifically in the areas of mitigation, adaptation, transparency and support; looks forward to a successful outcome at COP25 of the review of the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage and of negotiations on the Gender Action Plan; recognises that there will be further discussions to agree common timeframes at COP25; 32. Underlines the importance of establishing common implementation periods for NDCs, as although many Parties to the UNFCCC have 5 or 10-year timeframes, others have shorter implementation periods or none whatsoever; notes that continuing with conflicting timeframes could have a negative impact on future negotiations on climate ambition; believes that common implementation periods for NDCs would ensure that all Parties update and communicate their commitments in unison and improve the sum total of global efforts and make them easier to quantify; supports the introduction of a five-year common timeframe for all post-2030 NDCs which corresponds to the ambition cycle of the Paris Agreement and is without detriment to additional long-term commitments that the Parties may pursue domestically; 33. Welcomes the fact that Chile is one of the most successful emerging countries in the transition to clean energy and, in particular, that it has overseen the highest increase in solar energy production in the world; believes that Chile\u2019s commitments to addressing the climate emergency should inspire many countries in South America and around the world; 34. Stresses that the global action that is undertaken over the next decade will have an impact on the future of humanity for the next 10 000 years; therefore calls on the Commission and all Parties under COP25 to take bold and ambitious measures; 35. Recognises the role of cooperative approaches in delivering more ambitious mitigation and adaptation outcomes and in promoting sustainable development and environmental integrity; emphasises the need for these endeavours to deliver an overall reduction in emissions, and to avoid an increase in emissions within or between NDC periods; expresses concern at the limited progress achieved during the UNFCCC 50th intersessional meeting in Bonn on market and non-market mechanisms; 36. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to advocate for strict and robust international rules relating to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement; recognises the many problems that a great number of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI) projects under the Kyoto Protocol have posed for environmental integrity and sustainability; calls for the prevention of loopholes in accounting or double counting and regarding the additionality of C 232/36 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.6.2021 Thursday 28 November 2019 ",
        "emissions reductions; expresses concern at the potential use towards NDC targets of units issued under the Kyoto Protocol, as it would seriously undermine the environmental integrity of future mechanisms established under Article 6; underlines that emission rights traded under the new market mechanisms must be additional and increase the mitigation efforts of existing and future NDCs; supports putting a share of the proceeds from the Article 6 mechanisms towards the underfunded Adaptation Fund; 37. Considers that COP25 should define a new level of ambition, both in terms of implementing the Paris Agreement and in relation to the next round of NDCs, which should reflect enhanced commitments to climate action across all sectors on land and in the oceans; 38. Underlines the importance of the EU speaking with a single and unified voice at COP25 in order to uphold its political power and credibility; urges all Member States to support the EU\u2019s mandate during negotiations and bilateral meetings with other actors; The role of forests 39. Recalls that the Paris Agreement requires all Parties to take action to conserve and enhance sinks, including forests; notes that halting deforestation and forest degradation and allowing forests to regrow would constitute at least 30 % of all the mitigation action needed to limit global warming to 1,5 o C; underlines that sustainably managed forests are enormously important in fighting climate change via increased CO 2 sequestration by growing forests, carbon storage in wood products, and the substitution of fossil-based raw materials and energy, while at the same time reducing the risks of forest fires, pest infestations and diseases; stresses the importance of incentivising practices that maintain the natural carbon sinks, including primary forests and intact forest soils, which the Commission communication on stepping up EU action on forest restoration recognises as being irreplaceable; 40. Calls on all Parties, including the EU and its Member States, to honour their international commitments, including inter alia those made within the framework of the UN Forum on Forests, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the New York Declaration on Forests, and SDG 15, in particular target 15.2 thereof, the aim of which is to promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forest, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests, and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally by 2020; calls for greater efforts at all political levels to prevent the deterioration of forests in Europe and to restore their good condition where necessary; asks the Commission and the Member States to support measures for reforestation on degraded soils and those unsuitable for agricultural use; 41. In view of the fundamental role played by forests in the fight against climate change and the challenges that some forest owners in Europe face because of extreme drought and pests, believes that the Commission should consider a framework of incentives in case sustainable forest management no longer has a business case; Climate resilience through adaptation 42. Welcomes the publication of the Commission report on the implementation of the EU strategy on adaptation to climate change, which shows that some progress has been made on each of the strategy\u2019s eight individual actions; notes, however, that despite global efforts to reduce emissions, climate change impacts are inevitable and further action to adapt is vital; calls on the Commission, therefore, to revise the strategy in the light of the report\u2019s conclusions that the EU remains vulnerable to climate impacts both within and beyond its borders; stresses the need for the insurance industry to invest in adaptation and for public and private investment in research and innovation; considers that protecting human health and safety, arresting the decline of biodiversity and land degradation, and promoting urban adaptation constitute priorities; 43. Notes that Article 8 of the Paris Agreement (on Loss and Damage) states that the Parties should take a cooperative approach in relation to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change; therefore highlights the importance of global supportive action in areas especially vulnerable to climate change impacts; 16.6.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 232/37 Thursday 28 November 2019 ",
        "44. Reiterates that adaptation action is an inevitable necessity for all countries if they are to minimise the negative effects of climate change and make full use of the opportunities for climate-resilient growth and sustainable development; stresses the need to develop uniform systems and tools to keep track of the progress and effectiveness of national adaptation plans and actions; regrets the fact that the Member States\u2019 draft national energy and climate plans (NECPs) lacked ambition regarding energy efficiency and renewable energy targets; recalls that renewables including renewable marine energy, as an element of the circular economy, are part of the solution to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change; calls on the Member States to strengthen their national energy and climate plans in order to implement the Paris Agreement in full; Climate finance and other means of implementation 45. Welcomes the decision taken at COP24 that the Adaptation Fund should continue to serve the Paris Agreement; recognises the importance of this fund for those communities most vulnerable to climate change and therefore welcomes the new voluntary contribution of USD 10 million made by Member States to the fund for 2019; 46. Recognises that 37 % of the EU budget currently goes towards the financing of the common agricultural policy (CAP), which could mobilise significant funds with regard to incentivising and rewarding climate- and environmentally friendly practices in agriculture; 47. Reiterates that the CAP should no longer provide subsidies for activities that are harmful to the environment and the climate, including the draining of peatlands and the over-abstraction of water for irrigation, nor should it penalise the presence of trees in agricultural areas; 48. Recognises that the EU and its Member States are the largest provider of public climate finance; welcomes the decision taken at COP24 to decide on a more ambitious target from 2025 onwards, beyond the current commitment to mobilise USD 100 billion per year as of 2020, but expresses concern that the actual pledges by developed countries are still falling a long way short of the collective goal of USD 100 billion per year; expects emerging economies to make a contribution, from 2025 onwards, to the higher amount of international climate financing in the future; 49. Recognises that climate change is not a localised challenge and that climate impacts outside the EU have implications within the EU as well, as events such as hurricanes, droughts, floods and forest fires may have an impact on the EU\u2019s food and water security and the supply chains of goods and services; calls on the Commission and the Member States to prioritise scaling up international climate finance for adaptation so as to bring it to the same level as climate finance for mitigation, and to provide climate finance for loss and damage; 50. Stresses the importance of operationalising the global goal on adaptation and of mobilising major new funds for adaptation in developing countries; calls for the EU and its Member States to commit to a significant increase in the adaptation finance they provide; recognises the need for progress on the issue of loss and damage, for which additional resources should be raised through innovative sources of public finance under the Warsaw International Mechanism; 51.

Takes note of the announcement by Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen that the ETS will be extended to sectors not yet covered by the EU trading system; rejects a direct inclusion in the EU ETS scheme; 70. Highlights that the transport sector is the only sector in which emissions have risen since 1990; stresses that this is not compatible with a long-term climate neutrality objective, which requires bigger and faster reductions in emissions from all sectors of society, including the aviation and maritime sectors; recalls that the transport sector will need to be fully decarbonised by 2050 at the latest; notes that the Commission\u2019s analysis shows that the current global targets and measures envisaged by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), even if implemented in full, would fall short of the necessary emissions reductions, and that significant further action consistent with the economy-wide objective of net-zero GHG emissions is needed; considers that in order to ensure the consistency of NDCs with the economy-wide commitments required by the Paris Agreement, the Parties should be encouraged to include emissions from international shipping and aviation and to agree on and implement measures at international, regional and national level to reduce emissions from these sectors; 71. Recalls that by 2020, global international aviation emissions are projected to be around 70 % higher than in 2005 and could even grow by a further 300-700 % by 2050; expresses concern about the level of ambition of ICAO\u2019s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), given the ongoing work on the standards and recommended practices to be followed when implementing the scheme from 2019 onward; stresses that the current standards are unsatisfactory and that further dilution of the CORSIA scheme is unacceptable; calls on the Commission and the Member States to do their utmost to strengthen CORSIA\u2019s provisions and support the adoption of a long-term goal to significantly reduce the in-sector emissions of the aviation sector while safeguarding the EU\u2019s legislative autonomy in implementing the ETS directive; stresses, moreover, the necessity of addressing non-carbon GHG emissions from aviation in EU and international schemes; 72. Expresses its deep concern at the adoption of resolution A40-19 at the 40th ICAO Assembly and of the so-called exclusivity clause of CORSIA; urges Member States to file a formal reservation concerning this part of the resolution so as to preserve the Union\u2019s legislative autonomy with regard to measures intended to reduce GHG emissions from the aviation sector; 73. Recalls the legal obligation for the Commission to present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council, within 12 months of the adoption of the relevant instruments by ICAO and before CORSIA becomes operational, in which it shall examine, inter alia, the ambition and overall environmental integrity of CORSIA, including its general ambition in relation to the goals of the Paris Agreement; underlines that, as co-legislators, the European Parliament and the Council are the only institutions that can decide on any future amendment to the ETS Directive; stresses that any amendment of the ETS Directive should only be undertaken if it is consistent with the EU\u2019s economy-wide GHG emission reduction commitment, which does not envisage the use of offset credits after 2020; 74. Welcomes the growing support for an EU-wide coordinated approach for aviation pricing, and calls on the Commission to present as soon as possible an ambitious review of the Energy Taxation Directive in this regard, including an end to the tax exemptions currently applied to kerosene and maritime fuels; 75. Recalls that CO 2 emissions from shipping are projected to increase by 50 % to 250 % in the period to 2050; welcomes the agreement on the initial IMO strategy to reduce GHG emissions from ships as the sector\u2019s first step in contributing to meeting the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goal; urges the IMO to make swift progress on the adoption of short- and medium-term measures to help achieve the objectives of the strategy; stresses the importance and urgency of implementing short- and medium-term measures before 2023; calls for the EU, the Commission and the Member States to do their utmost in supporting the rapid designation of the Mediterranean Sea as a combined SOx and NOx emission control area as a crucial step forward to reducing shipping emissions in Europe; underlines that further measures and actions, including carbon pricing instruments, need to be explored immediately in order to address maritime emissions in line with the sector\u2019s low emission transformation strategy; consequently expresses its belief that the EU and the Member States should closely monitor the impact and implementation of the initial IMO strategy; welcomes the proposal for an EU regulation in order to take appropriate account of the global data collection system for ship fuel oil consumption data 16.6.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 232/41 Thursday 28 November 2019 ",
        "(MRV) and the IMO global data collection system for fuel oil consumption of ships; recalls that the MRV is a first step that should ultimately enable the EU to adopt mandatory targets to reduce emissions; urges the Commission to propose, as soon as possible, additional EU actions as part of its 2050 decarbonisation strategy, such as the inclusion of the maritime sector in the ETS and the introduction of a ship efficiency standard and a ship label, and to propose a strategy for cooperating with other Parties willing to act as early as possible in order to reduce maritime emissions in line with the temperature target of the Paris Agreement; 76. Highlights the fact that simple solutions to reduce emissions already exist, such as lowering speed limits or establishing emission control areas, which are provided for under the international MARPOL Convention; considers that the decarbonisation strategy and the European Green Deal should drive investment, ambitious research into zero-emission ships and green ships with eco-components, better waste and water management and the infrastructure improvements needed to enable a market ramp-up prior to 2030, such as the electrification of ports; 77. Urges an increase into funding of research and market deployment of alternative fuels; 78. Recalls that 23 % of global GHG emissions originate from agriculture; stresses that in order to ensure sufficient nutrition for a growing world population, investments in smart agricultural techniques and production methods are needed, such as capturing methane from manure, using fertilisers more efficiently, using biomass in cycles and improving the efficiency of meat and dairy production methods; 79. Recalls that while agriculture is responsible for around 10 % of the EU\u2019s GHG emissions, it has the potential to help the EU reduce its emissions through good soil management, agroforestry, the protection of biodiversity and other land management techniques; recognises that agriculture has the potential to make annual emission savings of about 3,9 gigatonnes of CO 2 equivalents by 2050 \u2014 around 8 % of the current global GHG emissions; 80. Notes that approximately 60 % of the world\u2019s methane is emitted by sources such as agriculture, landfill sites, waste water facilities, and the production and pipeline transport of fossil fuels; recalls that methane is a potent GHG with a 100-year global warming potential and is 28 times more powerful than CO 2 ; reminds the Commission of its legal obligation to explore, as soon as possible, policy options for rapidly reducing methane emissions as part of an EU strategic plan for methane; calls on the Commission to present the appropriate legislative proposals to Parliament and the Council to that effect within the first half of its mandate; 81. Acknowledges the positive and significant role the agricultural sector can play in fighting climate change and underlines the importance of reforming the CAP to help farmers to develop and implement climate-smart agricultural practices, such as carbon sequestration and the recycling of carbon emissions; 82.
