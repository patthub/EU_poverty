Following an EU Council Joint Action of 20 July 2001, it is now an integral part of the new structures that will support the further development of the CFSP/ESDP. The Institute\u2019s core mission is to provide analyses and recommendations that can be of use and relevance to the formulation of the European security and defence policy. In carrying out that mission, it also acts as an interface between European experts and decision-makers at all levels. Chaillot Papers are monographs on topical questions written either by a member of the ISS research team or by outside authors chosen and commissioned by the Institute. Early drafts are normally discussed at a semi- nar or study group of experts convened by the Institute and publication indicates that the paper is considered by the ISS as a useful and authoritative contribution to the debate on CFSP/ESDP.

Quelles sont les contributions concr\u00e8tes de chacun \u00e0 la pacification de la plan\u00e8te ? Sur quelles bases fonder un partenariat politique adapt\u00e9 aux exigences d\u2019une s\u00e9curit\u00e9 largement mondialis\u00e9e ? Vieille question transatlantique s\u2019il en est, la notion de partage du fardeau, entre Am\u00e9ricains et Europ\u00e9ens, m\u00e9ritait en effet d\u2019\u00eatre reconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des bouleversements politico-strat\u00e9giques intervenus depuis plus d\u2019une d\u00e9cennie. Question \u00e9minemment difficile toutefois, ne serait-ce que sur le plan de la m\u00e9thode, du choix ou de la lec- ture compar\u00e9e des donn\u00e9es disponibles de part et d\u2019autre de l\u2019Atlantique. C\u2019est pourtant ce d\u00e9fi que Gustav Lindstrom, charg\u00e9 de recherche \u00e0 l\u2019Institut, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de relever. Ce Cahier de Chaillot est le fruit d\u2019un tr\u00e8s long et patient travail de collecte d\u2019informations, d\u2019\u00e9tablissement de crit\u00e8res comparatifs, de recherche pluridisciplinaire, avec comme objectif premier de pouvoir fonder sur les donn\u00e9es les plus pr\u00e9cises possibles les \u00e9l\u00e9- ments traditionnels du d\u00e9bat politique entre Am\u00e9ricains et Europ\u00e9ens. Non que les chiffres permettent d\u2019\u00e9liminer toute conviction, toute approche politique, voire toute id\u00e9ologie dans le dialogue transatlantique. Mais au moins permettent-ils de cadrer le d\u00e9bat \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de faits con- crets et de comparaisons relativement homog\u00e8nes. De cette \u00e9tude extr\u00eame- ment pr\u00e9cise et la plus compl\u00e8te possible, je retiens pour ma part trois conclusions : (cid:90) La complexit\u00e9 de la question est l\u2019une des caract\u00e9ristiques majeures de la modernit\u00e9 internationale. Le crit\u00e8re des d\u00e9penses militaires est en effet nettement moins pertinent qu\u2019il ne l\u2019\u00e9tait durant la guerre froide, lorsque l\u2019affrontement des deux superpuissances r\u00e9sumait le syst\u00e8me international. M\u00eame s\u2019il occupe encore tr\u00e8s souvent le devant de la sc\u00e8ne, le d\u00e9bat sur les d\u00e9penses de d\u00e9fense est un d\u00e9bat dat\u00e9, insuffisam- ment r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur de la contribution r\u00e9elle des acteurs \u00e0 la stabilisation internationale. Leur capacit\u00e9 d\u2019influence se mesure en effet de plus en plus en termes de contributions globales aux politiques de pr\u00e9ven- tion/stabilisation/reconstruction, lesquelles ne sont que marginale- Pr\u00e9face CP82-text.qxp 03/10/2005 16:26 Page 5 ",

A ce titre, c\u2019est moins l\u2019OTAN que la relation bilat\u00e9rale Union/USA qui sert de vecteur principal \u00e0 la compl\u00e9mentarit\u00e9 transatlantique. L\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne pr\u00e9sente ainsi un bilan d\u2019influence nettement plus proche de l\u2019\u00e9quilibre que celui de la puissance am\u00e9ricaine : les Etats-Unis d\u00e9pensent en effet plus de 450 milliards de dollars pour leur d\u00e9fense et 19 milliards pour l\u2019aide au d\u00e9veloppement. L\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne consacre de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 186 mil- liards de dollars aux d\u00e9penses militaires et 43 milliards pour l\u2019aide au d\u00e9veloppement. En d\u00e9pit de leurs diff\u00e9rences, les deux acteurs restent toutefois dans un paradigme de puissance \u00e0 dominante militaire : tr\u00e8s nettement pour les Etats-Unis qui n\u2019affectent \u00e0 l\u2019aide au d\u00e9veloppe- ment que 4% de ce qu\u2019ils d\u00e9pensent pour leur d\u00e9fense ; de fa\u00e7on moins abrupte pour l\u2019Union dont les d\u00e9penses d\u2019aide au d\u00e9veloppement repr\u00e9sentent 23% des sommes affect\u00e9es \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense. (cid:90) La contribution collective des 25 Etats membres de l\u2019Union \u00e0 la paix et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 internationale est colossale. Pris isol\u00e9ment, aucun pays europ\u00e9en n\u2019est certes capable d\u2019atteindre les chiffres am\u00e9ricains, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de d\u00e9penses militaires, d\u2019aide au d\u00e9veloppement ou d\u2019aide humanitaire. Mais, collectivement, l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne est le premier contributeur au budget de maintien de la paix des Nations unies (40% du budget contre 25% pour les USA), premier donneur d\u2019aide inter- nationale pour le d\u00e9veloppement, en volume (55% du total de l\u2019aide) comme en pourcentage du PNB (0,36% contre 0,16% pour les USA) ; sa contribution au Fonds mondial de lutte contre le sida, la tuberculose et la malaria est le double de la contribution am\u00e9ricaine ; elle fournit 10 fois plus de personnel aux op\u00e9rations des Nations unies que les USA, et contribue pour pr\u00e8s de 90% des forces de stabilisation d\u00e9ploy\u00e9es dans l\u2019ensemble des Balkans. Si le partage du fardeau fonde le partage des responsabilit\u00e9s politiques, l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne est donc sans conteste un acteur international majeur. Or elle ne le sait pas. L\u2019absence de source europ\u00e9enne unique, con- densant selon des crit\u00e8res identiques et donc comparables, l\u2019ensemble des contributions, militaires, financi\u00e8res, civiles, humaines des Etats CP82-text.qxp 03/10/2005 16:26 Page 6 ",

        "Introduction This Chaillot Paper examines burdensharing patterns between the United States and Europe, focusing in particular on the time period since the 9/11 attacks. It does so by analysing military and civilian burdensharing activities undertaken to address the high- priority challenges identified in the 2002 US National Security Strategy (NSS) and the 2003 European Security Strategy (ESS). The four principal questions addressed in the paper are as follows: 1. What are the principal security challenges facing the United States and Europe? 2. Given these security challenges, what are the main military and civilian tools available to address them? 3. What are the patterns of transatlantic military and civilian bur- densharing? 4. What lessons can we draw from these trends in burdensharing? Prior to tackling these questions, this Chaillot Paper briefly reviews the evolution of the burdensharing concept since the beginning of the Cold War. Unlike previous studies that tend to focus on either the military or civilian aspect of burdensharing, it looks at both dimensions. Wherever possible, quantitative data is used to gauge patterns of burdensharing. The report is divided into four chapters. Chapter 1 describes how burdensharing has evolved since the Cold War. It then describes the global high-priority security challenges identified in the NSS and in the ESS. With these in mind, the chapter considers the tools and instruments available on both sides of the Atlantic to address today\u2019s global challenges. The chapter ends with a descrip- tion of exogenous factors that can impact on burdensharing levels between the United States and Europe. 9 EU-US burdensharing: who does what?

        "Chapter 2 analyses burdensharing in the defence field. The chapter evaluates frequently used indicators such as US and EU defence spending, US and EU participation in international mili- tary missions, and US and EU participation in UN peacekeeping missions. When analysing provisions made by the EU, considera- tion is given to both individual EU member state and collective EU contributions. Contributions are organised according to the secu- rity goals outlined in the security strategies of the United States and the European Union. Chapter 3 examines burdensharing in the civilian field. It con- siders financial burdensharing indicators, such as official devel- opment assistance and humanitarian aid. As in the previous chap- ter, contributions are organised according to their relevance to the security threats identified by the NSS and ESS. The chapter also takes into account efforts made to address global challenges in the area of health. Finally, the conclusion summarises the paper\u2019s principal find- ings. The chapter includes a discussion of future implications for burdensharing. The paper includes four annexes which provide additional data and information in support of many tables and figures presented in summary form in the main text. An overview of the organisation of the annex is visible in the report\u2019s table of contents. This Chaillot Paper should be of interest to a wide audience, espe- cially those interested in the evolution of US-European relations in the security field. In particular, it should appeal to analysts and academics on both side of the Atlantic monitoring burdensharing patterns and the collaborative measures taken to address present- day security challenges. Needless to say, any error or omission is the author\u2019s responsi- bility alone. Corrections or suggestions for improvement are wel- come as this publication represents an initial effort by the EU Institute for Security Studies to compare the US and EU contribu- tions which aim to address today\u2019s security challenges. 1 Comprehensive assessment of US-EU burdensharing is subject to certain limitations. This study is no exception. It is important to bear the following five limitations in mind when reading this Chaillot Paper . (cid:90) Definitional issues: Since the concept of burdensharing evolves over time and has no set definition, it is difficult to fully capture burdensharing trends. For example, some analysts may 10 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 1. Comments can be sent to g.lindstrom@iss-eu.org or to the Institute address under the au- thor\u2019s name.

        "view certain military contributions, such as foreign military sales, as more consistent with national priorities than burden- sharing objectives. Others might disagree with the inclusion of investments for improved global health outcomes as a burden- sharing category. With burdensharing encapsulating both mil- itary and civilian contributions, it is difficult to compare the rel- ative value of both forms of contributions. In this Chaillot Paper , there is no attempt to compare the relative value of military ver- sus non-military contributions, as it would entail comparing \u2018apples with oranges\u2019. Rather, both are considered to be critical ingredients in addressing present-day global challenges. (cid:90) Measurement issues: Capturing the scope of burdensharing is complex, even when individual elements are quantifiable. For example, frequent troop rotations on the ground make it diffi- cult to gauge the total number of personnel engaged in an operation. Different results may be obtained depending on when data is collected. Frequently, such numbers will not include other elements associated with an operation, be they air support elements, maritime elements, or support troops. In addition, while the number of different national troops assigned to a particular peacekeeping mission can be com- pared, it is very difficult to assess the quality or capacity of the compared troops in order to accurately gauge burdensharing contributions. In other words, some aspects may not be appro- priately captured when comparing commitments to burden- sharing. (cid:90) Quantification issues: Related to the previous point, many burdensharing elements are not readily quantifiable \u2013 espe- cially if their value is not available in terms of dollars, euros, or manpower. An illustration of hard-to-quantify contributions towards international security is participation in international agreements. Other examples include the value of contributions such as overflight rights and basing rights. While it is possible to calculate the monetary value of such rights, especially if taken in conjunction with the level of local host nation sup- port, the military value of such rights is difficult to gauge. 2 (cid:90) Data issues: Quantitative data comparison across the Atlantic is also complicated by the use of different categorisations. For example, the US international affairs budget includes compo- nents that have no equivalent in the EU external affairs budget. The existence of multiple data sources, such as those deriving 11 Introduction 2. With respect to basing rights, it is also difficult to gauge the posi- tive economic spillover effects on the local economy produced by the establishment of bases in the host country.

        "from the UN, OECD, NATO and the EU, also affects the \u2018com- parability\u2019 of data. Different time horizons used to present data also affect comparability: while the United States uses the fiscal year (running from October to September), Europeans tend to use the calendar year (January through December). Finally, most financial data available is typically not adjusted for inflation or currency fluctuations, requiring conversions before meaningful comparisons can be made. To maximise comparability, this report relies on a single source as much as possible to capture all available data for a particular category of comparison (e.g. defence expenditures). (cid:90) Burdensharing issues: Finally, gauging burdensharing across the Atlantic is complicated as it may take several forms. As this Chaillot Paper will argue, modern burdensharing can take on various guises. For example, \u2018temporal burdensharing\u2019 may take place when one partner contributes initially and then gives way to other partners. US and European involvement in the Balkans follows this pattern. \u2018Task-specific\u2019 burdensharing may occur when partners tackle different missions within a shared area of operations. The coexistence of Operation Endur- ing Freedom and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan exemplifies this type of burdensharing. Needless to say, the existence of these different forms of bur- densharing introduces a certain degree of subjectivity when it comes to defining what constitutes burdensharing. With these limitations in mind, this Chaillot Paper analyses bur- densharing trends between the United States and EU member states in their efforts to address the high-priority security chal- lenges identified in their respective security strategies. While the 2002 US National Security Strategy and 2003 European Security Strategy are relatively new and budgets have yet to be realigned to fully reflect the priorities identified in them, they serve as a basis for current and future planning. At present, many ongoing pro- grammes and initiatives are being realigned to fit under the threat categories identified in the respective strategy documents of the US and the EU, such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, state failure, and regional conflicts. 12 EU-US burdensharing: who does what?

        "The evolution of burdensharing This chapter provides a brief overview of the evolution of the bur- densharing concept and present-day global challenges. It begins with a discussion of burdensharing during the Cold War and pro- ceeds to show how burdensharing mechanisms grew beyond the confines of NATO after the Cold War ended. The traditional model based on a regional focus (Europe) that relied on military might has given way to an increasingly global concept that requires both military and civilian power to manage the shared threats. Using the US National Security Strategy (NSS) and the European Security Strategy (ESS) as a guiding framework, the chapter then outlines these shared threats and the types of tools available to address them. Burdensharing during the Cold War The concept of defence burdensharing can be traced back to the inception of NATO in 1949. 3 However, the seeds for future burdensharing were probably planted in September 1950, not long after the initiation of the Korean War, when President Tru- man committed four US army divisions to Europe as an insurance policy against a potential Soviet invasion. The move caused con- servatives in Congress to question the deployment\u2019s strategic and fiscal implications. After a series of debates, however, the Senate passed a resolution supporting Truman\u2019s deployment decision, but insisted that Europeans also take steps to enhance their own security. Specifically, Senate Resolution 99 (1951) called for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to certify that Europeans were taking appro- priate steps to increase security levels. 4 The prospect of a Euro- pean Defence Community (EDC) temporarily assuaged American concerns, but the defeat of the proposed EDC in 1954 reinvigo- rated concerns. 5 Ultimately, NATO would become the focal point for Cold War burdensharing. 13 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 3. \u2018Alliance Burdensharing: A Re- view of the Data\u2019, Staff Working Pa- per , Congressional Budget Office, June 1987.

EDC was a treaty signed in May 1952 by France, Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries which provided a supranational frame- work for common European de- fence. The concept encountered a great deal of resistance in Europe, and France did not ratify the treaty. The concept collapsed in 1954. 1 CP82-text.qxp 03/10/2005 16:26 Page 13 ",
        "1 During the Cold War, the concept of burdensharing was straightforward. For European allies, the priority was to con- tribute to the strength of NATO to ensure an adequate defence against the Warsaw Pact. 6 In the United States, the greater the European contribution to NATO, the more US resources could be channelled elsewhere to contain communism. The strong associa- tion between burdensharing, NATO and the Warsaw Pact meant that the concept was overwhelmingly measured in military terms. Measures included number of men under arms, the share of GDP slated to the armed forces, the number of military platforms avail- able, etc. Indirectly, these served as indicators of potential instru- ments available for collective security provided by NATO. 7 As far as Europe was concerned, burdensharing took place within the confines of the European continent. American contri- butions to other parts of the world, such as Korea and Japan, were viewed as \u2018additional\u2019 commitments assumed by the United States that were consistent with its global interests and reach. On the US side, Congress periodically raised concerns over European contri- butions towards collective security. The uneasiness was particu- larly acute when the United States faced financial or manpower limitations. In the late 1950s and 1960s, the United States faced considerable balance of payments pressures. Engagement in the Vietnam War drained resources and reinforced the need for greater contributions by Europe. In the late 1970s, the United States proposed a sustained increase in defence spending by Euro- pean allies of three per cent per year from 1980 through 1985. 8 The European allies agreed to the programme but achieving this goal proved difficult, ultimately reinforcing the contentious nature of transatlantic burdensharing. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the Cold War ended \u2013 but debates over burdensharing did not. Burdensharing after the Cold War The end of the Cold War forced a redefinition of NATO, the pri- mary framework for US\u2013European burdensharing. With the disso- lution of the Warsaw Pact, NATO\u2019s primary role of countering a potential military attack in Europe had disappeared. But accord- ing to NATO\u2019s new Strategic Concept (1991), the world remained a dangerous place where NATO played an important role: 14 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 6. Note that the term \u2018burden- sharing\u2019 has also been used to de- scribe European economic redis- tribution among member states (M. Chambers, \u2018Paying for EU en- largement \u2013 can a new \u201cburden- sharing bargain\u201d be sustained?\u2019, Paper for the Political Studies As- sociation-UK 50th Annual Con- ference, 10-13 April 2000, Lon- don). Throughout this document, however, it is used only to refer to military and civilian contributions for regional and/or global secu- rity. 7. The yearly \u2018Report on Allied Contributions to the Common Defense\u2019 captures the focus on military contributions amongst NATO member states.

        "1 In contrast with the predominant threat of the past, the risks to Allied security that remain are multi-faceted in nature and multi- directional, which makes them hard to predict and assess. NATO must be capable of responding to such risks if stability in Europe and the security of Alliance members are to be preserved. 9 These new types of threats did not take long to manifest them- selves. Regional tensions in the Balkans erupted in several wars of secession starting in June 1991. The inability of European policy- makers to end the violence in what was considered to be their own backyard eventually led to the involvement of the United States and NATO. In 1995, NATO forces struck Bosnian Serbs in Bosnia- Herzegovina (BiH) with the initiation of Operation Deliberate Force . Burdensharing took another turn in 1999 with the initia- tion of Operation Allied Force targeting the Yugoslav Army in Kosovo. Capability constraints, particularly with respect to air power and precision munitions, forced the Europeans to acknowl- edge their limited defence capabilities in key areas. The Yugoslav wars of secession had a profound impact in Europe. They reinforced the perception that Europe was not able to effectively handle security challenges arising from conflict in its immediate neighbourhood. It also signalled in a very dramatic way that the EU needed to improve its own military capabilities and needed to be able to deploy forces outside its borders. Unlike past assessments of burdensharing, scrutiny was placed not only on defence expenditures, but also on the defence capabilities needed to meet new, emerging security threats. The military inter- vention and subsequent peacekeeping efforts revealed that mili- tary, quasi-military, and civilian tools were all required to enhance regional stability and rebuild war-torn regions. European policy-makers responded to these new challenges with the launch of the Helsinki Headline Goal in 1999, calling for the establishment of a European force of 60,000 men capable of deploying within sixty days for up to twelve months. Unlike NATO, this emerging EU capability \u2013 European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) \u2013 was not to focus on collective defence. Rather, ESDP missions were to focus on the \u2018Petersberg Tasks\u2019, which emphasize humanitarian, peacekeeping, and crisis man- agement missions. Clearly the end of the Cold War redefined burdensharing. It brought about not only a redefinition of NATO\u2019s role, but also an 15 The evolution of burdensharing 9.

        "1 expansion of NATO, the emergence of ESDP, and force modern- isation in the United States, all with implications for burdenshar- ing. NATO enlargement provoked questions of cost and who would pay for it. 10 ESDP led to debates about competition with NATO, discussions about how the burden of ensuring European security could and should be shared, and a new allocation of mili- tary resources. US force modernisation triggered concerns about a growing capabilities gap between the US and Europe, and con- cerns about countries\u2019 abilities to participate in burdensharing. The concept of burdensharing would undergo yet another transformation in 2001, when new threats manifested themselves and the vestiges of the Cold War were erased. The attacks of Sep- tember 11 th 2001 placed terrorism at the forefront of these new types of threats. That a non-state actor could kill about 3,000 indi- viduals while targeting the economic and military power centres of the United States reinforced the notion that a new set of actors and threats needed to be addressed rapidly. Sharing the burden would require new types of cooperation, defined in both military and civilian terms. Before examining these mechanisms, the next section provides a brief description of the shared threats. Security challenges in a globalised world To identify potential areas for burdensharing, it is vital to first iden- tify the common security challenges facing the United States and Europe. If there are a substantial number of shared challenges, the likelihood and feasibility of burdensharing increases \u2013 especially if resources are limited or role specialisation is available as an alter- native. By contrast, if there are few shared threats, the likelihood for burdensharing activities diminishes. Many threats facing the United States and Europe today are shared. They are also different from those faced during the Cold War in key ways. First, threats were traditionally external in nature and military in character, creating a fairly clear boundary between internal and external security. Today, the lines between internal and external security have been blurred. As the US National Secu- rity Strategy notes, \u2018today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America\u2019s borders have a greater impact inside them.\u2019 11 The Euro- pean Security Strategy offers a similar view, maintaining that \u2018in 16 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 10.

        "1 an era of globalisation, distant threats may be as much a concern as those that are near at hand. 12 Examples range from the risks posed by pandemics to international terrorist cells. Second, some non-state actors have obtained the capacity to challenge the security of nation-states in ways that were unimag- inable only fifteen years ago. In addition to access to new tech- nologies and communication tools to facilitate the planning and execution of attacks, these groups are no longer deterred by the prospect of engaging in catastrophic terrorism. In the words of the NSS, \u2018enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of indi- viduals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank.\u2019 13 The European Security Strategy refers to these threats as \u2018new threats which are more diverse, less visible, and less predictable.\u2019 14 Third, the globalisation of economies and movement of people has greatly enhanced the implications of international disrup- tions. An attack on a critical infrastructure, for example, is likely to have both local and international ramifications. Globalisation has increased \u2018dependency \u2013 and so vulnerability on an intercon- nected infrastructure in transport, energy, information and other fields.\u2019 15 Moreover, with more individuals travelling across the world, the impact of an attack or natural catastrophe is likely to be felt indirectly in a greater number of countries. The tsunami in South East Asia in December 2004 painfully illustrated the direct and indirect consequences of large-scale events. Previously, the implications of an event were more likely to be contained within a specific sector or geographic area. 17 The evolution of burdensharing 12. \u2018A secure Europe in a better world\u2019, European Security Strategy , December 2003, p. 11. 13.

        "1 Given these developments, what are the shared threats? One method for ascertaining and comparing the high-priority chal- lenges across the Atlantic is to compare the 2002 NSS and the 2003 ESS. Both documents outline key threats and challenges that need to be addressed in order to promote global stability and security. While countries each view the strategic security environ- ment somewhat differently, since September 11 th , a relatively common view of the principal threats has emerged in the US and in Europe. The NSS and the ESS identify the threats posed by terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and regional conflicts as high-priority threats. It should be noted that the December 2004 UN High-Level Panel Report on Threats, Chal- lenges, and Change shares a similar outlook, reinforcing the notion that these security challenges are shared on a global scale. 16 Both strategies also place particular emphasis on the danger posed by the intersection of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. According to the NSS, \u2018the gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology\u2019. The ESS reflects a similar view, arguing that the \u2018the most frightening sce- nario is one in which terrorist groups acquire weapons of mass 18 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 16. According to the report, the principal security challenges are: poverty, infectious disease and en- vironmental degradation; conflict between and within states; nu- clear, radiological, chemical and biological weapons; terrorism; and transnational organised crime. \u2018A More Secure World\u2019, re- port of the Secretary General\u2019s High-level Panel on Threats, Chal- lenges and Change, 2 December 2004. \u2018In Larger Freedom: Towards Development, Security, and Human Rights for All\u2019, Report of the Secretary-General, 21 March 2005.

Despite large-scale US contributions to several parts of the world to combat elements of organised crime (e.g. Colombia), it is not listed as a principal threat for the United States. The strategies also identify global challenges such as poverty, disease, and lack of resources. They are linked to the key threats as they in many instances provoke or exacerbate security issues such as regional conflict and state failure. As root causes for potential security challenges, they require continual attention and resources. It is important to recognise that while perceptions of security threats may be shared, this does not necessarily translate to common solutions to address those challenges. Addressing the high-priority transatlantic challenges Addressing the key threats identified in the security strategies will often require the combination of military and civilian power. Examining both military and civilian power in the context of bur- densharing is a departure from traditional analysis, which focused exclusively on the military dimension. Table 3 outlines several mil- itary and civilian options available to address the high-priority challenges identified by the NSS and the ESS. The table\u2019s right- hand column provides examples of programmes or actions that may be used to respond to a specific threat. In addressing these security challenges, the EU and the United States rely, to a great extent, on their respective comparative advantages. Given its military might, the United States is more likely to explore military means to leverage its power to resolve global security challenges. The EU, on the other hand, gravitates towards its panoply of civilian tools and instruments to do the same. It is important to note that both approaches may play an important role in a specific situation and thus represent the build- ing blocks for burdensharing. 19 The evolution of burdensharing CP82-text.qxp 03/10/2005 16:26 Page 19 ",
        "1 Factors impacting on burdensharing Although the NSS and ESS identify similar threats, multiple fac- tors affect the prospects for transatlantic collaboration. Key among them are divergences in political outlook and constraints with respect to capabilities. The following section provides a brief overview of these and other factors that may impact on burden- sharing. The list is not all-inclusive, but rather aims to illustrate key considerations. View of the security environment A shared outlook of the security environment is an essential ingre- dient for collaboration and burdensharing. With the end of the Cold War, the number and character of threats has multiplied. They may originate from state or non-state actors. They can have 20 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? Key Threat Military options Civilian options Examples of US and/or EU military and civilian tools Terrorism - Military operations - Monitoring - Intelligence gathering - Police and judicial cooperation - Crisis management operations - Operation Active Endeavour - US/EU Mutual legal assistance - Container Security Initiative WMD proliferation - Interdiction of WMD shipments - Monitoring - Consequence management - Securing WMD - Information sharing - Monitoring - Negotiation - Cooperative threat reduction activities - Proliferation and Security Initiative Regional conflicts - Military operations - Military support ops. - Official Development Assistance (ODA) - Peacekeeping operations (e.g. KFOR, ALTHEA) State failure - Military operations - Military support ops. - ODA - Judicial assistance - Peacekeeping missions (e.g. ISAF) - Humanitarian assistance Organised crime - Interdiction - Monitoring - Police and judicial cooperation - Harmonised legal structures - Police missions (e.g. EUPM) - Counter narcotics programmes Table 3: Sample matrix of military and civilian contributions to achieve security objectives CP82-text.qxp 03/10/2005 16:26 Page 20 ",
        "1 an internal and/or external dimension. These different types and permutations of threats affect decision-makers\u2019 perception of the global security environment. Even slight changes in perceptions can have significant implications. While the NSS and the ESS are similar in many ways, there are both subtle and substantial differences in how the US and the EU each define and address security challenges. For example, the United States and the EU both underscore the need to deal with states facing internal challenges that impact their ability to func- tion properly at the international level. However, whereas the United States uses the term \u2018rogue states\u2019 to describe these players, the EU refers to them as \u2018failing states\u2019. 17 While the discrepancy may seem purely semantic, it is significant to the extent that it impacts on the means chosen to address a situation. The idea of a failed state implies that the state has lost much of its ability to ensure governance and adequate security. Assisting a country labelled in this way may result in direct assistance \u2013 either in terms of economic or peacekeeping assistance \u2013 and other \u2018carrots\u2019 as a means of stabilization. A rogue state, on the other hand, implies that the country still maintains much control over the state appa- ratus but has chosen a path that will put it on a collision course with international norms and practices. Isolation and the use of sticks rather than carrotsare likely to be a preferred choice of action. Another difference is also visible in how both sides frame ter- rorism. While the United States calls for a \u2018war on terrorism\u2019, Euro- peans refer to it as a \u2018fight\u2019 or \u2018struggle\u2019 against terrorism. The notion that it is engaged in a \u2018war\u2019 heightens a reliance on military power. 18 While European policy-makers are also preoccupied by terrorism, they consider themselves to be involved in a fight against terrorism. As a result, largely civilian tools are used to address terrorism, ranging from information sharing to judicial cooperation. While one could argue that both sides are simply relying on instruments which represent their comparative advan- tage \u2013 military power in the United States and civilian tools in Europe \u2013 different perceptions affect the choice of instruments and actions, and burdensharing as a result. New forms of collabo- ration and burdensharing may emerge. For example, \u2018task-spe- cific\u2019 burdensharing, where partners contribute according to political guidelines and capabilities, may become a preferred mode for interaction. 21 The evolution of burdensharing 17. Analysts within think tanks and academia sometimes use the reference \u2018irresponsible states\u2019 to find common ground. See Henry Kissinger, Lawrence Summers, and Charles Kupchan,\u2018Renewing the Atlantic Partnership: Report of an Independent Task Force\u2019, The Council on Foreign Relations, 2004.

US officials recently reconsid- ered the phraseology \u2018war on ter- ror\u2019, preferring to label it as a \u2018struggle against global extrem- ism\u2019 to tone down the military di- mension.

        "1 Geography also impacts on the view of the security environ- ment. For many years, European policies primarily focused on security issues in their vicinity. While this is largely still the case, Europeans recognise that events far from Europe\u2019s vicinity can have an impact on its security. This change in perspective, leading to a more global European outlook, increases the prospects of bur- densharing with the United States, which traditionally has had a global foreign policy outlook. Political support Political support on both sides of the Atlantic is one of the fun- damental elements for a strong transatlantic partnership. If there is limited political support for a particular military or civilian operation on either side, the prospects for burdensharing dwindle \u2013 even if all other necessary elements for cooperation are avail- able. 19 The 2003 war in Iraq illustrates this situation well. Both before and during the war, it was neither a lack of resources nor capabilities that fundamentally affected burdensharing; rather, political (dis)agreements on the merits of going to war determined levels of participation. At the EU level, political will plays a particularly important role concerning CFSP and ESDP related engagements. Moreover, the intergovernmental nature of the Union has implications for the pace at which the EU moves forward. The \u2018no\u2019 votes on the EU con- stitution, and to a lesser degree, the inability to agree on the next EU budget (2007-2013) at the June 2005 European Council meet- ing are likely to impact on the conduct of EU foreign policy. While it is too early to tell what the ramifications will be \u2013 some contend the EU will become more inward looking while others think it will focus even more on external affairs \u2013 it is clear that these events will impact on EU burdensharing choices. 20 Ability to contribute A partner\u2019s ability to contribute affects prospects for burdenshar- ing. Such constraints can take on a variety of forms, the most com- mon being financial or capability limitations. Manpower short- ages, legal limits on the number of deployable personnel, interoperability constraints, and military transport limitations all have implications for military burdensharing. During Operation 22 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 19. It should be noted that politi- cal support not only affects mili- tary collaboration, but also has strong implications for coopera- tion in the civilian domain. While these may not always fall into the classic definition of burdenshar- ing, they strengthen the notion that differences in political sup- port impact on prospects for in- ternational projects such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Interna- tional Criminal Court. 20. Likewise, it is important to recognise that events such as the recent terrorist attacks in London (and previously in Madrid) impact on the political outlook of deci- sion-makers.

        "1 Allied Force , European performance in the air war was severely con- strained by limitations in all-weather aircraft capabilities and a small number of precision-guided munitions. These constraints were also felt in other, lesser-known areas. For example, the United States ended up flying almost 90 per cent of all aerial refuelling and combat air patrol missions in support of the aerial missions. 21 Bur- densharing was thus constricted by disparities in capabilities. This factor continues to be a source of contention between the United States and Europe. For the United States, manpower constraints materialised with the initiation of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. The operation put additional pressure on US deployments elsewhere, including those in the Balkans, where the US was already scaling down its presence, and Asia (South Korea). Not only can manpower con- straints affect military options, but they may also impact on future courses of action. For example, substantial US commit- ments in Iraq may have narrowed the range of options available to address challenges in North Korea and Iran, while simultaneously increasing the importance of diplomatic burdensharing. Assuming that there is political agreement for a particular mis- sion, military capability constraints affect not only what each partner contributes, but also when they contribute. Analysts such as Robert Kagan capture the \u2018when\u2019 dimension of burdensharing when they contend that the United States does the cooking (or high intensity operations) while Europeans do the cleaning (fol- low-on peacekeeping operations). 22 Under such a scenario, limita- tions may nevertheless allow for \u2018temporal\u2019 or \u2018task-specific\u2019 bur- densharing. Constraints may also manifest themselves in civilian opera- tions. For example, this may occur during peacekeeping or nation- building operations that require specialised personnel such as military police, law enforcement personnel, civilian administra- tors, or rule of law experts. Military organisation and its interface with civilian tools Military organisation also affects the prospect for burdensharing. In particular, efforts at military organisation between countries may enhance prospects for burdensharing. Examples of such proj- ects include the EU\u2019s move towards battlegroups and NATO\u2019s evolving Response Force (NRF). Both of these force packages, 23 The evolution of burdensharing 21. John E.

        "1 currently under development, serve to boost burdensharing between participating states. The establishment of the battlegroups is an important build- ing block of the Headline Goal 2010 that will give the EU the abil- ity to address the range of tasks identified by the European Secu- rity Strategy and the Petersberg tasks listed in the Treaty of the European Union under article 17.2. 23 In addition to stimulating intra-EU burdensharing, this form of military organisation should give the EU an enhanced capability to contribute to bur- densharing operations with the United States. The NRF\u2019s missions are consistent with the global challenges identified in the NSS and the ESS. 24 Among the principal tasks assigned to the NRF are: non-combatant evacuation operations, support consequence management (e.g. in the case of a non-con- ventional attack), crisis response operations (including peace- keeping), support to counter-terrorism operations, and embargo operations. 25 Thus, the synergy achieved by these military force packages will both encourage burdensharing and enhance capa- bilities to address today\u2019s global security challenges. The potential for burdensharing is also affected by the ease with which military and civilian tools can be combined either simultaneously or consecutively to tackle today\u2019s security chal- lenges. As noted earlier, addressing today\u2019s threats will often require a mix of military and civilian instruments. The more seam- lessly the two types of tools can be put together, the greater the potential for some form of burdensharing. Both the United States and the EU are currently taking steps to enhance the complementarity of their civilian and military assets. The EU, for example, has established a Civilian Headline Goal for 2008 to complement the battlegroups and other objectives estab- lished under the Headline Goal 2010. In September 2004, several EU member states created the EUROGENDFOR (the European Gendarmerie Force). Consisting of approximately 800 gen- darmes, it will have an initial reaction capability of thirty days to address different aspects of crisis management. 26 The United States established the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruc- tion and Stabilisation with the State Department in August 2004. One of its principal roles is to boost the United States\u2019 institu- tional capacity to \u2018respond to crises involving failing, failed, and post-conflict states and complex emergencies\u2019.

Over time, the concept has evolved as the international security landscape changed. Turning points came with the end of the Cold War and the wars of secession in the Balkans in the early 1990s. Europe\u2019s inability to effectively address regional conflicts in its neighbour- hood eventually led to greater efforts to build European capabili- ties through a Common Foreign Security Policy (CFSP) and Euro- pean Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). These constructs and a greater global outlook provided Europe with greater possibilities to actively engage in foreign policy decisions. It also meant that burdensharing could occur through new mechanisms, not only through NATO. The 9/11 attacks reinforced the notion that the world faced a host of new threats \u2013 including those posed by non-state actors. It also underscored the view that the security environment had changed. This new category of threats increasingly blurred tradi- tional distinctions between different realms: civilian and military; domestic and international; state and non-state. In response, the US National Security Strategy and Europe Security Strategy iden- tified the main threats and potential means to address them. The identification of similar high-priority threats, such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional con- flicts, and state failure demonstrate that the potential for contin- ued and enhanced burdensharing is substantial. Ultimately, how- ever, differing priorities, capabilities, levels of political support, financial constraints and the like all shape the nature of burden- sharing: what is contributed, when, and how much. 25 The evolution of burdensharing 27.

        "Burdensharing in the defence field Military contributions play an important role in addressing the key threats identified in the NSS and the ESS. While military tools will often be used in combination with civilian assets to address secu- rity threats, the focus in this chapter is on traditional military indi- cators, such as defence spending, and personnel contributions to ongoing operations. 28 The chapter also reviews contributions towards peacekeeping operations and UN missions. It begins with an overview of financial burdensharing indicators and then looks at personnel contributions to the different missions consistent with the objectives highlighted in the security strategies of the United States and the EU. Financial burdensharing indicators Military burdensharing is frequently gauged by comparing finan- cial indicators. Statistics such as the proportion of GDP spent on defence across a range of different countries can shed light on which countries contribute the most towards defence and which lag behind. However, it is important not to take these figures out of context. There is no \u2018right number\u2019 for how much should be spent on defence. Decision-makers who set national priorities make choices that invariably change over time. Moreover, it is frequently more useful to analyse how defence funding is used as opposed to how much is spent . This provides information on priorities, capa- bilities, and future investments. Finally, we need not assume that there is a direct relationship between GDP and defence spending. An economy that grows over time does not necessarily imply that defence spending should or will automatically rise to represent an equivalent proportion of GDP. With this in mind, the following section reviews key financial indicators relating to defence. 27 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 28. With the focus on personnel contributions, there is limited space devoted to materiel contri- butions such as aircraft, ships, or other equipment. 2 CP82-text.qxp 03/10/2005 16:26 Page 27 ",
        "2 Defence spending Both during and after the Cold War, defence spending has been one of the principal yardsticks used to measure and compare transat- lantic burdensharing. A current comparison of aggregate defence spending on both sides of the Atlantic shows that the United States spends substantially more than EU member states. This is espe- cially true in the wake of the September 11 th attacks in 2001. Since 2001, the United States has increased its defence spend- ing, dramatically widening the gap with Europe (Table 32 in Annex 2). By contrast, defence spending within the EU has remained fairly stable over the same time frame, with some coun- tries injecting marginal increases and others cutting their defence spending. While the EU-15 defence budget was approximately $126.8 billion in 2001, the EU-25 figure in 2004 was $186.3 bil- lion. 29 Adjusting for inflation and currency fluctuations, the real increase in defence spending is practically zero. What increase there was can partially be attributed to the contribution made by the ten new EU member states in 2004 ($10.2 billion). As a result, the gap between the United States and Europe is quite large: $453.6 billion (FY04) compared to $186.3 billion (2004). 30 Defence spending as a percentage of GDP reinforces the lop- sided picture. As shown in Table 4, the US figure increased sub- stantially between 2001 and 2003, with defence spending rising from 3.0 per cent of GDP to 3.7 percent. By contrast, EU members spend a smaller proportion of GDP on defence, and the figures have remained fairly stable over time. In 2003, all but four EU- member states contributed less than 2.0 per cent of GDP towards defence. Greece, with the highest proportion spent on defence \u2013 4.1 per cent in 2003 \u2013 dedicates a large portion of its defence budget to territorial defence to mirror high spending in neigh- bouring Turkey. Overall, collective EU defence spending as a pro- portion of GDP dropped from 2.0 per cent in 1997 to 1.7 percent in 2003. Not surprisingly, the data indicates that US spending repre- sents around 70 per cent of total EU/US defence spending, a pro- portion that rose between 2000 and 2004. The EU proportion declined from a high of 31 per cent in 2000 to 28 per cent in 2003 (Table 33 in Annex 2). The finding is consistent with a United States that places greater emphasis on military options in com- parison to EU member states vis-\u00e0-vis foreign policy objectives. 28 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 29.

        "2 Individually, the greatest contributors within the EU are France, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Burdensharing can also be assessed from the perspective of \u2018fair share\u2019 that takes into account a country\u2019s ability to contribute . The \u2018fair share\u2019 is the ratio of a country\u2019s contribution expressed as a share of the total (in this case defence spending) to its ability to con- tribute (expressed as a share of GDP). 31 Table 5 provides an overview of the fair share with respect to defence spending from 2000 to 2004. Supporting data tables are presented in Tables 32 to 35 (Annex 2). A country is considered to be doing its fair share if its propor- tion of total defence spending is in balance with its share of total GDP. A ratio close to 1 indicates that a country\u2019s contribution is in balance with its ability to contribute. A ratio greater than 1 sug- gests that a country is contributing more than its fair share, while a ratio under 1 implies that a country is contributing less than its fair share. 29 Burdensharing in the defence field 31.

        "2 Again, while there is no \u2018right\u2019 level of defence spending, the growing gap between the United States and the EU has implica- tions for burdensharing \u2013 especially if all other necessary criteria for cooperation (such as political agreement) exist. These range from a negative impact on interoperability (a more technically advanced US military may complicate joint operations with Euro- pean forces) to discrepant abilities to transform the military serv- ices so as to effectively address key threats. Defence spending on Research & Development Acquiring the necessary capabilities to address current and future security challenges requires investment in Research and Develop- ment (R&D). Recent military operations reinforce the notion that troop numbers alone are not as critical as the capabilities of indi- vidual troops and units. In Afghanistan, network centric opera- tions based on smaller units on the ground coordinating with air and naval assets demonstrated the multiplier effect arising from integrated communications. Investment in military R&D can also produce positive spillover effects for the civilian sector through dual-use technologies. For example, technological advances to enhance force protection against weapons of mass destruction can lead to improved civilian detectors and decontamination equipment against chemical, bio- logical, radiological, and nuclear threats. 32 Such tools may be utilised in civilian operations in response to attacks or accidents. The US Department of Defense (DoD) divides Research, Devel- opment, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) into seven different accounts. They are: Basic Research, Applied Research, Advanced Technology Development, Demonstration and Validation, Engi- neering and Manufacturing Development, Management Sup- port, and Operational Systems Development. The first three cate- gories are frequently grouped together as Science and Technology (S&T). Large industrial firms usually perform the remaining R&D categories, which focus on the development and testing of specific weapons systems. Collectively, these programmes lay the founda- tion for R&D. Table 6 summarizes US research spending in Science and Tech- nology and total RDT&E during the fiscal years 2001-2004. Approximately $10 billion is spent on Science and Technology research each year. Overall, RDT&E has increased from $41.75 bil- 31 Burdensharing in the defence field 32. It should be acknowledged that civilian R&D likewise can pro- duce positive spillover effects vis- \u00e0-vis military equipment capabili- ties. CP82-text.qxp 03/10/2005 16:26 Page 31 ",
        "2 lion in FY01 to $64.37 billion in FY04. It represents about 14 per cent of overall defence spending over the last few years. 33 European spending on defence R&D is smaller. According to Nick Whitney, Director of the European Defence Agency, the United States outspends the EU 5 to 1 in the area of defence R&D. 34 At present, the United States spends about three times as much as the combined military R&D of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. 35 Since French, German, and British defence R&D on average represents 67 per cent of EU R&D investment between 2003 and 2005, the gap between the United States and the EU is particularly large. 36 Nonetheless, it is difficult to provide a clear indication of how much lower EU spending is as official R&D data is not available at the EU level. Although the European Defence Agency is currently in the process of collecting such data, R&D estimates exist only at the national level. Differing R&D definitions between EU member states, coupled with different methodologies for collecting such data, complicate the task of assessing EU-wide spending on military R&D. 37 Table 7 provides defence R&D figures for individual EU mem- ber states in 2004. The R&D figure for the United States is included to allow for comparisons using a single source. As seen, 32 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 33.

France, Ger- many, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom are the greatest contributors in terms of R&D expenditures as a percentage of the defence budget. 38 Together, these countries account for 95 per cent of total defence R&D spending within the EU.

        "2 While the EU does not need to replicate US levels of investment in defence R&D, divergences are likely to have an impact on bur- densharing in the medium- to long-term as new defence technolo- gies are introduced. 39 However, in the short term, traditional gaps, such as those in the area of strategic lift, will continue to define dif- ferences between US and European capabilities. Cost sharing within the NATO Alliance NATO\u2019s role has changed dramatically over the last fifteen years. With the end of the Cold War, the organisation found itself at a crossroads with respect to future operations and goals. Options ranged from obsolescence to reinvention. US Senator Richard Lugar captured the sentiment succinctly, arguing in 1993 that NATO could either \u2018go out of area or out of business.\u2019 40 Twelve years later, NATO is actively pursuing out-of-area missions. It is engaged in Afghanistan through ISAF, provides limited training support to Iraqi police forces at different locations, and provides logistical assistance to the African Union to ameliorate the situation in the Darfur region of Sudan. NATO has changed in other ways too. It has enlarged to 26 members \u2013 19 of which are EU members. 41 NATO\u2019s new activities and missions are consistent with the security objectives laid out in the NSS and the ESS. Thus burden- sharing within NATO is still relevant today, even though NATO no longer represents the sole vehicle through which burdenshar- ing takes place. One way to estimate burdensharing within the Atlantic Alliance is to analyse costs. There are two principal types of costs associated with NATO operations, common costs and individual operational costs. There are three categories of com- mon costs: civil budget, military budget, and the Security and Investment Programme. 42 These are borne by NATO members collectively according to contributions calculated through a cost sharing formula loosely attached to each NATO member\u2019s relative GDP. Individual operational costs refer to the costs incurred by countries participating in a specific mission. Those costs are usu- ally borne by the participants under the principle of \u2018costs lie where they fall\u2019. For example, France\u2019s participation in operations in the Balkans cost about \u20ac 230 million in 2003, with \u20ac 163 million going towards expenditures associated with KFOR and \u20ac 67 mil- lion for SFOR. 43 UK operating costs in the Balkans in 2003/04 34 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 39.

Overall, 23 of the 25 EU mem- ber states are either full NATO members or part of the Partner- ship for Peace (PFP). 42. The civil budget mainly covers operational costs at NATO head- quarters and the execution of ap- proved and civilian programmes. The military budget is dedicated to operating and maintenance costs, including operating costs of the NATO command structure for peacekeeping activities. The NATO Security and Investment Programme covers the infrastruc- ture costs needed to \u2018support the roles of the NATO Strategic Com- mands\u2019.

Given the difficulty in gauging individual operational costs, the focus here is on the common costs. Table 8 provides a snapshot of NATO common costs between 2000 and 2002.

        "2 The United States is the single largest contributor towards NATO common costs. The US contribution is consistently around one quarter of the common costs. In 2002, it provided approximately $341 million or 24.3 per cent of the total. The next largest contributor, Germany, provided $269 million or 19.1 per cent. However put together, the EU member states within NATO collectively accounted for $890.6 million of the total $1,404.9 bil- lion budget. This figure represents 63.5 per cent of all common costs. From a different perspective, the top five EU/NATO con- tributors accounted for over half the common costs (52.5 per cent). While the common costs are very small compared to the opera- tional expenditures associated with NATO operations, the value of each contribution should not be downplayed as it represents an important form of burdensharing. While contributions are driven by GDP, they provide a symbolic representation of burdensharing within the Alliance. Cost sharing within ESDP Since January 2003, the EU has carried out a number of military and civilian ESDP missions focusing on humanitarian, peacekeep- ing, and crisis management tasks. As of September 2005, eleven separate missions have been completed, are underway, or in the planning phase. While these missions have distinct objectives they all aim to enhance regional stability in their area of operations. As is the case with NATO operations, ESDP costs typically fall into two categories: common costs and individual operational costs that are covered by the participating nations according to the principle of \u2018costs lie where they fall.\u2019 47 The common costs refer to the incremental costs associated with the execution of the operation. These include the costs of maintaining a force head- quarters, lodging costs, hiring local staff, etc. 48 Individual opera- tional costs include expenditures associated with the deployment of troops and equipment to areas of operations. These costs tend to be greater than the common costs. Ascertaining cost sharing within a particular ESDP mission is complex for a number of reasons. First, cost-sharing patterns may vary from operation to operation. For example, in the case of 36 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 47. For more, see Antonio Mis- siroli, \u2018 \u20ac uros for ESDP: financing EU operations\u2019, Occasional Paper n\u00ba45, EU Institute for Security Studies, June 2003. 48. The participating states\u2019 con- tributions to cover the common costs are determined in accor- dance with the gross national product scale as specified in Arti- cle 28(3) of the Treaty on Euro- pean Union and consistent with Council Decision 2000/597/EC, Euratom of 29 September 2000 on the system of the European Communities\u2019 own resources. In February 2004, the EU set up ATHENA, a mechanism to admin- ister the financing of the common costs of EU operations with mili- tary or defence implications.

        "2 Operation Concordia , participating states were asked to cover both their individual operational costs as well as a percentage of total common costs ( \u20ac 6.2 million). As such, participating EU member states bore 84.5 per cent of the common costs, based on a GDP scale, while non-EU participants accounted for the remaining 15.5 per cent. 49 Second, individual operational costs borne by participating states are infrequently publicised. Since these costs tend to be much greater than the common costs of an operation, a lack of such figures makes it difficult to gauge total contributions made by each participating state. For example, in the case of Operation Artemis , France\u2019s individual contribution to the mission was \u20ac 46.58 million, a figure that greatly surpasses the \u20ac 7 million in common costs. 50 While one could estimate the individual costs for each participating state based on the number of personnel attached to an operation (be it military, police, or civilian), such figures would provide a rough approximation at best \u2013 especially if deployment costs are not included. Third, a scenario where a large number of states are participat- ing in an operation means that multiple contributions need to be tallied. For example, for the EU\u2019s first military operation under the auspices of ESDP, Concordia , twenty-six countries took part in the mission. Gauging total costs for the operation would thus require the compilation of cost data for all participating states. For France, the largest personnel contributor to the operation, indi- vidual costs added up to \u20ac 2.03 million. 51 With these limitations in mind, Table 9 provides an overview of the common costs for finalised and ongoing ESDP missions. The table shows that common costs for ESDP operations since January 2003 surpass one quarter billion euros. 52 Althea , the suc- cessor mission of SFOR, entails the highest common costs with a reference amount of \u20ac 71.7 million. 37 Burdensharing in the defence field 49.

        "2 Cost sharing within the UN The EU and the United States currently contribute about ten per- cent of all UN peacekeeping troops and they also cover a substan- tial portion of the costs associated with peacekeeping operations. Historically, US contributions hovered around 30 per cent of the UN total. In November 1994, Congress limited the amount the United States would contribute to 25 per cent of total costs, start- ing in FY1996. 53 In 2004, the UN\u2019s peacekeeping operations budget was $3.87 billion. 54 Collectively, the US and EU covered more than half the amount \u2013 with the United States covering 25 per cent while the EU provided about 40 per cent. 55 Table 10 below provides a breakdown of US and EU contributions to UN peace- keeping costs between 2000 and 2003. As can be seen, the United States is the single largest contribut- ing country to the UN peacekeeping budget. As a collective body, the EU surpasses the US contribution. 38 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 53.

In spite of this, the UN con- tinued to bill the United States at its historical assessment rate of 30 per cent of total costs, leading to sizeable arrears for the United States. UN members agreed to lower the proportion to 27 per cent in 2000. http://www.stim- son.org/fopo/?SN=FO2002022 7316 (accessed July 2005) and the United States Mission to the UN: http://www.un.int/usa/iofact3.h tm (accessed July 2005). 54. For comparison, UN peace- keeping spending in nominal terms averaged $164 million per year between 1975 and 1980. The figure rose to $210.8 million between 1981-1988. With more missions involving peace build- ing, average yearly costs rose to $1.75 billion during the 1989- 1996 period.

It should be noted that manpower contributions to operations vary over time due to troop movements, rotations, and reinforcements. As a result, within-year fluctuations for some operations may not be ade- quately captured. Historical data are provided for some missions, such as SFOR and KFOR, to take into account fluctuations over time. For UN operations, monthly figures are averaged over the entire year to produce a representative figure. Burdensharing operations to enhance regional stability Stabilisation Force (SFOR) and Operation Althea As the successor to the NATO-led Implementation Force, the Sta- bilisation Force (SFOR) was initiated in December 1996 to ensure a safe and secure environment in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH). 56 With respect to burdensharing, the picture has changed over time. An initially large US presence was eventually replaced by troops from EU countries. At the outset of the SFOR mission, the United States was the largest individual contributor, providing about 14,000 troops. However, this was somewhat less than the collective EU contribution of 18,500. Within the EU, the UK was the largest single contributor with 5,400 troops on the ground. 40 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 56. SFOR is sometimes referred to as Operation Joint Guard / Opera- tion Joint Forge .

        "2 As the situation on the ground improved, the number of per- sonnel was drawn down over time. By 2000, the number of person- nel attached to SFOR was down to 30,500. The United States still remained as the largest single contributor on the ground. By 2002, with the war on terrorism gathering steam, the United States decreased its presence considerably. As shown in Table 11, the US contribution to SFOR was down to about 2,400 troops in 2002. The EU contribution did not shift dramatically, providing about 11,000 troops in the same year. Among the EU member states, France contributed the largest contingent with about 2,200 per- sonnel. By late 2004, the EU provided 64 per cent of all troops to the mission. The United States had withdrawn most of its troops, maintaining about 800 or 8 per cent of the total share. Other part- ners stood for the remaining 28 per cent. In December 2004, the SFOR mission was handed over to the EU. The EU-headed Operation Althea was formally launched on 2 December 2004. As an EU operation, EU troops currently make up the majority of all personnel on the ground, representing 87 per cent of the total (Table 12). As of April 2005, Germany was the largest single contributor to the operation, providing 1,227 of the total 6,688 troops. 57 Althea \u2019s mandate includes both a stabili- sation and a counter-terrorism dimension, widening the burden- sharing potential of the operation. While not taking part in Operation Althea , the United States maintains some personnel in Bosnia-Herzegovina \u2013 for example a helicopter presence in Tuzla. In addition, NATO keeps a residual presence in Bosnia, carrying out missions in the areas of security sec- tor reform, searching for war criminals, and combating terrorism. 58 41 Burdensharing in the defence field 57.

        "2 The SFOR/ Althea operation represents a good example of \u2018tem- poral\u2019 burdensharing. Over time, large numbers of US troops were replaced by European troops as the situation on the ground sta- bilised and requirements for the redeployment of US troops arose in other parts of the world. US troops stationed in Bosnia were shifted to other theatres such as Iraq. The transition to an EU force through Althea means that European troops currently make up the bulk of peacekeepers in the region. A more stable situation on the ground also allowed the EU to initiate a separate police mis- sion in Sarajevo to train local law enforcement personnel in 2003. NATO Kosovo Force (KFOR) Established in June 1999, the NATO Kosovo Force represents a sec- ond large-scale mission in Europe\u2019s neighbourhood. As its name implies, KFOR\u2019s purpose is to maintain regional stability in Kosovo. KFOR\u2019s burdensharing pattern is different from SFOR\u2019s, as EU member states have consistently contributed more troops to the mission than the US. In 2000, at the early stages of the mission, Italy was the largest individual troop contributor with 6,400 troops on the ground. The United States provided about 6,000 or 14 per cent of the total while the EU accounted for 63 per cent of all per- sonnel. 42 EU-US burdensharing: who does what?

        "2 Over time, the KFOR contingent has decreased in numbers. It went from a high of around 44,000 personnel in 2001 to 23,400 in 2004 (Table 13). During that time, the United States\u2019 contribution gradually declined. In 2004, US troop strength was 9 per cent of the total or close to one third of its 2000 level. The EU also decreased its presence in Kosovo. However, it saw its share of total contributions increase. In 2004, the EU share stood for 77 per cent of all troops \u2013 14 percentage points higher than in 2000. The largest individual contributor in 2004 was Germany with 3,900 troops on the ground. ESDP Missions ESDP operations contribute towards burdensharing in different ways. First, ESDP missions allow the EU to address important secu- rity challenges in its neighbourhood independently. 59 Second, ESDP missions can provide burdensharing support during opera- tional gaps. For example, Operation Artemis in the Democratic Republic of Congo gave the UN time to regroup and reinforce its MONUC operation. Likewise, ESDP missions can provide follow-on support to high-end NATO operations. Operation Concordia was a follow-up operation to NATO\u2019s Allied Harmony , and was subsequently fol- lowed by an EU police mission ( Proxima ) when the situation on the ground called for law enforcement assets. 60 Finally, ESDP missions can induce burdensharing as they usu- ally accept contributions from non-EU member states. Most ESDP operations consisting of a sizeable contingent tend to have non-EU contributions. For example, in the case of the EU Police Mission (EUPM) in Sarajevo, non-EU support comes from Bul- garia (5), Canada (7), Iceland (1), Norway (8), Romania (9), Russia (3), Switzerland (4), Turkey (12), and the Ukraine (5). 61 43 Burdensharing in the defence field 59. The EU is also able to launch small-scale operations with very specific mandates. Examples of small-scale civilian operations in- clude the rule of law mission in Georgia (EUJUST Themis) and the Security Sector Reform mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (EUSEC-R.D. Congo). 60. Concordia relied on member states\u2019 assets as well as planning and logistical support from NATO through the \u2018Berlin Plus\u2019 arrange- ment. Berlin Plus was established in 2002 at the NATO Prague Sum- mit, and provides for support be- tween NATO and EU missions and operations. 61.

        "2 Table 14 provides an overview of civilian and military EU mis- sions since 1 January 2003. Collectively, about 8,500 EU personnel have been attached to these missions. About 1,000 personnel have been provided by non-EU member states. If we constrain the fig- ures to include only military operations, the number of EU per- sonnel is closer to 7,900. As can be seen, the size of the operation varies greatly according to needs and objectives. While Operation Althea engages about 7,000 personnel, Operation EUSEC-RD Congo has eight advisors. 44 EU-US burdensharing: who does what?

        "2 National operations Transatlantic burdensharing may also take place in the context of individual military operations, especially if the objectives meet international strategic interests. Medium- to large-sized powers with a colonial past or specific regional interests are more likely to carry out such operations. They may be initiated if social unrest or violence breaks out in a specific country or region, especially if the international community cannot act quickly and there are sub- stantial numbers of citizens from the intervening nation living in the area. Historically, such operations have occurred in Africa. As the burdensharing \u2018value\u2019 of such operations is subjective, no exhaustive or authoritative list is possible. Below are a few potential examples to illustrate these types of operations. In May 2000, the UK deployed its 1st Battalion, Parachute Reg- iment to Sierra Leone in response to a breakdown in the peace agreement between the government of Sierra Leone and rebels. Known as Operation Palliser , the UK deployment reached a peak of 4,500 personnel. The force carried out several missions, whose objectives were to stabilise the capital of Freetown, secure the air- port to help facilitate the evacuation of British nationals, and rein- force UN forces operating under the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). At a later stage, British troops provided training to Sierra Leone\u2019s armed forces to help them defend against future rebel threats. 62 A more recent example is France\u2019s standing force in Africa. Consisting of 6,000 \u2013 8,000 personnel, it is spread over five differ- ent nations to contribute towards regional stability. Since late 2002, the French contingent has been concentrated in Ivory Coast to enforce a truce in a civil war conflict. 63 On the US side, several large-scale commitments are ongoing since the end of World War II. They include substantial troop com- mitments to South Korea (34,500) and Japan (43,500). 64 While these contributions are not generally considered as burdenshar- ing operations, especially since they do not involve NATO or the European theatre, they play an important role in ensuring regional stability. 65 They are consistent with today\u2019s concept of global security challenges which acknowledges that instability originating from distant places can impact on the United States and Europe. As such, measures to enhance stability in those regions are consistent with the post-Cold War concept of burden- sharing. 45 Burdensharing in the defence field 62. \u2018Defence Secretary Statement on Sierra Leone\u2019, UK Ministry of Defence, 23 May 2000. http://news.mod.uk/news/press /news_press_notice.asp?newsIte m_id=586.

Moreover, since there was no expectation that other countries take part or contribute to these missions, besides the host nation, the perception that such opera- tions were outside the scope of burdensharing took hold over time.

        "2 The United States has also carried out smaller scale operations to enhance regional stability. For example in June 2003, US forces where deployed to Liberia as a Joint Special Operations Task Force to carry out evacuation operations. As humanitarian conditions deteriorated on the ground, the United States decided to boost its presence in Liberia. It deployed a Joint Task Force consisting of over 3,800 personnel. As noted by General James Jones, Comman- der in Chief of United States European Command, the efforts \u2018went a long way toward mitigating a humanitarian crisis in Liberia and preventing it from becoming a source of regional instability by helping international organisations respond effec- tively.\u2019 66 Contributions towards UN peacekeeping operations UN operations are a means of global burdensharing although they are not always considered as such. The security objectives of UN operations \u2013 usually the promotion of stability or security in volatile countries or regions \u2013 are consistent with the security objectives outlined in the US and European security strategies. Several UN peacekeeping operations are ongoing each year. Since 2000, the annual average number of missions has fluctuated between nineteen (2000) and fifteen (2003 and 2004). The total number of personnel engaged in these missions varies throughout the year reflecting rotations and the requirements of each mis- sion. During 2004, the monthly totals ranged from 48,590 in Jan- uary to 64,720 in December. Table 15 provides a breakdown of US and EU contributions of civilian police, military police and troops to UN operations between 2001 and 2004. Over the last few years, the United States and the EU together have provided between nine and fourteen percent of overall UN peacekeeping manpower. However, of the two, the EU member states provide the vast majority. For example in 2004, EU member states provided 4,781 personnel towards UN missions; the US equivalent was 451. With respect to the type of manpower con- tributed, the bulk of US contributions consist of civilian police while those of EU member states are military troops. As shown in Table 15, EU troop contributions in the last few years tend to sur- pass 2,100 per year while US civilian police contributions 46 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 66. Testimony by Gen.

        "2 fluctuate between 500 and 800. The EU\u2019s smallest contribution is in the category of military police (about 300 per year) while the US troop contributions to UN operations average less than three per year between 2001-2004. Another way to assess intra-UN burdensharing levels is to com- pare where European and US contributions to UN peacekeeping operations are deployed, or \u2018geographic burdensharing\u2019. While such deployments are based on operational requirements on the ground, certain trends can be noted over time. Table 16 gives a breakdown for the time period between 2001 and 2004. The figures show that the majority of US and EU personnel contributed to UN peacekeeping operations are concentrated in the European theatre (UNMIK in Kosovo). We find that EU mem- ber states tend to provide relatively equitable contributions to regions such as Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.

However, a look at the raw numbers shows that the EU has a substantially larger UN contingent in the continent: 1,310 versus 84 in 2004. With respect to Asia, there has been a gradual decrease in EU and US contributions to the region since the termination of UNTAET (UN Transitional Administration in East Timor) in 2002 and the steady drawdown in its follow-on mission UNMISET (UN Mis- sion of Support in East Timor). Burdensharing with respect to peacekeeping can also be assessed from the perspective of \u2018fair share.\u2019 Again, the fair share is the ratio of a country\u2019s contribution (expressed as a share of the total 48 EU-US burdensharing: who does what?

It should be recognised that the number of active duty person- nel are set according to domestic requirements, thus potentially af- fecting the objectivity of this par- ticular measure. For example, a country that chooses to maintain a small contingent of military per- sonnel (as a proportion of the to- tal population eligible to serve) is likely to obtain a higher fair share value.

With respect to manpower contributions, the EU average between 2000-2004 is 1.55, signalling that EU countries collec- tively provide more than their fair share towards peacekeeping and UN missions. The United States, however, provides less than its fair share. Its share was under one, even after the initiation of Operation Enduring Freedom in late 2001/early 2002. 69 Burdensharing targeting state failure and counter-terrorism Operation Enduring Freedom and International Security Assis- tance Force Operation Enduring Freedom was the military response to the 9/11 attacks. Launched on 7 October 2001 in Afghanistan, initial oper- ations consisted of a mix of air strikes and Tomahawk cruise mis- siles against al-Qaeda and Taliban contingents. Unlike previous large-scale operations, NATO was not engaged at the outset of OEF for a variety of reasons. These ranged from the need to act quickly (the NATO decision-making process was considered a liability) to concerns over interoperability as the United States introduced con- cepts of network centric warfare. The international presence on the ground was generally limited to Special Operations forces working together with their US equivalents. With the ousting of the Taliban regime, an International Secu- rity Assistance Force (ISAF) was set up. ISAF was to assist the Afghan government and the international community in main- taining security within its area of operation. Coupled with other forms of assistance, such as economic and humanitarian aid, ISAF would indirectly ensure that state failure did not occur. ISAF mis- sions were initially coordinated by volunteer nations. The United Kingdom ran the first ISAF mission starting in January 2002. Consisting of about 5,000 personnel, the operation included con- tributions from several EU member states, including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Turkey assumed command of the second ISAF mission on 20 June 2002, followed by a joint German-Dutch contingent for the third ISAF mission (ISAF-III). Initially, ISAF was configured as an \u2018international\u2019 mission\u2019, organised into six-month rotations with different countries 50 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 68. The calculations take into ac- count personnel contributions to UN operations and major non- UN peacekeeping operations such as Amber Fox , Operation Southern Watch , Operation North- ern Watch , SFOR, KFOR, CON- CORDIA, ARTEMIS, ISAF, and OEF (Afghanistan). 69. Clearly, the US figure would change if the numbers for Opera- tion Iraqi Freedom were included. However, the personnel contribu- tions towards OIF are not in- cluded, as the operation is not considered a peacekeeping opera- tion. CP82-text.qxp 03/10/2005 16:26 Page 50 ",
        "2 assuming a leadership role. It wasn\u2019t until the end of the German- Dutch mission that NATO assumed command of ISAF in August 2003. For NATO, conceived in the context of European-based bur- densharing, ISAF represented its first out-of-area mission and signalled a change in orientation. As of February 2005, thirty-six countries contributed about 8,200 troops to the mission. Of these, about 70 per cent hail from the EU-25. The United States con- tributes about 90 personnel or 1 per cent of ISAF forces. While these figures suggest that transatlantic burdensharing is limited in the region, ISAF does not tell the entire story. US contri- butions in Afghanistan occur largely in the context of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), which is part of the global war on terror- ism and entails deployments to different parts of the world. 70 In 2004, approximately 20,000 troops were engaged in OEF in Afghanistan or its vicinity. Of these, about 18,400 or 91 per cent came from the United States. EU member states collectively con- tributed about 1,300 or 6 per cent of the total (Table 18). The different distribution across the missions can to a large degree be traced to the mission objectives of the two operations. OEF\u2019s mission objectives emphasises counter-terrorism, which stands in contrast to ISAF\u2019s stabilisation mandate. 71 The United 51 Burdensharing in the defence field 70.

        "2 States, spearheading the war on terrorism, is placing its emphasis on OEF while the EU, mainly concerned with stability in the region, represents the bulk of efforts within ISAF. While capabili- ties also play a role in contributing to this role specialisation, it is difficult to gauge its overall impact vis-\u00e0-vis national contribu- tions. Currently, a form of \u2018task-specific\u2019 burdensharing best rep- resents the type of transatlantic collaboration taking place in Afghanistan. This may change somewhat should OEF and ISAF be merged, a possibility that is currently under discussion. Operation Active Endeavour Operation Active Endeavour (OAE) is a NATO-led counter-terror- ism operation initiated in October 2001 to monitor traffic in the Mediterranean Sea. In April 2003, the North Atlantic Council strengthened the mandate of the operation, deciding to allow ship boarding. Since February 2004, escorting tasks through the Strait of Gibraltar are also part of the mission to enhance security in the area. 72 As of May 2005, 488 ships have been escorted, 90 boarded, and 64,553 hailed. 73 With respect to country-level contributions to the operation, most nations currently participate with a frigate and maritime patrol aircraft (Table 19). Some countries, such as Germany, pro- vide additional assets such as submarines or patrol boats. Collec- tively, EU member states contribute about twenty vessels of vary- ing size to the operation. The United States, like most participating nations, provides one frigate and maritime patrol aircraft to the mission. In the future, it is likely that other nations will take part in the operation. Both Russia and the Ukraine have exchanged letters with NATO opening the way for their prospec- tive incorporation. 74 A couple of countries in the Mediterranean region have also indicated their interest in supporting the opera- tion. 75 Through its surveillance missions in the Mediterranean, OAE has resulted in several unintended benefits outside the scope of terrorism. Among the most notable are a drop in illegal immigra- tion and a drop in drug smuggling coming through the Mediter- ranean. 52 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 72.

        "2 (cid:90) countering the re-emergence of transnational terrorism in the region via civil-military operations and support from non-gov- ernmental organisations; and (cid:90) enhancing long-term stability of the region. 76 In geographic terms, CJTF-HOA\u2019s area of operations encom- passes the total airspace and land areas of Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti, Yemen and Ethiopia and the coastal waters of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. 77 In total, nine coun- tries contribute personnel and equipment towards the mission, including the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Unfortunately, an accurate breakdown of all national contribu- tions towards CJTF-HOA is not available, making it difficult to gauge burdensharing levels among contributors. 78 CJTF-HOA carries out aspects of its counter-terrorist mission in non-traditional ways which are not very well known. For exam- ple, a large part of its daily activities involves making contact with local populations and the provision of basic services through infrastructure projects, medical services, and other outreach activ- ities. 79 While these activities are thought to stem the recruitment of terrorists, they also have a stabilising effect in areas served. It also underscores the importance of combining military and civil- ian activities to address the root causes of present-day global chal- lenges. Burdensharing in the fight against weapons of mass destruc- tion (WMD) Countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction repre- sents a high-priority objective for both the EU and the United States. Burdensharing in this area mainly takes place through civilian pro- grammes working to secure known WMD stocks. Military assets are also available to contain the spread of WMD (covered in Chapter 3). The Proliferation Security Initiative is the best-known initiative to date. The Proliferation Security Initiative President Bush formally launched the Proliferation Security Initia- tive (PSI) during his visit to Poland on 31 May 2003. The Initiative promotes the creation of international agreements and partner- ships to \u2018impede and stop shipments of WMD, delivery systems, and related materials flowing to and from states and non-state 54 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 76.

        "2 multinational exercises to practise and test interdiction proce- dures. At the end of December 2004, thirteen multilateral exer- cises had been carried out under the auspices of PSI. 83 These exer- cises range from maritime manoeuvres in the Sea of Japan to air exercises over the Mediterranean. For all exercises in which data on participating states was available, the United States and at least one EU member state \u2013 usually France or Italy \u2013 were present. Transatlantic burdensharing within the PSI is thus fairly well developed. Operation Iraqi Freedom Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) was initially labelled by the United States as an operation to stop Iraq\u2019s alleged WMD programme, including the possibility that it provide WMD to non-state actors. Despite the non-proliferation classification attached to it, transat- lantic disagreements over how to best handle the situation in Iraq ensured that the operation would not become a traditional bur- densharing operation. Instead, OIF was launched as a \u2018coalition of the willing\u2019 operation in which several EU member states partici- pated. Transatlantic burdensharing in Iraq has increased slowly over time. According to the Pentagon, about half of the EU\u2019s member states were taking part in Operation Iraqi Freedom in January 2005, even though the United States provided the overwhelming major- ity of troops (approx. 148,000 or 85 per cent). The EU-25 accounted for 8,300 or about 10 per cent of the total. All other nations provided the remaining five per cent. 84 In July 2004, NATO established a Training Implementation Mission to train and mentor middle and senior level personnel from the Iraqi security forces in Iraq and outside of Iraq. 85 The ini- tial NATO presence in Iraq, about 50 personnel in August 2004, is expected to grow to about 360 personnel. At the NATO Heads of State and Government meeting in 22 February 2005, decision- makers outlined the objective of training about 1,000 Iraqi offi- cers in the country, and about 500 outside of Iraq per year. Besides EU member states\u2019 participation in the mission, the EU launched a rule of law mission for Iraq in July 2005 (EUJUST LEX). Despite these contributions, European participation in Opera- tion Iraqi Freedom remains hesitant.

Yet there are fears that Iraq could prove a prime terrorist haven unless the security situation is improved. Such an outcome would not just be a blow for the US, but also for Europe. Summary The concept of burdensharing has long been discussed in the con- text of military cooperation. This chapter highlights some of the key components of contemporary EU-US burdensharing. Changes in the international landscape described in Chapter 1, such as the end of the Cold War, adjustments in relative military capabilities, and the identification of new global challenges, opened the door for a greater international engagement by the United States, NATO, and the EU. ESDP, in particular, has enabled the EU to assume a larger role in regional stability than it has in the past. In summary: (cid:90) The United States continues to outspend the EU in terms of defence spending , a gap that has broadened since the 9/11 attacks. At $453.6 billion, the US national defence outlay for FY04 was more than twice the combined EU-25 defence budget in 2004. \u2018Fair share\u2019 calculations confirm this spending pattern, with the United States dedicating substantially more than EU member states. Its \u2018fair share\u2019 average for 2000-2004 was 1.36 versus 0.56 for EU member states. (cid:90) Regarding defence R&D spending , the US is estimated to be outspending the EU by 5 to 1. In 2004, US R&D spending was close to \u20ac 62 billion compared to \u20ac 12 million for the EU. Besides the US-EU gap in defence R&D spending, there is a sim- ilar gap among EU member states. Specifically, the contribu- tions by France, Germany, and the UK represent 67 per cent of overall EU spending on defence R&D. While the accuracy of R&D data cannot be confirmed due to a lack of transparency and common definitions, the difference between the United States and the EU is significant as it may have implications for future burdensharing as armed forces on both sides of the Atlantic are modernised. While there are a number of 57 Burdensharing in the defence field CP82-text.qxp 03/10/2005 16:26 Page 57 ",
        "2 workarounds available to address current interoperability gaps, the demands of future security situations may not be able to accommodate them as well. (cid:90) Another important dimension of burdensharing, operational costs , is difficult to gauge. While there are specific formulas for covering certain costs, such as common costs, within organisa- tions like NATO, the EU, and the UN, individual operational costs are borne by participating states on a \u2018costs lie where they fall\u2019 basis. Countries that tend to contribute more personnel to an operation therefore tend to bear a greater part of the burden. Concerning NATO common costs, the United States con- tributes about 25 per cent while EU member states cover approximately 63 per cent. Within the UN system, the US Con- gress has mandated that US contributions towards peacekeep- ing expenditures be a maximum of 25 per cent of the total. EU contributions, on the other hand, were 40 per cent in 2004. Thus, while the United States is the largest individual contrib- utor, the EU contribution as a whole tends to be greater. (cid:90) The complexity of burdensharing is especially evident vis-\u00e0-vis personnel contributions to non-UN-led and UN-led peace- keeping operations. Manpower data suggests that burdenshar- ing on the ground can take on a variety of forms. For example in the Balkan theatre, US and EU contribution patterns changed over time (\u2018temporal\u2019 burdensharing). An initially heavy US presence gradually gave way to a larger EU contingent. In SFOR, the US personnel went from 34 per cent of the total in 1997 (14,028) to 7.5 percent in 2004 (839). In contrast, the EU saw its contribution go from 45 per cent to 64 per cent over the same time period. In Afghanistan, a form of \u2018task-specific\u2019 burdensharing is tak- ing place. While EU member states focus their efforts to the NATO ISAF operation where they provide 5,738 or 70 per cent of the total in 2005 (1 per cent for the United States), the United States is carrying out the bulk of its contribution via Operation Enduring Freedom where it provides 18,400 or 91 per cent of all personnel (6 per cent for EU member states). An analysis of contributions to UN-led operations shows that EU member states provide at least six times more UN personnel than the United States for each year between 2001 and 2004. While both sides have seen declines in numbers between 2001 and 2004, the US decrease is 43.1 per cent while that of EU mem- 58 EU-US burdensharing: who does what?

Burdensharing here tends to follow a \u2018geographic\u2019 pattern, with the United States focusing its UN per- sonnel contributions on Europe (at least 75 per cent between 2000\u20132004) while EU member states dispatch their contribu- tions more equitably across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. A tally of personnel contributions made to all UN operations and nine different non-EU-led operations between 2001 and 2004 shows that the EU provides a greater share of personnel towards peacekeeping operations. For example, in 2004, the total personnel contributed by the EU to these operations amounted to about 33,300. The US contribution was approxi- mately 21,000, with the majority of personnel dedicated towards Operation Enduring Freedom . \u2018Fair share\u2019 calculations confirm that EU member states contribute more than their fair share towards peacekeeping while the United States provides less than its fair share. The EU average between 2001 and 2004 was 1.55 while that of the United States was 0.68. This is consis- tent with the American focus on \u2018warfighting\u2019 operations and the European focus on \u2018stability\u2019 operations. Currently, the United States is deeply engaged in Iraq, which although no longer officially a war situation, ties up about 140,000 person- nel. Despite these different orientations and capabilities, an analysis of personnel contributions to different operations sug- gests that burdensharing can take on a variety of forms and undergo changes over time. 59 Burdensharing in the defence field CP82-text.qxp 03/10/2005 16:26 Page 59 ",

        "Civilian burdensharing As discussed in Chapter 1, the global landscape has changed exten- sively since the Cold War \u2013 both in terms of key threats and the international security landscape. Whereas the concept of burden- sharing traditionally emphasized military contributions, today civilian burdensharing is increasingly viewed as a vital ingredient for addressing global security challenges. Civilian contributions can take a variety of forms, ranging from official development assistance to efforts to eradicate global disease. This chapter exam- ines various types of civilian burdensharing. Defining civilian burdensharing Defining civilian burdensharing is a complex task. First, while a lot of data is collected on a wide variety of civilian activities, as a general rule these indicators are not aggregated or summarised in terms of contributions to global security. Second, in many cases, common definitions for similar activities are difficult to come by, making consistent and accurate comparisons difficult \u2013 even for such long- standing activities as humanitarian assistance. Third, a large num- ber of stakeholders involved in civilian activities make it difficult to estimate the size of the civilian contribution. For example, a signif- icant portion of international assistance to developing countries comes from private assistance flows via foundations, corporations, religious congregations, private and voluntary organisations, as well as individual remittances. There are also many non-govern- mental organisations (NGOs) that channel resources to countries and regions in need. According to the OECD, about $10.2 billion was provided by NGOs worldwide in net grants in 2003 \u2013 an increase of $1.4 billion from 2002. 86 Thus, counting only direct government assistance understates national efforts to resolve important policy problems. 61 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 86. \u2018Total Net Flows from DAC Countries by Type of Flow\u2019, Statis- tical Annex of the 2004 Develop- ment Co-operation Report, OECD 2004. 3 CP82-text.qxp 03/10/2005 16:26 Page 61 ",
        "3 With these limitations in mind, this chapter summarises civil- ian burdensharing between the United States and the EU by com- paring key indicators according to different threat categories. The key threat areas and related indicators are: 1. Burdensharing targeting regional stability and state failure (a) Official development assistance (b)Humanitarian assistance (including crisis response). 2. Burdensharing in the fight against WMD and counter-terror- ism (a) Cooperative Threat Reduction Programme (b)G-8 Global Partnership Programme. [ Readers who are not familiar with the US and EU external budgets and their main components may wish to consult the background information provided in Annex 1. ] Burdensharing targeting regional stability and state failure The primary civilian contributions for enhancing regional stability and precluding state failure can be organised into the following three categories: official development assistance, humanitarian aid, and crisis response. For the United States, foreign aid is clearly linked to global security. According to the US State Department, \u2018the events of September 11 represent a significant challenge to US foreign policy and demonstrate the necessity of a robust foreign assistance program.\u2019 87 The EU\u2019s foreign aid programme is closely aligned with the UN Millennium Development Goals to reduce poverty. 88 While each may orient its aid programme differently, the assistance serves to enhance regional stability and reduce the likelihood of state failure. The following section reviews how the EU, its member states, and the US compare in terms of spending in this area. Official Development Assistance The most common proxy for foreign aid is Official Development Assistance (ODA), which is defined by the Development Assistance 62 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 87. \u2018Appropriations Subcommit- tees\u2019, US State Department web- site (accessed June 19, 2005). http://www.state.gov/m/rm/rls/ iab/2003/7808.htm 88.

        "3 Committee (DAC) of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Its principal elements are bilateral grants (e.g. technical cooperation, developmental food aid, emer- gency relief, and debt forgiveness), bilateral loans, and contribu- tions to multilateral institutions like the UN. 89 In terms of sheer volume, the United States is the largest con- tributing country of net Official Development Assistance. In 2004, the United States provided $19 billion in ODA. However, collectively the EU member states and the European Commission contributed $43 billion \u2013 more than twice the US contribution. Together, the EU and the United States represented 79 per cent of ODA spending in 2004. The remaining six DAC donor countries (Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway and Switzer- land) provided the remaining 21 per cent. According to the OECD, DAC members account for at least 95 per cent of worldwide ODA disbursements. The relative contributions of the United States and the EU have changed somewhat over time. Between 2000-2004, the US share of total ODA increased from 19 to 24 per cent. During the same time period, the EU increased its share from 47 to 55 percent (Figure 1). 90 Offsetting these gains by the EU and the United States was a substantial drop in contributions by the remaining DAC donor countries. Their share of total ODA decreased from 34 to 21 per cent. 63 Civilian burdensharing 89. OECD website: http://www.oecd.org/glos- sary/0,2586,en_2649_33721_1 965693_1_1_1_1,00.html. 90. An analysis of historical data going back to 1950 shows that the United States contributed a sub- stantially higher proportion of ODA in the 1950s and 1960s. In fact, the US contribution to over- all ODA was over 50 per cent be- tween 1950 and 1968. It was only \u2018overtaken\u2019 by the EU in 1973, when EU membership grew to in- clude Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Based on au- thor\u2019s calculations using OECD data.

        "3 Taking into account inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, the EU ODA contribution increased from $37.1 to $38.2 between 2003 and 2004. This represents a 2.9 per cent increase. 91 The United States, on the other hand, experienced a 14 per cent increase over the same time period, going from $16.3 to $18.6 bil- lion. 92 Another way to gauge transatlantic ODA contributions is to compare US and EU member state contributions as a percentage of their gross national income (GNI). EU member states con- tributed about one third of a per cent of GNI towards ODA between 2000 and 2004. Over the same time period, the US figure ranged from 0.10 per cent to 0.16 per cent. By this metric, the EU countries have dedicated substantially more of their gross national income towards ODA, even if both sides have been increasing their contributions over time. 93 64 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 91. Within the EU, some countries experienced greater changes than others. Portugal, for example, in- creased its ODA by 188 per cent between 2003 and 2004. 92. \u2018Net Official Development As- sistance in 2004\u2019, OECD, 11 April 2005. 93. This difference is likely to grow over time as EU member states re- cently agreed to increase their thresholds for ODA for 2010- 2015. The new objective is a col- lective commitment for a GDP threshold of 0.56 per cent by 2010. By 2015, the EU-15 mem- ber states are to dedicate 0.7 per cent of GDP towards ODA. The target goal for the new EU-10 member states is 0.17 per cent of GDP by 2010 and 0.33 per cent by 2015. \u2018Jean-Louis Schiltz believes the new EU collective commit- ment to a GDP threshold of 0.56% for official development assis- tance is \u201can essential break- through\u201d\u2019, Luxembourg Presi- dency Press Release, 25 May 2005.

        "3 It should be noted that the figures for the EU represent an aver- age. As such, there are a number of EU member states that provide an even higher proportion of GNI towards ODA. Figure 2 provides a snapshot for the EU-15 and the United States in 2004. 94 It shows that several EU member states \u2013 Denmark, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and Sweden \u2013 provided in excess of the UN target set at 0.70 per cent of GNI in 2004. The US contribution of 0.16 per cent placed it near the bottom of all DAC donor countries. A third way to evaluate burdensharing is to examine the relative \u2018fair share\u2019 of Official Development Assistance. The \u2018fair share\u2019 is the ratio of a country\u2019s contribution expressed as a share of the total (in this case ODA) to its ability to contribute (expressed as a share of total GDP). 95 Table 22 provides an overview of the fair share with respect to ODA between 2000 and 2004. Supporting data is pro- vided in Tables 34 and 35 in Annex 2 and Tables 48 and 49 in Annex 3. 65 Civilian burdensharing 94. Data for the new member states is not available. The only figure provided by the OECD is a $124 million contribution by Poland in 2004. It should be noted that most of the new mem- ber states were formerly net recip- ients of ODA. 95. These fair share calculations entail replicating the methodol- ogy used by the analysts responsi- ble for producing the Pentagon\u2019s yearly report on allied contribu- tions to the common defence.

        "3 A country is considered to be doing its fair share if its propor- tion of total ODA contributions is in balance with its share of total GDP. In the table, values close to one indicate that a country is contributing a fair share taking into account its ability to pay. Countries contributing less than their fair share exhibit values that are less than one. Those contributing more than their fair share have values greater than one. According to the fair share cri- teria, the EU member states are contributing more than their fair share of ODA in comparison to the United States. As the table shows, several small European countries such as Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden contribute more than their fair share towards ODA. The EU average over the last few years has oscillated between 2.0 and 1.6, translating into contributions that are in excess of their fair share \u2013 even if the proportion has decreased over time. Over the same time period, 66 EU-US burdensharing: who does what?

        "3 the US contribution has been around 0.5 or under its fair share. The fair share calculation does not attempt to answer the ques- tion \u2018what is an appropriate contribution level?\u2019 either at the national or aggregate level. Rather, it serves to compare individual contributions as a proportion of the total while taking GDP into account. Moreover, it does not provide any indication concerning the quality or value of the eventual aid furnished. 96 It also does not take into account to whom ODA is distributed. 97 Nonetheless, it provides an objective means for comparing contributions while taking into account the ability to contribute. Humanitarian assistance Humanitarian assistance (HA) aims to provide relief to areas struck by natural or man-made disasters. Such aid can play an important stabilising role in affected countries or regions. Humanitarian assistance is frequently used to enhance health, nutrition, and security levels in areas torn by conflict. For example, it may be used to provide resettlement assistance to populations affected by a dis- aster or conflict. It should be noted that HA represents a small por- tion of overall Official Development Assistance. Moreover, fund- ing levels tend to vary according to the number of events requiring humanitarian assistance. In terms of overall volume, US humanitarian assistance sur- passes that of the EU member states and the European Commis- sion combined. In 2004, US humanitarian assistance was about \u20ac 2 billion while the EU contributed a little under \u20ac 1.5 billion. However, the EU figure is understated as it is based on self- reported data to the European Commission. With the exception of 2003, the EU and US gaps have narrowed between 2001-2004, due in part to a weaker dollar and a substantial decrease in US con- tributions in FY04. Evaluating humanitarian assistance as a percentage of GDP shows that the US contribution is slightly greater than that of the EU. If we take into consideration that the individual EU member state contributions are underreported, it is quite likely the true proportions of the EU are higher, diminishing the US \u2013 EU gap. While humanitarian disbursements are event-driven, it is never- theless notable that no contribution on either side of the Atlantic has surpassed 0.03 per cent of GDP in the past few years. 67 Civilian burdensharing 96.

        "3 One area of distinction between US and European humanitar- ian aid involves the actual recipients. Seemingly consistent with the notion of \u2018geographic\u2019 burdensharing, the United States and EU focus much of their humanitarian assistance on different con- tinents. While the largest proportion of US aid was destined to the Middle East (39 per cent of total aid), the EU sent over half of its aid to the ACP countries (Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific). 68 EU-US burdensharing: who does what?

        "3 The United States pattern of economic aid is increasingly strategic in its nature. Historically, most US aid has been directed to the Middle East. But, to a great extent, considerations in the Global War on Terrorism drive current decisions on aid flows. For example, aid to Pakistan jumped from $1.7 million in 2001 to $275 million in 2004. 98 The EU, on the other hand, is placing its aid emphasis on alleviating poverty, responding to crises, and con- tributing to regional stability. For example, the European Com- mission is focusing its assistance on areas consistent with the goals of the Millennium Development Goals. 99 Currently, a large part of economic aid is dedicated towards cri- sis response and reconstruction. For example, a substantial por- tion of EU contributions towards Africa is destined to ameliorate the situation in Darfur (Sudan). As of May 2005, the EU had mobilised \u20ac 570 million in response to the Darfur crisis. The vast 69 Civilian burdensharing 98.

They make a contribution towards burdensharing by increasing stabil- ity, security, and development levels in specific parts of the world. 105 As such, they are consistent with a burdensharing para- digm in which \u2018preventative\u2019 measures to boost stability and devel- opment represent valuable means for addressing security chal- lenges. This section gives a brief overview of EU contributions towards the CARDS, TACIS, and MEDA Programmes. 71 Civilian burdensharing 103. \u2018Rebuilding Iraq: Status of Funding and Reconstruction Ef- forts\u2019, Report to Congressional Committees, General Accounting Office, GAO-05-876, July 2005, p. 2. 104.

This does not include other means at the disposal of the EU such as enlargement. The latest EU enlargement in May 2004 rep- resented a significant step to boost European (and global) se- curity and stability. The prospect of extending membership to other countries also gives the EU a pow- erful tool with which to shape de- velopments in its neighbourhood.

        "3 Since 1991, the Technical Aid to the Commonwealth of Inde- pendent States (TACIS) Programme has provide grant-financed technical assistance to thirteen countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Mongolia, Russia, Tajikistan, Turk- menistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. The goal of TACIS is to enhance development in each of these countries by supporting institutional, legal and administrative reform, economic and social development, infrastructure development, environmental protection, and nuclear safety. 106 The programme will provide \u20ac 3.14 billion between 2000 and 2006. 107 The EU\u2019s principal financial instrument for the implementa- tion of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is MEDA. 108 Launched in November 1995, MEDA offers technical and finan- cial support measures to Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Funding for the period 2000-2006 amounts to \u20ac 5.35 billion. 109 Since 2004, the MEDA partners are also included in the European Neighbour- hood Policy (ENP). ENP, which provides guidance on the EU\u2019s relations with its neighbours, includes \u20ac 15 billion in grants for ENP countries for the period 2007-2013. 110 The Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation (CARDS) aims to promote stability and peace in the Western Balkans. The CARDS programme commenced in 2000, streamlining a number of programmes that had begun in 1991. The countries benefiting from the CARDS programme are Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Serbia Montenegro. The programme will provide \u20ac 4.6 billion between 2000 and 2006 towards investment, institution building, reconstruction, and structural reform. 111 Taking into account US contributions to the region, burdensharing in the region has been robust for many years. According to a 2003 report by the US General Accounting Office, the United States military, civilian, humanitarian, and reconstruction assistance to Bosnia and Kosovo was about $19.7 billion between 1996 and 2002. 112 Collectively, these three regional programmes involve EU pay- ments exceeding one and a half billion euros per year. Overall, approximately \u20ac 13.1 billion are committed to CARDS, MEDA, and TACIS between 2000 and 2006. 72 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 106.

        "3 Burdensharing in the fight against WMD and counter- terrorism Burdensharing on the civilian side also includes pledges of transat- lantic funding to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including the challenges posed by the proliferation of chemical and biological materials. The funding streams princi- pally aim to secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union. Cooperative Threat Reduction In the United States, threat reduction programmes are con- ducted through the departments of Defense, Energy, and State. The Department of Defense (DoD) manages the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) programme, which aims to reduce the threats from weapons of mass destruction. It goes back to the Nunn-Lugar programme initiated in November 1991, known at the time as the \u2018Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act.\u2019 Today, the programme assists Russia and eligible states of the former Soviet Union with the storage, transportation, and dismantling of nuclear materials. 113 It is administered within DoD by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. CTR is funded through DoD, and has received over $4.4 billion through annual defence appropriations since 1991. 114 The 73 Civilian burdensharing 113.

        "3 request for the CTR programme for the fiscal year 2006 is $415.5 million, a slight increase over current spending of $409.2 million. 115 For FY 2006, all $416 million in DoD Cooperative Threat Reduction programmes will be counted towards the US contribution to the G-8 Global Partnership (discussed in the next section). The Department of Energy contributes through its Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Program. Its primary mission is to pro- vide technical leadership to limit or prevent the spread of materi- als, technology, and expertise relating to weapons of mass destruc- tion. Its funding for FY2004 and FY2005 was about $1.4 billion for each year, organised into eight major programmes. The FY06 request is $1.6 billion, of which $526 million will be counted towards the US commitment to the Global Partnership. 116 Within the State Department, the US conducts non-prolifera- tion initiatives \u2018to halt the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and conventional weaponry\u2026[and to estab- lish] verifiable safeguards against the proliferation of such weapons.\u2019 117 In FY 2005, non-proliferation efforts were funded at $195 million. The EU started to interact regularly with the CTR in 1994. Two of the initial areas for collaboration were involvement in the Inter- national Science and Technology Centre and the civil nuclear sec- tor programmes. Within the EU\u2019s first pillar, the TACIS pro- gramme became the main conduit for interaction. In the area of nuclear safety alone, the TACIS programme provided almost \u20ac 800 million between 1991 and 2001. 118 The European Commission earmarked about \u20ac 140 million for nuclear safety activities between 2002 and 2003. 119 According to the European Commis- sion\u2019s Nuclear Safety Indicative Programme, the envisaged budget for the time period 2004-2006 is an additional \u20ac 429 million. 120 Within the EU\u2019s second pillar, activities relevant to CTR in Russia are rooted in the Joint Action of 17 December 1999. Joint action projects are funded out of the CFSP budget line of the Community budget or directly by individual EU member states. 121 Over time, EU involvement in CTR expanded. Examples of such work include projects aimed at the disposition of excess weapons plutonium; safeguards and material protection; control and accountancy of nuclear materials; and civilian projects for former nuclear weapons production staff. 122 74 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 115. http://www.armscontrol. org/act/2005_04/ThreatReduc- tion.asp. 116. http://www.mbe.doe.gov/ budget/06budget/Content/Vol- umes/Vol_1_NNSA.pdf. 117. \u2018US Foreign Assistance Refer- ence Guide\u2019, US Department of State and US Agency for Interna- tional Development, January 2005, p. 19. 118.

        "3 It should be noted that EU non-proliferation activities are also taking place at the political level. An example is the EU\u2019s inclusion of non-proliferation clauses in international agreements. The EU has introduced such clauses in agreements with countries such as Syria, Albania and Tajikistan. The Global Partnership In early 2002, the United States formally proposed an expansion of its Cooperative Threat Reduction programmes, colloquially known as \u201810 plus 10 over 10.\u2019 The initiative calls for the G-8 to com- plement the $10 billion the United States was already planning to spend on CTR-related programmes with an additional $10 billion to be allocated by partners over ten years. At the June 2002 summit the Group of Eight (US, Canada, UK, France, Ger- many, Italy, Japan [G-7] plus Russia [G-8]) formed the Global Part- nership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction . Under this partnership, the United States, other members of the G-8 and the European Commission agreed to raise up to $20 billion over ten years for projects in parts of the Common- wealth of Independent States related to disarmament, non-prolif- eration, counter-terrorism and nuclear safety. Global Partnership projects are funded bilaterally under government-to-government agreements with recipient countries. In response to the United States\u2019 pledge to contribute half of the $20-billion target, the other G-8 countries and the European Commission have thus far pledged about $6.5 billion. 123 The national pledges of G8 members so far include commitments by Canada (CD$1 billion), France ( \u20ac 750 million), Germany (up to $1.5 billion), Japan ($200 million), Italy ( \u20ac 1 billion), United King- dom ($750 million), the United States ($10 billion), and Russia ($2 billion). The European Commission has pledged \u20ac 1 billion and Russia $2 billion. 124 Annex 4 provides a specific breakdown of these pledges and those made by non G-8 states. 125 While it is still too early to judge whether all pledges towards the Global Partnership will be honoured on time, the programme represents an important mechanism for burdensharing in the area of non-proliferation. The programme\u2019s ability to organise a variety of national initiatives under one umbrella heading repre- sents an important contribution in itself. 75 Civilian burdensharing 123. http://www.state.gov/t/np/ rls/fs/34967.htm. 124. http://www.g8usa. gov/d_ 060904i.htm. 125.

        "3 Burdensharing in other priority fields \u2013 combating international disease Although combating global disease is not identified as a key threat in either the NSS or ESS, it is identified as a global challenge that needs to be addressed. Both strategies also underline the rela- tionship between international disease and some of the key threats such as regional stability and state failure. The presence of disease can aggravate a delicate situation on the ground. The ESS notes that \u2018AIDS is now one of the most devastating pandemics in human history and contributes to the breakdown of societies. New diseases can spread rapidly and become global threats.\u2019 126 The NSS underscores the economic implications resulting from international disease: \u2018in countries afflicted by the epidemics and pandemics like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be threatened until these scourges can be con- tained.\u2019 127 Among the principal diseases on the radar screen of decision- makers are AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. In 2001, the Global Fund to Combat AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria was set up to channel international funding to combat these diseases. Among the principal donors to the international organisation are the United States and the EU. The US contribution to the Global Fund cannot exceed 33 per cent of the total, a ceiling mandated by the US Congress. Thus, US burdensharing to the fund represents a third of total contribu- tions. As shown in Table 27, the EU total contribution (including that of the European Commission) supersedes that of the United States since the establishment of the Fund. In 2005, EU total con- tributions are expected to reach nearly $750 million or 53 per cent of the Fund\u2019s total donor country provisions. Besides yearly commitments to the Global Fund, countries also contribute to alleviate the effects of certain diseases through bilat- eral means or through other organisations such as UNAIDS. For example, between 2000-2002, EU member countries committed $335.2 million bilaterally. Over the same time period, the United States provided a substantially larger portion ($566.6 million). If we include those funds provided to multilateral organisations, except those of the Global Fund, the contributions rise to $874.6 and $710.2 million respectively (see Table 54 in Annex 3 for actual 76 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 126. \u2018A secure Europe in a better world\u2019, European Security Strat- egy, December 2003. 127.

        "3 breakdowns). The EU figure reaches close to $950 million with the addition of the European Commission\u2019s contribution. 128 One of the more profiled initiatives to date is the US launch of the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Announced at the January 2003 State of the Union address, it con- sists of a five year $15 billion emergency plan to curb HIV/AIDS. So far, $5.2 billion have been provided under the plan. It should be noted that some of the US pledges have not been fulfilled \u2013 espe- cially in the area of HIV/AIDS funding. Summary Civilian programmes represent an important avenue for address- ing the global challenges identified in the security strategies of the United States and the European Union. A plethora of funding mechanisms exist to address state failure, regional conflict, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. As a result, it is difficult to obtain exact numbers on all types of contri- butions. A good approximation, however, is Official Development Assistance (ODA). 77 Civilian burdensharing 128. \u2018Analysis of aid in support of HIV/AIDS control 2000-2002\u2019, OECD Development Assistance Committee and UNAIDS, June 2004.

        "3 (cid:90) In terms of sheer volume, the United States is the biggest indi- vidual contributor of ODA . In 2004, it contributed $19 billion towards ODA, about half of the EU total ($43 billion). The largest contributor on the EU side was France with $8.5 million, closely followed by Germany ($7.5 billion). Overall, the EU pro- vides the biggest share of ODA. In 2004, the EU provided 55 per cent of total ODA while the United States accounted for 24 per cent. On average, EU member states provided about 0.34 per cent of GNI towards ODA between 2000 and 2004. The United States figure was 0.13 per cent. A fair share calculation of ODA contri- butions confirms that the EU gives more than its fair share towards ODA. The EU average for 2000-2004 was 1.84 while that of the United States was 0.6. Consistent with previous observations, it should also be noted that there are substantial differences in contribution levels amongst EU member states \u2013 suggesting that a form of burdensharing also takes place within the EU. (cid:90) With respect to humanitarian aid , US contributions tend to surpass those of the EU both in terms of sheer volume and as a percentage of GDP. In 2004, the US provided $2.5 billion ( \u20ac 2.0 billion) towards humanitarian assistance or 0.021 per cent of GDP. The EU figure was \u20ac 1.4 billion or 0.015 per cent of GDP. Since the EU data is likely to be underestimated as a result of the self-reporting mechanism used to calculate the figure, contri- butions across the Atlantic are probably closer than the data suggest. (cid:90) Efforts to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction are spearheaded by the G-8\u2019s Global Partnership. With pledges reaching $20 billion over the next ten years, the programme involves the United States, twelve EU member states, the Euro- pean Commission, and several third countries. If the pledges are maintained over time, the Global Partnership could become a model for burdensharing when specific objectives can be identified. 78 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? CP82-text.qxp 03/10/2005 16:26 Page 78 ",
        "Conclusion What have we learned about EU-US military and civilian burden- sharing in the years since the September 11 th 2001 attacks? A num- ber of observations can be made, particularly with respect to the high-priority challenges identified in the US and EU security strategies. First, the end of the Cold War transformed the concept of bur- densharing for security. With the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, NATO\u2019s primary role of countering a potential military attack in Europe disappeared. Burdensharing would no longer be some- thing that exclusively took place in Europe within the confines of NATO. Likewise, the emergence of conflicts on Europe\u2019s doorstep forced European decision-makers to assess and adjust their secu- rity capabilities. In particular, the wars of secession in Yugoslavia during the 1990s highlighted the need for improved military capa- bilities. A direct result was the reinforcement of ESDP in the late 1990s. The military and civilian capabilities formed under the umbrella of ESDP gave the EU the ability to contribute towards burdensharing in new ways. Second, the concept of security itself changed over time. Today\u2019s threats blur the lines of internal and external security. Pol- icy-makers perceive a closer linkage between the root causes of global challenges, such as poverty, and security threats such as ter- rorism, regional conflict, state failure and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As a result, it is increasingly clear that both military and civilian tools, and a strong interface between the two, are needed to address such threats. Third, burdensharing is not a homogenous or static concept. There are many forms of both military burdensharing (e.g. tempo- ral, task-specific, geographic) and civilian burdensharing (e.g. ODA, reconstruction assistance), which are likely to continue to evolve as the global security environment changes. In the military field, we may see a greater emphasis on niche capabilities \u2013 such as rapidly deployable special operations personnel \u2013 to provide 79 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? CP82-text.qxp 03/10/2005 16:26 Page 79 ",
        "specialised contributions to increasingly complex operations requiring rapid action. A similar development is likely to arise in the civilian field where future operations may become smaller but more specialised. This trend is already emerging with the use of police missions, rule of law missions, etc. These developments highlight the fact that burdensharing does not require both sides to take on the same tasks or build the same capabilities. Finally, measuring burdensharing is more an art than a science. Beyond the challenges associated with the collection of data, the vast number of avenues through which burdensharing takes place makes it difficult to gauge the size and scope of burdensharing accurately. Nonetheless, several points can be made: 1. The United States continues to outspend the EU in terms of defence spending and military Research and Development. (cid:92) At $453.6 billion, the US national defence outlay for FY04 was more than twice the combined EU-25 defence budget for 2004. (cid:92) \u2018Fair share\u2019 calculations confirm that the United States ded- icates substantially more funds than EU member states. Its \u2018fair share\u2019 average for 2000-2004 was 1.36 versus 0.56 for EU member states. 2. EU member states collectively contribute a greater number of personnel to non-EU-led peacekeeping operations and UN-led operations. (cid:92) In 2004, the total personnel contributed by the EU to these operations totalled about 33,300. The US contribution was approximately 21,000. 129 (cid:92) With respect to UN contributions, the EU personnel provi- sion was at least six times greater than that of the US for any year between 2001 and 2004. (cid:92) The United States provides the bulk of its troops to high- end operations such as Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom . This pattern reinforces the notion that the United States and European forces concentrate their efforts on different types of missions. 3. On the civilian side, the United States tends to be the single largest contributing country with respect to Official Develop- ment Assistance, humanitarian aid, and non-proliferation 80 EU-US burdensharing: who does what? 129. The figures do not include contributions to Operation Iraqi Freedom . CP82-text.qxp 03/10/2005 16:26 Page 80 ",
        "initiatives. However, European support outpaces that of the US when contributions are evaluated relative to EU member states\u2019 \u2018ability to pay\u2019 (e.g. as a percentage of GNI) or as a percentage of total contributions. (cid:92) In 2004, the United States contributed $19 billion towards ODA, as compared to $43 billion by the EU-25. After the US, the second largest EU contributor was France, with $8.5 bil- lion. (cid:92) Overall, the EU provided 55 per cent of total ODA while the United States accounted for 24 per cent in 2004. (cid:92) In the same year, the US provided $2.5 billion ( \u20ac 2.0 billion) towards humanitarian assistance or 0.021 per cent of GDP. The EU figure was \u20ac 1.4 billion or 0.015 per cent of GDP. (cid:92) In 2004, the EU accounted for 48.6 per cent ($724 million) of total contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria while the United States provided 28.3 percent ($459 million). 4. Although not fully comparable, contributions across military and civilian domains show that an overwhelming amount of resources go towards military expenditures on both sides of the Atlantic. (cid:92) In 2004, US contributions towards ODA represented 4.2 per cent of the US National Defense budget outlay. The EU ODA contribution represented 23 per cent of the total EU defence budget in the same year. 130 81 Conclusion 130. From a different angle, the US contribution to ODA in 2004 was 14.3 per cent of funding ap- propriated to the Department of Defense in support of the global war on terror in FY04 ($65 bil- lion). \u2018Military Operations: Fis- cal Year 2004 Costs for the Global War on Terrorism Will Ex- ceed Supplemental, Requiring DoD to Shift Funds from Other Uses\u2019, Report to Congressional Committees, General Account- ing Office, GAO-04-915, July 2004.

        "a 1 Brief overview of the US and EU external budgets The United States In the United States, Function 150 of the federal budget covers all spending on international programmes. In FY 2004, the US dedi- cated $30 billion to international affairs; a figure that rises to $50 billion if spending on Iraq is included. Of that amount, approxi- mately $22 billion went towards foreign aid (Table 28). 131 The most relevant budget categories within the 150 budget are: bilat- eral economic assistance, military assistance, multilateral eco- nomic assistance, contributions to international organisations, and food aid. The allocation of these funds is the responsibility of multiple government departments and agencies. 132 Principal agencies are the United States Agency for International Develop- ment (USAID), the State Department, and the Department of Defense. The greatest proportion of US foreign aid goes towards bilat- eral economic assistance (Title II), accounting for over 50 per cent of the foreign aid budget. A substantial portion of these funds is distributed through USAID and through multiple programmes. For example in FY2004, $1.82 billion was provided to the Child Survival and Health Program Fund, $1.36 billion towards devel- opment assistance, $544 million for international disaster and famine assistance, and $55 million for transition initiatives through USAID. Within Title II, the Economic Support Fund (ESF) represents the largest component of \u2018other bilateral economic assistance\u2019. ESF contributions are usually based on consideration of US inter- ests and special economic, political and security needs. Countries that receive ESF funding are often chosen for their strategic importance and not all funds are targeted on development. As such, Economic Support Funds \u2018somewhat overstates the total amount\u2019 of foreign aid. 133 However, it should also be acknowl- edged that certain ESF money goes towards initiatives, organisa- tions, and agencies that deal with development issues. Examples include the Africa Regional Fund, Regional Women\u2019s Issues, and the Middle East Partnership Initiative. At present, primary recipi- ents of ESF funds are Israel, Egypt, Jordan and countries in the 83 131. Not all aspects of Budget Function 150 are considered for- eign aid. Some funds, for example, go towards the day-to-day opera- tions of the State Department. 132. The House International Re- lations and Senate Foreign Rela- tions Committees bear primary responsibility for the authorisa- tion of foreign aid programmes. The House and Senate Appropri- ations Foreign Operations Sub- committees ensure that foreign assistance funds are appropri- ated. 133.

The Department of Agriculture provides a food aid programme, which is listed in the budget sepa- rately. 135 Title III of the foreign aid budget is Military Assistance. Aid comes primarily in the form of foreign military financing, contri- butions to peacekeeping operations and international military education and training. Title IV, or Multilateral Economic Assistance, helps to fund a wide variety of organisations that contribute to development \u2013 from the Asian Development Fund to the Inter-American Invest- ment Corporation. This money is complemented by direct contri- butions to international organisations and international peace- keeping activities, which are listed elsewhere in the budget. The European Union The European Union provides foreign aid both through member states and at the EU-level. This section describes foreign aid in the latter category, focussing on the activities of the European Com- mission. Within the European Commission, the external action budget covers spending on international activities, most of which can be considered foreign aid. Over the last few years, the EU has dedi- cated roughly \u20ac 5 billion per year towards external action activities ranging from food aid and support operations to financing Com- mon Foreign Security Policy (Table 29). The \u20ac 5 billion represents approximately 5 per cent of the EU\u2019s yearly budget. However, the External Action budget does not capture significant sums of development assistance distributed by other key agencies, such as EuropeAid, because the European Development Fund (EDF) is omitted. While the EDF is the main instrument for Community aid, it does not come under the general Community budget. It is funded by the member states, covered by unique financial rules, and managed by a specific committee. It is funded in five-year cycles, the most recent of which allocated \u20ac 1.3 billion for regional co-operation. Most categories in Table 29 are consistent with traditional def- initions of foreign aid \u2013 with the exceptions of CFSP and \u2018Other.\u2019 Overall, there are sixteen different external assistance pro- 85 135. Also known as the Bill Emer- son Humanitarian Trust, it is a re- serve of wheat, corn, rice, and sorghum that can be used to fulfil food aid commitments made by the US to developing nations. For example in December 2004, 200,000 metric tons of wheat was released from the reserve for Su- dan. CP82-text.qxp 03/10/2005 16:26 Page 85 ",

They cover programmes aiming to boost trade between the EU and other countries to those aiming to alle- viate poverty. 136 Most of the EU\u2019s aid is in the form of non- repayable grants. Each year the EU \u2018spends more than \u20ac 1bn in aid and \u20ac 2bn in soft loans.\u2019 137 Multiple entities are responsible for external aid in the EU. Among the principal actors are the directorates-general associated with humanitarian aid, development, enlargement, external rela- tions and trade. Within directorates, the principal Commission bodies handling foreign aid are EuropeAid and the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), which are partially funded by the EDF. 86 136.

        "a 1 EuropeAid, established in 2001, oversees EU external assis- tance globally. Its activities encompass the European Develop- ment Fund for the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific countries as well as fifty other budget headings. Over the last few years, over 150 countries, territories or organisations have benefited from aid managed by EuropeAid. Table 30 provides a regional breakdown of its nearly \u20ac 7 billion funding in 2004. It should be noted that EuropeAid funding does not con- tribute towards pre-accession aid programmes, humanitarian activities, macro-financial assistance, or the Common Foreign and Security Policy. ECHO is responsible for providing humanitarian aid. Situated within the Directorate General for humanitarian aid, it is tasked to provide \u2018assistance, relief and protection operations on a non- discriminatory basis to\u2026victims of natural disasters, man-made crises, such as wars and outbreaks of fighting\u2019 outside the Euro- pean Union. 138 Since its establishment in 1992, ECHO has financed and coordinated humanitarian operations in more than one hundred countries outside the EU. During 2004, 570 million was committed towards humanitarian operations. 139 ECHO receives funding from two principal sources: the Euro- pean Commission budget and the European Development Fund which has a provision for humanitarian and emergency aid. ECHO expenditures have hovered around the \u20ac 500 million figure 87 138. Article 1, Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96 of 20 June 1996 concerning humanitarian aid.

ECHO can also call upon an emergency aid reserve to request financial mobilisation in case of unexpected events \u2013 such as natu- ral disasters \u2013 requiring immediate resources. ECHO may cover the full cost of an operation or co-finance it with other international organisations, funding agencies or EU member states. Its assistance typically takes many forms includ- ing assistance to support medical teams, provision of medicines, and the purchase of targeted food aid. 88 Table 31: ECHO Expenditures 2000-2003 (in \u20ac millions) 2000 2001 2002 2003 Initial budget 471 473 442 442 Additional funds 18 50 80 145 Community budget 489 523 522 587 EDF 3 21 17 14 Total ECHO expenditures 492 544 539 601 Source: European Commission: www.europa.eu.int/comm/echo/ finances/budget_en.htm.

        "This Chaillot Paper examines burdensharing patterns bet- ween the United States and Europe, focusing in particular on the time period since the 9/11 attacks. It does so by ana- lysing military and civilian burdensharing activities under- taken to address the high-priority challenges identified in the 2002 US National Security Strategy (NSS) and the 2003 European Security Strategy (ESS). Among the principal categories considered are burdensharing activities to enhan- ce regional stability, to fight terrorism, to counter the proli- feration of weapons of mass destruction, and limit the potential for state failure. This paper should be of interest to a wide audience, espe- cially those interested in the evolution of US-European rela- tions in the security field. In particular, it should appeal to analysts and academics on both sides of the Atlantic moni- toring burdensharing patterns and the collaborative mea- sures taken to address present-day security challenges. published by the European Union Institute for Security Studies 43 avenue du Pr\u00e9sident Wilson F-75775 Paris cedex 16 phone: +33 (0)1 56 89 19 30 fax: +33 (0)1 56 89 19 31 e-mail: institute@iss-eu.org www.iss-eu.org \u20ac 10 cc 82-cover.qxp 03/10/2005 16:47 Page 4 "
