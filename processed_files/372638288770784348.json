        "Migrant integration Member States of the EU have traditionally been a destination for migrants, whether from elsewhere within the EU or from elsewhere in the world. The flow of migrants has led to a range of skills and talents introduced into local economies, while also generally increasing cultural diversity. The integration of migrants has increasingly become a key area for policy focus, with measures to help immigrants and their descendants to overcome various integration barriers so they may be more active participants in society. The Zaragoza declaration adopted in 2010 by the European Ministerial Conference on Integration identified a number of policy areas relevant to migrant integration and agreed on a set of common indicators for monitoring the situation of migrants and the outcome of integration policies. Four areas of integration have been currently identified as priority areas, building on national experiences and key for the common basic principles. Employment is a vital part of the integration process, and efforts in education are essential in helping immigrants to become successful and more active participants in society. Social inclusion is important not only for access to the labour market, but also for entry into society more generally. The participation of immigrants in the democratic process as active citizens supports their integration and enhances their sense of belonging. Apart from the Zaragoza indicators, Eurostat also publishes additional indicators on health and housing, as well as regional employment and indicators related to second-generation migrants. To respond to policy and the user needs, data analyses are performed by country of birth and by country of citizenship, based on data availability and reliability. The target population can then be divided into the following groups: By country of birth: \u2022 Native-born \u2022 Foreign-born, of which: \u0282 EU-born \u0282 Non-EU-born By country of citizenship: \u2022 Nationals \u2022 Foreign citizens, of which: \u0282 EU citizens \u0282 Non-EU citizens Emp As a vit measur \u2022 unemplo \u2022 emplo \u2022 activit \u2022 self-emplo \u2022 tempor \u2022 part-time emplo \u2022 long-t \u2022 newly emplo DID Y \u2022 EU citiz emplo the \u2022 The unemplo per \u2022 In the EU a tempor emplo Emplo level a (%) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 A t m o s t l o w e r Source: E ",
