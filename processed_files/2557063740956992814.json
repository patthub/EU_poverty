        "no 151 - may-june 1995 the Couder - Afrka-Caribbean-Pacrfie - European Union MEETING POINT Riccardo Petrella In conjunction with our Dossier on Social Development, we interviewed Riccardo Petrella who is the founder of the 'Lisbon Group'. Under his direction, the Group has just published 'Limits to Competitiveness', a hard-hitting analysis of the globalisation of the world economy. A Professor at the Catholic University of Louvain, Riccardo Petrella Is also head of the social research division at the European Commission. This is an Important role In an Influential institution, but it does not appear to limit our interviewee who spoke to us frankly and freely about the key social development issues. pages 2 to 5 COUNTRY RI\u00b7PORTS SURINAME During the 1980s, Suriname took a severe battering. A military coup at the beginning of the decade was followed by a steep decline In the country's economic fortunes. Large numbers of Surinamese emigrated in search of better prospects, taking their vital skills with them. The 1990s have seen a distinct improvement on the political front with the restoration of democracy to this multi-ethnic state on the northern coast of South America. However, despite a well-educated population and a natural resource base which most ACP countries would envy, Suriname still has serious economic problems. Structural adjustment has long been discussed but reaching agreement on what this should entail in practice has proved difficult. We report on the current state of play. Pages 18 to 42 DOSSIER Social Development The UN's recent Social Summit in Copenhagen, which focused on the fight against poverty, was the first of its kind to be held. But the declarations which emanated from the conference hall ended up dealing more with principles than with any concrete proposals to help people or countries In distress. Was it, therefore, a waste of time? Oddly enough, most Interested observers thought not. The Courier considers some of the views expressed at the Summit, assesses the results of the discussions and examines a number of aspects of the social development agenda in more detail.

It also saw the involvement of South Africa for the first time. The Festival 'fringe' Included the staging of the seventh International Market of African Television and Cinema (MICA), two colloquia \u2014 on the hundredth anniversary of cinema, and the participation of women on the African continent \u2014 and the opening of the African Film Library. At the end of an exciting week, Mallan producer Sheik Oumar Sissoko was declared winner of the FESPACO 'Grand Prix' for his film 'Guimba'.

        "Riccardo P e t r e l la Founder of the 'Lisbon Group' 'Politics has a b d i c a t ed in f a v o ur of p r i v a te e n t e r p r i s e' \u25a0 Can one say that the book 'Limits to Competitiveness', for which you were coordinating editor, is in tune with the recent Copenhagen Summit ? \u2014 I think that would be going too far. I don't really believe one can view the Copenhagen Summit, within the global institutional framework, as some\u00ad thing which calls into question the signific\u00ad ance of competitiveness. The document which was approved by the Heads of State, on the contrary, gives the impression that a competitive market economy should be developed as the most effective way of solving the problems of social develop\u00ad ment in the world. It regards the proper running of the market economy and of free trade as one of the instruments which 1 M.I.T. Press, Boston, 1995. Riccardo Petrella is a lecturer at the Catholic University of Louvain (Belgium), where he teaches 'Society, Scienceand Technology' in the Faculty ofEconomic and PoliticalScience. He also lectures at the College of Europe in Bruges, is Vice\u00adChancellor of the European University of the Environment and holds honorary doctorates from several universities and 'Ecoles Sup\u00e9rieures '. On top of all this, he heads the European Commission's Social Research Division. Three years ago he founded the 'Lisbon Group' whose 18 members are intellectuals and researchers in Europe, North America and Japan. Under his direction, the Group recently published a work in several languages entitled 'Limits to Competitiveness \u2014 Towards a New Social Contract 1 '. The Group's opinion on the internationalisation of trade is clear from this title. What is more complicated is the profusion of economic, political, historical and cultural references which the Group's researchers find to support their analysis and make it more accessible. Although Mr Petrella belongs to an institution (the Commission) which has a significant involvement in the world's political and economic choices, this has not prevented him from speaking freely to The Courier. In this interview, he seeks to communicate and interpret the social upheavals which have occurred in the wake of the economic globalisation that is taking place now that market forces dominate. It is a subject which is close to Riccardo Petrella's heart and he talks about it with warmth and passion. play a decisive role in creating world wealth and combating poverty, social exclusion and under\u00addevelopment. My impression, therefore, is that, in the wake of Copenhagen, we are still a long way from a strategy which might begin to question the relevance of the 'competi\u00ad tiveness' ideology. \u25a0 Nevertheless, some discussion did take place in Copenhagen in this area. There was even the threat of making capital flows subject to taxation as well as implied criticism of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. \u2014 It is a pity that taxation of capital movements remains just a threat and that no concrete decision was taken in this area. All the interest groups argue that these should be taxed, but the Summit document rejected this idea. From the outset, at the first preparatory meeting, the pressure groups and NGOs that took part demanded genuine, effective and concrete action \u2014 not just words. They called for intervention on a world scale to make it possible to direct and control movements of capital. At present, such movements are totally free. They are not subject to state control and their propriety is not questioned from a social or political standpoint. The interest groups tried to get an acknowledgement of this but it was rejected in the final document. The only Head of State who spoke about taxing the movement of capital, when he referred to the proposals made by Tobin, the winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, was the French President, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. But the document had already been approved by then. Nevertheless, President Mitter\u00ad rand tried to restart the debate. Given that this was his final appearance at a major world political summit, I think it is to his credit that he took this position. True, mention was made in the final document that the structural adjustment policies imposed by the IMF and the World Bank since the 1980s have sometimes given rise to social problems and have aggravated the social situation, and I suppose that is better than nothing. In the end, the document toned down the eulogistic self\u00ad ^ the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may\u00adjune 1995 ",
        "m e e t i ng p o i nt proclamation of excellence on the part of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in connection with structural adjustment policies. However, when the question arose of limiting what I regard as the considerable and pernicious influence of these two institutions, making them subject to some kind of international control \u2014 that is to say for their actions to be monitored by the UN and to conform, in particular, to the policies of the ILO, FAO and UNDP \u2014 this was not done. On the contrary, the total independence of the IMF and of the World Bank was reaffirmed and the only declaration made was that better forms of cooperation ought to be set up. What it boiled down to was an acknowledgement that there are still financial management institutions not subject to any political control by the United Nations. The statement simply served to reconfirm the absolute so\u00ad vereignty of the financiers. This attitude fits in both with national policies and those of European and other institutions, whereby banks should henceforth be regarded as completely independent of politics. It is even said that politics should have no real influence over central banks. The latter are independent and organise their own affairs. They pursue new policies only as a function of maintaining monetary stability, although it isn't even that really, in the absence of a single currency and given the instability of exchange rates. The central banks and world financial insti\u00ad tutions therefore organise themselves on the basis of maintaining the present system which clearly entails continuing inter\u00ad nationalisation of the world economy. No, to be perfectly frank, and with the greatest will in the world, I cannot see how the Copenhagen Summit can be said to have introduced strategies which are different from those of market economics. \u25a0 In your opinion, therefore, apart from good intentions, Copenhagen was merely a talk show; a lot of 'hot air' ? \u2014 It is a good thing that there was all this talk. It is worthwhile holding a high 'mass' like that because, in spite of everything, it does increase awareness and get things moving. Talk mobilises people. It also demonstrates that there are a huge number of interested parties and groups who argue with one another, make decisions and who can provide solutions. No, I would not throw the baby out with the bath water. I think these kind of events are very important, but it should not be said that they automatically make signific\u00ad ant advances possible \u2014 particularly if one examines them in any depth. The Summit again highlighted a general trend in cultural and conceptual thinking which I think is very dangerous : namely the view that social development is a matter for the individual. The English term for this is 'empowerment', a word which I heard used by virtually all the heads of state and government. Of the 130 world leaders who spoke, at least 100 of them referred to 'individual empowerment' or 'self\u00adem\u00ad powerment'. This is a very bad idea: to leave the solution to the individual and to see the task of the state and society as only that of 'empowering the people'. It may seem like sound ideology, but what it boils down to is seeing it as 'your' problem or 'my' problem \u2014 an issue for the individual, with no help from others to solve the actual social problem. From now on, we must not expect anything from the inter\u00ad national community. Each person must achieve self\u00adempowerment and become competitive at home in order to compete elsewhere. The nature of current European development policy urges us to help these people become competitive. I believe that culture and the sense of community have been totally forgotten. There was no reference to the empowerment of the community. Little by little, therefore, the role of the community \u2014 the state and society \u2014 is being diluted. That concept is being transformed. We are beginning to say that the state must be reduced and that salvation does not come from that direction. I am not advocating a dictatorial state, a centralised bureaucratic state or an anti\u00addemocratic state which is opposed to freedom, but a kind of state which, in French\u00adspeaking culture, would be called the 'republican' state, such as Germany, Sweden or the United States. I believe we must not lose sight of this concept of the state which is one of general interest and for the common good. \u25a0 So you think that the world leaders were effectively bidding farewell to the state ? \u2014 Yes, that is true. But it is a highly ambiguous and dangerous exercise to bid farewell to the state if it is not replaced by some other form of structure and other concepts of politics : if the route to salvation is left solely to the individual, through the idea of empowerment. Some forms of state are now dead and buried, but in their bereavement, the leaders of certain countries should not dismiss the idea of the state as a political community involving public governorship and even a certain type of world governorship. Nor must we get rid of all that was positive in the constitution of the nation\u00adstates, even if some aspects of them were very destruct\u00ad ive. The nation state has been highly centralising, rejected the reality of other cultures and other languages, and, at one time, generated fascist and totalitarian forms. However, it also established free schooling and welfare policy. On the other hand, one of the significant advances achieved at the Summit is to be found in the references to civic society. All the heads of state and government highlighted its role. If this is meant to replace the state, then it would be harmful. If, on the other hand, it expands it, promoting the achievement of a political community, and the idea of the general interest which is then expressed by the state in political and administrative terms, the emphasis put on civic society will, in historical terms, represent a step forward to which the Copenhagen Summit has contributed. \u25a0 The Lisbon Group talks about a world civic society but isn't that just part of the globalisation which is so often prejudicial to civic societies within states ? \u2014 Possibly. As far as we are concerned, the world civic society is a fact. It has been calculated that there are approximately 450 000 interest groups and non\u00adgovernmental organisations through\u00ad out the world. A very large proportion of these already have what I would call a 'globalist', planetary and internationalist outlook. They represent between 600 and 800 million members and supporters, with approximately 5 to 6 million leaders. Let me give you one specific example. Inter Wallonie Environnement is part of this world civic society in my opinion. It is connected with a number of other insti\u00ad the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may^une 1995 r ",
        "e e t i ng p o i nt tutions in other parts of the world that are concerned about the ecology. There are also associations which confine themselves to a national dimension, of course. For example the Federation for the Defence of the Finnish Language. One does not conflict with the other. \u25a0 In your study, you speak about ab\u00ad andonment of the weakest. Is this not also a ma tter for Third\u00ad World NGOs rather than their colleagues from the North ? Out of the 2000 NGOs which went to Copen\u00ad hagen, how many came from the South ? \u2014 I will talk later about the constraints of this world civic society, but I would like first to describe what it actually is. Currently it is regarded as worldwide because these 450 000 organisations are virtually the only ones to give expression to a world moral conscience. It is not the churches, be they Catholic, Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist or Shinto, who give expression to the world's moral conscience. It is all these associations who are fighting for what is good and just \u2014 friendship, respect for human rights, sharing, solidarity, love, kindness and human efficiency. If there is, in fact, a world moral conscience, it is these people who nowadays give expression to it. Fortunately, globalisation does not stop at the globalisation of capital. There is a whole series of organisations which have internalised and expressed this awareness, this planetary human condition, in explicit terms. As far as I am concerned, as an expression of the world moral conscience, this world civic society is, if you like, the visible manifestation of today's 'planetary' generation of which we are all a part. We are the first 'planetary' generation in history and this world civic society rep\u00ad resents the vanguard of the movement. The second raison d'\u00eatre of the global civic society is that it sees itself as the voice of world social demand. We all want a world which is more just and ecologically sus\u00ad tainable; one where there are no more wars and where disarmament is a fact, where people can travel freely, where there are no more refugees and where minorities are no longer slaughtered. Companies are not the ones who for\u00ad mulate this social demand. Nor are the military or the national bureaucracies. In addition, this world civic society is import\u00ad ant because, in certain respects, it is a vehicle for the expression of political demands. Examples might include the proposed ecotaxes and the monitoring and control of chemical dumps, demanded by the environmentalists. It could be the outlawing of certain types of trawling because we do not want to buy tuna if catching them has caused harm to dol\u00ad phins. The people are not just making demands or taking to the streets. It was they who pushed for the Rio Conference and for the Summit in Copenhagen. However, while we are in the process of achieving a certain level of organisation, the organisations that make up this world civic society do have weak\u00ad nesses. They are highly diversified and scattered whereas multinational com\u00ad panies are very well organised and very efficient. \u25a0 But would you not agree that they also suffer from a lack of ideology ? The world civic society seems to be afraid of ideo\u00ad logies in the wake of the overthrow of communism. \u2014 Yes, because it is currently too fragmented. For instance, there are de\u00ad velopmentalists and ecologists. In Rio there were no developmentalists and in Copen\u00ad hagen there were few ecologists. For\u00ad tunately, there were some though, and at least the preparatory documents did not talk of the ecology as if the subject had been exhausted in Rio. There is also fragmentation among the 'revo\u00ad lutionaries' and those who have 'sold out' to governments and to companies. There are many people of good will working in small organisations. But to compare these with other, much larger NGOs is like comparing Burkina Faso with Germany. Provided they organise and that some of their members, such as the trades unions, do not just drift along as is the case at the moment, the groups that make up civic society can become genuine negotiating partners of the private sector and exert a significant influence over the renaissance of politics in a world where politics has abdicated in favour of private enterprise. \u25a0 In practice, how can a politician rein in the ideology of competition ? \u2014 It is not my task to tell the politician what he should do to regain his position. I am a researcher and I observe. Obviously, an analyst is seen as a person who has values. There are those who, having done the same analysis as I have, see nothing wrong in political abdication. It would be best to ask the politicians how dignity can be restored to politics. \u25a0 How can the market be regulated to provide better social development for mankind ? In your book you stated that the means are well known, it is just that no one quite knows how to grasp the nettle. \u2014 At present, it is true, there is no place in the nature of globalised, privatised, deregulated, liberalised and competitive market economics for the general interest. There is only room for competitors and, in part, for big predators. How should politicians prevent the pre\u00ad dator acting with complete disregard for the rules? Well he must not liberalise everything. He must give new meaning to the development of market economics on a world scale and not leave the controls to the private sector. In principle, politicians do have the power : it is national parlia\u00ad ments which enact laws and, in theory, it is the state which defines the rules of the game, which does or does not deregulate and which does or does not privatise. If it were to be said that politicians were powerless, this would be an acknowledge\u00ad ment that politics are totally subservient to the private sector. That is absurd. The world is currently being transformed into an open space to be conquered. The imperative is to capture the telecommuni\u00ad cations market, or the grain markets or the car markets. In the future, we are told, there can only be four car manufacturers instead of seven, for example. Eight major telecommunications companies instead of 12. \u25a0 At times, it has been said that politics was warfare by other means, but isn't economics just politics by other means ? \u2014 I am aware of this expression, but it is incorrect. I am interested not in knowing how to wage war, whether I should use guns or conquer the market, but knowing how we will live together in 25 years, when there will be 8 billion people in the world. How can we organise all these people to allow them to meet their basic requirements and fundamental ^ the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may\u00adjune 199S ",
        "aspirations. What interests me is knowing how to organise an economy. What should the 'house' rules be ? The world economy sets out the rules of the world 'house' which are required to satisfy the needs of the members of our global family. We often hear the argument; 'if I don't conquer the market, someone else will'. In other words 'si vis pacem, para bellum'. I, myself, have never witnessed peace arising from a declaration of war. Sooner or later, a peace which is no more than an absence of war will lead to war. The prevailing view is that if you want to fulfil the needs of 8 billion souls, you must wage economic war. This might eliminate your rival and ex\u00ad terminate 100 000 people in the process because they are not competitive but it will allow you to say to people that you can supply water to them at the lowest price. But water is free \u2014 or at least it should be. \u25a0 Many people think that many heads of state and government attended the Cop\u00ad enhagen Summit because they fear the consequences of disparities of wealth in the world. You would draw attention to the fact that civilisations have disappeared owing to fear. Isn't that a very pessimistic view ? \u2014 On the contrary, it is very encouraging. The Lisbon. Group is saying that we have to build a society on a world scale whose objective is to pool the resources of science, technology, econ\u00ad omics, transport, telecommunications, and so on, in order to fulfil the basic aspirations of the eight billion. Otherwise, there is the fear that four billion deprived people will go for the throats of the other four billion. History demonstrates that all the civilis\u00ad ations that have survived, in the sense that they have overcome difficulties, are those which have taken a positive and construct\u00ad ive attitude towards mankind and which set themselves goals. Eliminating fatalities, cataclysms or threats were no more than means to achieving these goals. The essential thing was the goal. If you join forces with someone only because you are afraid of someone else, it will be difficult later to build together. It is necessary to have a sense of belonging to a community and of having a choice. No good can come out of mere obligation. \u25a0 Many decent people in the 'triad', as you describe the Europe I Japan/United States bloc, do indeed wish to share with countries in the South, but convince themselves that aid has hitherto been a total failure and now wonder why they should give aid to the poor. \u2014 You have put your finger on a major problem, there, because I do not think that the perpetuation of poverty or the exclusion of certain countries is due to the inefficiency of aid. True up to the early 1980s, aid was 'tied'. Remember that it was known as 'tied aid' ; that is to say that if I give you aid, you have to buy my produce, my machines, and to call my engineers in to build your motorways. That aspect must be taken into account. On the one hand aid was given out but on the other something was taken back in return. It is not purely by chance that by the second half of the 1980s, net financial transfers from the South to the North favoured the latter. You will remember that, in 1992, there was a net transfer of $50 billion from South to North. There was a whole series of mechanisms enabling the North to benefit from aid. It is true that the imbalances have not been entirely due to people in the developed countries. You also have to take account of certain groups in the developing countries \u2014 local pur\u00ad chasers, exploiters, dominant classes, clans, the military and, with a few exceptions, government officials, via whom all aid travels. Because of all of these, the so\u00ad called Southern countries therefore bear a great deal of responsibility for the failure of development policies because it is a well\u00ad known fact that most aid received is converted into arms or into prestige goods. I would conclude that those with the greatest wealth and those who have achieved the greatest level of develop\u00ad ment have to join forces with those who are least developed in order, together, to 'Civic Society... If this is meant to replace the state, it is harmful. If, on the other hand, it expands it..., the emphasis given to it will, in historical terms, represent a step forward to which the Summit has contributed' attempt to satisfy the needs of eight billion people. We have to admit our mistakes, try not to repeat past errors and reorganise the world. We cannot be content with just standing by and observing patients who are seen as terminally ill. That would be quite absurd. A country should never be regarded as terminally ill \u2014 there are always people who aspire to something. It is currently said that Africa is terminally ill but on what basis dare we say that Africa is a lost continent ? Just because you don't have purchasing power doesn't make you any less a man, woman or child. One cannot always believe that salvation or rationality lies only in market solvency. Free services are also important. Free education was set up in our countries and that is why we were able to develop, not because there was a 'viable' education market. We set up public health services, installed public transport, built roads, public gardens and forums, and it is all free. The citizen only has to pay taxes which are minuscule in proportion to the cost of these amenities. I am convinced that these are positive, formidable and enriching things. It is the market economy which makes some poli\u00ad ticians declare that there is no longer any poverty in Great Britain, that there are only people who do not respond to the system. That is cynicism of the most destructive kind. So it is not I who am pessimistic. It is the market economy which gives grounds for hope only to the strongest, and woe betide you if you are a loser. ^H Interview by H\u00e9gel Goutier the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 mayiune 1995 r ",
        "Southern Africa ' F r om c o n f r o n t a t i on to d i a l o g ue a nd p e a c e f ul d e v e l o p m e n t' This was the title of an international conference which the Friedrich Ebert Foundation organised in Bonn, from 8\u00ad10 March, to coincide with its 70th anniversary celebration. The Foundation, which was set up in 1925 in honour of the German President, Friedrich Ebert, has long been associated with the struggles in Southern Africa for freedom and justice. Its commitment to the political education of the underprivileged and to democracy explain its choice of subject for the meeting \u2014 a region where, in the eyes of many, a fragile peace has taken hold. Behind the conference's title lay a certain anxiety for that peace \u00ad and hope that the democratic processes underway in South Africa, Namibia, Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe could be consolidated and that economic develop\u00ad ment could begin unimpeded. The conference was well atten\u00ad ded, and at a very high level, by politicians, academics, trade unionists and journalists from across Southern Africa and the Federal Republic of Germany. Only the business sector was sadly absent. And female participation was badly affected by the Social Summit in Copenhagen where most of those invited preferred to go. Angola conflict In a week of heightened inter\u00ad national concern about the situation in Angola, following serious violations of the ceasefire and of the Lusaka accord, par\u00ad ticipants were pleased to see a panel convened, in which both sides in the conflict were represented (Unita's sec\u00ad retary of foreign affairs, Alcides Sakata Sim\u00f5es, and Angola's deputy minister of foreign affairs, Georges Chikot\u00ed), to discuss 'peace\u00admaking and reconciliation in Southern Africa'. Although not billed as a forum for negotiations, the conference was viewed as providing the protagonists with useful contacts. With them on the podium were people with first\u00adhand experience either with armed conflict or with the organis\u00ad ation of democratic elections after the cessation of hostilities : Afonso Dhlakama, president of Renamo, Teodata Hunguana, a high\u00adranking official of Frelimo and member of the newly elected parliament in Mozambique, Brazao Mazula, head of the Election Commission in Mozambique and (in the chair) Professor G. Toetemeyer, director of elections in Namibia. The combatants were given to understand by many speakers that the situation in Angola was not just the concern of Angolans, but also of Southern Africa, and indeed of the continent as a whole. The war is taking a tremendous toll in human lives and impeding the region's economic development. Mines have con\u00ad tinued to kill and maim and the economic infrastructure is relentlessly being laid waste. Although the history of the war is well known, and both Sakala and Chikoti sought to recapitulate on the efforts they had made in the search for peace, it became clear at a certain point in the discussion that the word 'democracy' meant something quite different to Unita and Renamo. Mr Sakala for, example, justified Unita's continuation of the war as the need to ensure respect for human rights, press freedom and democracy in Angola and, somewhat contradictorily, reiterated his organisation's 'acceptance of the results of the 1992 elections'. The war is continuing, he said, because of the 'intran\u00ad sigence' of the Angolan Government over the sharing of responsibilities. This was denied by Mr Chikoti who pointed out that Unita'a appointees to the portfolios re\u00ad served for the organisation by the Govern\u00ad ment were still welcome to take up their posts. Mr Dhlakama also appeared to nurse a grievance that, despite Renamo's conces\u00ad sions, Frelimo had refused to share power in Mozambique after the recent elections. The idea of a government of national unity, though not expressed, was at the back of the everyone's mind as he spoke. It was left to SADC's executive secretary, Dr Kaire Ubuende, to explain briefly to both men that in a democracy, there is a separation of powers between the legisla\u00ad ture and the executive. Although South Africa has a Government of National Union, it cannot be cited as a model, according to the Reverend Arnold Stofile (the ANC's treasurer and chief whip in the national assembly). South Africa, he said, operates a system which was the product of negoti\u00ad ations between the ANC and the white minority government before the April 1994 election \u2014 an election in which the ANC won an overwhelming majority and could govern alone. Although the system has so far proved to be a good thing for South Africa, it cannot, he argued, be 'transposed'. Beyond this debate on democ\u00ad racy, the general wish was to see Unita take a leaf from Renamo's book, and the audience was pleased to hear Mr Dhlakama speak (although somewhat tongue in cheek) of Mozambique's success\u00ad ful transition from war to peace as being based on 'the spirit of give and take and on patience'. While saying that it was not for him to advise Unita on the course of action it should take and regretting, at the same time, Frelimo's 'winner takes all' attitude, the Renamo president pointed out that at least democracy has brought respectability to his organisation (or political party). His participation in the conference was proof of that. The situation in Angola did not by any means dominate discussions. Ad\u00ad mittedly, it was invoked throughout the three\u00adday conference, being the only 'black spot' in any general or sectoral discussion about the future of Southern Africa. But the real issues at the seminar were whether, in those countries where political domination, oppression and war had given way to democratic elections, ^ the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may\u00adJune 1995 ",
        "a c \u03c1 realistic national reconciliation was possible and what would be the 'peace dividends'. Expectations Contrary to the generally held belief, national reconciliation in Southern Africa is not easy because of the complexity of the factors, the conference was told. Among these factors. Professor Toetemeyer pointed out, are the 'lack of compelling integrative forces', the risk of class or tribal monopoly of power and the problems of integrating former liberation forces into civil societies. There is still a danger of ethnic or racial considerations leading to civil strife. However, the priority concern at the moment should be how the majority of the people's expectations for qualitative improvements to their lives can be met and how the rule of law and democracy can be consolidated. A panel consisting of Toetemeyer, Dhlakama, Mazula, Stofile, Justice Mrs A. Msossa (chairperson of Malawi's Electoral Commis\u00ad sion and the only high\u00adranking woman from Southern Africa at the conference), EricSilwamba (Zambia's deputy minister of information) and Nghidimondjila Shoombe (deputy secretary to the minister of regional and local government in Namibia) were asked to examine these questions. There was a consensus that the people's expectations (or demands as many put it) are modest. They are no more than the right to the basic necessities of life \u2014 food and shelter. These expectations have to be met to avoid social explosion. And if, to achieve them, affirmative actions are necessary, then Governments are duty\u00ad bound to implement such policies. The electorate, the panel further agreed, expects transparency, accountability and representativeness (the issues of gender and group representation and minority rights having still to be fully addressed as is the developing resistance to the central\u00ad isation of authority). Regional development These expectations, however, cannot be met if economic growth is insufficient. The poor economic perform\u00ad ance of Southern African countries in recent years has been due in part to the disruptive and destructive policy pursued by the apartheid regime. The new South Africa, the conference was told, recognises the terrible price these countries have had to pay for their role in the fight against apartheid, and this more than anything, influences the policy of the South African Government. 'There is a sense of indebted\u00ad ness towards these countries', Professor Pieter Le Roux of the University of Western Cape, said. South Africa's emergence on the international scene has raised hopes that its economic strength will have a positive impact on economic growth in Southern Africa. The conference, not surprisingly, could not resist focusing at length on the Republic however much the organisers and the South'African representatives tried to expand the discussions. When regional issues were dealt with, they hovered around South Africa as the potential economic locomotive. Participants, however, recog\u00ad nised that the Republic is, at the moment, beset with problems. After many years of apartheid and economic subjugation of the black population, the government is facing an immense task meeting their expec\u00ad tations, however modest these are. There is not enough money in the kitty to implement the Reconstruction and De\u00ad velopment Programme (RDP) which is precisely aimed at 'righting the wrongs of apartheid', providing the black majority with basic necessities: food, health care and housing. South Africa, therefore, is expected in the short term to be more inward than outward looking. Despite the shortage of funds and the imperative nature of the RDP's social objectives, ANC treasurer Arnold Stofile said that the Government had pledged to adhere to 'sensible economic management'. Every available resource will be channelled to the RDP but the Government will resist the temptation to borrow from the IMF and the World Bank. Professor Le Roux praised this policy and urged the Government to rely on internal resources to avoid falling into the kind of debt trap in which many developing countries currently find them\u00ad selves. These debts, he said, resulted from World Bank and IMF willingness to lend to corrupt, unelected and unaccountable governments and, in his opinion, they should be cancelled. The World Bank and the IMF should bear the consequences of their own decisions, he felt. The professor was also sceptical about development aid which, he thought, induced dependency. The issues raised here were de\u00ad bated at length with several speakers from the floor disagreeing with Professor Le Roux. South Africa, they contended, re\u00ad quired enormous amounts of foreign capital and development aid to achieve its objectives. This view also emerged clearly during a panel discussion on South Africa's relationship with the European Union, which was chaired by Dieter Frisch, former Director\u00adGeneral for Development at the European Commission. South Africa, the conference was told, already has an aid budget from the Union which is substan\u00ad tially higher than that of a large number of ACP States. This aid, which was previously implemented through non\u00adgovernmental organisations and which had a consider\u00ad able social impact on the black population during the apartheid years, has now been placed at the disposal of the South African Government. Although minister of trade and industry Trevor Manuel referred briefly to this assistance in his intervention, he was more concerned about trade concessions from the European Union and South Africa's request for alignment with the Lom\u00e9 Convention. These were necessary not only because of South Africa's mem\u00ad bership of the various regional organis\u00ad ations to which ACP Southern African countries belonged, but also to prevent the concentration of industries in the Republic to their detriment Most speakers thought that the case for foreign injections of capital and development aid to the South African economy was overwhelming. South Af\u00ad rican journalist Alistair Sparks, who chaired the panel discussion on the RDP and regional cooperation, accepted this, but said 'there has to be a sense of caution.' He was supported by another speaker who pointed out that South Africa could avoid borrowing heavily by taking measures to repatriate all the indigenous capital that had fled the country during apartheid. the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may\u00adjune 1995 r ",
        "a c \u03c1 The apartheid years, when South Africa had abundant resources, were described by Professor Le Roux as a wasted opportunity. 'Instead of investing in peo\u00ad ple', he argued, 'the Government squan\u00ad dered the resources in defending a system which was based on division.' He pointed out, however, that successful implemen\u00ad tation of the RDP in South Africa could provoke a wave of immigration on a scale never before witnessed and that this could wipe out all the gains made within a short time. With a population currently es\u00ad timated at 41 million, which is likely to rise to 70m by 2020, South Africa cannot afford to be an island of prosperity in a sea of misery. This is why it must develop in tandem with the other countries in the region. This concept of interdependence and common economic destiny was a constant theme throughout the discus\u00ad sions. It was in this context that Mr Manuel spoke of South Africa's wish for alignment with the Lom\u00e9 Convention. As to the fear of South Africa's domination, only out\u00ad siders expressed it, according to Bot\u00ad swana's vice\u00adpresident, Festus Mogae. 'South Africa will play a big role just as the United States plays a big role in the world economy', he said. Everybody will not benefit to the same tune. There will be competition. 'The most important con\u00ad sideration', he explained, 'is that a country inside the region is better at something than one outside of it.' Mr Sparks believes that the best way forward in regional development cooperation should be on the basis of specialisation and complementarity. South Africa's role in this regard will be crucial. It has the industrial base, not only for regional reconstruction, but also for long term economic development. It could provide capital and agricultural machinery and inputs to other countries in the region. And one area where cooperation is ob\u00ad viously needed is agriculture. Mr Sparks pointed out that South Africa's soil is not very suitable for farming whereas the belt running from Angola to Zambia is ideally suited for it. This belt could easily become the breadbasket of Southern Africa. Some participants found the number of regional organisations in Southern Africa disturbing. They felt there was a proliferation which could result in increased bureaucracy and waste of pre\u00ad cious resources. Mr Stofile disagreed. Organisations such as SADC, the PTA and SACU, he explained, represent different levels of integration and they function efficiently. Regional integration in Southern Africa has to be evolutionary, Mr Mogae added. It would be foolish, for instance, to include countries with inter\u00ad minable political problems like Burundi and Rwanda in a Southern African set\u00adup. Industrial relations Neither South Africa nor the region as a whole will succeed economi\u00ad cally without industrial peace. A big question at the conference was whether the trade unions, whose role has been critical in bringing about political change, would also move away from confrontation and opposition towards cooperation, as they seek the fulfilment of the people's expectation for an improvement in their standards of living. South African trade unions have a difficult choice to make. The country already has wages that are comparable with, if not higher than those of many newly\u00adindustrialised countries in East Asia. The point was made by several speakers that the Republic risks becoming uncompe\u00ad titive because of this and might even lose some of its industries to neighbouring countries. To discuss this and other related issues, the Foundation brought two pow\u00ad erful regional trade union leaders to the conference : John Gomomo, President of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and Fackson Shamenda, President of the Zambian Confederation of Trade Unions (Zatu). They were joined in a panel by Dr Lloyd Michael Sachikonye of the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Zimbabwe, Steven Friedman of the Centre for Policy Studies in South Africa and Dr Albert Schunck of the German Metalworkers Union. The union leaders were quick to make the point that, although their organisations had been in the forefront of the struggle for freedom and democracy, the battle for social justice was far from being waged let alone won. Mr Gomomo spoke of the vast inequalities created by apartheid in South Africa which need redressing, the continuing resistance to change by large sections of the security forces and big business, and the large\u00adscale privatisation and trade liberalisation which, he said, were destroying jobs. Although Cosatu will not engage in 'mindless militancy', the interests of their members will remain the unions' para\u00ad mount consideration. Mr Shamanda, for his part, em\u00ad phasised the need for the entrenchment of democratic institutions which would guar\u00ad antee a conducive environment for free bargaining. 'There is room for cooperation' he said, 'but the initiative must also come from the other side of the table'. If sacrifices were needed in the interests of business or of the country's economy, those sacrifices have to be made by everyone \u2014 workers, ministers and busi\u00ad nesspeople alike. As to companies ab\u00ad andoning South Africa for neighbouring countries because of high wages, he warned that such companies will quickly find 'the same devil waiting for them' in their new locations. There would be close cooperation between trade unions in Southern Africa. The absence of business voices at the conference was widely regretted, for it is generally accepted that tripartite dia\u00ad logue involving the government, the trade unions and private enterprise is a sine qua non for industrial peace in the region. This, however, is unlikely to be achieved in many countries, according to Mr Friedman, first and foremost because a large section of the workforce is outside the organised labour market and employers themselves are not organised. In South Africa, tripar\u00ad tite bargaining can work because the unions are strong and are more es\u00ad tablished. Unfortunately, while employers accept the principle of the redistribution of income, he said, they do not have the 'mindset for negotiations with the unions'. Mr Friedman's pessimistic assessment was that he could see nothing ahead but conflict in industrial relations in South Africa. ^M Augustin Oyowe ^ the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may\u00adfune 1995 ",
        "King Baudouin Prize awarded to TASO Tackling Aids as a d e v e l o p m e nt issue TASO, the Aids Support Organis\u00ad ' ation of Uganda, has recently been awarded the bi\u00adannual King I Baudouin International Develop\u00ad I ment Prize. The award was pre\u00ad sented to TASO Director, Noerine I Kaleeba by King Albert II of the I Belgians, at a ceremony in Brussels | on 22 March. In its statement \u00ee explaining why TASO had been \u00a1 chosen from the 190 nominations j received, the King Baudouin Found\u00ad ation said that the organisation was 'an example of solidarity, and has been a driving force in the work of Aids prevention and in assisting Aids sufferers and their families in Uganda and throughout Africa. TASO,' it continued, 'is now internationally recog\u00ad nised as the leading African reference point for Aids assistance.' Uganda has been particularly badly hit by Aids. The country's first victim was diagnosed in 1982 and it is estimated that to date, 1.5 million Ugandans have been infected by the virus. The support organisation was established in 1986\u00ad87 by a small group of Aids sufferers who came together at a time when those who had contracted the disease were still effectively being ostracised from society. Mrs Kaleeba's husband Chris was himself a victim of Aids, and after his death in 1987, she and fifteen others went on to establish TASO. Twelve of the original co\u00adfounders have since succumbed to the disease. Although all the founder mem\u00ad bers were committed Christians, it was decided from the outset that the organis\u00ad ation must be a non\u00adreligious, non\u00adpolitical organisation. 'We wanted TASO to be open to all', said Mrs Kaleeba. The or\u00ad ganisation's relationship with the Ugandan government was also clearly defined right from the beginning. TASO is a non\u00ad governmental organisation whose aim is to develop a constructive relationship with the authorities without coming to depend entirely upon them for finance. 'We were fortunate', Mrs Kaleeba maintained, 'in that the Ugandan government very quickly recognised how serious the AIDS problem was in the country. Their national Aids programme is headed by capable and motivated people, who help us.' Today, TASO provides counsel\u00ad ling for some 25 000 'clients' in seven assistance centres, each of which is linked to a hospital. These centres are based in Kampala/Mulago, Masaka, Mbarara, Rororo, Jinja, Mbale and Entebbe. The organisation's work is carried out by a staff of 250 operating on a annual budget of $2 million. A special feature of TASO's ac\u00ad tivities is the fact that it couples medical care with psychological and social assist\u00ad ance. More than just an Aids support organisation The organisation's work is not limited to helping Aids sufferers. It also extends support to family members and indeed, to anyone who approaches it for help. In September 1990, it launched a programme of direct assistance to village communities. The focus is on obtaining cooperation from village committees who are given help by 'TASO trainers'. With this assistance, the villagers then decide for themselves on initiatives which meet their particular needs. Only communities that are prepared to accept responsibility for themselves are eligible for help from the organisation. There are certain elements that are common to every initiative, however. For example, TASO always de\u00ad votes a lot of attention to familiarising people with Aids prevention measures. The organisation is working on ways to change attitudes so that villagers are persuaded not to exclude sick and infected individuals from their midst. Communities are this encouraged to Noerine Kaleeba, founder member and current Director of TASO. She received the prize on behalf of the organisation from King Albert II at a recent ceremony in Brussels become closely involved in patient care as well as in identifying sufferers. Another important part of TASO's work is in helping to improve the economic conditions in which its members live. In concrete terms, this means launch\u00ad ing initiatives which generate local income. For example, TASO has provided a loan to a poultry farm and has also given loans for the cultivation of maize and groundnuts. The impact of the work done by the organisation clearly goes beyond the provision of care and assistance for Aids patients. This was one of the key aspects stressed by the Chairman of the Prize's selection committee, Professor M. Lechat, when he explained why the Foundation had chosen to award an international development prize to an Aids support organisation. TASO rarely refers to Aids 'vic\u00ad tims' or Aids 'sufferers', preferring to use the term 'clients'. Words such as 'disaster', 'plague' and 'epidemic' are also avoided. The organisation is similarly averse to campaigns with slogans such as 'I say NO to Aids' or 'This person will die of Aids', arguing that it is obvious that nobody has ever said 'yes' to Aids. It is also obvious to the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may^une 1995 r ",
        "a c \u03c1 TASO that people who have contracted the virus or are suffering from the actual disease can still live highly worthwhile lives. As one of the organisation's workers observes, 'sooner or later we're all going to die. Why should we single out a specific group of people and make out that its their own fault. It doesn't matter whose fault it was. What matters is that we continue to think and live positively.' Clients must be ready to give as well as receive Clients of the organisation must be prepared not just to receive help but Children at Old Mulago Hospital Kampala, one of the biggest TASO centres in Uganda also to work positively, becoming involved in the work of prevention, or even learning to become counsellors or trainers themsel\u00ad ves. And they are given a say in the organisation's most important decisions. When the World Health Organisation asked for TASO's help in testing a new drug, the clients were asked for their views first. They agreed that TASO should participate in the experimental prog\u00ad ramme provided the drug would sub\u00ad sequently be made available to all Ugan\u00ad dans should it prove effective against Aids. Similarly, when the organisation was considering ending the practice of giving free meals to people at consultation sessions \u2014 on the grounds that this made them into passive recipients of assistance \u2014 the proposal was presented to the members themselves. After several months of debate, a consensus was reached that this practice should no longer be auto\u00ad matic. The key figure in Taso's work is the counsellor. This man or woman gathers information from the local community about the medical, social and financial status of the patient and his or her family. A dossier is then compiled on each in\u00ad dividual, thereby enabling the provision of personalised assistance. The counsellor is also ideally placed to act as a link with the local community, which can discuss all its problems with him or her. The topics discussed can cover a wide range of subjects, from emotional problems to education, moral, religious and legal mat\u00ad ters. It is clear from the above that TASO fulfils a genuine role in the com\u00ad munity. Aids is the point of departure that allows all those involved to join together to think about their living conditions and how to improve them. TASO thus confronts wider development problems, while work\u00ad ing to foster a fundamental change in people's attitudes. From a modest initia\u00ad tive, launched by a handful of people, it now offers a model which is admired and imitated both within Uganda and beyond. When asked at a press con\u00ad ference prior to the award ceremony what impact the King Baudouin Prize would have on TASO, Mrs Kaleeba emphasised the morale boost it would give to all those involved. 'It is important to feel good in your work', she maintained. The financial boost was also extremely welcome, of course, and Mrs Kaleeba indicated that the award money of BF 4 million (approx ECU 100 000) would be used to extend TASO's work in the more remote villages of Uganda. \u25a0\u25a0 eds.H. \"I the Courier n\" 151 \u00b7 may\u00adjune 1995 ",
        "G r a in m a r k et l i b e r a l i s a t i on a nd t he small scale p r o d u c er in sub-Saharan A f r i ca by Peter Tyler* I A feature of structural adjustment I policies in sub-Saharan Africa is I liberalisation of the grain market. The overall benefits anticipated at I the macro-economic level are tend- I ing to overshadow immediate prac- I tical difficulties facing many small- I scale grain producers who no I longer find an assured market at I harvest for surplus grain. Recog nition and alleviation of the problems associated with the transition to a free market is vital if the process is to succeed. Specifically, this means addressing rural marketing and storage issues. For several decades, the grain trade in sub-Saharan Africa has been dominated by grain marketing parastatals. Their objectives often included price stabil isation, pricing policies designed to raise cash to finance industrialisation targets and welfare goals including the provision of cheap staple food for urban consumers. Furthermore, policy-makers believed that strategic and household food security would be better served in areas of un predictable production by maintaining government control of prices. Traditional methods of grain storage and marketing were either lost or became subsumed into parallel systems supplying both national and regional markets. High yielding varieties of maize were promoted as a cash crop using subsidised inputs, even in areas where production was marginally profitable or quite uneconomic. Local grain purchasing depots were provided in remote areas * The author works for the Natural Resources Institute (NRI), Central Avenue, Chatham Maritime, Kent ME4 4TB, UK. The British Government supports research by the NRI into food security and related issues. A comprehensive series of reports, including the proceedings of the workshop referred to in the article, is available on application to NRI at the above address. leading to high distribution costs. Pan- seasonal pricing encouraged marketing in the period immediately after harvest and central storage capacity increased. Re search into methods of storing grains at the producer level was not considered of economic or strategic importance and was given low priority. Nevertheless, evalu ation of the effects of recent droughts has shown that the tradition of holding a proportion of the grain harvest on-farm for household food security is not lost; it remains a valid and desirable objective. Liberalisation of grain markets arose in response to the unsustainable costs of public sector marketing. The main elements that affect grain marketing are : \u2014 removal of pan-seasonal and pan- territorial pricing and removal of taxes on imports for key commodities; \u2014 anti-inflation policies, including high interest rates and limits on government borrowing; \u2014 exchange rate policies designed to correct over-valuation ; \u2014 a reduced and more clearly defined role for grain marketing parastatals ; and \u2014 allowing the private sector to operate unimpeded. West Africa has a long tradition of free markets systems. In Ghana, for example, the profusion of small operators involved with procurement, transport and marketing of grains and other food crops is impressive. To some extent, Tanzania has led the field in East and Southern Africa as a rapid reformer, and it now has a vigorous private grain trading sector. Zimbabwe and Malawi are implementing a slower, structural approach with the governments retaining a significant marketing function. In contrast, Zambia has moved quickly to remove controls but the private sector has been unable to cope with the opportu nities created due to a shortage of trading capital. South Africa and the neighbouring economically-dependent states have yet to liberalise fully, although in all countries there is abundant evidence that the free trading process has started and is gaining momentum. Problems facing the small-scale producer Recent appraisal of the liberalis ation process by the Natural Resources Institute in six countries (Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe) has enabled a comparison to be made and general conclusions to be drawn. The key findings have been that : \u2014 grain market liberalisation is leading to a reduction in the physical size of the grain stocks bought and held by the parastatals and a decline in their role as providers of food security; \u2014 the private sector is emerging to participate in the grain trade but presently seeks a quick turnover rather than engag ing in inter-seasonal storage ; \u2014 the producer now often has an en forced responsibility for storage, keeping more grain for longer, and therefore assumes a much higher risk of incurring losses than was the case previously. Examination of the problems faced by the small-scale producer with surplus maize to offer has revealed several significant changes. In the past, it made good sense not to store maize, but to sell it immediately at the time of harvest at the fixed prices, buying it back later in the lean season (often at subsidised rates). Many years experience with guaranteed prices and a guaranteed outlet has not prepared producers for free market trading. Surprisingly, the liberalisation of grain markets reveals a certain naivety amongst the small-scale farming com- the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may-june 1995 r ",
        "a c \u03c1 munity, unfamiliar with the competitive elements of price negotiation. Some reori\u00ad entation, to educate farmers in commercial marketing practices, and to instil confi\u00ad dence, is therefore a priority. There is fear of inflation and a conservatism that opposes the new and unproven. In many areas, this is also tempered by an appreci\u00ad ation that the preferred type of maize for home consumption can be stored without significant loss for many months. In con\u00ad trast, improved high yield varieties grown as \u00e0 cash crop are more susceptible to loss by insects during storage on the farm. Consequently, they are not considered suitable for home storage and so even the possibility of holding on to stocks of hybrid maize for several months, until a more satisfactory price can be expected, is viewed with disbelief. On the positive side, the rapid growth in small village hammer mills is impressive. Some maize that previously left the production areas for commercial mil\u00ad ling is now stored and milled locally as required. Small mills have also proliferated in urban areas where they operate in direct competition with, and to the detriment of, the commercial roller mills. Technical options There are a number of options that can be followed to support small\u00adscale producers and help them to take ad\u00ad vantage of the opportunities for adding value to their production. Advice is needed on how, where and when to sell. Seem\u00ad ingly simple problems such as obtaining a grain bag or arranging transport to a market prove very difficult to resolve when cash is required in advance and the producer has none. For many rural producers, sale may not be possible or desirable im\u00ad mediately after harvest, and some addi\u00ad tional provision for storage will be needed. The options for this are extending the capacity of traditional storage, or finding temporary storage, often inside the house. Use of either method for more than a few months will require treatment of the grain with insecticide. Safe and effective pesti\u00ad cides must be available locally. The concept of communal or village buildings used as a means of providing good storage is sometimes proposed as an option. Unfortunately, management procedures for pooling grain or retaining ownership in a shared store rarely work well. One serious consideration for the small\u00adscale maize producer located far from market outlets is to replace maize with an alternative cash crop, perhaps of higher value and lower bulk. Where there remains strong demand for maize, a longer term option is the adoption of a variety which combines some of the high\u00adyielding advantages with improved storage charac\u00ad teristics. Government actions Part of the enabling process requires clear and implementable produc\u00ad tion, storage and marketing guidelines for producers. These should include deline\u00ad ation of the geographical areas from where it is clearly uneconomic to market maize, or marketing is impracticable dueto lack of all\u00adweather roads. Alternative crops to grow should be suggested. For those wishing to increase their storage of maize, advice on appropriate technologies should be available and access to inputs ensured. A review of the capability of the agricultural extension services is important and a post\u00adharvest training and extension initiative will be required. Technical issues such as the evaluation of storage methods, assuring grain quality and evaluation of alternative maize varieties and other cash crops will require adaptive research. There are several ways in which donors can support the process of liberalis\u00ad ation. Governments have to accept that the required policy is one focused on encouraging the successful entrepreneur and that donor assistance must be ap\u00ad propriate to the needs expressed. Where storage infrastructure is requested, cost\u00ad effectiveness and management capability must be evaluated before any commit\u00ad ment is made. Too many grain stores, constructed in accordance with previous sector policies, are empty because they are inappropriate or not financially viable.

There is much to learn about the liberalisation process, its ramifications, successes and failures. The process is dynamic but the methodology is incom\u00ad plete. A workshop held in Harare in October 1994 brought together key players from 12 countries to discuss prog\u00ad ress towards liberalisation of the grain markets of the region. The participants agreed unanimously to establish and maintain collaborative links through SADC to ensure that producers, entrepreneurs and consumers are all able to benefit from grain market reform. \u25a0\u25a0 P.T. ^ the Courier n\" 151 \u00b7 may\u00adjune 1995 ",
        "Days of r e m e m b r a n ce f or R w a n da On 6 April 1994 in Kigali, two I missiles fired by unidentified at\u00ad p t\u00e4ckers brought down a jet whose I passengers included the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi. This attack was the signal f or the unleashing of a wave of genocide and a series of I political assassinations with excep\u00ad ; tionally far\u00adreaching consequences : I the killing of approximately one million people, essentially civilians I and mostly Tutsis but also Hutu opponents, and hundreds of in\u00ad : nocent people of other national\u00ad I ities, including Belgians. The Rwan\u00ad dan people, together with all man\u00ad kind, was deeply affected by what hap\u00ad pened in the spring of 1994 which will forever remain engraved on their memories. One year later, leaders of Rwan\u00ad dan, Rwandan/Belgian and European as\u00ad sociations decided to mark the first anniv\u00ad ersary of the genocide committed in Rwanda by organising a series of activities. For three days, therefore, from 7 to 9 April 1995, there were events in various places in Brussels, all of which were characterised by the theme of 'IBUKA', or remembrance ('Ibuka' means 'remember' in Kinyar\u00ad wanda). The organisers of the Memorial Days had from the beginning to exclude any input of a political nature which might lead to polemics. The aim was quite different, since it was intended for this commemorative act to be above all an expression of remembrance and contemp\u00ad lation against a background of discretion and correctness imposed by respect for the victims and their families. Meditation also had a place in these events, hence the organisation at the Secretariat General of the ACP Countries (there could be no more judicious a choice) of some half dozen workshops devoted particularly to analys\u00ad ing the mechanisms behind the tragedy and ways of overcoming the consequences in the context of a new Rwanda. In addition to an exhibition of photographs and the showing of videos of the chilling images of the genocide, there was also a cultural and artistic dimension since, in the Country of a Thousand Hills, culture has always been invoked as a potential factor in national unity, capable of playing a decisive role in reconciliation and perhaps even solidarity between ethnic groups. The tone and general spirit of this Memorial Day were set at the outset, on 7 April at the Botanical Centre, at a night vigil which was both sombre and dignified, despite the emotion visible on people's faces. This took place in the purest African community tradition, and it involved a rite representing a kind of mystic link between the living and the dead : at the entrance to the Botanic Centre, a white cloth (rep\u00ad resenting a shroud) had printed on it a map of Rwanda and those attending the ceremonies placed a handful of earth or a spray of flowers on it. This symbolic gesture was also intended as a link with the state funerals organised in Kigali at the same time. Memories of genocide: eye\u00adwitness accounts This evening event, organised on the same day at the Palais des Beaux\u00adArts and attended by a thousand or so people, made up of Rwandan community rep\u00ad resentatives and all those who wanted to bear witness to the suffering of the victims of the Rwandan tragedy, was undoubtedly the most emotional part of the com\u00ad memorative events. Gasana Ndoba from the CRDDR (Committee for the Respect of Human Rights and Democracy in Rwanda) who was the organiser of the Ibuka Days, and Pierre Galand from the CNCD (National Development Cooperation Centre) began by clarifying the structure and significance of the gathering : 'This evening', said Mr Ndoba, 'it is above all the thoughts of the victims which haunt us at this unusual commemoration... This is the first time we have shaken off the yoke of solitude so as to share our grief solemnly with others ; only today, surrounded by all our friends throughout the world and in harmony with all the families affected by this tragedy in Rwanda, are we able to attempt to speak the unspeakable, to join hands, to support each other and to allow our hearts to speak for us...' He then handed over to those who had physically experienced the tragedy and who have been able to overcome the horror of remembering in order to attempt to utter the unutterable and, with exemplary courage, give an account to the world. Who, that evening, was not deeply moved after listening to the words of Mathilde. This young Rwandan, having witnessed the murder of her entire family, was buried alive with them on 18 May 1994 in Kigali. On the brink of death, she was saved by the intervention of a neighbour. As for Jean Baptiste, a former school teacher who also survived the massacres, his emotional account had the advantage of giving concrete expression to the experience of ethnic discrimination, humiliation and marginalisation suffered by members of the Tutsi minority over the last 30 years. However, the commemorat\u00ad ive events were not intended only for the victims of the 1994 Rwandan tragedy to speak out. In fact, in solidarity with them were representatives from the Armenian and Jewish communities that have also suffered genocide in the past \u2014 acts which have marked the history of the 20th century. They attended as fellow wit\u00ad nesses, demonstrating the universal nature of the challenge summed up in the phrase 'Never again'. The evening of remembrance was followed by a torch\u00adlight procession in the same serene and tranquil mould, without politicking, from the Palais des Beaux\u00adArts to the Palais de Justice. This was reminiscent of the marches towards death which preceded the massacres and underlined the fact that justice must be done. Meditation workshops The Days of Remembrance for Rwanda were, as mentioned, an occasion for meditation, within the context of workshops, on subjects such as 'The reconstruction of Rwanda : the role and responsibility of the NGOs', 'Intellectuals and the Media', 'Post\u00adgenocidal trauma', 'Justice', etc. The 'Intellectuals and the Media' workshop was the occasion for a discussion involving journalists representing the Bel\u00ad gian, European and African press on the the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 mayjune 1995 I\" ",
        "a c \u03c1 one hand and specialists from Belgian, European, Rwandan and African academic circles on the other. This workshop gene\u00ad rated both critical and forward\u00adlooking opinions. Particular topics for discussion were the state of isolation of the Rwandan press, the 'exclusion' of African intel\u00ad lectuals in TV debates concentrating on Africa, inter\u00aduniversity cooperation and the need to set up exchange structures which could contribute to the establish\u00ad ment of research centres in ACP countries. Why does the European media virtually always call on researchers and specialists in the wake of catastrophes and not beforehand, at a time when their preventive role could have been of use? What have the sociologists been doing and where are the books describing the history of Rwanda over the last 30 years ? How can we bridge the gulf which exists between the information received and the ability to react to it positively?... This type of question cropped up again and again in the debates and prompted the participants to make recommendations aimed at defining and rigorously applying a code of ethics and duty relating to the profession of journalist. In this field as in others, EU/ACP cooperation could certainly make a contri\u00ad bution. What can the 'shrinks' do to help the survivors of the Rwandan tragedy? This was essentially the question which fired debate at the 'Post\u00adgenocidal trauma' workshop. In the face of the scale of the disaster (in psychological and psychiatric terms) after the genocide and given that the survivors had mostly been isolated from their individual communities (the torturer had broken into the psyche of the tortured), any therapeutic approach has to attempt to relocate the patient, that is to say the survivor, back in the dynamic current of his forebears and descendants in order to restore 'self\u00ad esteem'. Moreover, those involved (mental\u00adhealth professionals, including two psychiatrists, a psychologist and a nurse) emphasised the need to set up the appropriate therapeutic techniques within the framework of the aid given to the survivors. These techniques should take into account the underlying cultural fabric of Rwanda including traditional methods of treatment which have proved their worth throughout Africa. A notable ex\u00ad ample comes from Senegal, where story\u00ad telling and narrative techniques, sup\u00ad ported by tom\u00adtoms, song and dance, enable the individual to rejoin his group, the aim being to set 'thoughts' in motion and to permit free discussion. At this stage, 'group resources are of paramount importance given the burden of trauma and grief'. The particip\u00ad ants unanimously acknowledged the im\u00ad portance of ongoing discussion groups as a therapeutic means enabling the survivor to recover and to resume his place with respect to the other members of the community. They also drew attention to the danger of doing 'anything rather than nothing' just because this is an emergency (thought here turns to some NGOs which are involved in Rwanda) without taking into account the fundamental rules of respect for human dignity, intrinsic human values and cultural and social organisation. It was possible for a relevant and effective exchange of views to take place, with the audience made up, inter alia, of social communicators and mental\u00adhealth professionals, most of whom had recent experience of work in Rwanda or who had been personally affected by the tragedy. Finally, the professionals meeting at the workshop paid tribute to the organisers of the Days of Remembrance for their initia\u00ad tives which were in themselves very therapeutic. They went on to call for the organisation in the near future of a colloquium devoted to the huge subject of the traumatic after\u00adeffects of the ge\u00ad nocide. This call was echoed by many of the participants of the other workshops when the whole group subsequently assembled in plenary to present their conclusions. This final session was attended by Berhane Ghebray, Secretary General of the ACP Group. The evening of artistic events on 8 April made it possible, by means of the sombre but moving performances of a group of Rwandan artists working in Brussels (Amarabe, Cecile Kayirebwa, Imena, Imitali, Isamaza...), to appreciate the progressive inroads of the memory of the genocide into the content and form of contemporary Rwandan art. Appropriate songs and poems punctuated this cultural evening which gave young Rwandan art students, who had not had the oppor\u00ad tunity to become acquainted with their country, the chance to pass on a message of hope to the audience; hope for a rehabilitated and united Rwanda. This message of hope and peace, which could be attributed to Rwandan youth everywhere, was shared by the Rwandan Ambassador, Mr P\u00f6lisi, who also marked the date of 9 April symbolically in a moment of contemplation organised at the Embassy as a closing ceremony for the Memorial Days. The lessons of IBUKA \u2014 An appeal to countries both North and South In addition to the commemor\u00ad ation and what turned out to be a form of collective catharsis, it may be argued that the Days of Remembrance for Rwanda have sown seeds for the future. Whether they germinate and grow, however, will depend on both the Rwandans themselves and the international community. This is true particularly of the demand for justice that was implicit, but nonetheless clear, in every eye\u00adwitness account that was heard. Clearly, the genocide and massacres in Rwanda are a challenge whose scale is of concern to all mankind. The fate of future generations will depend largely on the ability of countries in the South and the North effectively to prevent further human catastrophes on this scale. This challenge obviously requires both sides to listen to and acknowledge each other, this being the only way they will be able to understand the aspirations and deep\u00ad seated concerns of our respective peoples. There must also be active EU/ACP solidarity which is capable of being sustained during a crisis. This presupposes commitment, and concrete acts of sympathy and courage on all sides whenever the integrity or dignity of any population, individual or group is directly under threat. This is perhaps the most important lesson to be learnt from these Days of Remembrance for Rwanda. \u25a0\u25a0 Massamba Mboup * Trainee with DG VIII (Development). ^ the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may\u00adjune 1995 ",
        "Devaluation one year on Assessment of a nd f o l l o w \u00ad up to m e d i c i n es policy in t he CFA a r ea | In Abidjan, in March 1994, the I Health Ministers of the 14 countries i making up the franc area adopted a I new medicines policy to counteract 1 the worrying effects of the devalu\u00ad I ation of the CFA franc. One year I later, the ministers met again in I Brussels to discuss the initial results and to examine how they should follow up the measures implemented. The scene is the Borschette Centre in Brussels. The afternoon is draw\u00ad ing to a close and the atmosphere is expectant. All are waiting : experts, ad\u00ad visers, sponsors, industrial representatives, members of professional associations and other journalists. In a room next door, in camera, the Health Ministers of the 14 countries of the franc area, together with six associated African countries 1 , are, after considering the experts' report, agreeing the common provisions to be advocated in respect of medicines policy for the coming years. This meeting, supported by the European Commission, is the second of its type. The first was held last year in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire at the initiative of its Health and Social Affairs Minister, Maurice Kajou Guikahu\u00e9. It must be said that the 50% devaluation of the CFA franc which af\u00ad fected the 14 countries was a cause of great concern both for them and for the international community, in terms of its social consequences and particularly as regards the health of the various popu\u00ad lations. In these countries, 90% of medi\u00ad cines come from abroad, mainly from the French pharmaceutical industry, and a 50% devaluation of the currency thus signified a doubling of the prices of medicines. The fears will be all the better understood when one considers that medicines were not readily available to the great majority of the population even before devalu\u00ad ation. Promoting generic medicines At the Abidjan meeting, the ministers undertook to implement im\u00ad mediate short\u00adterm measures. The main one was a firm undertaking, as part of a policy resolutely aimed at procuring essen\u00ad tial medicines, to limit imports to a small number of medicines with which 90% of illnesses can be treated. In this context, the promotion of generic medicines 2 was undeniably the best approach since such 2 When a medicine has been invented, it is protected for 20 years. Once this period ottime has passed, the product falls into the public domain and may be copied. This copy is known as the generic medicine products are, on average, sold at a price three to four times lower than the original 'branded' product. This measure would require two things : first, the development of qualitat\u00ad ive control of the medicines (many of which are of doubtful quality) and, second, the systematic implementation of open or closed international tender procedures. The promotion of generic medi\u00ad cines in the private sector would also be encouraged. Of course, such products have already been introduced in the private health field but they are not particularly widely used \u2014 a legacy of the link with France, where generic medicines account for only 3% of those marketed in the private sector. In order to reverse this trend, one of the key concerns was to encourage pharmacies by holding out the prospect of higher profit margins. As the margin tends to be proportional to the wholesale cost of the medicine, the lower 1 Madagascar, Mauritania, Burundi, Guinea, Zambia and Zimbabwe. 100\u00ad 90\u00ad 80\u00ad 70\u00ad 60\u00ad 50\u00ad 40\u00ad 30\u00ad 20\u00ad 10\u00ad GE NER IC ME DK UNE S/ ^S A PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL IN THE PUBLIC SEC E N I N : A S 0 O O N R I C A 3 R O S N G O O I R E B O N R I A L I N E A M A L I I G E R < er m LU 3 < ce f\u00ad LU S O \u03c5 u h LU \u03b9\u00ad \u039f u 13 1 i J \u00ad < LU TC R _ \u00db o 2 8 the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may^une 1995 r ",
        "a c \u03c1 prices of generic products work against the interests of pharmacists. The meeting agreed that this proportionality needed to be ended. For the longer term, the 14 ministers recommended a policy of increas\u00ad ing public awareness and information about the use of generic medicines. Efforts were also to be made to develop competi\u00ad tive local production, particularly through lower import taxes on the raw materials required for manufacturing medicines. Finally, regional cooperation in the sphere of information (as to procurement sources, purchase prices, etc.) was to be im\u00ad plemented. This new medicines policy re\u00ad ceived the financial and institutional backing of sponsors such as the European Union, the World Bank, WHO and UNICEF. Avoiding the worst In the year that has passed since the Abidjan meeting the main achie\u00ad vement has undoubtedly been to avoid the worst. Although situations vary from country to country, it can be confirmed that imports of medicines have fallen in value by about 30%, representing a reduc\u00ad tion of approximately 22% in volume. Many things have happened over the course of the year and numerous measures have been taken. However, it has primarily been the fixing of price scales and the promotion of generic medicines that has enabled the rise in medicine prices to be limited : to 70%forthe private sector and to a relatively significant degree for the public sector (although a concrete figure is not currently available). As regards fixing of price scales in the private sector, there have been three types of initiative. There was a reduction in wholesale and retail distribution margins for pharmaceutical specialities, reflected by an average drop in multiplying factors of between 10% and 15%. Temporary price\u00ad freezing or price\u00adlimiting measures were also brought in, offset by subsidies in three countries (Benin, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Sen\u00ad egal). Finally, margin figures in excess of those authorised for pharmaceutical spe\u00ad cialities were applied in respect of ex\u00ad tremely rare generic medicines. As for the public sector, only minimal measures have been taken relat\u00ad ing to price scales. Only those countries where procurement centres were perform\u00ad ing to a high level froze prices at 1993 levels. The promotion of generic medi\u00ad cines was one of the key things to come out of the Abidjan meeting. The first priority was to alleviate the problem of regulation, since the countries in question have relatively weak legislative and re\u00ad gulatory structures. This was done and measures were effectively taken both to simplify registration procedures and to grant substitution permits to pharmacists. This was the case in most countries. Provisions regarding information intended for those using and prescribing medicines were also made more specific. Generic medicines were certainly promoted, but they also had to be accepted. Public\u00adsector results are by far the most significant given the ease of replacement of purchases by mutual ag\u00ad reement through greater recourse to the tender procedure. Against this back\u00ad ground, a number of purchasing centres have been reorganised (for example, in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire), whilst others have been set up (Central African Republic and Burkina Faso). At the same time, those which were not operating were dismantled (Ca\u00ad meroon). In the private sector, on the other hand, the tender procedure is still a rarity since only wholesalers from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Togo and Senegal have given it a try. In addition, of all the countries, it is only in Niger, Mali and Equatorial Guinea that the market share of generic medicines in the private sector has reached even the modest level of 20%. Local production is still a prob\u00ad lem. No new units have been set up, except for a repackaging plant in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and a small manufacturing plant in Chad. The few increases in production volumes which have been recorded (relatively small and highly variable as between countries) are in countries where there is a branch of a foreign pharmaceutical industry. As for domestic production, any improvement is marginal and it is not possible to say with certainty that true competition will result. A further issue of concern relates to the rules governing new entrants to the market. Other than in Niger and Mali, these remain poorly developed. A need to maintain progress Although the results mentioned above are encouraging, on the whole, it should nonetheless be recognised that the reduction in imports has meant reduced accessibility to and availability of medicines for the people of the CFA franc zone \u00ad\u03b9 the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may\u00adfune 1995 ",
        "a c \u03c1 countries. The new medicines policy must therefore be supported and its measures made more far\u00adreaching. The priorities identified by the ministers at the end of the Brussels meeting go some way towards this. The first priority is to increase monitoring of the quality of medicines. Although invitations to tender are well developed, particularly in the public sector, they do not always take into account product quality. This also entails better knowledge of the market. A second priority is, naturally, to accelerate the introduction of essential generic medicines in the private sector. To this end, there must be a consolidation of distribution\u00admargin systems in order to provide suitable incentives. Alternatively, generic medicines must be promoted as the primary element in the campaign against the parallel market for medicines. Their promotion and accessibility in the private sector are in fact essential to counter the marketing and use of sub\u00ad standard medicines. A third priority concerns the evolution of medicine prescription and dispensing practices. The main recom\u00ad mendation in this respect is to set up a graded list of essential medicines and to inform and educate people about the dangers of medicine abuse. A final priority relates to the promotion of domestic pharmaceutical production. It has been decided to make the year 2000 the target date by which the bulk of domestic requirements will be met from local production. The focus will be on highlighting the profitability and quality of such domestic manufacturing. In order to achieve these object\u00ad ives, the health ministers of the 14 countries and their counterparts in as\u00ad sociated countries demonstrated a genuine desire to strengthen regional cooperation. The results one year after implementation of the new medicines policy are still uneven between the various countries and it is essential that measures be harmonised. It would also undoubtedly be desirable for this reform not to be limited only to medicines policy but generally to tackle the various facets of the Before devaluation, 90% of medicines in the franc area were imported. The French pharmaceutical industry had a virtual monopoly of this market. The situation has changed substantially and it is evident that recent competition offered by the promotion of generic medicines and related tender procedures will enable the market to develop further in the future. Mr B. Lemoine, Managing Director of the SNIP (National Association of Pharmaceutical Industries) gives us his opinion.' \u25a0 Did devaluation of the CFA franc have knock\u00adon effects for the French pharmaceutical industry ? \u2014 The devaluation of the CFA franc undoubtedly had an effect on the French pharmaceutical industry which operates In Francophone sub\u00adSaharan Africa. The industry had approximately 80% of the pharmaceutical market in these countries, which was obviously a substantial figure, but this has been very significantly reduced, to approximately 15% to 20% in value tenns. However, industries operating in this area have traditionally wanted and still are keen to develop partnerships with our friends in Africa which go well beyond simply supplying medicines. So, yes, we were affected but we regard our role, as representatives of the French pharmaceutical industry in Africa, as being one of making available those medical treatments which are necessary to treat disease in those countries. We also see ourselves as working in partnership with public health authorities in the field of training, control mechanisms and diverse types of exchange. \u25a0 How do you see this role developing given the new policy implemented by health sector, such as education, access to pharmacies and water purification. In this context, although some things were already happening before devaluation of the CFA franc, the latter did these countries, particularly in the promotion of generic medianes? \u2014 There are acute health problems in many regions of the world and particularly in Africa. The French pharmaceutical industry has a decisive role to play there and will continue to have such a role although it will adapt, as demonstrated over the last few months, particularly by lowering the prices of its medicines and adapting them to the new conditions brought about by devaluation. We are also developing a new policy in respect of generic medicines which meets the requirements of the people in these countries. The French pharmaceutical industry has therefore entered the market for generic medicines whilst continuing to develop up\u00adto\u00adthe\u00adminute treatments, medicines and pharmaceutical specialities as we have done in the past. This complements the partnership we would like to have with our friends in Africa. \u25a0 Do you have any fears concerning the new competition, particularly from countries in Asia and Eastern Europe ? \u2014 Healthy competition, that is to say competition based on the same criteria, the same manufacturing standards, the same respect for people, health and the safety of medicines, is not something we see as a cause for concern. It is quite normal. On the other hand, if a type of competition were to develop which in some way eluded the strict procedures which make it possible to protect African populations against imports of medicines which are not controlled or insufficiently controlled, we would then naturally ask our African partners to put a stop to it and to be more vigilant in this respect. act as an additional catalyst in accelerating restructuring of the public health sector. That can only be for the good. \u25a0\u25a0 the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00ad mayiune 1995 r ",
        "Suriname A c o n t i n u i ng saga of s t r u c t u r al a d j u s t m e nt 'Suriname is one of those places you only hear about when things go wrong.' This statement by an American on the plane to Paramaribo seemed jarring and perhaps a little unfair. But when one pauses to consider how this South American country has impinged on the consciousness of the average European (outside the Netherlands) over the last two and a half decades, it is clear that there is more than a grain of truth in this harsh observation. In the 1980s, Suriname cropped up from time to time on the main news bulletins and In the international pages of newspapers for all the wrong reasons \u2014 a military coup in 1980, media censorship, the killing of 15 opposition leaders in 1982, a guerilla war which began in 1986 and a precipitous economic decline which saw tens of thousands of Surinamese emigrate in search of better opportunities. For most of the 1990s, the country's international profile has been much more low key, reflecting Sur\u00ad name's new\u00adfound stability and a far less fertile environment for those seeking lurid headlines. Suriname, of course, is not unique in only making the front pages when things go wrong. Indeed, such is the effect of the modern media that, arguably, humankind's knowledge of the political geography of small countries at any particular point in time is directly propor\u00ad tional to the misery being endured by the people of the territory concerned. Most of us would find it a lot easier to pinpoint Bosnia or Rwanda on a map than say Brunei or Costa Rica ! So while it may seem frustrating for those keen to extol the virtues of Suriname, the adage 'no news is good news' is more likely to be applicable at least when it comes to the attentions of the global media. The Courier, of course, is not driven by the same pressures which decree that war is a 'story' while peace is not (unless it has just broken out) or that a financial crisis is newsworthy while econ\u00ad omic stability is uninteresting. In our Country Reports, we seek to offer readers an accurate snapshot of an ACP country at a specific moment in time, highlighting the positive aspects without neglecting the negative ones. And our investigation of Suriname reveals a mixture of the two. In that general respect, at least, it is no different from any other country, ACP or EU, that we report on. Political equilibrium On the positive side, the country appears to have achieved a reasonable political equilibrium after many years of turbulence and military rule. The army's coup in 1980 came as a rude shock to the citizens of this young republic (which had gained independence from the Nether\u00ad lands in 1975) and although it was to be more than a decade before democracy would be fully restored, the Surinamese today seem determined to preserve and consolidate their rediscovered political pluralism. Evidence of a healthy democratic atmosphere was to be found in the openness of all those to whom The Courier spoke \u2014 government ministers, oppo\u00ad sition leaders, business people, civil serv\u00ad ants and union leaders. The bad news is that the revival of Suriname's democratic fortunes has not yet been accompanied by a significant \"I the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may\u00adjune 1995 ",
        "improvement in economic performance. To an outsider, the scale of the country's economic difficulties is both perplexing and frustrating. Here is a nation which, unlike many of its ACP partners, is rich in natural resources. The population, though small at just over 400.000, is well educated. Para\u00ad maribo shows some signs of wear but was obviously a reasonably prosperous place in the recent past. So what has gone wrong and what can be done to restore the country's fortunes ? There is a widespread belief that most of Suriname's economic woes are attributable to macro\u00adeconomic imbal\u00ad ances which are curable. In other words, the country has the potential but must take steps \u2014 some of which need to be radical and painful \u2014 to get back on track. The dreaded expression 'structural ad\u00ad justment' rears its head in this context and in Suriname, one has to broach this subject with particular care. Perhaps the problem is that adjustment implies 'blaming' the authorities for past mistakes. It is generally deemed to be necessary because a govern\u00ad ment has been spending too much of the nation's wealth \u2014 and usually a lot more than it actually has access to, resulting in growing indebtedness. It may have al\u00ad lowed the civil service to become bloated so that state revenues end up being spent on salaries rather than on infrastructure and social investments. It may have sought in the past to control the 'commanding heights' of the economy through interven\u00ad tion and nationalisation only to discover that, without meaningful competition, the new state enterprises have turned into white elephants. National pride may have induced the authorities to defend an indefensible exchange rate to the detri\u00ad ment of exports. Large\u00adscale emigration Elements of most of the above can be found in present\u00adday Suriname although they are hardly the fault of those currently in power. The years of military rule had some profound negative effects on the economy which cannot easily be reversed. There was, for example, the loss of tens of thousands of citizens through emigration (mainly to the Netherlands). Many of these were people with import\u00ad ant skills and the result has been a weakening of the human resource base of the country. Once a person has found a new life and career abroad, it is not easy to attract him or her back even if the prospects locally have dramatically im\u00ad proved. One side effect of the migration trend which might be seen as positive is the growth in remittances from Surinamese living overseas to their families back home. This has been an important source of income to the country in recent years. A second damaging effect of the military dictatorship of the 1980s was on relations with other countries including traditional aid donors. At a time when most developing nations could rely on support from one or other side of the Iron Curtain, irrespective of the regime that was in power, Suriname does not seem to have benefited particularly from this. It Paramaribo shows some signs of wear but was obviously a reasonably prosperous place in the recent past may be that they were unlucky in having The Netherlands as their main partner in the North. The former metropolitan power, with its liberal policies and strong commitment to human rights, reacted strongly to events in Suriname, suspending the substantial aid programme that had been agreed at the time of independence and was still being implemented. The country's geographical position may also have had something to do with it. While the United States has an obvious interest in events within its own hemisphere, Sur\u00ad iname was not of particular strategic interest to either of the main Cold War protagonists. Today, it is probably true to say that all small developing countries have to contend with the possibility of losing the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may^une 1995 r ",

A third element is the weakness of certain infrastructures. This is related to the small size of Suriname's population and its associated weak tax base. It is all veny well being rich in resources but you need people and cash to exploit these and in simple terms, there are not enough Sur\u00ad inamese to do this effectively. Despite the fact that the majority of the people are concentrated in the coastal strip, the country struggles even to maintain good east\u00adwest links centred on the capital. The coastal area is divided into segments by a number of very wide rivers several of which are too expensive to bridge. Goods tend to be transported by sea while people and vehicles have to rely on ferry services which are often erratic. During The Courier's visit, a crucial car ferry service linking the rice growing areas around Nickerie with Para\u00ad maribo was out of action although it was possible for foot passengers to make the crossing. Connections with neighbouring Guyana and French Guyana are con\u00ad strained by similar problems and this presents some formidable challenges for entrepreneurs keen to develop intra\u00ad regional trade. The country also has an extensive system of dykes and polders designed to hold back the sea and keep the Wide rivers and encroaching seas add up to high Infrastructure costs coastal area habitable and cultivable. This vital infrastucture is, needless to say, expensive to maintain. While structural adjustment may not be a panacea for all the nation's ills, there is a general recognition that certain fundamental changes to the economy are needed to set Suriname back on the road to recovery. Government ministers ac\u00ad knowledge this fact as much as external advisers but find themselves seriously constrained when it comes to taking the key decisions. One of the most important constraints is to be found in the country's unique ethnic composition which is re\u00ad flected in the political system. Diverse population For more information on the background to Suriname's heterogeneous population, we turned to renowned local historian Dr A. Loor. He explained how the country had experienced waves of settle\u00ad ment at different times during its colonial history. It began with European settlers and the forced migration of Africans brought over as slaves to work the plantations. Their descendants are known as Creoles. A number of these early slaves succeeded in escaping to the interior where they were able to re\u00adestablish a traditional village lifestyle. These people (the Bush Negroes) successfully concluded a peace treaty with the colonial authorities in 1760. In the mid\u00ad19th century a group of adeherents to the Dutch Reformed Church arrived to cultivate the land (without slaves), escaping recession and starvation in Europe. Following the abolition of slavery, it was the turn of indentured labourers brought in from Hong Kong, Macao and 'British' India. Although on limited term contracts, usually for five years, many of these people stayed on to make Suriname their permanent home. The descendants of the last\u00admentioned group are known today as the 'Hindus\u00ad tanis'. Finally the years between 1890 and 1939 saw the arrival of some 30 000 immigrants from the Dutch East Indies (the Javanese). Add to all of this the indigenous inhabitants (the Amerindians), and the result is one of the most ethnically diverse nations in the world. Dr Loor insists that there is a distinct Surinamese identity (the local lingua franca, Sranang Tongo, is evidence of this), but he also acknowledges that each group has retained significant ele\u00ad ments of its previous culture. Suriname, therefore, is not yet a genuine 'melting pot'. This is reflected in the party struc\u00ad tures, which tend to be ethnically based, and this obviously has consequences in the field of policy making. While one should not exaggerate the fact that there are divisions \u2014 the current four\u00adparty governing coalition even presented a common list to the voters at the last election \u2014 the organisation of politics along ethnic lines means that those in power are not necessarily natural 'bed\u00ad fellows' in ideological terms. As President Venetiaan himself acknowledged when he spoke to The Courier, the need for widespread consultation before agree\u00ad ment can be reached on proposals within government inevitably slows down the decision\u00admaking process. Measures likely to have an adverse effect on a particular ethnic group are especially difficult to push through and this causes real difficulties in a society where different groups have tradi\u00ad tionally performed different economic roles. For example, the effect of any measures aimed at the important rice\u00ad growing sector will be felt mainly by the \"I the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may\u00adjune 1995 ",
        "Hindustani community. Action targeted at organised labour and the trade unions will tend to impinge most heavily on the Creoles. The positive aspect of this is that Suriname has a broadly representative administration at present (even if it is doing badly in the opinion polls), which must be a good thing while memories of military rule and internal strife remain so fresh. It is surely better to fight one's battles round a negotiating table. This is perhaps an aspect which outsiders do not fully appreciate when they criticise Sur\u00ad iname for its apparent slow progress on the economic front. The result, however, is that while the government has made a broad com\u00ad mitment to structural adjustment, it has not yet advanced very far down this particular road. The situation has been complicated by an extreme reluctance to bring in the IMF, the traditional 'overseer' of structural adjustment processes. Sur\u00ad iname is no different from other countries in being less than enthuiastic about 'in\u00ad viting' the Fund to help with an SAP. Their judgments and prescriptions are often harsh and not everyone is convinced, on the basis of other countries' experience, that they offer the best 'cure'. What makes Suriname different, however, is the fact that they have held out much longer than most against IMF involvement. The stony of structural adjustment in Suriname \u2014 which might more appropriately be termed a 'saga' \u2014 could fill several volumes. It began in the late 1980s after the first attempt to restore democracy which culminated in the 'telephone coup' of December 1990. The European Commis\u00ad sion was closely involved at this stage in its novel role as proposed monitor of the structural adjustment process. The process was suspended during the brief spell of military rule in 1990/91 before being resumed following the election of the Venetiaan government. Unable to reach agreement with the authorities, the Com\u00ad mission subsequently withdrew from its intended role although it continued to play a part in Suriname's development through the regular Lom\u00e9 Convention arrange\u00ad ments. At this stage, the government turned to the Warwick Research Institute DE SURINAAMSCWE 5AM N.V of the UK for help in drawing up and supervising the SAP. When one considers the ideo\u00ad logical background to structural adjust\u00ad ment (freeing up markets, privatising, reducing the state's involvement in the economy etc.) Suriname's decision to seek assistance from a 'private' source in the implementation of its programme has a rather satisfying logic. After all, if a key purpose of the exercise is to 'roll back the frontiers of the state' then why should the programme itself be exempt. IMF officials after all, are merely civil servants ap\u00ad pointed to carry out the collective will of governments. The trouble is that in the real world, the Fund has the kind of influence that no private institute, however re\u00ad spected, is likely to be able to match. At a time when donor support is increasingly being linked to the implementation of fundamental changes in domestic econ\u00ad omies, the 'cachet' of the IMF can be extremely important. In the case of Sur\u00ad iname, the Netherlands, which is the key donor, has made it clear that balance of payments support will only be resumed once a fully\u00adfledged and convincing SAP is up and running. Ready to talk to IMF To be fair to the current govern\u00ad ment, progress towards structural adjust\u00ad ment has been speeded up, even if, to outsiders, it still appears frustratingly slow. R. Assen, who is the Minister of Planning and Development Cooperation (and National Authorising Officer for Lom\u00e9 Convention purposes) told The Courier of plans to 'strengthen the public service' in the process of which 'a lot of civil servants will be transferred to other productive A bank in Paramaribo Progress on the structural adjustment front has speeded up but there is still a long way to go activities.' He also emphasised the govern\u00ad ment's commitment to privatisation. The most significant development is that the authorities are ready to talk to the IMF. Ministers appear to accept the need to have, at the very least, the Fund's seal of approval, even if it is not officially involved in drawing up structural adjustment meas\u00ad ures. In all of this, external advisers need to be conscious of the domestic political pressures in Suriname. Towards the end of 1994, the country saw a series of demonstrations and damaging strikes, illustrating the difficulties of implementing even modest reforms which have an adverse effect on certain sections of the population. Could it be that in order to consolidate democracy, there is a need to tread softly on economic restructuring? Conventional wisdom is that democracy and economic progress go hand in hand but there may be an argument against having too much economic upheaval while democracy remains fragile. On the other hand, economic instability is in itself a destablising factor if it is not tackled speedily. It is an unenviable dilemma for the government and one which cannot be left unresolved for too much longer. M Simon Horner the Courier n\u00b0 151 * rn.iy june 1995 \u03a4 ",
        "President Ronald Venetiaan 'Economics d i f f i c u l t i es a re no r e a s on to p ut d e m o c r a cy in t he f r e e z e r' Suriname has had a rough ride in recent times. Military coups in 1980 and again (briefly) in 1990 adminis\u00ad tered severe shocks to the body politic, while the country's econ\u00ad omic performance has been less than impressive. The good news is that democracy is back. At elec\u00ad tions in May 1991, civilian govern\u00ad ment was restored and Ronald Venetiaan took over the Presi\u00ad dency at the head of a four\u00adparty coalition. The bad news is that the economy is still struggling. In an interview with The Courier, President Venetiaan explained the dif\u00ad ficulties facing his government as it seeks to restore Suriname's economic fortunes and consolidate the democratic system. We began by asking him about the economic challenges, and whether he could see 'light at the end of the tunnel'. \u2014 I think I may say, as a result of what we have been doing in recent years, that the business sector, and especially the part that is involved in production for export, has moved from a bad situation to more favourable conditions. Our main challenge is to ensure that we have enough export\u00adoriented production to earn suf\u00ad ficient foreign currency and, of course, that the effects of these increased activities are felt in other areas such as the social sectors and those that are not direct foreign currency earners. Here in Suriname, we have some sectors which have been active in the export field for many years. We have the bauxite/alumina industry, rice produc\u00ad tion and bananas, although the last\u00ad mentioned does have some problems. We also have the forestry sector, where we are preparing to step up activities, and mining of both gold and natural stone, not to mention eco\u00adtourism. So there are possibi\u00ad lities in production and exports and I think that, with these in mind, we may say that we can 'see the light'. \u25a0 On structural adjustment, which is evidently a sensitive issue here, what measures have been and should be taken with a view to adjusting the Suriname economy ? \u2014 We have taken quite a number of measures already and I think we should recognise that there are still more to be taken, for example, in increasing the taxation base. We also have to look at taking people from the government ser\u00ad vice into the productive sector, and at the very important task of stabilising the exchange rate. According to the specialists, that is related to the amount of Sur\u00ad inamese money in circulation. So the issues before us, and what we have to do, are now clear but, of course, implementation is something else. That causes problems because the social costs are very high. I think that our main target for the coming year must be to stabilise the exchange rate because until you do that. you cannot come to grips with develop\u00ad ment. You think you are getting nearer to the goal then, all of a sudden, the posts move because the exchange rate tumbles. Keeping control on the amount of money in circulation is therefore important. Another priority for this year is to increase government income in terms of both foreign exchange and local currency through taxes. \u25a0 You mention the social costs of adjust\u00ad ment. Given that you are a democracy, does that not pose difficulties in that you have to have an eye to the next election. \u2014The democratic system creates difficulties in two ways. First, as you point out, you have to keep an eye on the next election. Second, and perhaps more im\u00ad portant, before you can begin implement\u00ad ing certain measures, you have to work through the whole democratic structure. For some countries trying to undertake \"I the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may\u00adjune 1995 ",
        "c o u n t ry r e p o rt \u2014 S u r i n a me adustment that may be an even greater problem. But let me say straight away that these difficulties are no reason for us to put democracy in the freezer. Some people say you should start with economic adjust\u00ad ment and then, once growth is achieved, bring back democracy. We have always said that for us, democracy is a pre\u00ad condition for development and a sound economy. We recognise the difficulties, but democracy is a high priority for us. \u25a0 Looking specifically at the forestry issue, which you mentioned earlier, Sur\u00ad iname is obviously hoping to earn signific\u00ad ant amounts from timber export oper\u00ad ations. You are currently negotiating with some Asian logging firms. Are you con\u00ad cerned about possible environmental ef\u00ad fects, given what has happened in other parts of the world, and how would you propose to tackle this question ? \u2014 We know that concern has been expressed. I would not say that we in the Government are concerned, but we certainly have to keep a watchful eye on the issue. There is always a danger of mishaps in the area of forestry activity. So it is very important for us to work with the companies in a way that convinces them of our commitment to sustainable exploi\u00ad tation. This doesn't just mean not cutting down all the trees; it also involves not killing the life that is in the forest, although of course, every tree you take away brings some changes. But remember that we have been involved in forestry activities for a long time and 95% of the Suriname forest is still there. This shows the sensible way Suriname has dealt with the issue up to now. So we believe that with what we have learned in the past and, eventually with a suitable level of support from international and regional organisations and friendly countries, we will be able to work with these logging companies in the right way. Of course, it is not only forestry activity that can pose a threat to the ecology. There is also mining. You have to cut down trees to mine and there are other aspects as well such as the danger of chemical pollution at the processing stage. So in both forestry and in the mining of gold and bauxite, we are prepared, with support from abroad, to ensure that things are done properly. \u25a0 One issue which seems to be cropping up more and more, in both developing and developed countries, is privatisation. It doesn't seem to be a burning question here. Do you have any privatisation plans and if so, how far would you anticipate going ? \u2014As you know, even/ time there is a new administration, it presents a new programme setting out the policies of the governing coalition, and privatisation is in our programme. I believe that, together with new forms of tax, certain privatis\u00ad ation activities will have to be implemen\u00ad ted. \u25a0 What sectors are you talking about here? \u2014 Well among the government\u00ad owned companies, there are some that are successful and others that have been having negative results. In the first place, we will be looking at those with negative results to see if the private sector can be brought in to run things better. Of course, it is not easy to push proposals through in this area. There is resistance from some quarters \u2014 the workers union and certain parts of the coalition will be upset. But we have had some interest, for example, in a state company in the forestry and wood processing sector. We are also preparing to make government land available \u2014 for people who want to work it, not for speculators. Today, if a company wants to build a faeton/ for production, they have to rent the land. So we plan to make it possible to sell government land. This measure is also seen as a way of taking money out of the system which is part of our currency stablisation strategy. \u25a0 Moving on to political issues, are you happy that the democratic system is now well\u00adfounded after the problems in the last decade ? \u2014 We had tremendous difficul\u00ad ties in the 1980s: a bad situation which I am sure you know all about, and I think that many people who were not par\u00ad ticularly aware of the problems of dictator\u00ad ships and military rule have now learned f about them. Together we pooled our I efforts and worked to a point where we could restore democracy. We are very happy about that and particularly happy that it could be achieved without any major calamities. It was difficult and dangerous but we were fortunate that we got back to democracy without violence or intervention from outside. Now we have the opportunity to democratise further. I think that alertness is very important here because, while today's problems are seen as being mainly economic ones, we need to keep a watchful eye on the danger that things deteriorate on the democracy front. I am not saying that democracy is weak here but we have to see that it becomes stronger and stronger. You have been here some days ; you can see that we have a free press and Parliament. The opposition is free to criticise ? You know these things are in place. The judges are also independent. If they rule against a government decision, there is no problem with that. As for the situation with our army, we have to work very hard on that point because the period of dictatorship has had an influence. We have said that we need to restructure and Aluminium produced at the Suralco plant near Paramaribo ' We have to look at taking people from the government service into the productive sector' \u00daie Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may\u00adjune 199S ",
        "c o u n t ry r e p o rt \u2014 S u r i n a me transform the army to work with de\u00ad mocracy and serve the needs of the people and the country. Because of lack of means, we haven't yet accomplished that re\u00ad structuring. In Suriname, of course, we have the same problems of banditry and crime that are developing elsewhere. Some\u00ad times, crimes related to international activities are committed here. \u25a0 / presume you are referring to the drugs trade ? \u2014 Yes. Drug\u00adrelated crimes, for instance, create additional difficulties for the system : for democracy and for the economy. That means we have to work harder to preserve what we have achieved. It also means more work in restructuring the economy. There is, for example, a theory that because of drug\u00adrelated money, it is more difficult to bring about a stabilisation of the exchange rate. There are amounts of money in the system and you can't explain where they come from or where they are going. This is not to say that drugs crimes are the number one issue in Suriname but the problem is there. Logging operations 'We certainly have to keep a watchful eye' especially as we are on an important route between South America and Europe. \u25a0 Another political aspect which is inter\u00ad esting is the multi\u00adparty system that you have here. Eight parties are represented in Parliament. Do you think this is an ad\u00ad vantage or a disadvantage in terms of constructing the necessary coalitions to proceed with policy initiatives ? \u2014 I don't think there is any clear answer to that one way or the other. Our political system is there to provide for the representation of the people. And when you look at the population of Suriname, I think your conclusion should be that we have not yet reached the stage where we can work with a smaller number of parties. I think it is a good thing that the political system reflects the complicated situation in the population. At the same time, of course, it is not so easy to work with. You have to keep an eye on what is going on in all the parts of the coalition. Sometimes people say that the interests of one group or party are being promoted, and development is being blocked as a result. Some say that Suriname politics has an ethnic base. But if you look at politics in other countries, you see similarities. In the Netherlands, for example, they have a religious base. Having said this, we know that there are dangers when groups are organised along ethnic lines. The challenge is to move forward very cautiously, making sure that normal politics and interests do not become replaced by the race issues. But, in general, I think our political structure is a reflection of the situation in the popu\u00ad lation, and that is something that we have to work with. \u25a0 Finally, what do you think of Sur\u00ad iname's current relationship with the European Union and how do you see the relationship developing up to and beyond the year 2000? \u2014 I think Suriname is very close to the European Union at the moment. Of course we have very strong links with one EU country in particular \u2014 the Nether\u00ad lands, and there also our bilateral relations with countries like Belgium, France and, to some extent, Germany and the UK. The Union is working towards closer political union and Suriname is aware of the fact that we should be integrating on this side of the Atlantic Ocean as well. I think that after the year 2000, it will be organisations of which Suriname is a member that will be dealing with Europe. Some may think that is a pity, because it is always more interesting to be in direct contact, but it is clear the way things are developing. It is important for Suriname to start working with this trend in mind. That is why we are looking to join Caricom. We are already a member of the Association of Caribbean States. And we are studying the con\u00ad sequences of the regional organisations emerging in South America. We are a Caribbean country, but we are also on the South American continent, so we have to look at all these developments and then make our choices. Already, we see a trend away from bilateral links with more dealings between one regional organis\u00ad ation and another. If that is the way our partners want to work, then we have to adapt tO it. ^M Interview by S.H. ^ the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may\u00adjune 1995 ",
        "Rich in r e s o u r c es Suriname, despite its economic difficulties, is a country which has a wealth of natural resources. It has a variety of mineral assets, notably bauxite, gold, natural stone and oil (featured separately in the article which follows). The fertile coastal plain offers good potential for agriculture, with rice and bananas currently the main products. The sea provides a potentially lucrative source of income from fishing activities. Finally, there are the trees \u2014 thousands of square kilom etres of semi-tropical forest which could be exploited although such a sugges tion inevitably gives rise to environmental concerns. The degree to which each of these resources is being tapped varies enorm ously. In this article, we examine what is currently happening in the different areas of primary production and look at how the sectors may develop in the future. Bauxite is big business The largest single economic ac tivity in Suriname is bauxite mining and processing (into alumina and aluminium). In trade terms, this sector is responsible for between 50% and 60% of the country's total exports, by value, and it is therefore a crucial source of foreign exchange. Bauxite production began in the country as far back as 1916. Today, the main ore deposits being mined are around Moengo and Coermotibo in the east and in the central region. Moengo, where production began in 1970, has only limited reserves remain ing but more recent discoveries in the west of the country, with proven reserves of 90 million tonnes, should ensure continuing large-scale production for another 50 years. Bauxite, however, is expected to lose its dominant place in the economy within a decade. The industry has not always had a smooth ride. As Abdul Jainoel, who is Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Natural Resources explained to The Courier, the state of the market is heavily influenced by global economic trends. There was a downturn towards the end of the 1970s as the world price of the commodity slipped and the problems continued during the 1980s. The world economic situation was partly to blame for this but there was also the emergence of competition in the form of new plastics which provided alternatives to aluminium. Currently, the situation in the bauxite sector is somewhat mixed. The price of processed aluminium has been rising but alumina prices remain depressed. The devaluation of the Suriname guilder has, at least, had the effect of making local production more competitive. Mr Jainoel predicts that the country will see increased investment in the sector with new mines opening. The bauxite industry is largely in the hands of the private sector. The biggest enterprise is the Suriname Alum inium Company (Suralco) which is a sub sidiary of a large American conglomerate. It employs almost 2200 people in mining the Moengo-Coermotibo deposits and in processing at the huge Paranam plant situated some 20 km south of Paramaribo. It also has a minority stake in a mining joint venture with Billiton (a Shell subsidiary) which provides jobs for a further 600. The company produces some two million tonnes of bauxite annually. The bulk of its production is exported as alumina but the company also operates an aluminium smelter at Paranam which produces some 60 000 tonnes of the metal each year. To put these figures in context, approximately four tonnes of bauxite is needed to produce two tonnes of alumina which is then processed into one tonne of alum inium. When Arnold Soerohardjo, a manager at Suralco, spoke to The Courier, he expressed optimism about the potential in the west of the country. A new mining joint venture had recently been approved and the aim was for full feasibility studies to be completed by the end of 1995. He Part of Suralco's bauxite processing plant at Paranam near Paramaribo was also concerned, however, about the instability caused by the country's high inflation, which made forward planning more difficult. As for the environmental impact of bauxite production, Mr Soero hardjo was keen to stress that although the local regulatory environment was 'not stringent', Suralco applied the more rigor ous standards of its parent company in its mining operations and in dealing with waste products. Another enterprise engaged in the exploration sector is the state-owned Grassalco, which prospects for gold and other minerals as well as bauxite. This company, which employs 123 people, reports promising prospects 'after several years of set-backs and stagnation'. It negotiates on behalf of the government with potential private sector partners and owns the concessions for the above- mentioned deposits in the western region. Glittering prospects for gold \u2014 but government wants its share While bauxite production falls entirely within the formal sector, the same cannot be said for Suriname's gold mining operations. Although a number of com mercially exploitable ore bodies have been discovered, the bulk of the country's the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may-june 199S r ",
        "c o u n t ry r e p o rt \u2014 S u r i n a me current production, which takes place mainly in the eastern areas, is carried out by small\u00adscale prospectors. Most of the gold is smuggled out of the country to neighbouring French Guyana where it can be sold for hard currency. Indeed, the government can only come up with a vague estimate of total production (some\u00ad where between 5000 and 10 000 kilog\u00ad rams a year). Recently, the authorities have tried to gain a firmer grip on the sector with a policy based on the 'carrot' rather than the 'stick'. Previously, the Central Bank would only buy gold from individual prospectors at the official \u2014 and quite unrealistic \u2014 exchange rate of SFL 1.80 to the US dollar, thereby ensuring that virtually no\u00adone would sell to it. The Bank now offers a more attractive rate and the immediate result has been a surge of gold purchases with 800 kg being bought in a six\u00admonth period. This policy reflects the realities of the situation. It is simply not feasible for the government effectively to control the activities of the independent gold miners operating in the sparsely\u00ad populated hinterland : there are neither the personnel nor the infrastructure to monitor what is happening. Better, there\u00ad fore, to gain some benefit by making it worthwhile for prospectors to sell 'their' gold to a local, official purchaser. Suriname is also keen to attract foreign investment to exploit any larger\u00ad scale deposits that are identified. In June 1994, a joint venture agreement was concluded with a Canadian company in respect of a 10 000 hectare mining conces\u00ad sion granted by the government. Another Canadian enterprise has an option to carry out exploration and development of the Gross Rosebel concession, and assuming that the feasibility study yields favourable results, it is hoped to bring production on stream by the middle of 1997. Permanent Secretary Jayinoel indicated that the country could eventually have as many as four commercial gold mines in operation. Agriculture \u2014 strong reliance on EU markets Turning to agricultural resources, Suriname's main speciality is rice which is cultivated in the western area of the fertile coastal strip, mainly around the town of Wageningen. It is produced for local consumption but also in significant quan\u00ad tities for export. The main overseas market is the European Union. Up to a certain limit, the EU grants preferential access to ACP rice, with a 50% tariff reduction, but it is some time since Suriname has made use of this particular instrument. Financially, it is from privileged access to the EU market, up to a level of 38 000 tonnes. In 1994, the country was able to make use of most of its preferential tariff quota, exporting almost 34 000 tonnes of the fruit, valued at ECU 8.5 million, to the Union. As The Courier has reported in several recent issues, traditional ACP banana production is under threat from the more efficient more rewarding to use the 'Antilles' route whereby the Suriname crop is sent to one of the Dutch islands in the region for further processing. The value that is added to the rice enables it to be sent on to Europe duty free (as a product of EU origin). In 1994, more than 75 000 tonnes of Suriname cargo rice were exported to Europe and the value of total rice sales to the Union exceeded ECU 25 million. Rice is grown both by individual farmers and by a state enterprise which runs one of the largest, fully mechanised rice farms in the world at Wageningen. Significant research efforts (some sup\u00ad ported by the EU) are undertaken to maintain and improve yields and prevent diseases. The sector, however, cannot be insulated altogether from the country's macro\u00adeconomic problems and there is an awareness of the need to improve ef\u00ad ficiency, particularly in the light of global trade liberalisation whose effects are beginning to be felt in the field of agriculture. The move towards free trade in agricultural products poses a particular challenge to Suriname's second main export crop, bananas. These also benefit Working in the rice paddies at an experimental station near Wageningen 'dollar' zone producers and to a large extent, it is being kept afloat by the special arrangements of the Lom\u00e9 Convention. It is still not clear how long these arrange\u00ad ments can be maintained in the face of legal challenges under the GATT and the political impetus in favour of lowering trade barriers. However, it is generally recognised in Suriname, as elsewhere in the Caribbean, that the days of protected markets for bananas are numbered. Rich\u00ad ard Kalloe, who is the Minister for Trade and Industry, acknowledged that the country's production, which is vested exclusively in a state\u00adowned company (Surland), could not currently compete with dollar zone producers. Part of the solution, he thought, lay in diversifying into other crops, a process which he hoped would attract support from the EU. Sur\u00ad iname, of course, is fortunate in having greater scope for diversification than many of its Caribbean island neighbours, both in agriculture and in the wider primary production sector. Mr Kalloe cited the example of Suriname's sugar sector, which had col\u00ad lapsed despite the benefits available to it \"f the Courier n\" 151 \u25a0 may\u00adjune 1995 ",
        "c o u n t ry r e p o rt \u2014 S u r i n a me under the Lom\u00e9 Sugar Protocol. He blamed this on a lack of investment but also concluded that 'there is no point focusing on a product whose viability is based on protectionism which cannot last'. The implicit message for Surland seems to be 'adapt or go under'. This is not to say that there is no long term future for banana production in Suriname. Indeed, an assess\u00ad ment recently undertaken by external consultants suggests that the basic agro\u00ad nomic and climatic conditions in the country are favourable to banana growing and that what is needed are improvements to quality and efficiency. The European Commission is directly involved in efforts aimed at bringing about such improve\u00ad ments. The country also produces a range of other fruits and vegetables, although at present, these are principally for local consumption. Mr Kalloe is keen to see new export markets develop and spoke of providing incentives in this area. One sub\u00adsector which appears to offer considerable promise is fruit juices. To learn more about this, we turned to local entrepreneur Ernst Bleijert, who employs 28 people at his juice processing operation (Bleyco) in Paramaribo. Mr Bleijert is a former teacher who 'decided to go into business because of the economic situation'. On the face of it, this may seem a curious decision given the country's economic problems. However, when one considers the adverse effect of the crisis on the earning capacity of public servants, including teachers, the move may be more readily understood. In addition, Mr Bleijert was keen to stress that even a 'chaotic economic situation' can offer opportu\u00ad nities. 'It is not so difficult to go into business', he argued, 'and if you are well organised, it is possible to make a profit.' While currency stability was necessary for the long term, the current situation allowed Bleyco to produce 'an internation\u00ad ally marketable product at a highly compe\u00ad titive price.' Bleyco's main production line is fruit juice sold in cartons although it also makes concentrated juices (syrups) and some jelly and jam. At the time of The Courier's visit, the company was still only supplying the home market but a number of buyers in neighbouring countries, as well as in The Netherlands, had expressed interest in placing orders. Mr Bleijert felt that the regional export market (Guyana, French Guyana, Cura\u00e7ao etc) offered the best prospects for the short term. As he frankly acknowledged, 'other markets may simply be too big for us.' Mr Bleijert went on to describe the supply situation. Although all the fruit processed in his factory is grown in Suriname, there are some problems in ensuring regular supplies because of the undeveloped nature of the fruit farming Ernst Bleijert in his fruit juice factory sector. Citrus (oranges and grapefruit) is produced on plantations but the 'exotic' varieties such as passion fruit are generally grown by small farmers who cultivate just one or two acres. Bleyco has cooperated with two other entrepreneurs to set up the Foundation for Fruit Development in Suriname (SOFS) which aims to help small farmers expand their land use and thus ensure more secure supplies. Mr Bleijert also spoke of plans to provide a controlled irrigation system and of farmers and processors meeting together to agree prices and bring much\u00adneeded stability to the operation. From the government side, Mr Bleijert does not look for a great deal of active assistance, being a firm believer in private enterprise. He would, however, be happy to see an easing of restrictions in the field of export licences. Delays in the granting of licences, he claimed, created a particular problems for those involved in trading perishable goods. Fishing \u2014 shrimps dominate but expansion prospects lie elsewhere Marine shrimps are an important source of export earnings and employment in Suriname. Three companies are engaged in this business, the largest being the state\u00ad owned Suriname American Industries Ltd (SAIL), which processes and packages the shrimps for export, and provides employ\u00ad ment for 260 people. Erro! Mannes, who is the company's managing director, briefed The Courier on how the shrimp business and the fishing sector more generally was currently faring. He began by pointing out that there was very little scope for expansion in shrimp production. The fish\u00ad ing is undertaken, mainly by licensed foreign vessels (from Korea) on an all\u00adyear round basis and, in 1994, more than 1.3 million kilos, valued at almost $20m were exported. The biggest markets were Japan (1 million kilos) and Europe (330 000 kilos). The problem is that the max\u00ad imum sustainable catch of shrimps, which had remained stable at around 5000 tonnes for a number of years, is apparently now declining. With production costs going up, the result has been reduced revenues. SAIL, which is currently still in profit, is far from complacent about this and although shrimps will continue to be central to their operation (assuming the right measures are taken to stabilise the supply), they are actively looking at other possibilities, notably in the area of aquacul\u00ad ture. Suriname appears to have con\u00ad siderable potential for aquaculture (fish farming) in areas around the Suriname and Commewijne Rivers and the Matapica Creek and Canal. A prefeasibility study, commissioned by the UN Food and Agricul\u00ad ture Organisation (FAO) at the request of the government, revealed encouraging prospects for shrimp 'farming' in the brackish waters of the region. It is es\u00ad timated that an area of between 30 000 and 40 000 hectares is suitable for this purpose and a tentative projection puts the possible financial return as high as $300 million. The focus is not all on shrimps either. There is also scope for exploiting other species both in deep sea operations and through aquaculture. Indeed SAIL has the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may\u00adjune 1995 r ",

Suriname faces a problem as regards fishing for other species in its exclusive economic zone. At present, this is being done \u2014 often illegally \u2014 by foreign vessels. It is estimated that 50% of the snappers caught in the country's EEZ go straight to Venezuela. Mr Mannes spoke forcibly about this form of 'economic crime' which brings no benefits to the people of Suriname, arguing for punitive sanctions to deter potential offenders. Presumably, there is also a need to enhance the country's surveillance capabilities. Strong punishments are not enough to ensure effective deterrence \u2014 there must also be a reasonable prospect of getting caught. Lumber limbers up Finally there is one largely un- exploited sector which would appear to offer significant prospects for economic development. 90% of Suriname is covered with trees and, in theory, the country could earn huge sums of money from timber. Until recently, commercial forestry activity was only carried out on a modest scale. Civil strife, including some guerilla activity in the hinterland, hampered prospects for foreign investment but now that peace has been restored, the way is open for new developments. An Indonesian company has already begun logging operations in its The jetty in Paramaribo where shrimps are landed for processing by SAIL 150 000 hectare concession in western Suriname and the government has been negotiating big concessions with a number of other Asian logging companies. At the time The Courier visited the country, the contracts had been concluded and the only remaining hurdle was the need for par liamentary approval. Given the precarious state of the Suriname economy, it is not surprising that the authorities should seek salvation in the country's biggest untapped natural re source. In the absence of sufficient domes tic capital or expertise, it is no surprise either that they should look for foreign investors with experience in the forestry sector. But the policy raises some sensitive environmental questions. Suriname's trees form part of the wider South American rain forest which is often nowadays described as the 'lungs of the world'. Fears about unsustainable exploitation of the resource and the possible consequences for the global climate are increasingly being ex pressed, particularly in the North, where environmental movements have become more vocal (and politically powerful). It is easy to understand why some in the developing countries of the South might resent 'interference' in this area. Many regions of the industrialised world used to be covered in trees which were felled a long time ago in the interests of 'de velopment'. Do societies that failed to sustain their own resources have a right to lecture others on the virtues of sustain- ability? It is a valid question although the response could easily be that those who got it wrong in the past are quite well- placed to caution others against making the same mistakes. The concern is heigh tened when one looks at what has happened to other tropical forest zones in the world, notably in Asia and the Pacific, where the same logging companies operate. In fact, the real issue is not about ivneffier the forests should be exploited \u2014 the economic imperatives are probably too strong to leave them untouched \u2014 but rather over the way in which they are exploited. The government insists that sustainable methods must be employed and clauses to this effect feature in the contracts. The authorities are well aware of the permanent damage sustained by tropical forests elsewhere and argue that the same will not be allowed to happen in Suriname. The aim is, therefore, to ensure the forest can regenerate once the logging companies have taken the mature trees which are suitable for timber. The problem is that this is more expensive than tradi tional 'slash and burn' techniques and the concern must be that corners will be cut. To prevent this happening there has to be effective monitoring and control ? Recog nising that there is insufficient local expert ise, the government is looking to tradi tional aid donors, including the EU, to help out. It seems likely that this request for assistance will be viewed sympathetically. Only time will tell, however, whether the safeguards prove to be adequate, HH SH - \"t the Courier n\u00b0 151 * may-june 1995 ",
        "Staatsolie Rolling o ut t he b a r r e ls OU production in Suriname is never likely to rival that of the Gulf sta tes. Proven reserves are modest and it is not generally thought that new exploration will lead to the dis\u00ad covery of any huge new fields. Despite this, the oil wells of Sur\u00ad iname are playing an increasingly important part in the country's economy. Foreign exchange is in short supply and one of the few economic bright spots of recent years has been the growing pro\u00ad duction of crude oil to the point where the country now meets more than half of its consumption require\u00ad ments (of roughly 13 000 barrels a day). The company responsible for this is Staatsolie, the state\u00adowned oil business. In contrast to a number of other public enterprises, this company has established a reputation for efficiency and dynamism. The following article is an edited version of a text prepared by Staatsolie, which describes the growth and future prospects for petroleum exploi\u00ad tation in Suriname. Petroleum was first discovered in Suriname in 1930 although systematic exploration, did not begin until the 1960s. In 1965, a potentially exploitable find at Calcutta in the Saramacca district was actually made by the Geological and Mining Service, while it was drilling for potable water. A year later, oil was detected in the same district at the village of Tambaredjo and in 1967, there was a further discovery at Weg\u00adnaar\u00adZee near Paramaribo. The peak of this exploration phase occurred in 1969\u00ad70 with the drilling of 20 exploration wells by Shell Inter\u00ad national at various onshore locations near the coast. However, none of the finds were considered potentially profitable at the The 1970s saw a big change as the dramatic increase in oil prices led to a re\u00adevaluation of the commercial value of Suriname's oil reserves. Indeed, the search A pumpjack \u00a1n the oilfield Modem pumping equipment helps to keep the oil flowing for oil became a national obligation \u2014 Suriname was spending more than a third of its foreign currency earnings on pet\u00ad roleum imports and domestic oil produc\u00ad tion offered an important opportunity for foreign exchange savings. In May 1980, an oil commission was appointed by the government to formulate policies for petroleum explor\u00ad ation and production, and to negotiate contracts with foreign companies. After intensive preparations by the commission, the State Oil Company (Staatsolie Maats\u00ad chappij Suriname NV) was officially foun\u00ad ded under the commercial laws of Sur\u00ad iname. All but one of the shares are held by the state. The remaining share is held by the Stichting Planbureau Suriname, a public foundation for development and planning. As of the end of 1993, the company's equity stood at 273 million SFL. Petroleum exploration and pro\u00ad duction activities are carried out under the Petroleum Law of 1990 and Staatsolie is granted exclusive exploration and produc\u00ad tion rights in most of Suriname's sedimen\u00ad tary basin. Other oil companies may participate in these activities under so\u00ad called production\u00adsharing service contracts to be negotiated with Staatsolie. Such participation has, so far, been confined to the offshore area which has attracted several major oil companies in the past. In 1993, Staatsolie signed such a contract with Pecten Suriname Ltd (a subsidiary of Shell US), covering the total offshore basin. the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may^une 1995 r ",
        "c o u n t ry r e p o rt \u2014 S u r i n a me The oil potential of this area remains un proven. At the outset, Staatsolie oper\u00ad ated as an agent for the state, overseeing the exploration activities of foreign oil companies operating in Suriname. How\u00ad ever, it soon began onshore exploration in its own right. Initially, technical assistance was obtained from foreign oil companies operating in the country and with the passage of time, experience and know\u00ad ledge was accumulated. Today, the com\u00ad pany is run and staffed almost exclusively by Suriname nationals. At the end of 1994, the company was employing 455 people in a wide variety of tasks ranging from exploration and production to marketing and sales. Staatsolie began its onshore ex\u00ad ploration with the evaluation of a find of heavy crude in the Tambaredjo area about 55 km west of Paramaribo. A small petroleum deposit was located there, with promising test results, at a depth of 300 metres. In order to obtain better produc\u00ad tion data, a production pilot plant, com\u00ad plete with five wells, and treatment and storage facilities, was installed in 1982. This investment was financed through com\u00ad mercial loans obtained from a consortium of local banks. The oil from this location is low in sulphur content and has been named Saramacca crude after the district. It is extracted using conventional pumping techniques and without any reservoir stimulation. The commercial potential of the test production was established by selling the crude as a cheap burner fuel to local industries, replacing the more expensive refined fuel oils which had to be imported. It is transported to customers in tanker barges owned and operated by Staatsolie. The cash flow resulting from this, together with the experience and technology ac\u00ad quired, have allowed facilities to be expanded annually. By the end of 1994, production had reached 6600 barrels a day from 321 wells. In mid\u00ad1994, the total amount of oil in the Tambaredjo oil field was estimated to be 657 million barrels of which at least 20% can be extracted using conventional techniques. By 1994, 13.7 million barrels had been produced. In 1992, a 55 km pipeline was constructed to transport the crude from the treatment facilities in the field to the distribution Staatsolie storage and treatment facilities in Saramacca terminal located on the Suriname River near the capital. In 1994, about 40% of the crude was exported, mainly for refining in Trinidad, with the remaining 60% being sold to local industries, the largest propor\u00ad tion of which went to the bauxite/alumina sector. Plans for the future include expan\u00ad sion of onshore production to 10 000 barrels a day and the building of a refinery in order to process Saramacca crude locally (Suriname still has to import refined petroleum products). Production expan\u00ad sion is financed from the annual cash flow, together with short term bank loans. The plan is for the refinery to be funded by internally generated cash flow with initial capital coming from government funds and guarantees, and commercial bank\u00ad loans. The funding package was expected to be in place early in 1995. Construction of the refinery will take about 27 months. \u25a0\u25a0 \"I the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may\u00adJune 1995 ",
        "This expression, borrowed from an Indian philosopher, sums up the attitude ofSubhas Mungra who is Suriname's Minister of Foreign Affairs. He quoted it, in a wide\u00ad ranging interview with The Courier, to undertine his message that the world is changing rapidly and that his country has to change with it. The tides of the global economy, like the waters of any river, are constantly on the move. For Mr Mungra, this should be viewed as a challenge rather than a threat. He also has strong views on the importance of new technologies and the free enterprise system. And he sees increas\u00ad ing regional integration as one of the keys to his country's future prosperity. The Minister began by explaining how Suriname's re\u00ad lations with other countries could be used to positive effect to improve the economic situation at home. \u2014 We believe that, in order actively to reinforce our economic recovery programme, the strengthening of our foreign relations, on both a bilateral and multilateral basis, is of great importance. Nowadays, there is no such thing as a domestic economy. There is only one economy, the global one. Given the fact that no country can develop in isolation, there must be a push to strengthen and enhance relations with foreign countries. Normally in economic textbooks you have four factors of production \u2014 labour, natural resources, knowledge and capital. In this global village, international econ\u00ad omic relations should be seen as a fifth factor. That is our basic philosophy. Anyone who thinks you can still operate within closed economic boundaries is living in different world \u2014 and one that has already gone. The globalisation of the economy has, of course, a lot to do with modern communications systems. It took our fore\u00ad fathers, who came from Asia and Africa by sailing ship, three to six months to reach Suriname. Today, I can board an aeroplane in the afternoon and start work next morning at eight o'clock in New Delhi. I can pick up the phone and do business with financial institutions in any country. I can take the fax and communicate with anyone on the globe. Once you are linked to the Internet, you have the world before you at the press of a button. If you buy the proper CD\u00adRom programmes, you have all information contained in every university at your fingertips. So modern communi\u00ad cations systems have changed everything. The trouble is that most people you talk to are still thinking within the framework of the old world, and this is the major challenge. Our philosophy is that you should not see the changes as a threat but rather as a challenge. We need to re\u00ad invent company structures, labour unions and other functional groups within society. Look at what is happening in the USA. There is a corporate revolution going on at the moment ; a completely new approach to management. The same goes for governments, of course, especially in developing countries. Governments which design their policies in the framework of a closed economy are living 10 if not 20 years behind the times. \u25a0 Would that need to reinvent govern\u00ad ment also include reducing its size ? \u2014 Yes, it includes that. We also have to talk about specifics here. What do we mean by re\u00adinventing government? The first thing one must recognise is that, because of modem communications, the political awareness of the population has increased dramatically. So participation at all levels of decision\u00admaking must come increasingly into the picture. It is not just a question of the government deciding. You need to get popular consensus and that means restructuring decision\u00admaking pro\u00ad cesses. This is especially true for developing countries. Today, the whole world is talking about adjustment programmes. We have to adjust, not necessarily because we like it, but because it is a necessity. There was a famous Indian philosopher who said 'you the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may\u00adjune 1995 r ",
        "c o u n t ry r e p o rt \u2014 S u r i n a me never cross the same river twice'. Just as the water in a river is constantly changing, so too is the world we are living in today and our policy must take account of that. \u25a0 You have talked about globalisation. Within that, and as we move towards it, there is also r\u00e9gionalisation taking place. Suriname in a sense, straddles two regions \u2014 the Caribbean one with which you have strong historical ties and the South Amer\u00ad ican one. Where do you see Suriname being placed in a regional context. \u2014 Given that the whole world is being divided into mega\u00adtrade blocs \u2014 the EU, the Pacific Rim countries, the seven new tigers of Asia, Nafta, Mercosur and so on, Suriname has no choice other than to join in the process. Regional integration involves a series of stepping stones. Ob\u00ad viously, the group closest to us is Caricom. We have applied for full membership of this organisation and hope to be part of it by the middle of this year. This means we become part of a market of five million people with a GDP of $500 million. At the same time, given that governments should be looking, not just at the next election but, also at the next generation, we agreed at the meeting in Colombia last year to sign the Charter of the Association of Caribbean States. This is a grouping of all the nations that border the Caribbean including the three big 'G3' nations ; Mexico, Columbia and Venezuela. The market here is much bigger \u2014 195 million people with a GDP of $500 billion. Then there was the summit of the Americas in Miami recently, where we agreed to participate in the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas. This aims to create the biggest market in the world \u2014 800 million people \u2014 by the year 2005. So as you can see, we have clear policy of intensifying regional cooperation. Orienting ourselves more to\u00ad wards our own region means that our previous unilateral dependence on the former colonial power will necessarily be diverted. These steps are important if we are to achieve economies of scale and improve the efficiency of our production. In a bigger market, the most creative entrepreneurs will reap the richest re\u00ad wards. And the message to the private sector is that you can no longer rely on monopolistic practices, tariff barriers or other kinds of protection from the govern\u00ad ment. That is no longer possible. \u25a0 So the policy of state subsidies is no longer viable ? \u2014 No it certainly is not. Of course, what I have just said begs the question as to whether wider economic spaces actually benefit small vulnerable economies like ours. This is a key question to which there is no easy answer. However, realistically, I think there has to be a transition period in which small vulnerable economies have some special arrange\u00ad ments, although I would hesitate to the use word 'protection' here. If this doesn't happen, whole industries may wither in the face of competition from the multi\u00ad nationals. They are able to afford price differentiation when they are penetrating new markets\u2014temporarily offering prices that are lower than production costs so as to eliminate the opposition. So I think there must be some provision for small vulnerable economies while you are in the process of opening the markets. The important thing is that it should be temporary. President Clinton put the point well at the Miami summit. The only answer, he said, when you think your neighbour is beating you is to do even better yourself. \u25a0 You mentioned ending Suriname's dependence on the former colonial power. I have heard comments, both positive and negative, from Surinamese people about your relations with the Netherlands. How would you characterise the situation today ? I would also be interested to hear what you think about your relationship with the European Union \u2014 which is not the same thing, of course. \u2014 I think one should be very realistic. The reality is that this over\u00ad orientation to the Netherlands has, one way or the other, to be changed. Once Suriname is forced to play its proper role in Caribbean regional integration, this will automatically divert attention way from the link with the Dutch. At the same time, we have to recognise that we have close family and historical ties and that we speak the same language. These ties will ob\u00ad viously continue. \u25a0\"\" j* B f \u00a1Sm \u0392 41! 1 \u25a0 ^111 ima \u00c6\u00c5 Subhas Mungra 'A clear policy of intensifying regional integration As for European Union link, that is a different story. Suriname is an ACP member and the EU is one of our major markets. I have talked about exploring and developing a wider economic space in this region, but our entrepreneurs are still oriented towards the European market. And I should say that we have a very good market for our rice and bananas. I think Europe will remain a very important trade partner for us in the coming decades and I see that as a good thing. There is no reason why trade blocs should not cooperate to enhance world trade. The thing that will change is that the blocs, in future, will be dealing with each other on a collective basis, not as individual countries. So for Suriname, the EU will remain very important. I have focused on trade here, but there is also our close cooperation in development policy. I believe that the Lom\u00e9 Conventions have helped to accelerate development in a number of sectors. Of course, there is a view that the decision\u00admaking process could be speeded up and red tape in Brussels could be reduced. We should look at whether the local delegation of the European Commission should not have more authority to decide on projects at the local level. These are just observations which one might make. But the agreement itself, between the EU and the ACP group, is still one which sets an example to the world in modern development cooper\u00ad ation and Suriname is veny happy that we are part of it. ^ the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may\u00adjune 1995 ",
        "c o u n t ry r e p o rt S u r i n a me \u25a0 Sticking with the Lom\u00e9 Convention, one of the demands made by the ACP side is that they should have unrestricted access to the EU market for their agricultural products. Would that be helpful for Suriname ? \u2014 It would be most helpful to Suriname and many other ACP countries who are primarily involved in agricultural production. Some Caribbean countries, notably the banana producers, are reliant on the European market for 80% of their exports. Fortunately, that is not the case for us, but free access to the EU would still be very welcome and would provide us with significant new opportunities. \u25a0 In the same context, new conditional\u00ad ities are being suggested by your European partners. It looks as if, instead of EDF money all being earmarked to national programmes in one tranche, there will now be two stages, with access to the second being dependent on how well the first has been used. There has also been talk of extra political conditions. What is your view about this ? \u2014 Like many ACP countries we are concerned about some aspects of these proposals. As you know, there is a project cycle \u2014 the preparatory stage, project analysis, the financing contract, implemen\u00ad tation, disbursement and finally, evalu\u00ad ation. The degree to which we effectively use the Lom\u00e9 funds depends, of course, on all these steps in the decision\u00admaking process. And as long as we don't know whether the delays have to do with red tape in Brussels, infrastructure problems or poor administration in the developing countries themselves, we should be wary of changes which might simply add to the delays. In particular, if they are due to red tape, you end up punishing the country for slow decision\u00admaking over which it has no control. So I don't think this is the way to do it. But I do think we should study new technologies for closer monitoring and better management of the complete project cycle. We need a better under\u00ad standing of the obstacles for each country or region, and have try to find new measures to enhance the process. I think one possibility would be to have a project pipeline readily available the moment you sign the next Lom\u00e9 Convention. You shouldn't wait to prepare a project and there should be some funding for that. So you have always, so to speak, a selection of projects that are feasible and readily executable. With regard to political con\u00ad straints, we don't think there is any objection to the EU emphasising basic human rights, and of course protecting the environment. We all agree on these points. On human rights, I think it is the obligation of humankind, after 5000 years of civilis\u00ad ation, to force governments to tackle problems at the negotiating table and not by violence. Similarly, we should oblige governments to safeguard the environ\u00ad ment for future generations. \u25a0 There seems to be general agreement that human rights and democracy con\u00ad ditionalities are acceptable \u2014 and indeed desirable. But what about a condition, for example, that a country must be commit\u00ad ted to a free enterprise economic system ? Is that an acceptable requirement to impose in a multilateral treaty like the Lom\u00e9 Convention ? \u2014 This is a very difficult question to answer because it presupposes we all agree on what is the most appropriate economic system for a country. We do know one thing : centrally\u00adplanned econ\u00ad omies are out. It is clear that these don't work. No government can plan consump\u00ad tion behaviour, monetary behaviour, sav\u00ad ings behaviour and investment behaviour for every person in the world. Even Deng Hsiao Ping admitted that a government that does everything for the people deprives them of their talents. So we mustn't interfere with the creativity of individuals. Let them be free to invest, consume and save whatever they like. But having said this, we still haven't really identified the optimum economic development model in the world. All economies are mixed economies, but some have more central planning than others. In Sweden and the Netherlands, there is a lot of central planning. In the US, there is less, but even there, it exists. Everybody agrees that we should promote free markets in one form or another because it is better than having mono\u00ad polies and closed economies, and con\u00ad tributes to general welfare, but the mix of planning and free enterprise differs from country to country. So while we know that the market system should be promoted, I think that to make it a requirement in development cooperation instruments may be going a bit too far. It could lead to unnecessary interference in the so\u00ad vereignty of a country. \u25a0 Is there, perhaps, a contradiction be\u00ad tween a free market condition and the requirement that a country be democ\u00ad ratic ? If the idea that there is only one valid economic model is elevated to a funda\u00ad mental principle, then surely your de\u00ad mocratic choices are reduced to just one possibility ? \u2014 Exactly, and that is why we have to be careful about free market requirements. Look at the problems that have arisen between the IMF and a number of countries. The IMF imposes conditional\u00ad ities to secure monetary and balance of payments targets, but in the process, they restrict the governments' scope for de\u00ad veloping their own monetary and fiscal policies. Of course, this is the only way you can do it, but the key point is that it is only temporary. It is designed to bring about stabilisation where things have got out of hand. Imposing the same conditions in the field of regular development cooperation policy is a very different matter. \u25a0 One final question. Is the IMF going to get involved in structural adjustment in Suriname ? \u2014 Definitely. We recognise that Suriname should have closer cooperation with the Fund. The modalities have yet to be worked out but we are agreed that the IMF should assist Suriname to look into the viability of the programme that is being designed with our European consultant, the Warwick Research Institute. Once the programme is in place, we need the seal of approval and good advice from the IMF. This will help us in attracting the external support that we need and will also help to improve the investment climate. \u25a0\u25a0 Interview by S.H. the Courier n\u00b0 151 * mayjune 1995 r ",
        "The opposition Democratisch Alternatief '91 P r o m o t i ng y o u ng l e a d e r s h ip The election in 1991, which saw the re-establishment of democracy in Suriname, resulted in a clear par\u00ad liamentary majority for the New Front coalition. The two main parties on the opposition benches are the NDP of former military ruler. Desi Bouterse, and Democrat\u00ad isch Alternatief '91 (Democratic Alternative) which is led by Win\u00ad ston Jesserun. The latter grouping draws much of its support from the business community. The Courier met Dr Jesserun and one of his colleagues, praesidium member Ricardo van Raven- swaay to, get an opposition perspective on current affairs in Suriname. In answer to a question about the differences between DA '91 and the government, Dr Jesserun was keen to stress the unitary nature of his party. The four parties of the governing coalition, he suggested, tended to pull in different directions making decision-making more difficult. There was also the linked issue of ethnicism. 'Each party in the coalition represents a different ethnic group,' he said. 'We, on the other hand, are a multiracial organisation, and that is a big advantage'. The youthful leadership of the party was suggested by Mr van Raven- swaay as another key difference. He said that DA '91 was committed to promoting young leadership and that this was in sharp contrast to other political groups, most of which, he stated 'are run by old leaders.' Dr Jesserun went on to speak of policy differences between DA '91 and the government, notably as regards the economy. The latter, he maintained, had presided over a deterioration in economic conditions, 'without implementing any real policies for development.' In practical terms, DA '91 believes that a genuine political commitment to carrying out structural adjustment needs to be made. What was required, according to Mr van Winston Jesserun, Leader of Democratisch Alternatief '91 Ravenswaay, was a comprehensive pro\u00ad gramme, accepted and supported by all the parties in government. The two key objectives, he thought, should be develop\u00ad ment designed to increase foreign ex\u00ad change income, and expenditure reduc\u00ad tions within the government itself. Improve absorption capacity of private sector Reducing government expendi\u00ad ture, of course, entails pain for public servants. Replying to a question as to whether DA '91 could realistically go into an election advocating big cuts (some people suggest that the civil service could be cut by half), Mr van Ravenswaay acknowledged that it was easier to say than to do. 'You can't just throw people on to the street without an income', he admitted, 'but what we need is policies to make sure this doesn't happen. We should simultaneously be developing the private sector so that their absorption capacity in terms of new employees matches the downsizing in the public service.' In addi\u00ad tion, he suggested that a start could be made by removing some civil servants who, he alleged 'just sit there and don't actually work', or who are making money from outside activities. On the subject of privatising state concerns, our interviewees believed that this was 'a must', with an emphasis to begin with on the government-owned companies that make the biggest losses. Dr Jesserun was pessimistic, however, about the prospects for privatisation under the present administration. 'With this govern\u00ad ment,' he suggested, 'it is almost im\u00ad possible because there is a difference of opinion between two of the main groups. The Creoles are afraid that everything will be bought by the Hindustanis.' Turning to the broader problem of structural imbalances in the economy, the DA '91 spokesmen thought that the time had come to bring in the IMF on a more formal footing. While recognising that the work of the Warwick Research Institute in drawing up an SAP could be useful, they felt that the country had effectively exhausted its options, following the ending of EC involvement in this area. This is a highly sensitive subject in Sur\u00ad iname. The country has always resisted a classical SAP drawn up (and some would say imposed) by the IMF and Dr Jesserun thought that the main stumbling block now was a fear in government that it would 'lose face with the electorate.' Mr van Ravenswaay did not believe that any real progress would be made until after the next election. He recognised that the short term effects of structural adjustment are often painful while the benefits were more medium or long-term. 'I don't think it is possible for the government to embark on something which could hurt them at the next election. All they can do is bide their time and hope to cling on to power.' With big forestry concessions due to be agreed with a number of Asian logging companies, the environment is a topical subject at the moment. In fact, in this area, there appears to be no funda- \u039b the Courier n\" 151 \u00b7 may-june 1995 ",
        "c o u n t ry r e p o rt \u2014 S u r i n a me mental disagreement between DA '91 and the government. As Mr van Ravenswaay was anxious to stress 'we are not against foreign investment.' He believed, how\u00ad ever, that it was necessary to 'check the reputation of any company that is willing to invest in our country', and that the agreements in question needed to contain firm environmental safeguards. His main concern was whether Suriname was in a position to ensure that the environmental clauses in the contracts were respected. And like the government, he saw the solution to this problem in getting outside help from international organisations with the appropriate expertise. 'If that can be done, and you can give reassurances to the society, then we don't have any problem with this kind of investment.' The Dutch connection One aspect which clearly dis\u00ad tinguishes DA '91 from the parties of the coalition government concerns relations with the Netherlands, the former metro\u00ad politan power. The government, of course, wants an amicable relationship, but Dr Jesserun hinted strongly at something more than that. As he pointed out : 'We have a close relationship with the Nether\u00ad lands. We have historical ties, we talk the same language and indeed, one third of our people actually live there.' He men\u00ad tioned specifically, the importance of Dutch economic support. Quizzed as to what the relationship might entail, he did not argue for a return to some form of legal dependency, although that option has been mooted in some quarters in the past. There was no question of Suriname giving up its sovereignty, he insisted; 'What we are looking for is some form of Commonwealth'. He acknowledged that Suriname already had an association with the Netherlands but he wanted it to be given more substance. 'The Dutch refuse to do that at the moment', he observed ruefully. DA '91 believes that placing the association with the Netherlands at the heart of its external economic relations policy would be nothing more than a reflection of the practical realities. As Mr van Ravenswaay argued, 'we have to be honest and recognise that we need ex\u00ad ternal assistance to consolidate our de\u00ad mocracy and achieve economic growth.' The problem is that 'it takes two to tango' and the Netherlands does not seem con\u00ad vinced about the utility of releasing funds to support Suriname's development in the absence of significant progress in the field of structural adjustment. DA '91 believes that success for their party at the next election could be enough to induce their hesitant partner back on to the dance floor. Whether that is what the voters of Suriname (and the Netherlands!) want remains to be seen, m S.H. A complex political mosaic I Suriname gained independence from the Netherlands in 1975. It was ruled democratically until 1980 when the elected government was overthrown in a coup staged by army officer. Colonel Desi Bouterse. In 1987, democracy was re\u00adestablished and Colonel Bouterse's party was resoundingly defeated by a three\u00adparty coalition. There were continuing \u039c\u039c\u039c\u0392\u039c\u0397\u039c \u25a0\u039c\u039c\u039c\u039c\u039c\u039c\u039c\u039c tensions, however, between the civilian administration and the military, and in December 1990, the army again seized control. This was a bloodless affair involving a simple telephone call from the army leader to the President ; hence the name, 'the telephone coup'. An interim military\u00adbacked administration took office but only for a short period, and in May 1991, further elections were held. These were won by a four\u00adparty coalition whose chosen candidate for President, Ronald Venetiaan, holds office today. The next elections are due to take place in 1996. The country has a unicameral legislature of 51 seats elected by a list system of proportional representation. The President is chosen by Parliament. Eight parties are currently represented in the chamber \u2014 reflecting the multi\u00adethnic composition of the country as well as a range of ideological positions. The party breakdown is set out in the chart.

        "Eco\u00adtourism ' G e t t i ng a w ay f r om it a takes on a new m e a n i ng For most people, Caribbean tour\u00ad ism conjures up images of sandy white beaches, scuba diving in clear blue waters and sipping daiquiris as the sun sets after another busy day of doing nothing in particular. Although on the South American mainland, Suriname can justifiably claim to be a Caribbean nation. Its popu\u00ad lation is heavily concentrated in the coastal strip, and there are few overland links with the rest of the continent. Having said this, there is not much point going there if you want a beach holiday in a luxurious all\u00ad inclusive resort. Readers of our last issue will recall that we featured Guyana and it is not surprising to learn that the next door country, Suriname, displays similar geog\u00ad raphical features. For the tourist, the coastal waters are muddy and unattract\u00ad ive, thanks to the major rivers which disgorge their contents (silt included) into the seas in this area. Beaches are few and far between and the climate tends to be rather too humid for the comfort of the average vacationer. The Surinamese recog\u00ad nise all this and have no ambitions to rival the Bahamas, Jamaica or St Maarten in the highly competitive mass tourism of the region. Instead, they have sensibly decided to target one particular market niche which exploits some very different attrac\u00ad tions available in the country. With a huge area of underpopulated and often un\u00ad disturbed tropical forest (whose few in\u00ad habitants have been largely isolated from the outside world), Suriname has a hinter\u00ad land which is well\u00adsuited to eco\u00adtourism, and the authorities are keen to expand this sector, currently in its infancy. To some, the term 'eco\u00adtourism' may be a contradiction in terms. Any activity which introduces human beings to virgin territories, or brings so\u00adcalled 'mod\u00ad ern' cultures into contact with traditional ones, is bound to have an impact. The concerns of those who take this somewhat fundamentalist position can only be as\u00ad suaged by having no activity at all, and this is almost certainly an unrealistic dream. The case for eco\u00adtourism is that it offers an opportunity to exploit resources \u2014 in this case the tropical forest \u2014 which might otherwise suffer the depredations of loggers, mining enterprises and road developers. If sufficient regular income can be derived from visitors who are interested in the flora and fauna, and the lifestyle of the forest inhabitants, then the temp\u00ad tation to seek a quick 'one\u00adoff' profit from those who would destroy the resource forever would be greatly reduced. This is an argument that is particularly powerful in countries encountering economic dif\u00ad ficulties. One problem is that there is no clear definition of what is meant by 'ecotourism'. The expression is used by an increasing number of tour operators anx\u00ad ious to tap into this growing market. Environmental awareness is increasing and so too is the desire for 'different' ex\u00ad periences in an increasingly homogenous world. Unfortunately, there must be a suspicion that some operators are simply 'jumping on the bandwagon' without any genuine commitment to preservation of the world's ecological assets. To be fair, this is not an accusation that can be levelled at those who run METS \u2014 the state\u00adowned company responsible for the ecotourist product in Suriname. 'Anxiety and hope' During the Courier's visit to Suriname, we took the opportunity to sample what METS had to offer. The destination is Awaradam on the Pikin Rio river \u2014 one of a small number of resorts (if such a term is appropriate), now up and running in the country's forested hinter\u00ad land. The starting point is the quixotically\u00ad names 'Zorg en Hoop' airport in Para\u00ad maribo. This combination of 'anxiety' and 'hope' might have been specially devised to reflect the sentiment of the country at a time of economic crisis, but it also captures the feeling of the moment, as we ac\u00ad celerate along the multi\u00adsurfaced runway (rutted concrete, grass and compacted mud) in a tiny six seater aeroplane. There are very few roads in the interior and light aircraft, operating from clearings in the forest, offer the only real link between the hinterland villages and the capital. The route takes us over a flat landscape punctuated by houses and tracks. The huge Suralco bauxite and alumina facility is visible to the east but soon after the imprint of man fades to be replaced by a carpet of undulating green. An hour later, we descend through broken cloud towards the treetops, and a surprisingly smooth land\u00ad ing on a grass airstrip. There we are met by Frans Dinge who is to be our host for the next two days. His 'local' name is Jang Jan Man, which means 'the man who loves food' although this is not immediately obvious from his physique. This is Bush Negro country and Frans is a 'local boy \u039b the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may\u00adjune 1995 ",

Incidentally, the expression 'Bush Negro' has not acquired any pejorative overtones here. It is the name given to the descend\u00ad ants of former slaves who fled to the interior during the eighteenth and nine\u00ad teenth centuries. The term 'Maroon', presumably borrowed from Jamaica, is sometimes used instead. Although not indigenous to the area, the Bush Negro communities have established a distinctive and traditional lifestyle in their forest villages. Our party then boards an open canoe\u00adstyle boat \u00ad with an efficient out\u00ad board motor \u00ad for the twenty\u00adminute jour\u00ad ney up the P\u00e9kin Rio to Awaradam. We marvel at the skill of our navigator who deftly steers the vessel on a zig\u00adzag route avoiding submerged rocks and skirting minor rapids. He has obviously done this many times before ! Later, we would experience the same journey at night \u2014 accomplished at a much gentler pace with the additional help of nothing more than a powerful torch. Awaradam itself is a custom\u00ad made 'village' of recent construction on an island in the middle of the river \u2014 the \u00a1deal place for those who want to learn the real meaning of the expression 'getting away from it all'. If your taste is for sumptuous accommodation with en\u00adsuite facilities, hot showers and room service just a phone call away, then you should, perhaps look elsewhere. Genuine eco\u00adtourists, of course, are not looking for five\u00adstar luxury and, in Frans Dinge \u2014 the 'man who loves food' *mi *\u03ba. Below, the boat trip up the Piki n Rio to Awaradam Above, a Suriname Airways plane carrying a party of eco\u00adtourists lands on an airstrip carved out of the forest fact, the village is surprisingly comfortable. Great attention is paid to cleanliness, the toilet facilities are adequate and the huts which provide the sleeping accommod\u00ad ation are nicely designed. Wholesome hot meals are laid on (although the variety is limited) while coffee and tea (serve your\u00ad self) are 'on tap' thoughout the day. There are also some nice individual touches \u2014 the hammocks set up on the balcony of each hut affording a view of the river, the reassuring mosquito nets above each bed and the hot coffee delivered in the morning. Swimming with the piranhas ! The tour organisers lay on a number of different activities for the visitors. A walk in the forest gives us the opportunity to learn how the people have adapted to living with their environment, without destroying it. It seems that every tree provides material for some aspect of daily life \u2014 construction materials for the houses, food and traditional medicines. A visit to some neighbouring Bush Negro villages allows us to find out more about the local lifestyle and traditions. Then there is 'shooting the rapids' without a boat \u2014 an exhilirating experience which is not as dangerous as it sounds. The news that we are sharing the waters with piranhas as we float downstream is alarm\u00ad ing but it seems that the reputation of these 'killer\u00adfish' is an unfair one \u2014 especially here, where they do not swim in shoals. Finally, we are treated to a spec\u00ad tacle of local culture one evening. The importance of the oral tradition is under\u00ad lined in the songs which are replete with the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may\u00adjune 1995 f\" ",

The local children join in the dancing and audience particip\u00ad ation is also expected ! The overall experience is a mem\u00ad orable one, and we leave Awaradam with a better understanding of how the Bush Negros live \u2014 and of the importance of preserving their natural environment if their lifestyle is to be maintained. There is a downside too. Awaradam welcomes a manageable number of tourists \u2014 roughly forty a month at present \u2014 but even this modest number is bound to have some impact. Visiting the villages is fascinating, and the people are welcoming, but one is slightly uncomfortable about the fact that, within a few days, another group of outsiders will pass through, and then another.... More tourists means more income but if the tourism is to be genuinely 'ecological', then it needs to be kept on a very limited scale. METS offers similar tours to the areas inhabited by the original Indian inhabitants, whose customs and lifestyles are surprisingly different from those of their Bush Negro neighbours. Combined trips are also possible with modestly\u00adpriced accommodation available in Paramaribo. It Sleeping accommodation at Awaradam : basic, but surprisingly comfortable must be said that the range of activities is somewhat limited and a more varied programme may be needed for those who plan to spend longer periods in the country. Another negative feature, which affects both tourists and businesspeople visiting the country, is the international airport. This can hardly be described as A warm welcome from the children \u2014 but how long can their lifestyle be maintained ? A cultural evening laid on for the tourists The importance of the oral tradition is underlined in the songs' 'user\u00adfriendly' and the arrival of big aircraft (particularly from Amsterdam), is usually accompanied by chaotic scenes. The bureaucratic formalities at the airport can be time\u00adconsuming and frustrating. The same goes for a visit to the bank which all visitors must fit in at some point during their stay, given the obligation to change a minimum sum of money into the local currency. Despite these irritants, it is clear that Suriname is striving to provide a distinctive and attractive 'eco\u00adtourism' product which exploits the country's natural assets without destroying them in the process. The hope must be that this approach will be maintained as the plan\u00ad ned expansion of the sector takes place, \u03b2 s.H ",

        "EU\u00adSuriname cooperation S u p p o r t i ng e c o n o m ic r e s t o r a t i on by Rolf Smit * Suriname has been associated with the European Community since the | Treaty of Rome in 1957. Initially, i the association was based on its i status as a Dutch OCT but since I 1975, when the country gained f independence, Suriname has been i a signatory to the Lom\u00e9 Conven\u00ad \u2122\"\u00bb\u2122* tion. In this capacity, it has par\u00ad ticipated actively in the different institutions set up under the Convention and has benefited both from the preferential trade advantages and from the aid instruments of the system. To date, financial allocations to Suriname under the four Lom\u00e9 Conventions have amounted to ECU 87 million. Addi\u00ad tional resources have been made available to the country under the regional pro\u00ad gramme. Suriname has a good natural resource base with fertile coastal plains suitable for agricultural production, mi\u00ad neral wealth, extensive forests and rich fishing grounds. It also suffers, however, from the constraints of a small population, which means a limited domestic market and high per capita costs for infrastructure. The situation has been aggravated by massive emigration, often of educated and skilled people. This occurred especially after independence but continues today. Ambitious development programmes, high government spending and frequent changes in the country's leadership during the 1980s led to macro\u00adeconomic imbal\u00ad ances, including high inflation and scarcity of foreign exchange. In 1989 the Govern\u00ad ment sought the assistance of the Euro\u00ad pean Commission in addressing these problems. For the next three years, the Commission's role in Suriname was closely associated with the discussions on the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP). During 1990, a Programme for Recovery, Growth and Adjustment was elaborated by the EDF\u00adfinanced consult\u00ad ants Coopers and Lybrand. This was submitted to the Suriname authorities but within a few days, the Government was toppled in what has become known as the 'telephone coup'. Discussions on the SAP resumed a year later following the instal\u00ad lation of the democratically\u00adelected Pre\u00ad sident Venetiaan. With the approval of the Surinamese version of the adjustment programme by Parliament in November 1992, the Government invited the EC to take on the role of external monitor. Despite lengthy discussions between the Commission's services and the Government on the modalities for monitoring, it was not possible to reach agreement and in June 1993, it was decided that the Com\u00ad mission would not act as external monitor of the SAP. Accordingly, any future in\u00ad volvement of the EC in the SAP will be in the framework of the Lom\u00e9 Convention. Democracy consolidated In the political field the govern\u00ad ment has succeeded in recent years in pacifying the country and consolidating the d\u00e9mocratisation process. The role of the army has been reduced and it has basically become a loyal instalment of the government. However, the reinforced democratic rule has not yet led to econ\u00ad omic progress, and this remains the prime objective of the Government. With this in mind, they contracted with the Warwick Research Institute of the United Kingdom to assist in the preparation and monitoring of the structural adjustment programme. Discussions with the IMF, aimed at achiev\u00ad ing closer collaboration, are also under way. The government's priorities and strategies are set out in the Multi\u00adAnnual Development Plan (MDP) for 1994\u00ad1998. This lists as the main objectives, the restoration of financial and monetary equilibrium, the growth of the export sectors, and the promotion of investment and employment.

Enthusiastic response to micro-project programme A micro-project programme has been approved and is being implemented. This scheme has been given an enthusiastic response from many people at the grass roots. As is the case in many other ACPs where such programmes are being carried out, the aim here is to improve the socio economic position of lower income groups through the promotion of self-help and participation. The road project approved under Lom\u00e9 IV is part of a wider programme to re habilitate the whole of the 376 km-long coastal route. This road provides the only overland connection with the neighbour ing countries of French Guyana and Guyana. It is also the backbone of Sur iname's road infrastructure, serving 90% of the population and most of the agricul tural production. The cost of the project is ECU 9.7 million. Approval is expected shortly for an expenditure of ECU 3.2 million on a rice research and breeding station. This inter vention is designed to increase the compe titiveness of rice production and exports, through the supply of improved seed material and production technology. The sustainability of the project should be assured by the imposition a levy on rice exports, to be used to finance the oper ational and replacement costs of the station. Currently the Government is ne gotiating large-scale forestry concessions with Asian companies for timber extrac tion and export. This offers the possibility of substantial returns but the potential risks to the forest are high, especially in the absence of a monitoring and control body. To make good this deficiency, the Govern ment has sought EDF finance to prepare a project dossier with a view to setting up just such a body. The study will be carried out in the coming months. As regards the Part of Suriname's main coastal road. The European Union has funded significant sections of this key transport artery future management of the forest re sources, a recently approved project with the University of Paramaribo, for a remote sensing facility, could play an important role. This project is financed from a special Commission budget line. Other schemes currently being prepared include a tourism development programme, a training scheme for high level Surinamese staff involved in adjust ment activities, an Aids prevention pro gramme, and a drugs demand reduction programme.

        "c o u n t ry r e p o rt \u2014 S u r i n a me The overall focus is very strongly on improving production and export capabilities, and thus foreign exchange earnings, as well as on creating employ ment and the conditions for a more stable economy and society. Trade benefits The main benefits for Suriname under the Lom\u00e9 Convention are to be found in the trade field. All of the country's rice and banana exports go to the EU market under preferential access con ditions. For rice the ACP countries benefit from a special quota of 125 000 tons of cargo rice and 20 000 tons of broken rice, with a 50% import tariff reduction. Since 1991, rice from Suriname has been going through the Dutch Antilles where value is added through processing. Thereafter, it receives 'EU origin' status which means that on export to Europe, it is exempted from import duties and quantitative re strictions. This route is very attractive and accordingly, almost no use has been made by Surinamese exporters of the ACP quota in recent years. The financial advantage amounts to at least ECU 200 per ton. With an export volume of some 80 000 tons per year, this represents a total benefit of about ECU 16m. For bananas the ad vantage is ECU 75 per ton. With a quota of 38 000 tons, the additional earning poten tial amounts to almost ECU 3m. These advantages are consider able, but the future for them is uncertain. They are contested by countries which are not eligible for the same treatment, including the United States, which has a special interest in both the banana and rice industries. It has publicly announced its opposition to the preferential trade re lations under the Lom\u00e9 Convention. It is therefore important that Suriname in crease its efficiency in these sectors in order Inspecting EDF-funded polder works at Coronie to be able to confront the competition. The EU is helping in this through both the rice research and breeding station, and a support programme for the banana indus try, financed from a special Commission budget line. Under the regional programme, Suriname is implementing a ferry project with.Guyana designed to improve the links between the two countries. There is also a regional airport improvement programme in the pipeline. Other ongoing and future regional programmes of benefit to Sur iname cover sectors such as tourism, human resource development, agriculture, the environment and trade. Recently it has been established that Suriname is eligible for support from the Sysmin fund under Lom\u00e9 IV, and project dossiers in the energy and com munication sectors are now being pre pared. Finally, through the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Centre for the Development of Industry (CDI), Sur iname has received additional technical and financial assistance, especially for developing its industrial base. Technical and market information is also made available to Surinamese entrepreneurs through the publications and activities of COLEACP and the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA). Looked at as a whole, the pro jects, programmes and other interventions described above amount to a significant engagement by the EU in Suriname's efforts to achieve lasting development, H R.S. lass \u00bftek.

        "Schengen o p e ns t he w ay f or f r ee m o v e m e nt of p e o p le Free movement of people is finally to bcome a reality, at least for seven of the nine countries which have signed the Schengen agreement. These countries, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain, have three months to remove all frontier controls with other signatory states, starting from Sunday 26 March. Greece and Italy aim to implement the agreement at a later date. For David Williamson, the European Commission's Secretary General, this new freedom is not to be equated with insecurity. Quite the reverse in fact. He gives his reasons in an interview with '7 Jours Europe' (7 Days in Europe), the weekly organ of the Commission's representation in France. Below, we reproduce an abridged version of what he said : I \u25a0 The Schengen agreement has I just come into force between seven EU Member States. What concrete effects will this have on their citizens ? \u2014 For the first time, it will be possible to cross certain internal frontiers within the Union without being subject to personal checks. This is important for both political and practical reasons. In a political context, it proves that the aim in the Single European Act to eliminate controls on the movement of people within the single market is realistic, as long as the political will exists among Member States. Schen\u00ad gen points the way forward for the whole Union and I am very pleased about that. As for the practical reasons, the first point is that everyone benefits from the new freedom. There will be no discrimination between citizens of the Union, depending on whether or not they are nationals of the 'Schengen states'. In concrete terms, free circulation will apply as much to a French\u00ad man as to an Italian or a citizen of the UK. Nor will there be any discrimination at the internal frontiers between Union citizens and those of other countries. Nationals of non\u00adEU countries who are normally resident in one of the seven 'Schengen states' may in future travel to any of the others without a visa. The residence permit will constitute ex\u00ad emption from the need to obtain a visa for stays of less than three months. Moreover, nationals of states not belonging to the EU who enter from outside will no longer have to have several visas to travel to the seven countries applying the Schengen agree\u00ad ment. A visa issued by any one of them wil I be recognised by the others. I should emphasise that 26 March marks a beginning rather than an end. Italy and Greece have also signed the agree\u00ad ment while Denmark has indicated its interest in not being left out of the area where people can move freely. Addi\u00ad tionally, the new Member States, Austria 1 , Finland and Sweden, have expressed their intention to show their citizens that they belong to the Union in this concrete form. \u25a0 What will happen at airports ? \u2014 The elimination of controls applies whatever mode of transport is used. In the case of road and rail, this means eliminating controls which up to now have generally been implemented by simple spot checks. But the main innov\u00ad ation is at the airports. A special area reserved for passengers coming from other Schengen states is to be set aside in every major airport within the seven countries. Checks will no longer be made on people entering or leaving this area, who will be treated in exactly the same way as domestic ticket\u00adholders \u2014 in other words, only subject to the security checks that apply to all flights, to ensure the safety of passengers. \u25a0 Is there not a danger that the new system will lead to more illegal immig\u00ad ration and greater freedom of action for terrorists and criminals ? \u2014Contrary to what some people believe, internal security is more effectively taken care of between countries which have eliminated their frontiers with one another than between those which retain a number of non\u00adsystematic border con\u00ad trols. Indeed, controls within the 'Schen\u00ad gen area' were only eliminated because effective and modern ways of cooperating between police forces were ready to replace them. As for illegal immigration, by establishing stronger controls at the ex\u00ad ternal frontier, the Schengen countries have provided themselves with effective ways of acting together to combat unau\u00ad thorised frontier crossings. It should be emphasised that the arrangements for issuing a national visa must take account of the security needs of the other Member States. This will be a much more effective system than the present one, in which failure to obtain a visa in one Member State can be evaded by first passing through another in which the desired visa is issued. Regarding migration within the Schengen area, it would be anomalous for a national from an outside country who is legally resident in one Member State to become an illegal immigrant in another. It should moreover be pointed out that the principle of readmission remains sacred : for example, an Uzbek who has entered France illegally via Germany must be readmitted by Germany, since that is the country through which he entered the Schengen area. Development of terrorism and organised crime has unfortunately not waited for the elimination of internal \"frontiers. We must have the courage to recognise that current frontier controls between EU member states do not provide a barrier against this scourge. How many criminals have unfortunately succeeded in crossing internal frontiers despite such controls? New forms of cooperation be\u00ad tween police forces will be much more effective, in particular thanks to the 'Schengen information system', which is a central database of wanted people and objects. This must be accompanied, in each country in question, by legislation to protect personal data. It means that a person wanted by the police will no longer be able to evade pursuit by crossing an internal frontier. The same applies to drug seizures which, incidentally are much more frequently the result of good police intelligence than of spot checks at fron\u00ad tiers. \u25a0\u25a0 Interview by F. de Fouch\u00e9cour\u00adCozals 1 Since this interview took place, Austria has signed the Schengen Agreement. the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00ad may^une 1995 r ",
        "The t u r b ot w ar On 9 March, Canadian coastguards stopped and inspected the Spanish trawler Estai in international waters, over 200 miles off the coast of Newfoundland. On 13 March, the European Union decided to freeze relations with Canada. What very quickly came to be called 'The Turbot War' in the media was the direct consequence of a dispute over fishing between Canada and Europe which had been simmering for some time. The most recent disag reement between Ottawa and the EU began at the beginning of February at a meeting of the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO). This organisation, which groups together 15 countries and whose aim is to regulate fishing and to protect fish stocks, decided to reduce the 'total allowable catch' of turbot from 60 000 to 27 000 tonnes. This decision, which was intended to conserve turbot stocks, was not opposed by the Union. However, Brussels protested against the distribution of quotas among the inter ested countries. In fact, during voting, although the NAFO usually conducts its business on the basis of consensus, Canada succeded in obtaining 60% of the quota of authorised catches compared with only 12.6% for European fishermen. The main parties involved in this case are Spain and Portugal which, in 1994, fished 80% of the 60 000 tonnes of what is also referred to as the Greenland halibut. After the vote, the EU asked the NAFO Member States not to ratify this distribution and unilaterally awarded itself a quota of 18 630 tonnes, i.e. almost 70% of the total. The Canadian riposte was not long in coming. They accused the Europeans of not accepting NAFO's majority decision unless it suited them. Ottawa also declared itself prepared to 'prevent the European Union laying waste the turbot stocks' in the same way as it had already 'devastated' the cod fisheries. Canada has long accused Spanish and Portuguese trawlers of being the cause of turbot depletion. Although it is difficult to determine who is principally respon sible, given that Canadian and American vessels also fish in the zone in question, there is, no doubt that stocks of turbot and of fish in general have fallen to critical levels. A study carried out by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) re veals that 70% of fish stocks are, to a greater or lesser extent, close to depletion and that turbot has declined by over 60%. Fish do not respect frontiers In response to the threat to the North Atlantic fishing grounds, the Ca nadian authorities decided under national law, in 1994, to extend their jurisdiction beyond the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone. The EU properly pointed out that this was contrary to the law of the sea. However, although from a legal stand point the Canadian legislation is ques tionable, it is understandable from an ecological point of view. Greenland ha libut, like other migrating fish, do not respect frontiers. It is therefore necessary to limit catches both inside and outside the EEZs if the 'overlapping' stocks of halibut are to be conserved adequately. In full stride, now, Canada, which has for many years been self-appointed 'defender' of fish stocks, proposed a sixty-day mora torium on halibut fishing. This proposal was rejected by the EU. Paying this rejection no heed, at the beginning of March, Ottawa gave the Spanish and Portuguese trawlers present on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland notice to leave the area. Having complied with this order for 24 hours, some 15 Spanish vessels returned to the zone. Ottawa was not slow to react. On 9 March, after a dramatic pursuit, Canadian coastguards detained the Spanish trawler Estai. Although this action on the part of Canada seriously aggravated relations between Ottawa and Brussels, Canadians and, in particular, fishermen in coastal provinces were fully behind the govern ment's decision. The boarding of the vessel unleashed an upsurge of nationalist feeling which was much to the satisfaction of the Federal Government. The independence referendum campaign in Quebec was in full swing and there is nothing like the nomination of a foreign 'enemy' to re- invigorate feelings of national solidarity. Finally, although the Canadian authorities are, first and foremost, stressing the ecological argument to justify their actions, there is no doubt that economic consider ations also played a part. According to an EU spokesman, the Canadians are hoping, through their manoeuvring, to pick up a larger slice of the cake, ecology coming only second. However, regardless of the motives offered, in this case economic concerns and ecology are closely linked. In fact, if turbot stocks continue to decline at the current rate, all nations fishing for this species will suffer. 'Piracy' or ecological imperative ? The conflict, which saw a rapid deterioration of relations between the two sides, with Brussels accusing Ottawa of piracy and the Canadians accusing the Europeans of taking part in an ecological massacre, receded somewhat in the wake of the release of the Estai and its crew. The EU and Canada returned to the negotiat ing table and managed to reach a settle ment after some long and hard talks, over the Easter weekend. This agreement may serve as a model for the UN sponsored negotiations on managing underwater stocks in the high seas which resumed in March 1995. In any event, the dispute has served to highlight the problem of too many fishermen chasing too few fish, and has concentrated the minds of those involved on the importance of sustainable practices and effective conservation, m Francis Caas * * Trainee with the ACP-UE Courier. \"I the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may-june 1995 ",
        "Social development This Dossier was organised by The Courier to mark the First World Summit on Sodai Development held in Copenhagen from 6-12 March. As is clear from the name, this international meeting was the first ever to focus exclusively on social issues and it was convened at an appropriate time, with most regions of the world, whether rich or poor, affected by some form of social malaise. The presence in Copenhagen of a record 130 world leaders demonstrated widespread concern about a possible 'social breakdown'as the present century draws to a close. The Courier analyses the Summit and its results, and expands on some of the key issues. The C o p e n h a g en S u m m it A h u n g er f or f o od a nd j u s t i ce The Copenhagen conference was I the first UN summit to deal with the 'little' people or, as an official put it, people with a hunger for food and justice. But there is many a slip twlxt cup and lip. Interests diverged greatly and people were fearful of breaking the fragile com promises reached in the preparatory meet ings. Everyone attending had come to make a declaration of faith. You got out what you put in, and those who wanted to be happy were happy, while those who expected to be disappointed had their expectations fulfilled. They were all, or nearly all, there. And very few went so far as to claim that the outcome wasn't worth the effort. At first sight the Declaration of the heads of government and the Action Programme, the two official documents signed at the Summit, seek to tackle the social challenges facing the planet 'head- on'. The Declaration includes such resol utions as 'we commit ourselves to working towards eliminating poverty in the world', 'we commit ourselves to making it possible for everyone to earn a living... and to continue to move towards full em ployment'. The Action Programme aims to 'reduce poverty' and even refers at one point to its 'elimination'. It repeats the list of objectives of certain specialist agencies of the UN: 80% of children to complete primary education by 2005 (Unicef), 42 developing countries out of 95 having already achieved this aim; 35 mortalities for every thousand live births, the current annual average being 70 per thousand and a reduction by three quarters in serious cases of malnutrition among children less than five years old (WHO); official de velopment 'assistance at a level of 0.7% of the gross national product (GNP) of donor countries, 20% of such assistance being devoted to social needs. The programme has set 1996 as the deadline for cancel lation of the bilateral debt of the least developed countries (LDCs). Following up these good intentions is no less important. Thus, the Summit texts talk of the need to reduce military expenditure and expendi ture on armaments 'as far as possible' in order to increase the resources available for social and economic development. A second reading of the official documents reveals that most commit ments are fixed neither in terms of figures nor of implementation deadlines. The heads of government state that they 'intend to' take, or 'envisage' taking action. Phrases such as 'asfar as possible' or 'as soon as possible' are used to qualify statements of intent. Heated exchanges Whereas some unexpected alli ances were forged at the Cairo Population conference, in Copenhagen there was a clear divide on most topics between North and South. The only qualification to this is that some European countries, notably from Scandinavia, often supported the developing countries. From the preparatory committee stage onwards, this 'divide' manifested itself in a variety of areas. The Group of 77 (developing countries plus China) wanted to set the year 2000 as the deadline for achievement of the 0.7% GNP target. Japan and the USA opposed this. Most Northern countries rejected demands for debt cancellation. Nor did the USA and Canada wish to hear any talk of 'new and additional financial resources' for social development, a phrase which cropped up in an initial version of the preparatory document. The final document only spoke of envisaging ways of finally solving the problems posed by servicing debt. Another point of disagreement concerned immig ration. The USA wanted a situation in which only legal residents would be permitted to benefit as migrants from the 'essential services' provided by states to the most needy. For their part, developed coun tries pressed for the inclusion of undertak ings on sustainable development. The G77 took the view that the conference was not about the environment and that if the rich countries insisted on returning to the 'Agenda 21' agreed at Rio, then they should also be ready to meet the financial commitments made in this connection. The 'battle' of the parentheses The documents were all but finalised during the preparatory stage and the seven days in Copenhagen were only to be concerned with 'the words in parentheses', i.e. the points on which no agreement had been reached. This did not make the discussions any the less heated and their vehemence increased as the day of arrival of the heads of government approached. One of the final episodes in the 'battle' of the parentheses was a confron tation between the USA and Cuba, the the Courier n\u00b0 151 - may-june 1995 r ",
        "d o s s i er latter supported by the G77. Cuba de fended the text put forward, according to which states would 'refrain from applying coercive unilateral measures in violation of international law which hinder economic and social development'. The last-minute compromise was that the signatories would 'avoid applying coercive measures which are not in accordance with inter national law and the UN Charter and which undermine commercial relations between states'. The week was full of similar incidents, with the Action Programme provoking most of the disagreements. The final text of its first chapter, concerning encouragement for social development, demands that ODA be increased 'as soon as possible bearing in mind the economic circumstances and the assistance capabi lities of countries...' The 'right to de velopment' gave way to a commitment 'to take measures to ensure development'. Regarding finance, the wording 'such resources must be both adequate and predictable' became 'maximising their availability'. Instead of 'ensuring high- quality employment', it will be necessary to respect the ILO agreements relating to this issue. Regarding the eradication of poverty (chapter 2), access to preventive health care is no longer guaranteed, the representatives calling for primary health care services to be 'free and affordable'. On the other hand, the G77 managed to 'ensure' that a social security network be included in structural adjustment program mes which would have to be designed so as to reduce their negative effects. The offer of 'basic health services' was also upgraded to the 'highest possible level of physical and mental health' The text includes a number of other advances, following the addition of paragraphs on the advance ment of women, education about HIV/ AIDS, raising environmental awareness and recognition of the links between the labour market and education policies. This should probably be regarded as a success, attributable to NGO lobbying. Definition of the resources to be allocated to these education and health objectives remains elusive, as does everything regarding financing. The Action Programme talks of mobilising 'additional financial resources... both bilateral and private, including loans on concessionary terms'. Once again, there was a failure to specify amounts and resources. The inter national fund for social development, called for by the developing countries and NGOs, which would have given greater credibility to the decisions made at the Summit, was not established. A veto by most of the rich countries prevented inclusion in the final declaration of a tax on financial transactions. This has been pro posed by James Tobin, the winner of the Nobel Economics Prize, and was advocated in Copenhagen by numerous leaders of developing countries, notably the Guyanese President Cheddi Jagan, as well as by President Mitterrand of France and the Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. Measures to encourage expan sion of productive employment and reduce unemployment were confined to a call for ILO standards to be respected. Regarding the burning issue of arms spending, a call for this to be reduced 'without necessarily compromising security' was toned down by the recognition of 'legitimate national defence requirements'. A new section was added on social integration and family responsibilities, calling for support for families, a sense of responsibility on the part of family members, mutual respect and equal partnership between men and women. One disappointment for the de veloping countries was the absence of concrete provisions on the implementation of undertakings made at the Summit. The necessary resources will no longer be 'available' as envisaged in the initial text. There is now only a simple call for them to be 'adequate, predictable and mobilised in order to maximise their availability'. The undertaking for developed countries to commit 0.7% of their GNP to ODA before the year 2000, which was passed in Rio at the request of the European countries, has vanished into thin air. Regarding the problem of resources, the developing countries, with a few reservations, have nonetheless reacted positively to the 20/20 prindple (20% of ODA from the developed countries and 20% of the national budgets of the developing countries to be allocated to basic social programmes). Hopes raised over debt The developing countries also reacted favourably to the invitation to the World Bank and IMF to adopt 'an innovat ive approach in order to assist low-income countries with significant multilateral debts in order to reduce the burden of debt'. The explicit reference to Africa's bilateral debt disappeared, to the great displeasure of that continent. But hopes about debt cancellation were initially raised only to be dashed subsequently. This hope was fed by a gesture from Denmark, which announced at the outset that it would cancel the debt owed to it by developing countries to the tune of $166 million. Denmark made an impassioned plea for others to display similar gene rosity. Information emanating from a number of developing country even en couraged the belief that their moderate stance in the debates was due to a desire not to upset Western leaders who were likely to follow Denmark's example. But the widely-awaited effect of Denmark's announcement failed to ma terialise. Only Austria responded, writing off debt amounting to about $100 million. There was a passionate plea from Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, who expressed the view that his earlier decision to write off LDC debts owed to France was the most generous to be taken by a rich country. This is true in absolute if not relative terms (Denmark is a much smaller country). Prime Minister Rasmussen returned to the attack at the end of the Summit by urging his counter parts to display generosity in the next few months. But there must be some concern that his voice was submerged in the hubbub of a meeting drawing to its close. The Bretton Woods institutions and numerous Western countries, under the leadership of the USA, sought to demonstrate that debt cancellation would have few positive effects, and might even be harmful to developing countries. It would be interesting to know if these arguments caused some people to waver in their conviction ? Certainly, the Eritrean President, lasaias Afwerki expressed the view that such a write-off would not help many African countries, arguing that their main problems lay elsewhere. A policy almost without substance The discussions on the Declar ation were characterised by less North- South controversy than those on the Action Programme, with moral issues more to the fore. Immediately before the heads of government arrived, last minute pressure was exerted to bring about a modification of undertaking number 10 of the Declaration relating to education and health. Iran demanded that the text should give religious groups the status of partners \"I the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may-June 1995 ",
        "d o s s i er in the provision of education, and won its case despite Tunisia's opposition. On religious intolerance, the basic text called for 'the application where appropriate of laws and other regulations against racism, racial discrimination, religious intolerance, xenophobia and all forms of discrimination at all levels of society'. The words 'where appropriate' appeared in brackets. In diplomatic parlance, this term is used to imply that an obligation has priority over national legislation. Japan and the USA supported Iran against the European countries. Finally the term 'appropriate laws' was included instead and Iran suc\u00ad ceeded in having religious intolerance qualified by 'in all its forms', which addition was supposed to diminish the strictness of the stipulation. As usual in this kind of international sparring match, the Vatican supported Iran, which also found a rather more unusual ally in Benin. Despite the obvious concern of many to avoid overly political topics at the Summit, the discussion surrounding this tenth undertaking brought politics back onto the agenda. When, for example the UN Secretary General, Boutros Boutros\u00ad Ghali, reiterated his conviction that a number of serious social problems found all over the planet should be dealt with in a global way, the Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng fiercely defended the right of each country to determine its own social system, opposing what he perceived as a desire to interfere. And there was, of course, the ongoing confrontation between Cuba and the USA. Behind the scenes, one issue which is now a recurring theme, was the increasing part played by the Vatican State in UN conferences, as self\u00adappointed 'ar\u00ad biter' in decisions where moral issues are involved. The desirability of giving priority to the Vatican over other religious faiths was once again questioned. Summit of fear? Another increasingly common situation at international conferences is the habit of a number of countries (often the same ones) of making reservations on everything relating to procreation and the family. On this occasion, the Holy See, Argentina, Ecuador, Sudan and Malta expressed reservations in this area. Iraq also made a reservation relating to its own particular circumstances, arguing that the social consequences of trade sanctions had not been sufficiently emphasised. Apart from this, the Declaration and Action Programme were signed by 120 leaders attending the Summit. However, despite the apparent unanimity, it was not possible to conceal the frustrations felt by participants. These came to the surface in the course of press conferences and post\u00ad Summit declarations, and sometimes found expression in outbreaks of humour. The contribution of the President of Gabon, Omar Bongo, who provided an improvisation on the theme of the selfish\u00ad ness of the rich who have gained their riches from the poor will not be forgotten. A similar memorable moment occurred when Gro Harlem Bruntland drew atten\u00ad tion to the sign displaying the demands of the NGOs which was mounted at the entrance to the Summit meeting room. Ms Bruntland, the Prime Minister of Norway, had previously made scathing comments about her Northern counter\u00ad parts who set off for Copenhagen with 'pockets full of air and mouths full of promises'. Before a panel of world leaders, she gave a parody of Martin Luther King, mocking the seven days of declarations made at the Bella Centre and claiming that any attempt to use them to pay bills would quite rightly be turned down by a bank with the words 'bounced cheque'. It is worth remembering that her country is part of a select group of just four countries (the others are Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands) that have achieved the 0.7% GNP objective for ODA. The Swedish Prime Minister, in his turn, called on the West to avoid replacing the cold war with 'cold feet' isolationism. Another member of the chorus of protestors, Cheddi Jagan of Guyana, made the following critical remark: 'We have come to the Summit and all we have heard about is free trade in one big integrated hemisphere'. He went on to cite, with irony, an example of the 'benefits' of free trade. The Caribbean Basin Initiative launched by President Reagan in the 1980s to assist the countries of the region had led to a doubling of US exports to the Basin between 1984 and 1993. US imports of Caribbean goods remained severely limited. The 'benefit', of course, is for the United States ! The plea by President Mitterrand for a 'Tobin Tax', named after the aforementioned winner of the Nobel Economics Prize was very well received in Copenhagen. But the President of Guyana advocated this a long time ago. in his analysis entitled 'Global Human Order'. He considers that a 'Tobin Tax' of just 0.1% would yield billions. The Nether\u00ad lands, for their part, regretted that ques\u00ad tions of poverty and exclusion in the Northern countries had not been broach\u00ad ed. Complete optimists were rare although US representatives were certainly 'upbeat'. They were keen to extol the provisions relating to the elimination of poverty, programmes of structural adjust\u00ad ment, advancement of women, workers' rights and the integration of the handicap\u00ad ped and other marginal groups. On the other hand, those who felt the Summit had achieved nothing were also thin on the ground. Most considered that though it did not yield tangible results, it will certainly act as a catalyst and a starting point for a new awareness of problems. Boutros Boutros\u00adGhali considered that the presence of so many heads of government was an encouraging sign, and could be taken as assurance that the Summit would bear fruit. This was especially true now that there is general acceptance of the view that today's serious social problems stem from a lack of security which affects the whole of humankind. While declaring support for the alternative NGO declar\u00ad ation, Juan Somavia, the Chilean diplomat who organised the conference, stated that the Summit had delivered a message of change and that it would enable the least regarded members of humanity to return to the stage. He thought that the commit\u00ad ment to eradicate poverty was of historical importance. In the name of G77, the Philippines representative, Cielito Habito stated that the meeting had been very worthwhile regarding debt, the possibility of new resources and the 20/20 arrange\u00ad ment. Others saw the Summit as a success because heads of government had taken part out of fear that a social cataclysm affecting the whole world may follow on from the more limited cata\u00ad strophes which have marred the new world order. This could be termed the 'Rwanda\u00adBosnia\u00adChechnya' effect.

        "Delors b e h i nd t he scenes at t he S u m m it 'Saving Lom\u00e9 is of great political importance, not only for those countries which are signatories to the Lom\u00e9 Convention, but also for the political unity of Europe. ' Jacques Delors, the former Pre\u00ad sident of the European Commis\u00ad sion, whose opinion is sought by a large number of international bodies, (in this case by the or\u00ad ganisers of the first UN Social Summit), was at Copenhagen as a matter of course. After the press conference given by the French President, which he attended, the Courier asked him briefly if he was keeping up\u00adto\u00addate with the po\u00ad sition regarding the ACP countries, espe\u00ad cially following the ups and downs of the ACPIEU negotiations on mid\u00adterm review of the Lom\u00e9 Convention. We also thought it would be interesting to give Mr Delors' opinion on the Summit which he expressed in response to a question from another journalist. Jacques Delors I think that the idea of a social convention (defended by President Mitterrand at the press conference \u2014 ed.) is linked to a proposal which I put forward at a Council where we discussed the subject of econ\u00ad omic security. This was to bring together all the international organisations and not to focus solely on monetary aspects or short term adjustment. What is needed in reality is to ensure lasting development in a healthy and stable economic climate and the 'take\u00adoff' of those countries which have not yet achieved this goal. It will, however, be impossible if each organis\u00ad ation works separately; especially if some of them, such as the International Labour Organisation, receive less of a hearing than others. My proposal is therefore that the full range of relevant international insti\u00ad tutions should get together with all the national representatives and regional or\u00ad ganisations to work out a global approach for the entire world. There is a lot of talk about globalisation but in reality, it is difficult to identify any concrete action so far. The Courier Don't you regret that there was no discussion of unemployment and poverty in Europe ? Jacques Delors I told Mr. Somavia (ine organiser of the Copenhagen conference \u2014 ed.) right from the start that we shouldn't attempt to cover everything. The inevitable result was a discussion between the rich Northern countries and the poor Southern ones. The other subjects need to be discussed in a separate conference. There is a lot to say about the causes of poverty in rich states, but much of it is specific to those countries. Trying to cover too much led to a failure to deal with everything on the agenda. When I met the organisers, I asked them what their theme was going to be. And when they mentioned three subjects to me, I told them that that was two too many for maximum effect, not just to ensure an immediate impact on public opinion, but also effective follow\u00adup. The Courier Do you, acting from the outside, have a part to play to save the Lom\u00e9 Convention, which appears to be under threat ? Jacques Delors Yes, yes, of course. I think that it is a problem of solidarity between countries. We cannot allow ourselves to fall back from the level the Community has achieved so far, which is worth maintain\u00ad ing. Our countries decided to grant some of their aid in a multilateral form and the end result of such aid is increasingly satisfactory.

It is therefore an effect\u00ad ive approach and it is an extremely important political question, not just for the countries which are signatories to the Lom\u00e9 Convention, but also in order to preserve the political unity of Europe.

' countries in particular, here, although they are not the only ones involved, of course. As long as I am responsible for it, and I am in agreement with the government on this, France's policy will be to reject any reduction. This means that the disagreement will continue if our partners insist on their desire to reduce aid to the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. The Courier President Mitterand, there is reason to believe that many African countries were expecting France to write off their debts, following Denmark's example. You, who they see as their defender, have not done so. Was your dedsion partly out of courtesy for your successor ? Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand What more do you want? We have written off the public debts of 39 countries, almost all of which are in Africa. We have also taken spedfk measures to reduce the indebtedness of five or six countries classed as intermediate. No other country has made an effort like ours. Your question implies that we ought to dedde to write off all debts without exception. I will tell you straightaway that this is not so far from my own personal view although such an approach would lead to numerous problems. Nevertheless, the effort made by France is the most significant one made so far anywhere in the world. It is therefore rather upsetting to be taken to task for not having done more. I agree that the problem of indebtedness should not be allowed to continue to spoil relations between developing countries and the richest ones. But unfortunately that is what is happening. \u25a0\u25a0 Interview by H.G. From the long press conference given by President Mitterrand, which was one of the high points of the Copenhagen Summit, we are reproducing two of his answers of particular interest to the ACP countries, the second of which was made in response to a question from the Courier. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand (on the difficulties experienced in connection with the Lom\u00e9 convention) I personally think that it would be a very serious error for the European Union to abandon or reduce the ambitions which it set for itself when it raised the Lom\u00e9 resources to ECU 12 billion. This was done under conditions which were just as difficult as those of today. What's more, I remember the prognoses, as I myself was involved, when it was said : \"We'll never go beyond ECU 9 billion'. In fact, we decided on ECU 12 billion. Now we have come up against an obstacle because several countries think that their internal situations will not allow them to be generous with regard to other countries. I stress that this would be a serious error. The sums involved are not so large that they justify endangering the general policy of developed countries vis\u00ada\u00advis developing ones.

        "The c h a l l e n g es of i n v e s t i ng in h u m an c a p i t al by Armeane M. Choksi The World Summit on Social De\u00ad velopment, attended by almost 100 heads of state, placed in high relief the issue of investments in human capital to alleviate the plight of the poor. Clearly, the challenge of economic progress in the developing world, in the broad\u00ad est sense, is to improve the quality of life of the poor. Experience shows that this improvement results from moving simultaneously on two parallel tracks, namely economic reforms, to provide sta\u00ad bility and an enabling environment for growth, and investing in people in the fields of education, health, nutrition and family planning. Successful countries have, in fact, moved on both these fronts to form a virtuous circle of development. There is \u2014 and can be \u2014 no delinking between economic reforms and effective investments in human capital. The positive link between the overall economic system and investments in the human capital of the population can be seen from the cases of Pakistan and Korea. In 1960, the two countries had similar levels of income but, by 1985, Korea's GDP per capita was nearly three times that of Pakistan. What had Korea done differently from Pakistan? It had invested three times as much in its human capital, and it had done this in a very different and far more supportive overall economic policy environment than Pakis\u00ad tan. In 1960, fewer than a third of Pakistan's children were enrolled in prim\u00ad ary school, while Korea had already achieved nearly universal enrolment in primary education. One defining charac\u00ad teristic of all East Asian countries is that they invested much more in human capital than most countries at similar stages of * Vice President, Human Resources Development and Operations Policy, The World Bank. development and had adopted more liberal and open economic policies than most developing countries. The so-called 'East Asia miracle' is really a misnomer. These countries achieved high growth by getting the basics right. Investment in people in and of themselves will not be of high quality unless the overall economic policy frame\u00ad work within which these investments take place is conducive and supportive. This implies macroeconomic stability, a market- oriented economy, an open trade and investment regime, access to world mar\u00ad kets, the right structure of incentives and the proper functioning of capital, financial and labour markets. These economic policies are needed to ensure that the investments in human capital are indeed of high quality. The quality of these invest\u00ad ments is at least as important, if not more so, than the quantity. Specifically, investing in edu\u00ad cation makes sound economic sense. Evi\u00ad dence across a wide variety of developing countries shows that investments in edu\u00ad cation \u2014 particularly at the primary level \u2014 boost productivity and economic growth. A better-educated person is also productive because he or she absorbs new information faster and applies unfamiliar inputs and new processes more effectively. Education for girls Investing in girls' education makes even more economic sense. This shows higher returns than investment in education for boys, which is not surprising. Many studies show that mothers channel more of their own incomes to expenditures on children than do fathers and, in virtually all societies, women are much more heavily involved in the immediate care of children and in the critical decisions about food, sanitation, and general nurturing, all of which affect children's health and develop\u00ad ment. Better educated women have fewer and healthier children. In Africa, one out of five children dies before the age of five if the mother has no education. The probability is more than halved for children whose mothers have seven years of education. In South Asia, women with no education have seven children on average. Those with seven or more years of education have fewer than four children. Women who receive education, and are then employed, also provide role models for young girls. Investments in health increase people's alertness, capacity for learning, and ability to cope with and enjoy life. In addition, they bring benefits to the count\u00ad ry's economy, because they release re\u00ad sources that can be used to achieve other development goals. Healthier workers are more productive and have longer working lives. The direct economic impact of investments in health are very telling. One example is the effect of sickness on loss of No schooling for these shanty town children in the Philippines Investment in education doesn't just have social benefits \u2014 it also makes sound economic sense -\u03b9 the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 mayjune 1995 ",
        "d o s s i er work time. Workers in Ghana, Indonesia and Peru report they are sick between three and five days a month on average \u2014 this is a lot of sickness I Worst of all, these days lost from work amount to a potential income loss of between 3% and 7% per month in these countries. These poorer countries and families can ill afford such losses. And now, a recent study has shown that maternal nutritional deficien cies \u2014 specifically Vitamin A deficiency \u2014 can affect the transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. A critical area that has long been neglected, and that provides a tremendous opportunity to reduce poverty and prom ote growth, is early childhood develop ment. Currently, three million children die every year because of lack of clean water. Twelve million under the age of five die in the developing world, and 130 million do not have accessio even primary education. More than a million children are blind because they do not get enough Vitamin A. An estimated 50 million are seriously impaired mentally and physically because their diets lack iodine. Some of the most serious prob lems can now be prevented relatively easily and at low cost by immunisation and nutrition programmes. It would, for ex ample, cost about $15 per person to immunise children in low-income countries against seven of the most dangerous diseases. Hard-headed economics Clearly, investing in human ca pital Is good economics. It leads to higher income and more economic growth \u2014 and to more education, and better health of this and the next generation. The rates of return on these investments are very high \u2014 much higher than the traditional sectors of infrastructure, agriculture and trans port. For example, the rate of return to primary education in developing countries is 18%. It is not just the soft-hearted who should be concerned with improving health, education and other programmes. It is the hard-headed as well. The past 50 years have witnessed the World Bank's evolution from an organisation originally created for the reconstruction of post-war Europe, into a modern institution seeking partnership with its clients in opening up markets and strengthening economies to improve living standards and expand prosperity for peo ple everywhere. The early emphasis on infrastructure projects has been replaced by investment in human resources, with World Bank lending in this area increasing sharply from an average of about 5% of the total in 1980 to more than 17% in 1994. The World Bank is now the single largest source of external finance for investment in education and health, par ticularly primary education and basic health, where the impact on economic growth and poverty reduction is the greatest. The Bank's main objective in the area of human capital development is to help developing countries to reach the point where limits to investment in people (in education, health, nutrition and so on) no longer hold back growth or keep people in poverty. Its approach has been to: \u2014 emphasise the importance of economic liberalisation and the integration of the developing countries into the world economy ; \u2014 increase its total lending devoted to investments in people ; \u2014 emphasise the basics, assisting countries to increase access to quality primary Bottle feeding time at a Tanzanian orphanage Early childhood development \u00a1s a critical area that has long been neglected schooling (particularly for girls), and to provide cost-effective basic health and clinical services, and take an integrated approach to population policy; \u2014 give special attention and intensified emphasis to early childhood development, including immunisations, pre-school edu cation programmes, and the provision of vitamins and other nutritional supple ments ; \u2014 further increase operations designed to remove barriers to women's participation in economic development ; and, \u2014 work with all borrowers and partners in a joint effort to help attain \u2014 within the next generation \u2014 universal primary education of good quality, access to a minimum package of cost-effective health care, and the elimination of malnutr ition.

        "World Bank and IMF on trial The C o p e n h a g en ' h e a r i n g' Those who drafted the source document for the Social Summit claimed at the preparatory commit\u00ad tee stage that economic problems were not on the agenda at Copen\u00ad hagen. They also introduced an article of 'liberal' faith in the first undertaking of the action pro\u00ad gramme when they claimed: 'We favour dynamic, open and competi\u00ad tive markets and guarantee everyone, and in particular the poorest and most disadvantaged, greater and more equitable access to such markets'. But such statements were of little avail. The two big international financial institutions \u2014 the World Bank and the IMF \u2014 still found themselves 'in the dock', accused by many of being 'antisocial'. And this was j ust one of a number of criticisms. The issue was encapsulated by officials from Mali who noted that prior to 1984, debt servicing was the second biggest item in their country's budget. Since structural adjustment, it had become the largest component, ahead of education and health. Structural adjustment is always in the dock, but in this case it was the 'safety nets' provided in social programmes and intended to alleviate the impact of the adjustment which were under fire from NGOs, developing countries and their allies in Copenhagen. The links between the above\u00admentioned financial organisations and the United Nations itself were also criticised, with the claim being made that the latter is not in control, and therefore failing to live up to it founding principles. There were also mutterings about the profits of the World Bank, which are said to amount to a billion dollars per year, implying that the charity it prescribes really does begin at home. An internal world Bank report (the Wapenhans report) has, it must be acknowledged, added grist to the mill of its detractors, by accepting that the 'safety nets' are rather threadbare in places. There were 'serious problems' with 20% of the 1800 programmes of this type and the number of 'lame ducks' had considerably increased. It was also as\u00ad certained that some social programmes linked with adjustment, which were sup\u00ad posed to act as models, had not lived up to expectation. This, for example, was the case with Agetip (the agency for carrying out public works to combat under\u00ademploy\u00ad ment) in Senegal, according to the conclu\u00ad sions of a joint mission of the Bank and the UNDP (United Nations Development Pro\u00ad gramme). One of the most aggressive 'pros\u00ad ecutors' in the case was Michel Chossud\u00ad ovsky, an economist at the University of Ottawa and a member of the Committee for cancelling Third World Debt. He ac\u00ad cused the drafters of the Copenhagen document of duplicity: 'If a poverty threshold of 1 dollar per inhabitant per day is selected, as defined in the document, only 33% of the population of the Third World is defined as poor...The bank is fiddling the figures to make out that poor people are in a minority and to justify the concept of vulnerable groups on which campaigns should be targeted'.

Chossud\u00ad ovsky also pointed out that 'the United Nations document does not provide any analysis at all of the causes of the slump and dogmatically asserts that the neo\u00ad liberal model is the right one'. He quoted the official document: 'Internationalis\u00ad ation creates new opportunities for sus\u00ad Tema Port \u00a1n Ghana, a model country as far as structural adjustment is concerned. According to the UN, 'internationalisation opens up new opportunities for sustained economic growth... especially in developing countries' \"\u00ce the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may^une 1995 ",
        "tained economie growth and for develop ment of the world economy, especially in developing countries.' He considered that the document expressed no reservations about excessive deregulation, the injustice of unequal trade and access to credit. He thought that many NGOs had fallen into the trap of criticising individual details rather than attacking the entire edifice. The World Bank and the IMF kept their cool. They began to mount their defence, with some notable 'trumpet- blowing' at the preparatory committee stage. During the months preceding the Summit, they prepared a whole series of documents on their activities, as if seeking to forestall the inevitable attacks. In Copenhagen, they combined appeals to their audience with a pedagogical ap proach. The IMF, for example, invited the NGOs to a discussion of economic policies. Its representatives emphasised, to a packed meeting, the social concern under lying its five priorities for long-lasting developments : to take control of the monetary system, especially by reducing inflation which is really a source of indirect tax on the poorest members of society ; progressively to eliminate all the barriers to a smoothly functioning market ; to open up the economies of Member States to international trade and exchanges with the outside world ; to institute active social policies to reduce poverty and unemploy ment and protect the less vulnerable sections of society ; and to insist on proper management of public affairs \u2014 what the British term 'good governance'. The IMF went on to define the short term as being three years. Countries which have taken longer to introduce a policy of structural adjustment have failed to follow the prescriptions of the financial institutions. When asked why it was refusing to write off or reduce the debts of less advanced countries, the IMF replied that this would be a bad signal, but that it was planning debt repayment facilities. 'De veloping countries have every interest in giving pride of place to repayment of their debts to other countries,' according to the Fund. 'Otherwise they will lose all cred ibility with their financial backers'. Those against structural adjust ment maintained that African countries have been pressurised to such an extent that they are frequently no longer eligible for loans from the African Development Bank (AfDB). The institutional autonomy of that organisation, therefore, existed only in theory. They deplored the fact that the arrangements determined by the G-7 in Naples had done little to alleviate the burden of African debt. For example, it was only reduced by 3% in the case of Uganda. Ravi Kanbur, the World Bank's chief economist for Africa pleaded 'not guilty' to this charge. He considered that the budget deficit of the country was to blame, maintaining that multilateral insti tutions only hold a quarter of the claims on African countries, 60% of which result from bilateral debts. Another of the Bank's high- ranking officials thought that debt elimi nation would increase the cost of Bank loans. He believed that attention should be given to countries with extremely low incomes and even then, complete cancel lation could not be considered. Complaints were also made about the World Bank encouraging agricultural over-production, which has led to a drop in world prices. The Bank saw its encouragement of production as going hand in hand with a reduction in regional taxes on products. Under such conditions, it argued, the increase in production has led to an increase in farmers' income, despite the fall in market The representatives of the World Bank and the IMF considered that the best form of defence was attack. They said that writing off the debt could lead to un desirable effects on developing countries. Rathan Bhatia, the IMF representative to the United Nations maintained at the meeting with the NGOs that, according to a study carried out by his organisation, the debts of middle-income countries were 'not too bad'. Only the debts of the poorest countries gave cause for concern. He thought that cancelling the debt of a developing country would only result in economic growth of about 0.5 %, achieved at the high price of a lack of faith on the Groundnuts In Senegal Complaints about World Bank encouragement of agricultural over production... which leads to lower prices on world markets part of potential investors. The critics were unfair and out of date, he argued. Struc tural adjustment was a life raft for coun tries facing problems, whether developed or developing. When it was suggested that the structural adjustment programmes which have been implemented in Africa for many years now have proved futile, Rathan Bhatia admitted that African coun tries did have special problems, but claimed that these were due to their instability, which discourages investors, and also to the limited scale and therefore lack of attractiveness of their economies. The defence and counter-attack were followed by a burst of magnanimity. The World Bank announced that it had prepared programmes which will enable the poorest countries to wipe out debt amounting to 1 billion dollars in the short term, with another 3 billion in the offing. After the discussions, the official texts adopted in Copenhagen called on the World Bank and the IMF 'to adopt an innovative approach in order to help low- income countries with large multilateral debts'. Against the odds, the developing countries managed to ensure that 'a social security net' is attached to structural adjustment programmes. It was also de cided that the UN would keep a closer watch on certain working committees of the two Bretton Woods institutions. The latter maintained that this is no innovation and that the 'exhortations' of the Summit are already current practice as far as they are concerned. Nonetheless, the events at Copenhagen seemed very much like a shot across their bows, and their efforts to justify themselves perhaps mean that the point has been taken, HEB H.G. the Courier n\" 151 \u00b7 may-jun\u00e7 1995 r ",
        "Copenhagen The no-frills r e p o rt of a E u r o p e an public s e r v a nt by Pierre Defraigne* This text was not intended for publication. It is an open report, free from diplomatic circumlo cutions, written on-the-spot by a public servant on assignment, to record his impressions of a pivotal international forum. The Courier is pleased to be able to offer it to you for two reasons : firstly because its analysis of the results of the Copen hagen Summit is clear-sighted, and, secondly, because it offers an unusual insight into one aspect of the work of the European Commission. The major outlines of what was achieved in Copenhagen are gradually becoming clearer after hundreds of hours of negotiations, conducted in parallel at several levels in a less enthusiastic frame of mind than was the case in Rio (Conference on the Environment) and less fervently than in Cairo (Conference on Population and Development). The sole fact of having brought together the biggest meeting of Heads of State and Government ever convened on a topic both as neglected and as con troversial as social progress is a major event in itself. The price to be paid in return for attendance by the world's leaders at the highest level was to avoid radical debate of the world economic system itself, the counterpart of its efficiency being in creased inequality between countries and within countries, or of the political systems which still prevail in many countries in the South and which ignore human rights and development. On the other hand, this was a propitious opportunity to rouse the international conscience and it was indeed seized. This Summit did not therefore result in any spectacular advance, but it did mark progress in several fields which, taken * Deputy Head of the European Commission's delegation to the World Summit on Social Develop ment. together, give new direction to develop ment policies. The positive side Positive elements resulting from the Summit were as follows : Firstly, a multidimensional, global, common approach to development is gradually emerging as an alternative to North/South confrontation. The idea that the quality of internal development po licies and access to international markets are more effective than external public aid is gaining ground everywhere. Copen hagen introduced the idea that greater emphasis ought to be given to human development both for economic reasons (gains in productivity) and for social reasons (justice and stability). Human development and sustained development appear henceforth to be inseparable; the eradication of extreme poverty, a reduc tion in inequality and the place accorded civil society and education contribute to protecting the environment. Although the superior efficiency of the market has now been recognised, its shortfalls (flaws in competition, external influences and short-sightedness) and limitations (unequal distribution of income) are also better perceived and, consequently, the need for corrective political actions, particularly to ensure a more equitable distribution of productive resources and of the fruits of growth, and more prudent management of natural resources, is the subject of a growing consensus. Complementarity of national po licies and international action is more evident than ever, owing to interdepen dence. This interdependence is no longer limited to the economic and financial sphere, where It continues to be con solidated. Since Rio, it is also recognised at an ecological level. Copenhagen also clearly reveals that interdependence pro foundly affects the social sector : voluntary or forced migrations are only the most obvious manifestation of this, and, from now on, it is at the very heart of our societies that the process of globalisation is destabilising social structures, forcing peo ple to move and adjust, generating new divisions between winners and losers in the internationalisation of commercial and financial markets. Consequently, the international context of social development must be strengthened. Despite reluctance on the part of some developing countries, it was confirmed for the first time by the United Nations that human rights were part and parcel of the whole development problem. The idea that human rights and funda mental liberties are universal values and that State sovereignty cannot be used as a pretext for ignoring or restricting them, is gaining ground. In this respect, Copen hagen confirmed what was accomplished in Vienna. Moreover, it is now accepted that human rights include the right to (individual) development and that it is therefore impossible to say that the entitlement to (collective) development and human rights are in opposition. Finally, the theory of equal rights for men and women is gaining ever greater ground over the notion of fairness, a concept put forward by some countries. The progressive generalisation of ILO conventions in relation to fundamental workers' rights is essential if freedom of trade is to lead to more equitable wealth distribution in developing countries. It is also needed to ensure fair competition in order to prevent protectionism. The ex plicit and priority need to integrate the social dimension into IMF and World Bank adjustment programmes is accepted. More effective use of develop ment aid and its rechannelling towards the social sector is illustrated by the approach of the 20/20 bilateral agreements: 20% of official development assistance devoted to basic social programmes as against 20% of national public resources allocated to the same objectives. The burden of official debt will be lightened within this frame work. The proposal to organise a meet ing devoted to social development, on the eve of each Development Committee meeting of the World Bank, between the ^ the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may-june 1995 ",
        "d o s s i er UN Secretary General and the Directors General of the IMF and World Bank and, from now on, the ILO, has been approved. The other side of the coin Cultural and religious differences are being reinforced and becoming increas\u00ad ingly noticeable. They have been revealed, particularly, in the undertaking concerning health and education but, above all, in relation to human rights. Some Muslim countries fiercely resist the formulation of rights for women, more liberal customs and religious pluralism, and for a large number of developing countries democ\u00ad racy, human rights and the role of civil society are still controversial or even radically contested subjects. Some success\u00ad ful countries, notably in Asia, justify their reluctance to provide such rights on the grounds that they might interfere with the 'right to development'. They are also rejected by countries with authoritarian regimes or reactionary oligarchies that have no real concern for development. These divisions, which were al\u00ad ready present in Cairo, persisted in Copen\u00ad hagen and were behind most of the difficulties encountered during negoti\u00ad ation. In contrast, it will be noted that Asian countries (such as India) and coun\u00ad tries in Latin America (such as Chile, Mexico and Brazil) support evolution towards universal values on the subjects of human rights, fundamental liberties and equality between men and women, even within the Group of 77. On the subject of resources, aid fatigue is gaining ground: the 0.7% objective is a distant goal. Partly for good reason and partly for the sake of change, more and more emphasis is being placed on the quality of official development assistance and on the contribution of the private sector, including in the social fields. Too much aid is still being distributed on the basis of strategic and commercial interests and its effectiveness will improve only slowly. The international financial mar\u00ad kets are contributing increasingly signific\u00ad ant resources to developing countries, but the problems they pose are still left out of the debate. On the one hand, the problem of the amplification, by the international money market, of the external shocks to which the fragile economies of developing countries and countries in transition and engaged in reforms are exposed, is not being studied seriously. Any serious debate on this topic within the United Nations is prevented by the fear on the part of industrialised countries of seeing the free movement of capital by the developing countries once again called into question. On the other hand, little attention is given to certain serious dysfunctional aspects of the financial markets : expatriation of capital linked to corruption or to fraud and tax evasion ; money laundering. These problems have dimensions which are at once economic (and, owing to their breadth, their impact can sometimes be macroeconomic), ethical and political, which interfere with development. Once again these questions are evoked without being properly discussed. Monitoring a summit such as this is essential, since it marks the point of departure of new policies on the part of states and international organisations. Results and methods should therefore be evaluated regularly and at a significant political level. This monitoring and follow\u00ad up system remains to be drawn up by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). There is a risk that industrialised countries will encounter great difficulty in setting up a technically effective and politically cred\u00ad ible monitoring system because they will be accused of interference by developing countries. The EU's image As regards internal coordination, we can feel satisfied that the common positions have generally been presented by France fairly and convincingly. European Union positions often appeared to the participants as being constructive and reasonable : the EU demonstrated both its cohesion and strength to make proposals. Internal coordination revealed the wealth of expertise and diversity of positions of Member States. On the one hand, we had at our disposal an exceptional pool of technical and political knowledge and, on the other, by making a continuous effort to be succinct, we proposed well\u00adbalanced common positions capable of serving as a sound basis for a more general consensus within the UN. However, although our work is recognised by the participants at the Conference, awareness of it outside that forum is low because we have an image problem (institutional complexity and difficulty in defining the role of the EU with respect to the Member States) and a communication problem. The United Nations always beat us in this area ! With more specific reference to the Commission, the speech given by President Santer to the Heads of State and Government was refreshing and innovat\u00ad ive and it was perceived as such since this privilege has not been extended to any other leader of an international organis\u00ad ation or institution, however impressive. Copenhagen thus signified the crossing of an institutional threshold for the Commis\u00ad sion, a result both of full\u00adparticipant status and of the support of the Secretary General of the UN, sensitive to the active involve\u00ad ment of the Commission in preparing for the Summit. The President's speech pre\u00ad ceded that of Mr Mandela and he spoke to a packed auditorium which was very receptive to his message. Mr Flynn's speech in the minis\u00ad terial session gave a very convincing picture of a social Europe which is being built with difficulty, but with ambition and gene\u00ad rosity. The Commission's services gave a very solid and dynamic contribution to the internal coordination process, both in the field of basic guidelines and strategy and of specific compromise formulations which were very warmly welcomed by our Member States. The conviction and expertise of the French Presidency were of considerable help to the Commission which necessarily has a difficult and hybrid role (providing expertise and 'overseeing' events) at a UN conference.

        "From Rio to Beijing The l o ng m a r ch of civil society The 1990s have seen the UN return to the social issues outlined at the 1990 World Summit on Children. The change was really first seen at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro where 'civil society', rep resented above all by NGOs, played \" a prominent role. This was fol lowed by the World Human Rights Conference in Vienna in 1993, where the debate turned out not to be as passionate as expected, given the subject matter. There was, however, no lack of passion in Cairo at the Conference on Population and Develop ment which was held in September 1994. In Rio, the participants 'discovered' the planet Earth and were given a jolt in the process. In Cairo, it was women's issues that came to the fore. Women's organisations played a central part once again in Copenhagen and in September, they will occupy centre stage at the World Conference on Women which will take place in Beijing. Although 'civil society' has succeeded in making its mark at recent UN conferences, the organisations involved have had to fight hard to arrive at this point. To use appropriate Chinese imagery, the route from Rio to Beijing has indeed been a 'long march'. The UN has just set itself a goal at the first Social Summit in Copenhagen \u2014 to reduce poverty. One may well ask what is new. After all, the UN Charter of 1945 includes the objective of eradicating pov erty. And it is not lacking in detail when it comes to social objectives. Article 55, for example, aims at achieving better living conditions, full employment, and economic and social development. It was to have been the task of the UN's specialised institutions to meet these objectives. However, the Cold War meant that the hopes and values that flowered briefly at the end of the Second World War soon receded. The world divided into camps set apart by wealth, ideology and mutual suspicion, and social concerns were swiftly relegated. It was necessary to await the fall of the Berlin Wall and rising disillusionment with the new world order before they could regain a place high on the list of global priorities. It took hordes of the newly impoverished, the dreaded emer gence of what some see as a new type of barbarism and, above all, anguish on one's own doorstep (misery having become established in even the richest countries) for the UN to think again about the need to make nations cooperate in the quest for individual welfare. The UN's 'return' to social issues has been an agonising process. Despite the impetus given by the two most recent Secretaries General, bureaucracy, paralysis, national self-centredness, the require ments of domestic politics and reluctance to adopt the language of ordinary people have all combined to hinder the process. The new ambiguous relationship between states and the groups within them that constitute 'civil society', have forced the latter to fight to avoid rejection, but also to prevent themselves becoming part of the 'establishment'. The relationships between official conferences and parallel NGO conferences are a good illustration of this. Copenhagen was symptomatic : the NGO forum was relegated to Holmen, some kilometres from the actual Summit but a number of officials, ranging from the Chairman of the Conference to Mrs Hilary Clinton, made the trip to speak to the NGOs. NGO representatives also acted as advisers and sometimes even as full mem bers of certain national delegations. Rio: a torrent of 'inadequate' promises The ambiguities in the UN's re newed approach to social matters are demonstrated particularly if one looks at the time taken in following up undertak ings made in Rio. Many NGOs see the circumlocutions of politicans as evidence of a lack of will pointing to a need for greater determination on their part to continue the struggle. Yet as far as the diplomats are concerned, the lapse of 'just' three years between the Rio Conference and the first follow-up session, which took place re cently in Berlin, represents a record. It is this kind ofthing which disconcerts the man in the street. Another disconcerting aspect is that, in Berlin, a decision was made not to make a decision about anything. The undertakings of the Earth Summit were effectively put 'on hold'. In Rio, the developed countries agreed to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Angela Merkel, the German Environment Minister who chaired the conference said in her address that this was the only genuinely important point on the agenda. It was vital, she felt, to adapt the Rio undertakings in order 'to prevent any dangerous disturbance of the climatic system'. But this is too expensive, insisted a number of OECD countries. It would jeopardise economic revival and standards of living, without any scientific certainty that reduced consumption of fossil fuels would have a positive influence on the greenhouse effect. 30 or so coun tries from the Caribbean, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean, which risk being sub merged if global warming increases, be lieved that the mere existence of the danger should be enough to justify action. It is worth noting that some nations who see themselves as 'representatives' of the Third World, such as China, India and Brazil, are also major polluting countries. Oil-producing states do not support ecol ogical measures either. The surface tem perature of the earth has increased by 0.5\u00b0 in 50 years, according to the experts, and a further increase of 1.5\u00b0 to 4.5\u00b0 over the next 1000 years is predicted, with a rise in sea level of between 30 and 60 centimetres by the year 2050. There is also doubt as to the precise role of aerosols and other pollutants. Some of the major polluters in the North therefore think it would be better to invest in climatology with a view to obtaining more concrete information. The Rio undertakings are in the form of conventions on biodiversity and climatic change and the so-called 'Agenda 21' of measures to be applied during the 21st century. The US is unwilling to pay for ecological progress in developing countries and the latter, for their part, do not intend to wager their development in order to \"\u00ce the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may-june 1995 ",
        "d o s s i er respond to the latest ecological concerns of the rich nations. The Group of 77 reject the requests of certain rich countries for the financial burden to be shared with de veloping countries. In Berlin, delegates preferred not to discuss resources, owing to a lack of common ground. The US, Britain and other developed countries wanted 'joint implementation', a stra tagem which would enable them, in exchange for investment in environmental programmes in the South, to reduce the ecological demands placed on their own territory. In other words, it would enable them to carry on polluting at home whilst cleaning up elsewhere. Industrialised coun tries were to submit a report on their programme for the reduction of toxic gases, and the results obtained, to the Berlin meeting. Only 15 did so, including five who stated that they were committed to achieving the set target. Paradoxically, participants in Berlin agreed on one thing : reductions in gases must be even greater than the targets set in Rio. Not much in fact came out of the Berlin gathering. The compromise text, voted through by consensus, merely ac knowledged that the Rio undertakings were 'inadequate' and gave a 'negotiating mandate' for the conference scheduled to take place in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997. There is thus still no protocol for actually applying the framework agreement on the reduc tion of greenhouse gases. It is intended that the Kyoto meeting should ratify an agreement on carbon-dioxide emissions after the year 2000. But the US, Japan, Australia and New Zealand remain un happy at the prospect of fixing threshold levels for a reduction in toxic gases within two years. The oil lobby is, of course, very powerful in the US. Both Europeans and Americans wanted negotiations to ensure that ecological measures do not impede competition and Southern countries saw in this a threat of customs barriers being set up against them. There was even fear of a blockade. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia ex pressed their reservations and the proposal for 'joint implementation' for an experi mental period of five years did not succeed. Finally, the US obtained an agreement on 'trapping', i.e. the planting of trees to reduce carbon-dioxide levels. Southern countries were successful in that the 1997 protocol 'does not introduce any new undertaking' for them. They will have only 'to comply with undertakings already made'. The text from Aosis (Association of Small Island States) was not accepted and will be looked at later. The NGOs were disappointed. Germany, however, was pleased that it was chosen to host the Secretariat of the Convention on Climate Change. Michel Barnier, the French En vironment Minister, praised the Berlin conference on behalf of the EU, saying that it had given 'new life to the spirit of Rio'. This appears to be a somewhat optimistic assessment. Cairo : the big surprise The recent Cairo Conference turned out to be the 'jewel in the crown' for the UN in its programme of meetings on social issues. Even before sufficient time has elapsed to allow a balanced assessment of its results, observers believe that its resolutions represent an outstanding suc cess for the UN, particularly since a revival of moral conservatism did not augur well for significant progress. There was success regarding human rights, which were sup plemented by a new one : the right to reproductive health. Never before had an official meeting tackled so many sensitive issues. Meeting in order to discuss the dangers of overpopulation, the world's nations ended up by outlining a new world moral code to protect the individual against the excesses of his country, culture or religion. They were virtually forced into this by the mobilisation of global 'civil society' - not just the NGOs but also groups representing the people of various coun tries, trades unions, intellectuals, local politicians and so on. As for the NGOs, who had their fingers burned by the Rio experience, where they arrived en masse but without a strategy, they prepared for Cairo down to the last detail. According to the Liaison Committee of the Develop ment NGOs of the EU, they lobbied governments and Community authorities for months prior to the conference. The focus was on one central issue, namely that any population control must be set in the context of rights and reproductive health and that efforts must be concentrated, as a priority, on development and equality between men and women. The emphasis should not, they believed, be on the issue of population, perse, the current situation being a consequence of unequal develop ment in political, economic and human terms between North and South, rich and poor, men and women. The result was that European countries spearheaded these ideas. Reproductive rights were proc laimed : abortion is no longer taboo, even if acknowledged only 'in the event of distress to the woman... in those countries where it is permitted' and not as a means of birth control. Moreover, 'health and reproductive rights' imply that 'people can have a satisfying and risk-free sex life', that adolescents have a 'right... to confiden tiality', even if, in parallel, 'the right, duty and responsibility of parents to guide adolescents in matters of sexuality and reproduction' is acknowledged. As for another matter directly affecting millions of individuals, namely immigration, the bringing together of families, although not accorded the status of a right, is neverthe less stated as a vital principle with which nations are required to comply and which they must include in their domestic legis lation. Above all, the meeting quickly became a forum on the place of women in preparing for the future. The official declaration acknowledges that it is im possible to manage the world population if women are not active players in change, given that they influence their surround ings more than men do. The declaration demands equality in terms of education (all must have access to primary education by 2015 at the latest), individual control over the number of children wanted and spacing of offspring. Violence against women and children, particularly genital mutilation, child prostitution, infanticide and the selection of foetuses to the detriment of girls were all condemned. Despite initial criticism of the lack of time allocated to sustainable develop ment or of the weakness of the UN in agreeing too quickly to make concessions to 'moral' nations, the NGOs still regard Cairo as having been a positive step, while they continue to mobilise themselves particularly as regards monitoring the system for financing rights and reproduct ive health.

        "d o s s i er women. This statistic provides the link between the conferences in Cairo and Copenhagen. With International Women's Day, on 8 March, falling in the middle of the conference, this was a dream occasion for women's groups to increase awareness. The Swedish Prime Minister, Ingvar Carlsson, probably summed up their work best. 'We have talked of the f\u00e9minisation of poverty, but we must feminise the struggle against it! Enlightened men should learn from the feminist agenda. Shared power and shared responsibilities are not a cost. They are an investment'. However, the 'poverty clock', which was set running on 3 March by the UNDP administrator, a few days before the conference started, made no gender dis tinction. After 11 days, when debate came to an end, it indicated the figure 598 072, this being the number of children born into poverty since the talks had started. The clock will be started again in Beijing. Everyone, including civil society organis ations who, in Copenhagen, concentrated their efforts on development topics, is aware that most of these children were bom in developing countries. The hunger strike at the entrance to the official Summit, by women (mostly from the South) calling for cancellation of debt had some impact. A number of NGOs from the South set themselves up as a General Assembly, thereby realising a project born at the Cairo conference. They had the opportunity to structure their project during the preparations for Copenhagen and Beijing on the basis of two observ ations, namely Southern countries' lack of influence at the United Nations, which is seen as being controlled by a single superpower, and the impression that the South is in the minority in international fora, whereas the reverse is actually true. This Assembly has taken on the respons ibility for passing on the viewpoints of countries in the South. Razia Ismail, the Indian co-founder stresses that this is being done without any animosity towards Western nations. The sole desire, she says, is that such nations should understand that there are other ways of thinking and developing than those they adhere to themselves. She believes that Southern NGOs, in particular, must develop their ability to become true partners because, currently, they and their sisters in the North are only tolerated at the United Nations, not fully accepted. Trade unions were also prom inent in Copenhagen. Indeed, in several cases, the so-called social partners (from employers associations and trade unions) were represented in the official deleg ations. Hundreds of trade unionists took part in a forum convened by the ILO on 8 March. They stated that they were satis fied with the Summit which represents a 'sign that the international community is aware of the need to act with great urgency in order to combat flagrant and increasing injustice in the world' and which 'took into account the recommendations of the ILO'. Another reason for satisfaction on their part was the Summit's decision to breathe new life into the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The third Copenhagen summit, besides the official one and the NGO forum, was that involving a number of intellectuals at the University of Copen hagen. Invited to debate the struggle against poverty and inequality, they en hanced their standing. One debate con cerned the modern state : a concept generally agreed to be of recent invention. Even in Europe, the empires and kingdoms of the past were not states, emphasised Eric Hobsbawn from Britain, since the attributes of the modern state \u2014 ter ritorial and administrative integration, and equal rights for citizens involving redistri bution of resources, were not inherent to them. Moreover, current distortions be tween states were held to make this system of world organisation practically unviable. The paradoxes include the con cept of overpopulation : 'overpopulated' countries, it was claimed, are, in fact, underpopulated. Only 25 of the world's 220 countries have more than 50 million inhabitants (1993 figures), and just three of these are in Africa. During the course of debate, the 'nebulousness' of African countries was featured. Mapped out by a small number of colonial strategists, with no thought for logic, they owed their existence solely to official declarations. These countries, it was said, are incapable of meeting intrinsic state obligations as regards the security and welfare of the citizens. This situation was condemned by Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian winner of the Nobel Literature Prize, who added that the frontiers of a country remain precarious so long as they divide people who want to live together. According to the intel lectuals, Africa is not the only case in point, the former Yugoslavia or the former Soviet Union offering further instructive ex amples. Soyinka therefore requested that men and women be placed centre stage, and assisted in finding their identity. It was the frantic search for such an identity which was at the root of many of the recent disasters involving humankind (civil wars, Muslim fundamentalism, community fanaticism). He also urged that priority no longer be given solely to abstract figures attributed to countries, such as increases in GNP. A programme for Beijing: bread and roses The results of Copenhagen and the importance placed on them have been assessed in various ways by the rep resentatives of civil society, yet all state that they are prepared to defend the Summit's achievements. They also hope for further progress in Beijing in various areas, ranging from undertakings on sustainable development and employment protection, the definition of NGO status at the UN to the promotion of skills and technology in developing countries. Gertrude Mongella, Secretary General of the Beijing conference, wants this to be the starting point for implemen tation of the recommendations of the UN's 'social' conferences. She launched a 180- day campaign which aims to bring about a 180-degree turn in the world order so that half of mankind can assume its rightful position. On 8 March she presented a woven cloth from Cambodia which she circulated amongst the audience. It bore the inscription 'together, women will weave the world as far as Beijing'. Nat is Sadik, the Secretary-General of the Cairo Conference, ended her list of aspirations for Beijing with a simple statement : 'We want bread and roses'. The UN's new found attention to social issues is therefore Very Welcome. M Hegel Goutier \"t the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may-june 1995 ",
        "Poverty C u l t u re as a r e s p o n se by Daniel Duranleau* The Action Programme adopted in Copenhagen requires nations, over the next few years and particularly in 1996 (International Year for the Elimination of Poverty), to work to establish national objectives for the elimination of poverty and to define what poverty actually is. In this context, the definition proposed by Father Joseph is still relevant. Heads of state and of government, NGO representatives and journal ists have all left now and life in Copenhagen has resumed the tran quil course typical of this Nordic capital. It would be easy to say that life goes on exactly as it did before these solemn declarations of war on poverty, which were heard at the Belt\u00e0 Center, but this World Summit on Social Development which has just ended has, in our opinion, made it possible to make considerable advances which must now be methodically con solidated. Naturally, aspirations of seeing the adoption of an integrated, global policy to combat extreme poverty and exclusion have not all been fulfilled, but Copenhagen is a landmark in the improved understand ing of extreme poverty and of the way in which its elimination may be tackled. Poverty: a question of responsibility and rights The Summit's final Declaration states 'We have been meeting here in order to make a commitment to work for social development throughout the world so that all men and women, particularly those living in poverty, will be able to exercise their rights, utilise resources and share responsibilities enabling them... to make a contribution to the well-being of their family, their community and hu manity as a whole'. This statement is a clear recog nition of the fact that poverty is a condition which makes it impossible for those burdened by it to exercise their rights and take on their responsibilities, a situation which leads to exclusion. The Declaration reinstates poor families and * ATD Quart Monde. (An NGO acting as consult ant to a number of United Nations' and European bodies). peoples in their rights by recalling that they are not to blame for this situation but, on the contrary, are constantly striving to combat poverty. This approach to poverty, linking rights and responsibilities, echoes what the international ATD Quart Monde Move ment, at the initiative of its founder, Father Joseph Wresinski, has been defend ing for the last 37 years. In 1987, in his report to the French Economic and Social Committee ('Extreme poverty and econ omic and social instability'), Father Joseph put forward a modern definition of pov erty which applied to all countries regard less of their level or type of development. 'Instability is a situation where those factors which give a sense of security, particularly employment, are absent. Without these f \u00e4rtors, peoples and families are unable to assume their professional, family and social obligations, or enjoy their basic rights. The resulting sense of inse curity may be more or less far-reaching and have more or less serious and definitive consequences. It leads to extreme poverty when it affects several areas of their existence, when it becomes persistent, and when it compromises the opportunity to take on one's responsibilities again and reinstate oneself in one's rights in the foreseeable future'. This definition describes extreme poverty and the various forms of instability which can lead to it if they are ongoing. It also offers clear-cut lines of action, namely to concentrate attention, both in analysis and in implementation of solutions, on the urban or rural population burdened over time by multiple factors of instability and thereby sidelined by the policies that are put in place. It also points to the priority which must be given to the most dis advantaged populations. The multidimensional nature of poverty This definition also stresses the multidimensional nature of poverty, some thing the Copenhagen undertakings clearly recognise. Of course, some countries were reluctant to use the term 'multi dimensional', but all agreed on the need for an integrated, global approach to combat poverty. Poverty is undoubtedly an economic and social phenomenon, but it also has cultural, spiritual and political aspects. It is not possible to tackle one aspect of instability in isolation whilst ignoring the interdependent nature of the various aspects of life for the most under privileged peoples. In point of fact, however, this is too often what the anti-poverty measures put in place actually do. if all the partners in this struggle had understood the need to make an integrated attack on poverty, Copenhagen would truly have signified an advance at this level. The need for human investment The discussions which took place, particularly during the third preparatory session, on the need to reconstruct social links, to enable everyone to take part in community and cultural life, demonstrate the need for human investment to over come misery. These discussions revealed that the fight against poverty could not be solely a matter of equipment or program mes, but that it was also necessary to create places where feelings of solidarity could be expressed, that it was necessary for men and women to join together with disadvantaged populations in order to build confidence and take action to combat misery. Far from being a secondary aspect, this human investment is, on the the Courier n\" 151 > may-june 1995 r ",
        "d o s s i er contrary, a quite integral part of any effective policy - without it, the partner ship cannot last. It is important, however, not to confuse participation and partnership. It is one thing to propose that a population participate in development programmes devised, designed, implemented and as sessed by others with the best of inten tions, but it is quite another to be guided by the populations in question, to enable them to explain what their plans are, to conceive them, to implement them and to Let men and women join together with the most disadvantaged populations in order to build confidence assess them together. Any fight against misery requires partnership. In partnership with the most deprived populations The texts published after the World Summit confirmed time and again that the fight against poverty and exclu sion could not take place without a partnership with the peoples and families living in poverty and the organisations representing them. We should rejoice at such an approach. Our Movement is convinced that it is only by closely associat ing those who are the foremost particip ants in the fight against the poverty with which they are burdened that it will be possible to progress towards this objective of elimination. We must also remain vigilant. We are aware that partnership with the world's poorest peoples is a difficult exercise. It requires the implemen tation of new ways of enabling deprived peoples to be partners and a strong desire on everyone's part for such a partnership to succeed. It also requires time, as no partnership can be improvised. Misery crushes those in its grasp to such an extent that it would be illusory to assume that this partnership would be automatic and that it would be sufficient to publicise one's intention to set it up for it actually to take place. Partnership with the poorest peoples is all the more essential since the value of the Copenhagen Summit will be revealed by monitoring of the undertak ings made by our leaders. Yet, who will be a partner in assessing the measures an nounced? Who will join in considering the programmes to be consolidated because they have been deemed effective and the remedies to be applied to others? If underprivileged peoples and their organis ations are not closely associated with this monitoring process, what will have been the significance of the declarations on partnership made in Copenhagen and throughout the preparatory process ? The priority for our Movement and for the small NGOs and individuals meeting in the 'Permanent Forum on Extreme Poverty in the World' will be to fight constantly for the full involvement of the most under privileged peoples actually to be given concrete expression both at national and international level. (The Permanent Forum is a network of correspondents in ap proximately 100 countries set up by Father Joseph Wresinski and grouping together small NGOs and individuals engaged in the fight against poverty.) \"I the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may-june 1995 ",
        "d o s s i er Partnership: a question of sharing know-how and culture What, however, is the essential condition for a partnership to end the exclusion of the world's poorest people ? Father Joseph alerted us to this as early as the 1960s. In order to become full partners, the poorest people must, naturally, have equal opportunities of access to work. But this must not consist merely of 'invented' occupations, or jobs offering neither pre stige nor the opportunity for a professional career in the future \u2014 which are likely to be poorly paid and accompanied at best by only limited training. In order to become partners with equal opportunities, excluded workers must have access to culture. They must have the means to utilise their own know- how, to enrich it through access to other knowledge, to share in the cultural wealth of the world around them and to become creators, together with their more priv ileged fellow citizens, of the culture of tomorrow. Without sharing in cultural creativity, it is futile, thought Father Joseph, to speak of sharing in economic creativity. The poorest people show us in their daily lives that cultural development, social development and economic develop ment are inseparably linked. Rethinking human activity It is in this context that our Movement considered the need to rethink the whole question of human activity and produced, as a contribution to the World Summit, a document entitled 'To combat poverty and exclusion, we must rethink human activity' (Alwine de Vos van Steen wijk, January 1995). The world's poor have the same aspirations as everyone else : to be free and useful, and to be freely useful. The 'social processing' of unemployment is not, on its own, a response which fulfils their am bitions. Man's creativity does not extend only to trading activities and its most widespread manifestation, namely pro ductive employment. It also develops on a social, cultural, spiritual and political level. Those populations which are excluded from the productive employment sector and from trading activities are also ex cluded from the fields of culture, artistic creativity and from social, spiritual and political participation. Therefore, work sharing as well as sharing of all effort to make people's lives dynamic, creative and full of the promise of change are called for. In the absence of this, work- sharing will constitute only an internal redistribution amongst those who already have a place within our societies, and the gulf between these people and the world's poor will grow ever wider. The change which is before us is a project in civilisation, a project in whose context nations ought simultaneously to undertake to fight so that everyone can have a job which confers dignity, and can thus be regarded as a worker of quality. Human activity overall must be reconsi dered, introducing throughout one's working life periods where a time of economic productivity and a time of human, cultural and social productivity alternate. In conclusion, in this great effort to promote social development, the ATD Quart Monde Movement, in the footsteps In order to become partners... excluded workers must have access to culture of Father Joseph, will therefore conduct a three-fold campaign in respect of this question of human activity : \u2014 a campaign for the right of everyone to have access to the employment market, and to play a useful part under dignified conditions and in the long term ; \u2014 a campaign for the right of everyone to be creative and useful during those periods when they are not active on the employ ment market ; and \u2014 a campaign for an equitable distri bution, in everyone's working life, of periods spent both in and out of the employment market in a market economy. In this context, we welcome the progress made by the World Summit on Social Development. It is now a matter for our leaders to match words with actions so that those people experiencing extreme poverty can effectively 'exercise their rights, utilise resources and share re sponsibilities' which enable them to con tribute to the wellbeing of humanity, H the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may-june 1995 r ",
        "Representation of t he very poor t h r o u g h o ut history by Jean Tonglet* We do not intend, here, to go back beyond the time of the French Revolution (1789) interesting though it might be. For present purposes we can start with the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, made at the time of the Revolution. It was then that the idea of citizens' participation in the affairs of State first emerged, along with the associated concept of representation. Even today, however, 'representation' is by no means a universal idea. To be able to exercise full rights as a citizen, many requirements have to be met; you must have a certain amount of money, a fixed place of abode, pay taxes, be on the electoral roll and so on. All these conditions have prevented the poorest people from being represented. Because this sector of the popu lation has not been properly represented, intermediaries have usually taken over, in place of the parties concerned. Through out the history of the West, it has often been the Church which has acted as mediator. It has been a constant presence among the poorest sections of society, represented by parish priests, religious congregations, and charities. Affected by the misery around them, philanthropic organisations of all kinds, both religious and lay, have striven to meet the most urgent needs of the poor, taking on in the process the role of mediator. This 'humani tarian' world has thus brought about certain changes and has contributed to the acquisition of respect for certain rights.

All these interlocutors may claim a certain legitimacy owing to their proximity, presence, the aid they con tribute and their role as defenders of the rights of the world's poorest people. Direct forms of representation also exist. People come together, usually on the basis of a territory or a specific objective, to form community organis ations (such as tenants' committees) or campaigning groups for the right to housing or other specific rights. But even here, the phenomenon of 'internal ex clusion' is sometimes seen. Thus, for example, tenants' committees in a poor district often turn against their poorest members (the 'bad tenants', the 'bad payers') and sometimes even demand their expulsion ? Those within the group argu ing for this form of exclusion point out that, in their relations with the authorities, their case is weakened by these 'bad' people because they contribute to the poor 'name' of the district, or provide a useful pretext for intermediaries seeking to justify a lack of action in the sphere of maintenance or renovation. A more extensive kind of rep resentation, however, was advocated as far back as the French Revolution, notably by the Paris city engineer, Dufourney de Villiers. Through his work, he experienced at first hand the wretchedness of the population. In a 'List of Grievances', dated 25 April 1789, de Villiers urged the 'Fourth Estate, the Fourth Order, the Order of Vagabonds, Invalids, Beggars, Day Labourers, the Sacred Order of the Un fortunate' to draw up lists of their griev ances and thus to participate in the system of consultation within the framework of the States General. A clear distinction must be made between the various forms of represen tation referred to above. On one side, there are the mediators, for whom the poorest people might be regarded as clients, with all that that implies in terms of mutual dependence. On the other, there are the mechanisms which provide for the poorest to represent themselves. Some mediators certainly achieve a degree of understanding of what pov erty really entails, owing to their proximity to the very poor and the ways in which they have made themselves more aware of their aspirations. However, there are also many contrary examples in which med iators use their own ideas and judgments about the needs of their 'customers' as a basis for their actions. This explains, for example, the policy implemented up until the 1950s, whereby children were sent from or phanages in Liverpool to Australia and elsewhere without their relations ever being informed. Similarly, across Europe, children find themselves placed in the poorest circumstances with little hope of 'escape'. It also explains how outside involvement in the family life of people receiving social benefit develops, with the imposition of certain views on the edu cation of the children, family life, relation ships between spouses (for example, pressure on the couple to separate), family planning and the spending of money. In the context of research into the guaran teed income in Europe, a Dutch recipient of social benefit told us, seething with anger, how his social worker had demanded he give up paying into a small funeral- insurance plan he had 'treated' himself to. The social worker regarded this as a pointless expense for a recipient of State benefit. For the man himself, it was, on the contrary, of paramount importance to his concept of human dignity. Some years earlier, he had seen his partner buried without ceremony in a common grave for the destitute. Finally, some mediators some times prevent the poor from expressing their own opinions, because their views are deemed worthless or even damaging to the proper running of the system. We experienced this phenomenon ourselves in the course of the survey mentioned above, carried out by ATD Quart Monde at the request of the European Commission. When we were seeking the opinions of the poorest populations on the guaranteed income systems, some social services de partments, who could have introduced us to extremely poor families, refused to cooperate. Officials took the view that their departments were doing all within their power and that there was no point in asking questions of people who were the source of so many problems. ^ J.T. ^ the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may-june 1M5 ",
        "T r a de aspects u n a c k n o w l e d g ed at t he Social S u m m it by Myriam Vander Stichele* Global trade liberalisation has been embraced by many as a solution to a large number of the world's economic ills. Trade is expected to increase as barriers are removed and the result should be stronger growth and \u2014 it is assumed \u2014 greater prosperity. This should, in turn, lead to fewer social problems, better educational opportunities, enhanced health facilities and so on. Not everyone accepts all the elements of this analysis, however, particularly when it comes to looking at the plight of the world's poorest people. The author of this article, who is the Trade Programme Coordinator at the Inter national Coalition for Development Action, reviews a report on trade launched by the ICDA during the Social Summit and takes issue with some of the conclusions (and omissions) in the texts that were agreed by the politicians in Copenhagen. One of the reasons stated for convening the World Summit for Social Development in March 1995 was the fact that the world economy is becoming globalised. This phenomenon is 'pro foundly changing the parameters of social development' and is being 'accompanied by intensified poverty'. The final text of the Social Summit recognises that greatly increased trade is one of the factors contributing to globalisation and that this, in itself, opens up new opportunities for sustained economic growth in developing countries. During the debate and in the negotiations on the various texts adopted at the summit, however, there was little discussion about the impact of inter national trade and trade liberalisation on * Readers wishing to obtain a copy of the Alternative Report on Trade discussed in this article should contact the ICDA Secretariat, rue Stevin 115, B-1040 Brussels, tel 32-2-2300430, fax 32-2- 2300348. social development and particularly on poverty eradication, productive employ ment and social integration. Indeed, this complex relationship is not widely under stood and is seldom analysed. The limited economic criteria used in official reports on international trade are unable to provide a sufficient assessment of the impact of trade on the social development of people in Third World countries. Yet trade generates 19 times more income than aid in these countries. In 1992, the developing coun tries' export revenues amounted to $1167 bn compared with $60.4 bn from aid and $51.5 bn from investment. The International Coalition for Development Action (ICDA) launched an Alternative Report on Trade (ART) at the UN Social Summit with a view to clarifying the issues relating to the impact of trade on the lives of people in the Third World and the role of multinationals in world trade. ICDA is a network of development IMGOs which has been working mainly on the effects of international trade policies (such as the Uruguay Round) on sus tainable development and people in de veloping countries. The ART contains a series of concrete case studies prepared by civil associations in developing nations, as well as campaign materials from non-govern mental development organisations in European countries, which are aimed at offering an assessment of trade's impact at the social and micro-economic levels. It also gives an analysis of the main trends in international commerce and develop ments in international trade policy, looking at some of the realities of trade that are frequently ignored : the main agents, the politics, the lobbying, and so on. Contradictory findings A number of the conclusions in the Alternative Report on Trade contradict the recommendations of the Social Summit. For instance the Summit's Pro gramme of Action on a favourable national and international economic environment, as a basis for social development, talks of 'implementing fully and as scheduled' the multilateral trade agreement reached in the Uruguay Round. However, a careful analysis of Brazil's agricultural sector, and of the impact of trade liberalisation, reveals negative consequences on poverty eradication, employment and social integ ration : In Brazil, the liberalisation of trade in agricultural products under the Uruguay Round is taking place in a context where 73% of the 38 million people living in rural areas have an income below the official minimum wage and where concen trated land-ownership means that 80% of those owning land occupy just 13% of the total cultivable area. The great majority of small farmers are not in a position to intensify or modernise their production in line with the needs of industry because of competition from products imported with lower tariffs. This leads to further mar ginalisation and threatens the very ex istence of five million farms operated by poor families (representing 56% of the rural working population). The import liberalisation that has already taken place has undermined food security without leading to lower food prices. From being self-sufficient in wheat, Brazil is now a net importer. In the wheat and cotton sectors alone, 350 000 jobs have been lost. Poverty and hunger are a consequence, not so much of high prices, as of a lack of the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may-june 1995 r ",
        "d o s s i er A subsistence farmer in Brazil Competition from imports threatens the very existence of five million small farms purchasing power experienced by more than 30 million poor Brazilians. Estimates as to the likely gains from the Uruguay Round suggest very modest increases in the export volumes of Brazil's main products (between 1% and 3%). Only a limited group of 'competitive' products (such as poultry, orange juice and tobacco), produced by large agri\u00adbusi\u00ad nesses, are expected to do better, increas\u00ad ing their exports by more than 10% above current volumes. The foregoing analysis also re\u00ad veals a contradiction between the provi\u00ad sion supporting immediate implemen\u00ad tation of the Uruguay Round and other elements in the Programme of Action that was agreed. The latter includes a commit\u00ad ment to promote open markets and a multilateral rule\u00adbased trade system which is open and equitable for all people, 'particularly those living in poverty', and support for sustainable development of the agricultural sector, including improved food production and access to food for poor people. The kind of support for agricul\u00ad tural production allowed under the Uruguay Round agreement will certainly not be enough to implement effective domestic policies for sustainable agricul\u00ad ture, food security and the fight against poverty. As a result, some 4.5 million Brazilian families will be faced with a total lack of alternatives in their struggle for survival. Studies undertaken by UNCTAD, FAO and others, show that sub\u00adSaharan Africa, for example, will be a loser in the latest GATT process. The Social Summit texts, however, fail to acknowledge fully these negative effects. In essence, the Summit only recommended policies de\u00ad signed to enable developing countries to take the opportunities created by the new trade agreement. It called for assistance to be given to countries, particularly in Africa, that 'are not currently in a position to benefit fully from the liberalisation of the world economy'. However, it recommends action to help counter the negative effects on agriculture in the net food\u00adimporting and least developed countries, as decided in the Uruguay Round. The big question is : when will the Northern countries 'give full consideration to requests for technical and financial assistance to improve agricultural productivity and infrastructure' ? On the subject of poverty eradi\u00ad cation, a case study in the Alternative Report on Trade shows that family, farm\u00ad based banana production for export con\u00ad tributes significantly to this goal in the Caribbean Windward Islands. However, the protection afforded to that production is inconsistent with the Uruguay Round. The Social Summit Programme of Action requires fair competition and ethical con\u00ad duct on the one hand, so as to improve the functioning of the market and mitigate negative impacts resulting from market forces. On the other hand, it requires the dismantling of protectionist measures in line with the provisions of the Uruguay Round. If the new free trade rules were to be fully applied, Caribbean banana exports would plummet because of competition from bananas produced by transnational corporations in Latin America under often unacceptable conditions. People in the Windward Islands would suffer because no other export alternatives are likely to be available offering the same widespread benefits for the population. The European Union has so far stood firm on the Lom\u00e9 banana protocol that gives preferential access to traditional ACP banana pro\u00ad ducers. But there are imperfections in implementing the regime, and the EU is under attack from Latin American produc\u00ad ing countries and the United States.

        "d o s s i er people affected in Chiapas, Mexico, and with the situation in the cocoa and medicines sectors, are set out in the ART. These describe the complex links between trade on the one hand and poverty, employment and marginalisation on the other \u2014 issues that are not acknowledged in the proposals in the Social Summit texts. The latter place emphasis on the national level and national governments with often little mention of multilateral trade agree\u00ad ments. The relationship between the UN (including the Social Summit) and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is not examined. Indeed, the WTO is not even mentioned, presumably because it was created outside the UN framework. Trade liberalisation and better market access are nevertheless seen as beneficial ways to obtain the Summit's goals. Case studies in the Alternative Report indicate that where these could have positive effects on developing countries, the recommend\u00ad ations have not always been followed in the past by the industrialised countries. For instance, the first phase to implement new rules on textiles and clothing has only liberalised 0.1% of the EU textiles and clothing market. Once more, opportunities for alleviating poverty through job cre\u00ad ation, such as was seen in Bangladesh where there was a boom in employment for women in the textiles and clothing export industries, are being lost. Many inequalities The Alternative Report on Trade puts the case studies in perspective through an analysis of recent trends in North\u00adSouth trade and of important events at both the economic and political levels. The information is supplemented with appropriate graphics and tables. These reveal the inequalities in terms of the share of global trade enjoyed by the countries of the Third World. As a whole, these countries were exporting 25% of the world's traded goods in 1992 but there was a sharp contrast between the least developed countries (just 0.3%) and those of South and South East Asia (13%). The ART also reveals the cost of arms imports in developing countries ($12.4 bn in 1993). This sum is not far short of the amount of $15 bn which is needed to provide primary health for all, including the elimination of severe malnutrition. Throughout the Social Summit texts, diversification of commodities is called for. At the end of the ART section on recent trends in commodity trade, one of ICDA's member organisations, INZET, calls for consideration of other solutions for Africa such as supply management and commodity agreements. Highlighting the important role of multinationals The Social Summit documents also imply that economic growth will lead to more employment. The same prediction has been made as regards the expected effects of the Uruguay Round. The ART takes a less optimistic view, pointing out that trade is driven by competition and that rationalisation of production is de\u00ad stroying jobs rather than creating them. In this area, the strategies of transnational corporations (TNCs) play an important role. Between 1985 and 1992, the number of foreign affiliates of such companies tripled while employment in the TNCs themselves only increased by 12%. In the various sections of the Alternative Report on Trade, the overrid\u00ad ing role of transnational corporations in international trade becomes evident. Yet TNCs are largely absent from the texts and conclusions of the World Social Summit. These corporations have been and are lobbying for rules which are of special benefit to them but which ignore the impact on people in the developing countries. This is the case, for example with regard to intellectual property rights (TRIPs) which could increase the price of medicines, reducing the access of poor people to health care. Similarly, it is TNCs who are keen to see the adoption of new EU rules on chocolate which could have a negative impact on cocoa producers in the Third World. TNCs control a large part of world production through their invest\u00ad ment strategies, specialisation, strategic alliances and sub\u00adcontracting. The econ\u00ad omic power of the biggest multinationals is as great as, if not bigger than, the GDP of many developing countries. For instance. the sales of the world's four biggest corporations (General Motors, Ford, Exxon and Shell) amounted to $435 bn in 1993, which was more than the gross domestic product of all of Africa ! Governments signing\u00adup to the Social Summit declarations promise only to encourage transnational corporations 'to operate in a framework of respect for the environment' and 'with proper consider\u00ad ation for the social and cultural impact of their activities'. They agree to promote 'fair competition and ethical responsibility in business activities'. If the Summit is to have any real impact on world poverty and unemployment, the role of transnational corporations will need to be better ad\u00ad dressed. A drug dispensary in the Horn of Africa.

The Alternative Report, however, tries to provide a critical analysis that reveals the risks of trade liberalisation, the complex reality of the links between trade and social development, and the major actors. There is a need for further debate, more case studies and a global analysis from different countries and levels of society (civil associations, university, busi\u00ad ness, governments, the EU) to enhance the understanding as a basis for sound policies and international agreements that aim at sustainable development, IH M.V.S. the Courier \u03c0\" 151 \u25a0 may\u00adjune 1995 r ",
        "NGO Forum The a l t e r n a t i ve C o p e n h a g en c o n f e r en by Thibault Gr\u00e9goire* The aim of the Heads of State and of Government, meeting at the Bella Centre in Copenhagen, was to launch a programme for develop ment in the service of mankind. In parallel, a few kilometres away, in Holmen, nearly three thousand NGOs were meeting as a reminder that more has to be on offer than just the perennial promises. Although recent world summits in Rio, Vienna and Cairo have demonstrated the need to implement a common action programme aimed at long- lasting and sustainable development, they also bore witness to the limits \u2014 some would readily speak of a lack of will \u2014 of their applicability. Was the Copenhagen Summit on social development to flounder as a result of the same shortcomings? There were many who foresaw dark clouds hanging over the result and, amongst the NGOs, there was a general feeling of scepticism. The economy in the service of mankind A lack of genuine debate con cerning the structural roots of poverty, under-employment and social exclusion, the three main subjects of the Summit, was undeniably what the NGOs feared most. Although Copenhagen was to concentrate on a tragic social situation which has to be tackled, it was nevertheless necessary to avoid the customary conciliatory gestures. Social development would quite simply remain illusory if, by dealing with only the symptoms, an attack were not made on the causes of the social crisis. The United Nations' Summit could not produce what Christian Com- eliau called 'an ambulance sent to help the victims of the economic war'. 1 Economics: the key concept of the much-heralded campaign. As far as the NGOs were concerned, the leitmotiv of social development ought to be the institution of an 'economy in the sen/ice of mankind'. The single line of thought, modern dogmatics 2 , should be relegated to the dungeons. Neo-liberal orthodoxy has proved itself to be incompetent by placing growth above all aspects of human welfare. The world economic system, idealising competition as sacrosanct, has only widened the gulf separating rich and poor, affluent and excluded, countries in the North and countries in the South. The usual incantations no longer apply, since the current situation in industrialised countries implacably bears witness to the fact that growth does not necessarily go hand in hand with employment, quite the contrary. It is therefore now time to reverse the trend. Since internationalis ation of the economy is inevitable, it should be given a new role, namely that of serving mankind. To this end, the social dimension can no longer be isolated from financial, commercial or political diktats. Harmonisation of objectives must take over the predominant position given to economics. The need to reflect on the crux of the problem was to serve as a backdrop to the Summit. The major powers had no other choice and the NGOs hung like the sword of Damocles over Copenhagen. Such was the role that was announced. 'If there is no strong movement of public opinion in both North and South, persistent and consistent action on the part of the NGOs, popular and community organisations and * Trainee with the ACP-EU Courier. 1 Christian Com\u00e9liau, in Les cahiers d'Environne ment sans fronti\u00e8res, p. 21. 2 Ignacio Ramonet, in le Monde Diplomatique, January 1995, p. 1. trades unions, one can be sure that this Summit will see, yet again, a display of pious wishes' 3 . Only concrete and whole hearted participation on their part, that is to say taking account of civil society, would make it possible to draw up just solutions. To bring this task to a successful conclusion, the 3000 or so NGOs had to forget their varied backgrounds. Despite their great diversity, the various NGOs, both from North and South, were sometimes in harmony. Genuine alliances between groups of researchers, associations and other social movements were formed during preparation for the Summit, there by building up pressure and a will to succeed which was international. Through the medium of newspapers, magazines and numerous lectures or within the framework of national platforms, they did, for the most part, demonstrate solidarity in their proposals. For the most part, that is. Proposals for an alternative vision of development Inspired, on occasion, with a certain idealism, the NGOs attempted to nudge open a few doors on the future by recommending specific measures, without falling into the simple trap of merely imposing another universal model. Even at the preparatory stage (PrepCom), they had set up a code of behaviour for managing equitable development ('12 points for saving social development'). These priorities, which, it is claimed, are the framework for the future action pro gramme, were to come up throughout the Summit, each NGO emphasising one aspect or another, according to what type of organisation it was. Without claiming to be exhaustive, the major guidelines, could, however, be easily discerned. The fundamental priority, the initial foundation for authentic social development, was, for these NGOs, un doubtedly recognition of and respect for human rights, more particularly those termed indivisible and universal economic, social and cultural rights. Without doubt, this concept presupposes that there will be an end to any form of discrimination, be 3 Plate-forme Copenhague des associations fran cophones belges, CNCD, p. I. \"t the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may-june 1995 ",
        "d o s s i er this on the basis of race, sex, religion or culture. The same applies to the right for all to receive education. Although some NGOs insist on certain specific rights such as, for example, the right to nourishment 4 or those of autochthonous peoples, all were in agree ment in giving special attention to the condition of women. In fart, in the opinion of the NGOs, the Summit, particularly in the draft Declaration, did not place enough emphasis either on the effective measures to be taken to end the discrimi nation of which women are too often the victims (despite the UN Convention) or on their role in future social and economic development. Each player in development, that is to say household, community, government or social movement, is thus required to set up suitable policies. This obligation to respect human rights is inevitably reflected in commercial policies, whether of the private sector or those defined by the WTO (World Trade Organisation). There is a need to develop fairer commercial exchanges and to moni tor the flow of capital on an international scale and to make this and financial speculation subject to the requirements of social development for all. Intrinsically, these measures must be accompanied by a code of behaviour in this field : the famous social clauses. Protectionism in the North, the South's categorical rejection of social clauses, the attitude of the United States, and applying the rules long advocated by the International Labour Organisation were all subjects which promised to give rise to impassioned debate. The NGOs were persistently in favour of the clauses being applied firstly to major transnational companies whose size must, moreover, be reduced. In addition, the NGOs proposed that the WTO be made answerable to and thus be monitored by the United Nations. The same treatment was pro posed for Bretton Woods institutions, a radical modification of World Bank and International Monetary Fund policies having long been the battle cry of a number of NGOs. Debate principally con cerned structural adjustment programmes. In order to put an end to the widely discredited negative social effects of the economic conditions imposed by these institutions, the NGOs advocated total remodelling of these programmes on the basis of preliminary social-impact studies (under the auspices of the UN). Another of their concerns was debt which is re sponsible for diverting resources from their rightful destination (for example, health or education). The solution put forward by the NGOs was, of course, a radical one, since it required no less than complete debt cancellation. Still on the subject of aid to developing countries, but this time with reference to bilateral policies, the NGOs reminded OECD countries of the promise made a long time ago to devote 0.7 % of their GNP to official development assist ance (this reminder was naturally not directed at Denmark, Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands, who are the only ones to fulfil their obligations). Also, according to Rio, a new timetable had been established, for the year 2000, but current figures revealed that the situation for the majority of them was quite the opposite. The NGOs were also relatively in favour of the concept of the 20/20 pact proposed by the United Nations 5 . The fight against environmental degradation is also a topic the NGOs hold very dear. Long-term social development which takes this factor into account is an effective way of combating poverty and unemployment and thereby of recalling, once again after the fashion of Rio, the fact that economic and ecological interests must complement each other. Since the topics dealt with were population growth, the renewal of resources and energy- related pollution, the NGOs, supported by many scientists, proposed concrete sol utions in this sphere also. Hence, for example, plans to integrate the unem ployed into work renovating buildings or plans to use solar energy. The final favourite subject was disarmament. Any social development is 4 Advocated particularly by the FIAN (Food First Information and Action Network), referring to the fact that this right is enshrined in Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 5 The 20/20 pact means that the poorest countries devote 20% of their national budget and donor countries devote 20% of their aid to fundamental problems of human development. Women undoubtedly have a major role to play in future social development impossible while conflicts persist, and the NGOs called for world peace. In addition, although the end of the Cold War is a historic opportunity to make progress in terms of nuclear disarmament, one fart that should not be neglected is that conventional arms today claim many victims. Particular reference was made to the notorious anti-personnel mines with which many countries in the South abound. The NGOs insisted that all these measures would be possible only within a context of active consideration of social movements. This was the absolute basic requirement. The NGOs advocated that all governmental, international or community decisions must be based on participation by civil society in the various stages of the development process. This was the logical follow-up to their task in Copenhagen. To this end, 'the Summit must incite nations to suppress structures and policies which hamper access to decision-making on the part of populations and impede organis ation in everything relating to their living the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may-june 1995 I\" ",
        "d o s s i er conditions' 6 . The groups most often targeted are naturally women and also trades unions, and the NGOs endeavoured to remind certain governments to take these into account when formulating long\u00ad term employment programmes. Particular mention was also made of autochthonous peoples : in order to preserve their culture, any policy which affects the welfare of these communities must be implemented under their control. 'A Summit for nothing...' \u2014 but who is at fault? Have all the discussions about moving towards a fundamental modifi\u00ad cation of development resulted in any\u00ad thing ? This question could well be asked in the light of the NGOs' 'Alternative De\u00ad claration'. The latter was, in fact, a counter\u00addeclaration, a mirror\u00adimage of the parallel Summit, which simply emphasised the ideas close to the hearts of the organisations in question. There are genuine grounds for disappointment. For example, the heads of government signed only non\u00adbinding undertakings, the subject\u00admatter of the social clauses was skilfully eluded and proposals concerning structural adjust\u00ad ment programmes were vague, to say the least. However, all the NGOs did not express the same opinion. Some of them, like OXFAM, stated that they were relat\u00ad ively satisfied with the Copenhagen Summit because it could henceforth serve as a basis for future action or, alternatively, because it gave rise to a solemn undertak\u00ad ing to attempt to eradicate poverty. These NGOs will perhaps celebrate the fact that Denmark and Austria have both cancelled the debts of developing countries (US\u00ad Si 66 million and US $100 million, respect\u00ad ively). In any case, no one was naive enough to believe that, under the in\u00ad fluence of the representatives of civil society, a magic wand would be waved at the end of the Summit, bringing an end to social deprivation. Incidentally, what exactly is this civil society that was supposedly rep\u00ad resented by the NGOs? Is it that of the 6 Orientation document in response to the draft Declaration and to the draft Action Programme, Caritas internationalis, CIDSE, July 1994. outcasts, the excluded, the deprived, the down\u00adand\u00adouts and others trying to live in a system which, for them, has been discredited. Or has the claim to represent 'civil society' been hijacked by organis\u00ad ations who, in reality, lack any real influence? Of course, many NGOs have thousands of people behind them. But where were the associations for the unemployed ? Mostly absent. Where were the organisations which defend the cause of the homeless hiding ? Forthey were also absent. How many NGOs came from the South ? Very few. Too few. It costs a great deal to travel to the Danish capital and, in fact, if one looks closer, the priorities referred to above are, first and foremost, instructions directed at states and inter\u00ad national institutions. Did the NGOs there\u00ad fore have the wrong idea of their mission, or does this criticism apply to at least some of them ? Many observers, as well as other NGOs, reproach them for restricting them\u00ad selves to the customary activity of lobby\u00ad ing, contenting themselves with speaking about ideology and idealism without digging deeper for solutions based on the fruits of their own experiences. In addition, Putting an end to child labour: an obligation which is not yet universally recognised the Alternative Declaration did not obtain the desired 1000 signatures (only 600). The reasons for its rejection were of two types : there were those NGOs who felt that the declaration had nothing to do with them, their mission in Holmen being only 'to attend' and there were those who dis\u00ad agreed with the proposals. This was the case, in particular, with many Spanish NGOs, including M\u00e9dicos del Mundo : 'It is not a matter of reiterating battle orders or of claiming utopian rights but, rather, of succeeding in adopting concrete measures which are valid from day to day and, above all, implementing methods for eradicating corruption' 7 . Finally, the mistake on the part of NGOs undoubtedly lay in the fact that they did not take advantage of having been in the background. Rather than exchanging experiences in Holmen, they preferred to use their time peering at the Bella Centre, wm T.G. 7 El Mundo, 10 March 1995, p. 57. \"I the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may\u00adjune 1995 ",
        "Social development A u n i v e r s al p r i o r i ty The World Summit on Social De\u00ad velopment which was held in March 1995 in Copenhagen pro\u00ad vided an opportunity to take stock of the social situation over the past few decades and to devise a social agenda for the 21st century. The United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) was intensively involved in prepar\u00ad ations for the summit. UNRISD, which was set up in 1963 on the initiative of the Dutch government, devotes itself exclusively to research into social development. Al\u00ad though it is part of the United Nations system, the Institute is entirely financed by voluntary contributions and enjoys a large amount of autonomy. UNRISD is com\u00ad pletely free 'to define the questions into which it will conduct research, decide on the methods to be applied, select re\u00ad searchers, draw conclusions and publish the results'. In anticipation of the Social Summit, the Institute stepped up its activity and mobilised its network of researchers throughout the world. Intense pre\u00adSummit activity has been brought to a successful conclusion. The Institute has issued a number of publications containing a whole range of proposals made by researchers, academics, economists and other organisations. It has also drawn up a kind of action programme of what could be achieved in the field of social develop\u00ad ment. The aim was to prepare the ground for those taking part. In fact, social development encompasses a number of fields which are very different, although related, ranging from the social and political effects of the economic crisis on the Third World to the impact of environ\u00ad mental deterioration on the female con\u00ad dition and the problems of refugees. Bearing in mind the diversity and comp\u00ad lexity of the world today, the Institute has attempted to clarify and highlight the main social problems facing us as we approach the end of the century. A changing world Everyone agrees that the world today is moving forward at a frantic pace. Technological innovation, advances in information technology and speedier, more powerful means of communication, mean that for a number of years now, mankind has been moving at a rate which is faster than its 'normal' cruising speed. Whereas it took Europe more or less a century to achieve its industrial revolution, now each day sees a new batch of technological revolutions. Their scope means that the changes affect everyone on the planet, from Vietnamese farmers to New York brokers. And it is no longer just a question of technological upheaval. Society as a whole, from a political, social and economic viewpoint, has entered a phase of rapid and frantic change. The process termed globalisation by many has become one of the great issues. While we may congratulate ourselves for some of the changes wrought by this process, others have had devastating results on individuals, populations and countries. The very nature of the process means that everyone is affected. It remains, however, the case that the effect on those who do not take part in this development and who suffer instead of profiting from it are frequently disastrous. Taken as a whole, the inter\u00ad national community has often been taken by surprise by the speed at which the changes have occurred. Sometimes it has simply decided to ignore them. Many have believed that a laissez\u00adfaire economic approach would ultimately provide all the solutions \u2014 and that social problems would be eradicated through the es\u00ad tablishment of a healthy market economy. With this in mind, a number of govern\u00ad ments have pared down or dismantled their social institutions. Such measures have had dramatic effects on the poorest and most disadvantaged sections of society and all those who have not been swept along by the dynamism of the free market. Studies published by UNRISD clearly highlight the way in which decision\u00ad making powers have, over the past few years, been passed over to institutions which, whether they be private or public, political or financial, have systematically ignored the social implications of their actions. This has been particularly true of the structural adjustment policies ad\u00ad vocated by the IMF and the World Bank in Third World countries. These policies were intended in theory to permit developing countries to put their shaky economies back on their feet. In practice, however, they have almost always failed to take account of the realities in the countries to which they have been applied, tending to destabilise an already precarious social and economic situation. This has meant that even though the North and South are now intimately linked, the connection has tended to work in favour of the former for the simple reason that it operates the controls of the new world order in which the free market is 'king'. There is, however, a growing realisation that economic de\u00ad velopment and social development go hand in hand. Indeed, economic globalis\u00ad ation has led in its turn to a globalisation of social problems. This means that if account is not taken very soon of the social aspects of development, there is a danger that the economic engine will begin to falter. As Boutros Boutros\u00adGhali has written, it is now necessary 'to elevate the social question to the level of a universal priority'. A dangerous imbalance In order to tackle poverty, it is necessary to institute social measures to forestall or compensate for the dysfunc\u00ad tions resulting from the market economy, which have continuously widened the gap between rich and poor. Today, almost a third of the population of the Third World lives in conditions of absolute poverty. Inequalities have deepened even in the industrial countries. In Europe, almost 15% of the population lives below the poverty line. The tension resulting from this situ\u00ad ation means that the search for a solution is the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may\u00adjune 1995 I\" ",
        "not just a moral question, but also one of international security. UNRISD and other organisations have proposed a whole range of measures intended to combat poverty and exclusion, create jobs, curb crime and drug trafficking, take action to correct the inequalities between poor and rich countries, fight starvation and prom\u00ad ote education for everyone; in short, to create a fairer world. To achieve this, we must first strive to eliminate the flagrant imbalances which currently exist. Even though, since the Second World War, mankind has developed at an unprecedented rate, such development is indisputably of a selective nature. Development and wealth always exist in conjunction with the most un\u00ad speakable destitution. The existence of wealth and poverty alongside one another and the resulting contrasts are disturbing. A large number of children continue to die of hunger while huge quantities of food are wasted each day. World wealth has increased sevenfold over the past 50 years, but the billion richest individuals receive 60 times more than the billion poorest. And military expenditure is now equal to the total annual income of half the human race. In view of the pressures which could result from these imbalances and the dangers lying in wait for mankind as a whole if the situation deteriorates or even continues as it is at present, it is essential that thought be given to a new social contract, which must be implemented on a global scale. A new social contract UNRISD and other United Nations organisations, such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have published a large number of reports, especially in the run\u00adup to the Copenhagen Summit, putting forward suggestions as to how social development can be restarted. Now that the cold war has ended, there is much less danger of a nuclear Armageddon. However, even though fear of a worldwide cataclysm is no longer the order of the day, millions of Shanty town in the Philippines Even though there is less danger of nuclear Armageddon, millions of human beings still live in a climate of permanent insecurity human beings still live in a climate of permanent insecurity. This insecurity is due among other things to 'the dangers of famine, civil war and the illnesses with which the Third World is inflicted. In the industrial countries, it is mainly crime, drug addiction and the precarious nature of employment which cause insecurity. Long term aid for developing countries is essen\u00ad tial in order to permit their reintegration into the international economy. At the moment, the low\u00adincome countries have been left holding a poor 'hand'. They lack the means necessary to face the industrial countries on equal terms in the race for competitiveness and profitability. There is a need, therefore, for more constructive relations between rich and poor countries. The survival of both depends on it. We only have to consider the problem of indebted\u00ad ness to see how the relations are governed by interdependence. Although the poor countries are compelled to borrow to enable them to function at all, the rich countries are, for their part, obliged to lend to keep the economic machinery running and to enable the debtor countries to pay the interest on their debts. For example, when Mexico became insolvent in De\u00ad cember 1994, a rescue plan was negotiated as a matter of urgency between the main creditors to enable it to continue to service its debt. In order to increase the pace of social and economic development in less advanced countries, in Africa in particular, it has been proposed that donor countries divert 0.7% of their GNPs to development aid. This aim, which has been frequently reiterated, is currently only achieved by four countries : Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. A great deal has also been said about a new '20\u00ad20' deal for human development. Based on the sharing of responsibilities between donor and developing countries, the idea is that the former would devote 20% of their official development assistance (ODA) to social programmes, while the latter would allocate 20% of their total budgets for the same purpose. Another way of making money available for development would be to 'harvest the peace dividend'. Since 1987, military expenditure has fallen by 3.6% per year on average. The amounts released in this way amount to $935 billion, 3/4 of which is 'savings' made in the industrial countries. However, this reduction in military expenditure has not automatically led to an increase in amounts spent on development aid. On the other hand, the poorest regions of the world, and sub\u00ad Saharan Africa in particular, have not reduced their military expenditure at all. By the same token, the arms\u00adproducing coun\u00ad tries have taken a short\u00adterm commercial view of matters and have continued their export trade. At present, 86% of arms deliveries are made by the five permanent members of the Security Council. Buyers and sellers must act together to reverse this trend. Exporting countries would first of all have to stop subsidising their arms exports. In addition, the amount of development aid granted to the poorest countries should be increased. This would give them the resources to reduce social and econ\u00ad omic disparities. These are frequently the cause of the instability which governments cite to justify their 'need' for weapons. In short, the relative security afforded by armaments must be replaced by the security of a social and economic environ\u00ad ment which is more equitable and stable. A reduction in military budgets amounting to 3% per year between 1995 and 2000 would release $460 billion. This could be used to accelerate social development and to finance conversion of the arms industry into manufacturing for civil purposes. Another major source of finan\u00ad cing on an international scale might be provided by the imposition of a tax on speculative international capital transac\u00ad tions (suggested by James Tobin, Winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics), and an international levy on polluting materials. Imposition of a rate of 0.05% on spec\u00ad ulative transactions would yield a sum of $150 billion per year. A tax of $1 per barrel of petrol or its equivalent for coal would release $66 billion per year. These amounts could be spent on social development and protecting the environment. ^ the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may\u00adjune 1995 ",
        "d o s s i er To achieve these objectives, in\u00ad dividual countries and international insti\u00ad tutions will have to show goodwill. The role of the UN in particular will have to be strengthened in order to promote better cooperation. Finally, it is essential that monitoring organisations, especially for checking on arms sales and observance of the 20\u00ad20 part, be set up. There must also be a possibility of imposing restrictive measures where the rules are not followed, if the proposals are to be effective. An interdependent world Human security is currently threatened in numerous ways. Some of these threats, such as starvation or civil war, are restricted to particular regions of the planet, but others are not limited by political or geographical boundaries. These include the AIDS pandemic and environ\u00ad mental deterioration. Whatever the threat, however, the solutions are mostly to be found at the international level. And the reasons for the emergence of such threats must be placed in a more inter\u00ad national context. For example, stopping drug traf\u00ad ficking will only be possible if we tackle the reasons for drug\u00adtaking in industrial coun\u00ad tries and if alternative ways of earning a living are provided for drug producing countries, such as Bolivia, which earns 20% of its total GNP from the cocaine industry. Crime and violence, not to men\u00ad tion terrorism, have also taken on a multinational character. These have de\u00ad veloped exponentially in our societies, mainly because of an undesirable social and economic environment, which is itself due to deep\u00adrooted international imbalances. Crime does not develop in a vacuum and it may have an impart on areas with which it is not directly connected, such as invest\u00ad ment. A large number of foreign investors hesitated for a long time before establish\u00ad ing themselves in South Africa \u2014 a very violent society where someone is mur\u00ad dered every 20 minutes. Famines provide another ex\u00ad ample. Although limited to particular regions and caused natural factors such as droughts, these are frequently due to maladjusted agricultural policies and in\u00ad adequate environmental management. Solutions to all these problems are, nowadays, rarely found at a national level alone and so an international view must be taken. New structures will have to be established or old ones reinforced if we wish effectively to fight crime, drug cartels, environmental problems or the exploi\u00ad tation of women and child labour. During its preparatory work, UNRISD adopted a number of proposals. A key one was the creation of an Economic Security Council within the UN. Its task would be to analyse the main economic problems, determine their impart on social development and define the action neces\u00ad sary to put them right. It is necessary for nations to be represented at the inter\u00ad national level, perhaps, for example, through a 'People's Assembly' within the United Nations. Such an institution would tighten the links between the various peoples inhabiting our planet. For a number of years, we have been witnessing the resurgence of nationalism. In order to prevent nations from turning inwards in this way, it will be crucial in future to redefine common aspirations and common goals for the entire human race. Finally, the Institute feels that the possibility of setting up a Central World Bank should also be considered, to replace or coexist with the IMF and the World Bank, which are often rightly or wrongly accused of only representing the interests of the industrial countries. Although these proposals are currently vague, their very existence should be welcomed, as they point to a way in international collabor\u00ad ation can be redefined and reinforced. Towards a new concept of citizenship Since the end of the Second World War, we have witnessed true integration, both atan international and a regional level. The best example of this is perhaps the European Union, which now encompasses 15 countries. Other regions of the world have also followed this path, with greater or lesser degrees of success. However, although links have been tig\u00ad htened at a political and economic level, very little has been done from a social viewpoint. In Third World countries, social action is all too frequently still at an embryonic stage, while in the industrial countries, there has been a dear reduction in the commitment of organisations to social development. There must therefore be a re\u00ad think. Social development must be injected with a new dynamism which will allow everyone on the planet to become a fully fledged world citizen. The proposals ad\u00ad opted by UNRISD are intended to help achieve this. According to the Institute, true and active citizenship is based on three pillars : respect for human rights and individual liberties; political participation via universal suffrage and involvement in public life; and finally a certain level of socio\u00adeconomic well\u00adbeing. There are not many countries in which these three pillars co\u00adexist harmoniously, if they exist at all. To implement the third element, it is essential for new life to be breathed into international solidarity. This is a question of effective and constructive solidarity, not charity. There is a need for redistribution along more equitable and humane lines both within countries and between them. The current trend for an increasing number of re\u00ad sponsibilities to be transferred from poli\u00ad tical institutions to multinational economic and financial corporations must be re\u00ad versed or at least moderated. The role of state institutions and international forums must be reaffirmed and reinforced. One of the main roles of the Copenhagen Summit was precisely to remind the world and its leaders that, despite the indisputable progress which has been achieved over the past half century, there are still serious imbalances. The work of UNRISD clearly shows that a solution to these imbalances must be found as a matter of urgency and that social development is a universal priority. However, the final declaration made at Copenhagen did not dictate anything to anyone. The task of drawing up concrete measures and proposals therefore re\u00ad mains. \u25a0\u25a0 F.C the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may^une 1995 r ",
        "The Nordic c o u n t r i e s: a society f or all \u039c^\u0397\u03af-^\u0390* The Summit held in Copenhagen mobilised international opinion. Just as in 1981 in Cancun, govern\u00ad ments and politicians were asked to concentrate their minds. This they did. The Summit laid particular stress on the importance of human beings (the people-centred ap\u00ad proach) and on the way in which people should interact to tackle their own problems and those of their physical environment. It was no coincidence that the Conference should be staged in Northern Europe. The eminent position afforded social issues by the state in the de\u00ad mocracies of Scandinavia countries is well known. It is at once a factor and a unit of measurement of global progress. The 'Swedish model', in effect an embodiment of the entire Scandinavian system, inspired politicians further south in continental Europe, particularly in France, where President Pompidou wanted to achieve it 'plus sunshine'. At the Summit, Finland's President Ahtisaari stressed that his country had always defended the principle of people-centred development: 'the result of contemplation about our de\u00ad mocracy and our individual traditions, linked to a highly advanced sense of social responsibility', he commented. The wel\u00ad fare state has long been cited as the 'answer' to various socio-economic challen\u00ad ges but current economic problems have brought its viability into question. 'Perhaps the model needs a few far-reaching modifications', stated President Ahtisaari, who reaffirmed his conviction that 'the foundations of the welfare-state system remain healthy \u2014 a society for all regard- Total social expenditure by source of Denmark less of the wealth and status of each individual in that society'. The welfare state, has many supporters and arouses much admiration but it also provokes controversy about its economic basis and its potential effects on individual liberties. It is usually the benefits rather than the concerns which are up\u00ad permost in people's minds. Much more than a simple historical reference, the 'Nordic' model arouses great practical interest and has a certain intellectual attraction. Being centred on people and their social welfare, it bases the progress of the individual on reforms and ongoing improvements to his physical and cultural environment. Environmental investment and the development of resources are the cornerstones of this system. One of the most noteworthy results for the Scandi\u00ad navian countries is the very high level of economic and technological development that has been achieved despite the sparse- ness of the populations. But what are the foundations of the Nordic model ? The 'ideology' of social welfare in Scandinavia is based on the principle that all strata of society must have decent living conditions and certain fundamental rights in respect of unemployment, illness and old age. The principal elements of these rights lie in their universality, and public measures are seen as the best way of guaranteeing them. Thus, virtually all social benefits are financed by direct or indirect taxation. These account for approximately 31% of Denmark's GDP as against an average of 27% in the EU as a whole! It is noteworthy that social expenditure in Denmark rep\u00ad resents no less than 50% of all public spending. The system involves social trans- financing fers to ensure a better redistribution of income. By international standards, the result is impressive \u2014 only 4% of the population in Scandinavian countries live below the OECD-defined poverty line. It is estimated that 80% of the transfers in question go to those who would, other\u00ad wise, be classified below that line. The graph gives more information about social expenditure in Denmark, (comparable with that of the other Nordic states), and the average for the same expenditure in the EU as a whole. In family matters, for example, in all Scandinavian countries there are well-established measures for compensating women should their income drop when they become pregnant, have a child or adopt a child. Similarly, allowances are granted to families with children, while housing is allocated on the basis of the requirements of the family, elderly persons or the needy. The state also steps in to take the place of bad payers of maintenance in the event of divorce. Health allowances are allocated either through the state or directly via one's employer. There is a right to an early pension for those who are unable to work on health or social grounds. Thus, the 'Nordic way of life' is special in terms of the priority it affords social issues and the equality of oppor\u00ad tunity it provides from a very early age. It includes an education system which avoids means-testing and places great emphasis on public-sector involvement in managing virtually all the social services. The Scandi\u00ad navian societies have gained the necessary knowledge and developed high-quality technologies in the field of social insti\u00ad tutions and services. Elements of these approaches have been copied worldwide, ensuring for the Nordic model an inter\u00ad nationally renowned reputation. How\u00ad ever, the success of the socio-economic system in Scandinavian countries has only been achieved through the commitment of the people of these countries to build 'a society for all'. This is perhaps the key lesson for anyone seeking to emulate the Nordic model. \u25a0\u25a0 Luden Pegni \u25a1 Employers \u25a1 Beneficiaries CD Government D Other ",
        "A novel experience fH T he p l a n t e r \u00ad c h e q ue o p e r a t i on in C a m e r o on by V\u00e9ronique Alary and Georges Courade* Confronted by a worldwide crisis in coffee and cocoa prices, the Ca\u00ad meroon Government, supported by the European Union, has for several years been attempting to make the change from a price\u00ad regulation system under State con\u00ad trol to a complete opening\u00adup of thesector. One of the key phases in this restructuring plan was the repayment of debts owed to the planters. The authors present an assessment of this operation and a number of conclusions drawn from their work. At the beginning of the 1990s, after an initial stage during which costs came down owing to a reduction in export tariffs and intermediary margins, the Cameroon Government set itself the task of remodelling its marketing policy, hit\u00ad herto dominated by the all powerful National Basic Products Marketing Office (ONCPB). In financial crisis, the Office was faced with a situation of having to suspend price support payments to producers. The ONCPB was abolished to make way for the more lightweight ONCC (National Cocoa and Coffee Office), which permitted greater commercial freedom while main\u00ad taining a degree of annual stabilisation. Abolishing such a body was not without problems, a case in point being how to balance the ONCPB's debts arising from cocoa and coffee shipments via inter\u00ad mediate structures and incurred by way of price stabilisation? The ONCPB was in a situation where it had to suspend pay\u00ad ments although it was imperative that the thousands of planters be reimbursed. Within this context, the European Commis\u00ad sion, using STABEX funds, made a signific\u00ad ant contribution to financing the oper\u00ad ation (to the tune of CFAF 44.5 billion). * V\u00e9ronique Alary, doctoral student at Paris I and researcher at ORSTOM. Georges Courade, geograp\u00ad her at ORSTOM and lecturer at IEDES. Cocoa is one of Cameroon's main crops Avoiding pitfalls To ensure that the operation ran smoothly, a STABEX cell was set up in Cameroon whose mission was to coordi\u00ad nate and verify the amounts of the intermediate structures' debts after they had provided a breakdown of their finan\u00ad cial situation (production, approach costs, finance costs) together with a list of payments made to their planters. This was an operation fraught with difficulties, since some of the debtors sent their production directly to independent processing plants, with these manufacturers shipping on to exporters. Therefore, to avoid any imbal\u00ad ance amongst the local inhabitants when arrears were paid, it was decided that these private operators should also receive assistance in honouring their debts. A further problem was encountered when drawing up lists of eligible recipients and debts when it came to updating these debts with respect to the initial payments made. These lists were prepared using the intermediaries' accounting records and were from then on also drawn up on the basis of receipts issued by the planters. After comparing lists provided by the intermediaries with audits conducted at the former ONCPB, the amounts were set in proportion to the index derived from 'amount of ONCPB\u00adintermediate debt/ total intermediate\u00adplanter debt'. Any balance remaining after payment to the planters was allocated to the intermediate structure. A cheque system was set up to ensure efficient reimbursement: after signature of a discharge, individual, non\u00ad endorsable cheques are handed over to the intermediaries at public ceremonies at which the government and the European Delegation are represented (the latter is responsible for explaining the origin of and reason behind the funds). It was then up to the intermediaries, once they had the cheques in their possession, to ensure that they were distributed to the planters who had been informed earlier by radio and the press and also by representatives from the authorities, the message being relayed via the classic 'word\u00adof\u00admouth' method. At the same time, this contact with the planters enabled the intermediaries to bolster their confidence, given the context the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 may\u00adjune 1995 r ",
        "c l o s e - up of freedom in purchasing which had, meanwhile, been set up by the Cameroon State. The cash was then paid out at bank branches in an operation which, in the more inaccessible regions, was facilitated by the setting-up of 'mobile cashpoints' by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole du Cameroun, which was the commercial bank associated with the operation. This operation enabled more than 50 000 planters from five different provinces to be reimbursed, an achie vement which invites a number of com ments in the light of a study that was made of it. Understanding and use of the funds Initial comment relates to the planters' perception of the operation. In effect, being too distant from those who devised it both in cultural and geographical terms, the recipients appear to have had some difficulty in understanding the ma chinery of the operation in real time as well as in working out exactly who was behind the scheme. This problem in appreciating the situation was, naturally, exacerbated by the random nature of the way in which they had been informed and also owing to the election campaign going on at the time. Many planters associate the pre sidential elections (held in 1992) with vague promises and they are a source of scepticism and mistrust. Moreover, the A Cameroon woman in her small coffee plantation official intermediaries or those in the sector did not always rush to pass on the information, as they had only a very sketchy knowledge of STABEX. The result of this was that only a very small propor tion of planters were aware of the origin of the funds. A second comment relates to satisfaction on the part of the planters. Easy access to bank branches (above all for the elderly) and the virtual absence of approach expenses or commission fees when the arrears were cashed in certainly received a warm welcome from the re cipients. In fart, three out of four planters stated that they received the total amount of the cheque. The study also dem onstrates that the vast majority of planters actually turned up in person at the bank to cash their cheque (in other cases, a family member or someone from the cooperative was delegated to attend), and there was none of the customary wrangling to prove their identity. There is, finally, a third comment arising from the study which relates to the use of the funds received. The amounts averaged CFAF 94 000, and one-quarter of the planters received in excess of CFAF 200 000, yet most of the planters had spent their money within three months. There were various reasons for this, the planters' spending being subject to the constraints of urgent needs and require ments which were themselves conditioned by an inherent scale of priorities. In this connection, it should be noted that the planter was not always the only one to decide the fate of the sums received since, in many cases, other people benefited from the recipient's generosity \u2014 these were people of varying degrees of close ness to the planters, for instance spouses, unemployed family members, agricultural workers, etc. In any case, the money was spent principally in three specific areas : the first was to pay off loans, most of which had been taken out for the childrens' education, for funerals or to repay another loan (under the so-called 'rotating' system). The second priority when allocat ing the money was education and health, clothing, farming (particularly purchasing equipment) and investing in business and stock breeding. Of marginal importance and of lowest priority was saving, with tontines remaining the principal desti nation of the funds, followed by banks, friends and family. An encouraging experience This complex and risky operation which, given the context, was an outstand ing success, enabled the European Commis sion to demonstrate that it could guaran tee effective direct payment to the plan ters. In doing so, it also strengthened the intermediaries, enabling them to find healthier accounts and renewed credibility in the eyes of their supporters or clients, a very necessary quality given the recent opening-up of the sector. However, it is a pity that the origin of the funds should remain a mystery for many planters. Having said this, although misappropri ation was reported here and there, the intermediaries were generally imaginative in responding to the planters' wishes and requirements. Finally, the Cameroon Government was able to support inter mediaries forced to adapt to the market. Above all, it regained legitimacy as an economic regulator, a function which was being increasingly called into question. The final stage of restructuring is currently in progress \u2014 the complete opening-up of the sector and the freeing of prices together with the abolition of the ONCC.

        "The i n c r e a s i ng [\u03c2| i n f o r m a l i ty of A f r i c an e c o n o m i es by Odoardo Como * 'The informal economy is the people's spon\u00ad taneous and creative response to the State's incapacity to satisfy the basic needs of the impoverished masses' (Mario Vargas Llosa) Structural adjustment continues to be a constant in the economic policies of many developing countries. This is certainly the case for the African economies, still in serious crisis after the terrible decade of the 1980s. The signs are there for all to see. Growth is half what it was in the 1970s, having fallen to an annual average of 2.1 % for the period 1980-91 (as against a 3.3% average for developing countries as a whole and 2.9% for OECD countries). Investment fell in real terms by 53% between 1980 and 1989. During the same decade, the real price of certain primary products, notably cocoa, coffee, cotton and tea, fell by half. The debt ratio (foreign debt/GNP) exceeded 109% in 1991, the highest level in the world. Human capital investment is still insufficient to increase significantly the indicators relating to the development of human resources. Among other things, structural adjustment programmes are leading to drastic reductions in the public sector. There have been redundancies in the civil service, or at the very least recruitment has been suspended. Civil service salaries have been cut or frozen, and public enterprises have been privatised with the inevitable result : the dismissal of surplus labour. The job situation has been de\u00ad teriorating, both as a consequence of the economic crisis, and in some cases as an immediate effect of the measures imposed * This is an edited version of a text submitted by the author who works at the Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Napoli 'Federico II'. by SAPs. Unemployment has increased from 10% in the mid-1970s to 18% now, and in some countries it has touched 30%. About half the population lives in poverty. Prospects remain bleak, given the continu ing trend towards growth without em ployment, which was recently identified in the UNDP's Human Development Report for 1993. In the 1990s too, according to ILO estimates, the number of manufacturing jobs in Africa will not keep pace with demographic trends, increasing by just 2.4% per annum, while manpower in creases at the rate of 3.3%. Increasing exclusion The area of exclusion is therefore increasing : exclusion from growth, exclu sion from employment, and exclusion from basic services. The inability of the state to satisfy the expectations of its population seems ever greater. Conversely, forms of adaptation are on the increase and the informal economy is a typical manifes tation of this. Although definitions may differ somewhat, the informal sector can be said to cover all those forms of productive activity, both of goods and especially services, carried out on a small scale, while totally or partially evading institutional, fiscal or insurance obligations. A certain degree of informality is inevitable in any type of economy. It can, in fart, constitute one of the means by which new needs begin to be satisfied when they originate in traditional societies, thus generating spontaneous development. It may also be a way of circumventing the high degree of institutionalisation in societies. However, it is also true that the current growth of the informal sector is mainly due to other explanations. Indeed, given the general failure to promote informal activities effectively so as to make them useful to overall socio-economic development, the growth of this sector nowadays appears more to respond to the pure logic of survival than to demonstrate the validity of the laissez-faire approach. Today a strange social trend seems to be at work. Societies, including African ones, are becoming increasingly institutionalised. Even though the state is disengaging from productive sectors, it is attempting to strengthen its role as the arbiter and guarantor of the rules of the game. The result is somewhat paradoxical with the state endeavouring to insti tutionalise its presence and formalise rules at a time when private initiatives are hindered by a difficult economic situation. An example of this is to be found in the field of taxation. States are attempting to structure fiscal systems better by introduc ing western-style VAT, or by seeking to tax the informal sector. The logical con sequence of this is that the informal sector has itself begun to change in order to adapt to the social and institutional context. Different components of the informal sector When we speak of the increasing informality of African economies, we are referring not just to the general growth in the informal sector,! but also to its internal dynamics. It should not be seen as a uniform whole but rather as divided into segments. One component is made up of people who are not really part of the labour market at all, such as prostitutes or 'car-minders' and 'shoe-shines' in large African cities. There is no sense in talking of institutionally and formally identifiable supply and demand in relation to such categories of work which are not recog nised and are sometimes even illegal. the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 m.iy-juno 1995 r ",
        "There is also an informal sector within the market, which can in turn be divided into three categories. The first is what may be termed low profile informal activity. This includes many small trades plied by a self-employed workforce which is completely lacking in training and has no fixed workplace. The focus here, not unnaturally, is on the provision of services. The sale of pre-cooked foods, light and non-organised transport on rickshaws, hawking and domestic service come to mind. The second category could be defined as intermediate informal activity. In this case, there is a low level of skill and the use of (a little) employed labour. A small amount of starting capital is required for equipment. This category would in clude small carpentry or cycle-repair busi nesses, the small-scale transport of goods and persons, and retailing. The third category is made up of high-profile ac tivity. Here we find manufacturing, the existence of a sound basic professional training, perhaps acquired in the modern sector, the hiring of staff, and sufficient capital assets to cover start-up costs. It includes large-scale commercial activities such as motorcycle and car repairs, manu facturing using wood and metal to a reasonable standard, and the production of other manufactured goods. The dif ference between this informal category and the others is the existence of a start-up barrier (mainly in relation to skills and the required initial capital). The distinction between this field and the formal private sector is to be found in the partial evasion An example of 'intermediate' informal activity : a motorcycle repair shop in Bamako, Mali of some institutional factors, the relation ship between employer and employee, and the lack of availability of loan finance (always problematic for the informal sector, as banks are reluctant to lend to anyone who is unable to provide suitable guarantees). Mopping up on the margins When we talk about the \u00a1n- formalisation of African economies, we are mainly referring to the process which has swelled the marginal categories of the informal economy, that is to say those outside the market, and the first two categories (low profile and intermediate) operating within the market. This has been described by one author (IVIilton Santos in L'espace partag\u00e9) as 'the lower circuit of the economy. In a period of dramatic decline in economic activity, it is precisely the poor segment of the economy which is swelled with the persons expelled from the civil service and the privatised enterprises. What appears to be significant is that the overall reduction in the level of economic activity has led to lower labour demand from both the formal private sector and the high-profile informal sector. The con sequence of all this has been more un employment (which in Africa has increased by 6% in five years, and is still increasing) and growth in the intermediate and low- profile informal sectors. The ILO has estimated that at least 70% of new jobs created are currently in the informal sector. As mentioned earlier, this is the least dynamic part of the informal sector, characterised by the absence of barriers to entry. Today, this sector has taken on the role of mopping up on the margins of the labour market. This leads to an increase in the business carried out in defiance of the regulations, and clearly damages formal activities. Increasing marginalisation is also caused by the fart that as urban employ ment and salaries fall, there is a knock-on effect on the rural areas. This is because the remittances sent back by those who previously left the countryside to take jobs in the cities have dried up. Thus, while it is true that the fall in employment is essen tially an urban phenomenon, it also means that the countryside has become poorer. Accepting the thesis that the poorest part of the informal economy has gained in importance as the socio-econ omic fabric of Africa is progressively dismantled, it is difficult to see how this informal activity is capable of providing the basis on which to construct the new model of development advocated by Latouche in his work '77ie Planet of Castaways'. This model, which rejects the ideal of a just society \u2014 the better society advocated by Popper \u2014 is supposed to originate from the spontaneous forces of the castaways of development. Our view is that the ex istence and increasing growth of the informal sector is simply the economic manifestation of exclusion, revealing the inadequacy of the view that modern isation is an uninterrupted and in some way inevitable process. Exclusion might only be a cost which has to be paid in the short term, but it must teach us to perceive development processes in a new way, and to pay more attention to the complexity and multiplicity of forms which develop ment processes can assume. We must be ready to take advantage of those elements which prove to be particularly useful in different contexts. We also need to assess how states and international organisations can play a role in providing concrete support for those trends which, like the high-profile informal sector, can stimulate development and help it to spread, H \"t the Courier n\u00b0 151 * may-june 1995 ",
        "Can aid p r o m o te g o od gl g o v e r n m e n t? by Mick Moore and Mark Robinson* The promotion of 'good govern ment' has become an explicit ob jective of most aid donors. This has raised suspicions in developing countries, particularly when the threat of withholding aid has been used to force multi-party elections. But experience is showing that the good government agenda is less threatening than it first appeared, and provides opportunities for improving the quality of aid. Good govern ment principles are here to stay and \u2014 if applied consistently, openly and intellig ently \u2014 can bring benefits for both re cipients and donors. What is meant by 'good government'? The term 'good government' entered the aid vocabulary in the early 1990s. Definitions of what it means vary. For most donors, the main ingredients are democracy (particularly multi-party de mocracy), respect for human rights and the rule of law, and efficiency, accountability and transparency in government and public administration. For some, good government also embraces popular par ticipation, equity and poverty concerns and a commitment to market-oriented economic policies. Disagreement among donors on the content of the good government agenda means they have pursued distinct, sometimes contradictory policies, and have failed to give clear signals to recipients about what they are trying to achieve. This has confused the picture and diluted the impart of good government initiatives. * The authors are fellows of the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) at the University of Sussex. Brighton, UK.

Nigerian civil rights lawyer arguing in favour of tying aid to human rights. What's new \u2014 and why now? There is nothing new in many of the aims of good government policies, or in the approaches used to pursue them. What is new is that donors are putting more emphasis on using aid to promote good government, and are devoting more resources to it. There are several reasons for this. In the first instance, the end of the Cold War and the collapse of Commun ism undermined the case for giving aid to repressive and undemocratic governments simply because they were anti-Communist. Democracy could be promoted as an objective in its own right. There was also a growing belief that 'bad government' had been undermining development. Corrup tion, poor control of public funds, lack of accountability, human rights abuses and excessive military expenditure, have all been blamed for holding back develop ment, particularly in Africa. Finally, there is the conviction among donors that aid will be more acceptable to taxpayers if it is seen to promote democracy and human rights. The end of the Cold War was the trigger that allowed these concerns to be packaged together under the single 'good government' heading. The punitive approach Aid donors are implementing good government policies through a range of measures. These can be broadly divided into two sets: positive (the carrot) and punitive (the stick). With the punitive approach, aid is made conditional on the recipient government adhering to political conditions set by the donors. Failure to do so can result in aid being reduced, sus pended, and in extreme circumstances, terminated. The key objective is to prom ote political reform, usually in the form of multi-party democracy, together with progress on human rights. In practice, the punitive approach has been used sparingly, and often only as the last resort when conventional diplo matic pressures have failed. Where it has been applied, it has not always had the desired effect. In 1992, donors publicly presented the Kenyan government with a virtual ultimatum \u2014 hold free, multi-party elections or aid will be severely cut. This caused a stir, partly because Kenya had previously been seen as a close ally of Western donors. Donors achieved their objective in the sense that multi-party elections were held, in December 1992. However, the outcome was that the existing government was able to take advantage of its influence over the elec toral process to split the opposition, and gain re-election on the basis of a small share of the votes polled. Ethnic tensions were heavily exploited in campaigning, leaving Kenyan society in a weakened state, and undermining its development prospects. the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may-june 1995 r ",
        "d e v e l o p i ng w o r ld Punitive measures have also been taken against Haiti, Malawi, Somalia, Sudan and Zaire, but again with mixed results. All this has convinced some donors to downplay the punitive approach. Canada, for example, has abandoned it as a mechanism for furthering good govern ment. France has diluted its commitment to democracy promotion as a key policy objective. And in May 1994, the Clinton administration reversed its policy of linking preferential trade benefits to China to an improvement in human rights. However, the United States has not discarded the punitive approach completely, and in some cases has been willing to back aid sanctions with military force to restore democracy \u2014 Haiti being the most recent example. Most donors will no doubt con tinue to use aid as a bargaining counter to affect the composition and behaviour of governments. The difference is that now they are doing this quietly rather than overtly. The positive approach Donors also employ a wide array of positive aid measures \u2014 mostly involv ing institution-building \u2014 to encourage good government. They fall into two main categories. The first of these is public sector reforms, advocated by the World Bank in particular. These include promoting better management of the public sector, en couraging civil service reforms, pushing for greater accountability and transparency in government, strengthening the legal system and training the police. The second category is political reforms. This covers such areas as training journalists, promoting a free press, sup porting human rights groups and other civic and non-governmental organisations, providing election monitoring, encourag ing constitutional reform and assisting new political parties. The positive approach has been less controversial than the punitive and has, on the whole, been more successful. But it is not without its problems. Insti tution-building projects tend to be small- scale and long-term. They require patience and flexibility on the part of donors, and are difficult to manage and appraise. Donors have found it hard to spend money in this area. Providing too much money to organisations, too quickly, runs the risk of undermining their effectiveness and legi timacy. Is national sovereignty threatened ? Good government policies are intended to be a threat to Third World governments who abuse human rights, or are corrupt and undemocratic. Using aid to counter these tendencies may threaten Do donors practise what they preach ? Aid agencies have been justly criticised for failing to apply good government principles to their own operations. For example : \u2014 failing to consult properly with recipients ; \u2014 being less than 'transparent' in their own dealings with recipients ; \u2014 advocating good government on the one hand, while at the same time funding dubious aid projects, such as dam schemes that leave thousands displaced without proper compens ation. The World Bank, which pioneered the notion of connecting aid with good government, very quickly found the tables being turned against it. The fart that it has recently opened its operations to greater public scrutiny is due in part to creative use of good government arguments by its critics. governments, but can help those who suffer under them \u2014 donors argue. However, even those who favour de mocracy and respect for human rights are wary of donor intentions. Donors are promoting a particular type of govern ment \u2014 multi-party democracy. What right have they to interfere in the internal politics of countries by prescribing this form of government? If positive rather than punitive measures become the norm in future, then recipients may feel less threatened. But critics remain suspicious that donors are using good government arguments as a convenient excuse to cut aid budgets. One of the clear benefits of good government pressures is that they are helping to shift the debate within Third World countries. People are hearing terms such as accountability, transparency and anti-corruption, and are beginning to use them themselves to raise questions. Are government organisations doing their job? Do we get value from large, para- statal foodgrain corporations that fail to provide cheap and reliable food supplies and run enormous deficits? Why is the press not able to investigate allegations of high level corruption? People feel more confident about raising these kinds of questions when their governments are also under international pressure to take these issues seriously. Contradictions At present, the good govern ment agenda is full of contradictions. Apart from donors defining it in different ways, there are glaring inconsistencies in the way it is applied. The following are among some of the most obvious : \u2014 the fart that donors continue to provide substantial aid and trading privileges to some powerful and influential countries such as China and Indonesia, despite clear evidence of human rights abuses. \u2014 The fart that some of the donor nations most active in promoting good govern ment have themselves been among the largest suppliers of military equipment to the Third World. Recent reductions in sales to some parts of the Third World are not due to any change in policy. They are because Western suppliers are being priced out by tight budgets and competition from other low-cost suppliers, like China. \u2014 inconsistent responses to events, such as when General Sani Abacha seized power from a caretaker government in Nigeria in late 1993, reversing the country's planned return to democracy. He was condemned by (among others) the British Government. But Britain continued to supply arms to Nigeria.

        "d e v e l o p i ng w o r ld 'S \u2022vsNa I A historical snapshot of a military parade in Zaire. ',4n open attack on military spending has yet to become a recognised dimension of the good government agenda' realities. They may be inevitable, but they do not strengthen Third World confidence that good government policies are being applied consistently or fairly. Other problems stem from con\u00ad flicts between different elements in the good government agenda. In July 1994, for example, the elected government of Gambia was forced out of office. Coup leaders alleged that the previous govern\u00ad ment, which had held power for 29 years, was corrupt. The dilemma for donors was which was more important: supporting democracy, or rooting out corruption ? In cases such as these, donors are forced to make difficult choices. The USA announced it would cut off aid. Britain opted for a middle course, saying that existing aid commitments would be honoured but that no new ones would be made. And what if recipient govern\u00ad ments change their policies and satisfy good government criteria? The German government has recently increased aid to countries that have complied with good government criteria, and cut funding for others. But most donors have stopped short of making hard and fast commit\u00ad ments. The way forward The good government agenda has moved on since it was first put forward. The positive approach has gained ground. and use of aid as an explicit and public means of forcing political change is being downplayed. It has proved to be a crude and unreliable tool. Instead, donors are resorting to the more traditional approach of applying pressure behind the scenes. In early 1994, action of this kind led to the sacking from an African government of three Ministers against whom donors had collected direct evidence of large\u00adscale corruption. This more covert approach has the advantage of being more flexible, and more likely to be effective \u2014\u25a0 although it can be criticised for not being transparent, and therefore breaking one of the basic rules of good government. Looking ahead, the good government agenda is clearly here to stay. Aid donors have become attached to the principle, and have in many cases re\u00ad organised themselves so they have an office or division dealing explicitly with these issues. The 'good government' label may be too broad and diffuse, and may eventually fall out of use. But the principles behind it \u2014 that giving and receiving aid are political processes, and that political issues should be taken into account \u2014 are likely to be embedded in aid programmes for the foreseeable future. There are a number of lessons to be learned, however, if the potential benefits of good government policies are to be reaped. For recipient countries, the good government agenda has turned out to be less threatening than it originally appeared. It is better f or countries to grasp the agenda and turn it to their advantage, than fight it. Demonstrating progress in improving government performance and addressing human rights issues should also provide useful leverage in negotiating better aid packages \u2014 although there are no guarantees. Recipient countries should, in addition, be putting pressure on donors to consult more, stop 'moving the goal\u00ad posts', and practise what they preach. For donor countries, greater cla\u00ad rity and consistency are crucial if good government policies are to work. Donors should coordinate their actions and seek to develop a more coherent approach. Addi\u00ad tionally, the good government agenda needs to be broadened to embrace the economic dimension of human rights.

Established in 1966, it is situated on the campus of the University of Sussex, near Brigh\u00ad ton, UK. The good government agenda is just one of the subjects that IDS research focuses on. Other key areas include investment and enterprise, human development, gender, food security, poverty, and the environment. The Institute's teaching programme has two parts. Its post\u00adgraduate degree courses attract students from all over the world. It also offers a range of short courses designed for senior administrators and develop\u00ad ment practitioners. Several of these are run in collaboration with partner institutions in the Third World. Also based at IDS is the British Library for Development Studies. This has one of the most extensive collections of material on Third World develop\u00ad ment.

A third point is that an open attack on military spending has yet to become a recognised dimension of the good government agenda. Until it does, this glaring incon\u00ad sistency will undermine the moral argu\u00ad ment behind good government policies. Finally, if donors are serious about at\u00ad tacking Third World corruption, they should start by following the United States' lead and make the payment of overseas bribes by their citizens a criminal offence.

        "W i n d \u00ad up r a d io The idea is a simple one, but as always, someone had to think of it first. Trevor Bayliss, a British re\u00ad searcher, can claim the credit in this case. While watching a BBC docum\u00ad entary on the AIDS epidemic In Africa, Mr Bayliss realised that one of the main obstacles to the dis\u00ad semination of information in Third World countries was the high cost of batteries and the fact that they were not readily available. A market study carried out by 'BBC International Broadcast and Audi\u00ad ence Research' (IBAR) showed that there are currently over 100 million working radios in Africa. In fact, the radio is the main mass medium of communi\u00ad cation throughout the continent. However, a number of users are unable to listen to the radio for longer than a few minutes a day because of the high price and scarcity of batteries. The solution to this problem is therefore to develop a radio which does not need batteries. An inventor and a businessman Trevor Bayliss's invention works a little bit like old\u00adfashioned watches which have to be wound up at regular intervals. A handle situated on the back of the radio is turned for a minute in order to tighten a spring inside the set. As it is released, this spring supplies energy to a generator which enables the radio to operate for almost an hour. Then, all one has to do is wind up the radio again to prepare it for another 60 minutes. The generator has a life of 7000 listening hours, i.e. three to five years of normal use. It is easy to replace, has a good sound quality and can be used to receive FM, AM and short waves. Another advantage of the wind\u00adup radio is that it only costs $25. And of course, as it does not use batteries, Mr Bayliss's radio is environmentally friendly. Rony Stear, a South African busin\u00ad essman, took over where the inventor left off and ensured that the project was a success from a financial viewpoint. Mr Stear very quickly realised the potential and importance of this radio for the dissemination of information in developing countries. Having met Trevor Bayliss, he contacted the British Overseas Develop\u00ad ment Administration which provided the money needed for technical development of the Bayliss generator. The next stage was to find the funds which would enable radio sets to be produced. It was here that Kagiso Trust Investments (KTI) and the Liberty Life Foundation entered the story. KTI is the leading non\u00adgovernmental or\u00ad ganisation in South Africa. It mainly occupies itself with providing development aid and Archbishop Desmond Tutu is one of its members. The Liberty Life Found\u00ad ation also devotes itself to social develop\u00ad ment and is part of the Liberty Life Association of Africa, South Africa's lead\u00ad ing insurance company. The funds ob\u00ad tained by these two groups made it possible to set up the BayGen Power Company 1 and an assembly plant in a Cape Town suburb. The radio sets will be produced by about 150 workers, most of whom are handicapped. South Africa's six main organisations for the handicapped have also invested in the company set up by Rory Stear. If everything goes according to plan, the first radio sets should leave the works during June. Almost 60 000 have already been ordered by the British Crown Agents agency for dispatch to Rwanda. All the advantages without the disadvantages The wind\u00adup radio project is interesting and promising for many rea\u00ad sons. In South Africa, it will create jobs for the disadvantaged and some of the profits made will be used to finance social projects under the auspices of the organisations backing the BayGen Power Company. In Third World countries, the wind\u00adup radio will increase access to all kinds of inform\u00ad ation, such as AIDS prevention campaigns, weather reports or adult education pro\u00ad grammes. A study made by the John Hopkins University in Washington has shown that the radio is now the most effective way of disseminating information among the inhabitants of developing countries. It has a crucial part to play and important needs to satisfy. Uganda's Ministry of Information estimates that almost three million wind\u00adup radios will be required in that country alone. \u00c6^L\u00b7 IM \" \u00ab* \"\u25a0**\u00b7 ^BP^^^J m f J 1 ^^ \u25a0\u00bfL\u00b7 ^^HM \u00c6 Its affordable price makes this radio particulary suitable for NGOs.

But once the screen grows dark, there is the question of access to the inner vision which governs each visible universe. Only language and symbolic translations can control this access... \u00abthe eye listens\u00bb' R\u00e9gis Debray (French essayist) The 14th Pan\u00adAfrican Film and Television Festival was held in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) from 25 February to 4 March 1995. This event was devoted to 'Cinema and history' and was welcomed as a celebration both of 100 years of cinema and 25 years of Fespaco. There was a record attendance: 66 countries were represented, there were 228 foreign journalists, 187 directors, 174 producers, purchasers, distributors and operators, 65 actors and actresses and 130 films. The panel of judges for the feature\u00adfilm competition was chaired by Ousmane Sembene, a Senegalese novelist and film\u00admaker, born in 1923, a pioneer of African cinema who, in 1966, was the originator of the first African feature film, 'la Noire de...'. Competition was between 20 feature films, 23 shorts and documentaries, six feature films submitted from the African 'diaspora' and eight 'diaspora' shorts. There were also a number of other films and TV productions, eight of which concerned South Africa. Taki ng place on the f ringes of the actual festival was the Vllth MICA (Inter\u00ad national African Television and Film Fair), marking ten years of experience. At the last MICA in 1993, 317 products (film and video) were presented and there were 879 sessions with two thirds of the productions actually screened. Two colloquia also took place on the fringe, one relating to the centenary of the cinema and the other concerning 'the outlook and voice of women on the African continent'. The African Film Centre was also inaugurated. In addition, the 14th Fespaco was marked by the notable entry of South Africa onto the stage. Perhaps more than usual, Fes\u00ad paco was both a professional and popular event. Its popular appeal was dem\u00ad onstrated at the opening and closing ceremonies, attended by more than 50 000 people and by the audience sizes in the cinemas. These included open\u00adair venues, most notably, the giant screen set up in the Place de la R\u00e9volution to accommodate more than 5000 film\u00adgoers. We should not forget either the animated crowds that thronged Ouagadougou's streets for over a week. During that period, the city was vibrant with the rhythm of African films. All the cinemas were in use \u2014 taken almost by storm by the many film en\u00ad thusiasts who were pleased to have such a wide choice. Most of the cinemas offered three 'sittings' (18.30, 20.30 and 22.30) and some of the indoor ones were even showing films in the morning. The oppor\u00ad tunity offered by Fespaco saw the revitalis\u00ad ation of a number of districts on the outskirts where there are popular cinemas. Throughout the event, the same themes kept cropping up : \u2014 the possibility of breaking free from traditional story\u00adtelling and the 'folklore' genre, \u2014 the desire to record the values of a threatened way of life, \u2014 artistic demands, \u2014 the desire to entertain an audience unfamiliar with quality cinema, \u2014 aspirations of reaching the inter\u00ad national market, \u2014 making films in local languages. Even more striking was the pre\u00ad occupation with the distribution and screening of films. In Burkina Faso, most cinemas are part of a state structure and 15% of the ticket price is ploughed back into production. Moreover, any film of African origin has been exempt from tax since 1993. Unfortunately, this is a very rare \u2014 and perhaps even a unique \u2014 situation in Africa. A weekly publication in Burkina Faso (Journal du Jeudi) wrote : 'We can no longer revel throughout the festival in the exceptional quality of our film\u00admaking. We now have to break even, and this is the sole requirement for cinema in the future'. From this standpoint, Africa, just like the United States or Europe, also has to contend with competition from foreign television, foreign video and foreign satel\u00ad lite channels. But why are African films not profitable ? The main reason lies in the fact that they suffer from a poor distribution system. But the idea that the African public does not like its own cinema is clearly one that is no longer sustainable. To quote only the example of Burkina Faso (a specific case, admittedly) many film enthusiasts in Ouagadougou go to the cinema every evening and sometimes they see two or three performances. There are 15 cinemas in the capital and many more in the regions. The average price of a seat is CFAF 200. Could it be that the audiences in Burkina enjoy films as much as ever but that African films are too scarce to fill the cinemas on a regular basis?

        "c u l t u re a nd s o c i e ty Africa and the centenary of the cinema Speaking about the ethnographic and documentary films shown during Fespaco, the Chairman of the panel of judges, the legalese film\u00admaker Ousmane Sembene, dedared : *We will be seeing films which have been made in Africa, films for which Africa has been the backdrop, with blacks appearing as extras, like shadows'. It is true to say that prior to 1950, Africa was exduded from dnematographic production. Then the first pioneers appeared on the scene \u00ad people like Albert Mongita in the Congo, Mamadou Toure in Guinea and Paulin Soumanou Vieyra in Senegal. Before then, the African continent had been little more than a film set for European film\u00admakers. At the time when African countries were gaining their independence, African cinema was to come into being against a pre\u00adexisting dnematographic background where films were not made by African directors, distribution and snowing of films was controlled by the former colonial powers and a pre\u00addetermined cinematographic culture was conferred on audiences. On the occasion of the centenary of the dnema, the Pan\u00adAfrican film\u00admakers' federation published a work* bringing together many varied contributions, which we summarise below. At the outset, Gaston Kabore asserts : 'If Africa does not acquire a genuine capability to forge its own viewpoint, so as to come to terms with its own image, it will lose sight of its point of view and its awareness'. Two principal subjects deserve mention : the functions of cinema and the perennial problem of distribution. Should dnema be militant (at the risk of being conformist), is it useful in social terms or is it a free art? Naturally, opinion varies on this subject : For Cl\u00e9ment Tapsoba : '...black and particularly African cinema cannot be perceived simply as an interpretation of beauty. A work of art's interpretation of beauty is, in my opinion, a matter for dogmatic criticism, which is commonplace in the West'. Similarly, there may be a risk of African directors losing their air of authenticity and their originality because they have to respond to external market demand. ..On the other hand, Idrissa Ouedraogq has a totally opposite viewpoint : 'Africa has for too long regarded films in terms of their cultural or educational aspects, and has neglected production requirements... African directors have in mind more a declaration of claims than simply film\u00admaking. For me, Yeelen, Bal Poussi\u00e8re and Ti\u00adlaii are proof that a major obstacle has been overcome... Samba Traor\u00e9 is an act of rebellion against the ghetto into which everyone else is trying to push us. I want my films to be seen in Africa and elsewhere in the world, and my ambition is that audiences choose to see them because they are films and not because they are 'African' films... Cinema is above all technique and, today, this technique is universal. Sensitivity and creativity have neither colour nor race'. As for distribution, Tahar Cheriaa points out that 'whoever controls distribution controls the dnema'. However, there are others who comment that, today, a film depends more on its TV or video distribution rights than on cinema ticket sales. This situation also applies to Africa, with the additional handicap that the continent as a whole depends principally on the West both in terms of equipment and programmes. This leads us to the idea of launching a MEDIA programme aimed at creating a single market for film and television, encouraging all aspects of this particular sector, namely finance, production, distribution and training.

Orokia is veny keen on Malian films, but says 'I would like to know why Africans don't make as many films as white film\u00admakers. It's such a pity because I'm fed up with karate films and all the others, although I do like going to the cinema'. Sophie states, apropos of a Tu\u00ad nisian film, that she quite likes African films which are not based on fiction and that she identifies with the actors because the subjects dealt with are closer to real life. She does not go to the cinema on a regular basis and feels Fespaco offers her the opportunity to forget her 'weariness at the end of a long day'. The results of this survey can be summarised as follows : Firstly, Fespaco is a real festival, not only in terms of its films but also for the atmosphere it generates. Secondly, the majority of film enthusiasts are quite keen on African films but deplore the fart that they are unable to see them in the two years between festivals. On the contrary, they are 'compelled to acquire a taste for the American, karate and Indian films which are regularly shown'. wm Dominique David the cinemas, that was arranged by The Courier.

        "An interview with the Malian director, Sheik Oumar Sissoko ' G u i m b a ': d e n o u n c i ng t he A f r i ca of t he t y r a n ts Lying somewhere between tradi\u00ad tional and modern, the film 'Guim\u00ad ba' by the Malian director Sheik Oumar Sissoko, received 'L'\u00e9talon du Yennenga', the grand prix of the fourteenth Panafrican Film Fes\u00ad tival (Fespaco), in Ouagadougou. It is the successor to 'Au nom du Christ' by Roger Gnan M'Bala, from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, which won the award in 1993. The winner also received the European Union award, the prize for best costume and scenery as well as a number of other special awards. 'Guimba' is a parable on de\u00ad mocracy and it denounces the Africa of the tyrants. King Sitakilli reigns in Mandingo 1 territory as a tyrant over his people in the company of his dwarf son who is as fond of women as is his father. The tyrant's oppon\u00ad ents intend to exploit this weakness to bring about his downfall. This is the third time that Mali has received the highest Fespaco award, making it the country to have received the greatest number of prizes in the history of the Festival. The Courier had the opportunity to interview Sheik Oumar Sissoko during the proceedings in Ouagadougou. We began by asking him whether 'Guimba'is a genuinely African film. \u2014 I have been wanting to make an African film with Africans since 1980 and that is why I set up an association which then became an Economic Interest Grouping called Kora Films. Its aim is to make co\u00adproductions with other African countries and it was Kora Films, supported by Idrissa Ouedraogo (a director from Burkina Faso) which made 'Guimba'. Post\u00ad production on my second film was in 1 The Mandingo Kingdom covered all or part of the current territory of Mali, Guinea and Senegal. Burkina Faso and pre\u00adediting on 'Guimba' was also in Burkina Faso. Apart from final editing in Paris, my film was produced, directed and edited by Africans. \u25a0 For a film which many are comparing to Bertolucci's 'The Last Emperor', don't you think that your budget is exceptionally low? \u2014 My film's budget is approxi\u00ad mately FF 6 million and this level of financing was made possible by using local equipment and technicians who were paid at a preferential rate. Funds came from the EIG Kora Films (Mali), the French Ministry of Cooperation, the National Cinematog\u00ad raphic Centre (France), the Cultural and Technical Cooperation Agency (French\u00ad speaking communities), the CBPC (Mali) and DIPOCI (Burkina Faso). \u25a0 Filming took place at Dj\u00e9n\u00e9, a tradi\u00ad tional Malian town. I overheard a young Malian spectator say that he no longer recognised his own town. What do you say to that? \u2014 All I did was to touch up a few buildings here and there for the modest sum of FF 15 000. All the work was done by local people. 'Death before dishonour!' \u25a0 There are several themes in 'Guimba', including the denunciation of arbitrary power, but also certain concepts based in Mandingo culture: the relationship of humour and its logical succession, i.e. the tyrant's suicide ! You yourself are a Malian, so surely people are going to think of recent events in your country ? \u2014 That's how things are : 'Death before dishonour!'. This is a trait in Mandingo culture : tolerance is not venge\u00ad ance. It was our cultural heritage which was trampled underfoot by tyrannical governments. Contrary to what you might think, this is about the virtues of our cultures, the birth of initiatives and par\u00ad ticipation. There can be no modern de\u00ad mocracy without traditional democracy; there has to be tolerance and respect, and the 'relationship of humour' is the best example of this. Even when the relation\u00ad ship happens to be a distant one, certain links mean that murder is out of the question but that acting in collusion can lead to the saying I mentioned earlier 'Death before dishonour!'. Hence the noose placed around the neck of the tyrant and his descendants ! \u25a0 What are your feelings about the way the film was received by African audien\u00ad ces? \u2014 It would be wrong these days to say that Africans are unaware of African films. In the last five years, Africans have both witnessed and been players in the rejection of tyrannical governments, so my film will not pass them by since it is a kind of testimony to this rejection. African audiences are extremely tolerant, re\u00ad spectful and they stand together. They are also acquiring a taste for the lowering of taboos ! \u25a0 How does 'Guimba' fit in with your other films ? \u2014 I initially studied mathematics. I was a committed African student, always wondering how I could express myself, and it was not long before I found that film had to be my means of expression, in the language of my country. I continued my studies in history and sociology and then I did a course at the Louis Lumi\u00e8re National Cinematographic College. I started out by making topical films. In 1982, my first film dealt with the problem of education in Mali and in 1983 I looked into rural libraries and the effects of drought in rural areas. I made 'Nyamanton' (The lesson in filth), in 1986, and this was the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1995 r ",

According to the award winner, Omar Sissoko : 'It can no longer be said that Africans are unaware of African films' my first feature\u00adlength film, about child labour. After that, I made 'Finzan' which was dedicated to the condition of women oppressed by tradition and society. I have also made several documentaries. \u25a0 What do you expect from critics both in the West and in Africa ? \u2014 What I would like above all is for them to take a fresh look at culture which is closer to self\u00adsufficiency in food than might be thought. Everyone knows that culture is, first and foremost, food for the spirit and only this approach will make it possible to understand development problems before trying to solve them ! 'Petty nationalism is harmful' Cultural activities also have an economic function since culture is an industry which creates jobs. As far as cinema in Africa is concerned, there are sufficient regional structures (Burkina Faso, Mali, Tunisia, Algeria, Zimbabwe) but, unfortunately, there is petty nationalism which is harmful. In addition, culture must not be confused with the advancing tide of communication because communication always sweeps away culture. \u25a0 The perennial problem of cinema in Africa is one of distribution. How do you see this affecting 'Guimba'? \u2014 The problem of distribution is all the more complicated because even TV stations have insufficient funds and we know that subsidies cannot go on for ever. In the case of 'Guimba', Kora Films will be organising distribution and release in Africa and Europe. We expert the film to be dubbed into English so we can reach the US market, and we also intend to be at the Cannes Festival. However, the main ob\u00ad stacle is still distribution of the film in Africa. African directors must become more involved in releasing films. The real problem is that we do not have any credible distributors in Africa. At the moment, to set up an effective distribution structure in Africa necessarily implies further State subsidies. Despite this, there is a need for it to be managed in\u00ad dependently. \u25a0 Do you believe that there is such a thing as 'African' cinema ? \u2014 To make a film specifically 'African' is, to a certain extent, to mar\u00ad ginalise it. Cinema is a universal art characterised by a script, and the cinema in Africa is diverse and multi\u00adfaceted. We must not let it be side\u00adlined. Fespaco is attempting to bring in stricter rules regard\u00ad ing the selection of films, but there is still a kind of African ghetto. Nevertheless, I still think that the 'Fespaco label' is important for a film coming out of Africa. As for the Europeans, they would do better to help us finance the distribution of our films in Europe rather than organising myriad festivals.

        "Radio as a d e v e l o p m e nt t o ol A project undertaken by Echos Communication, an association which has chosen to deal with development through communi\u00ad cation, could very briefly be sum\u00ad marised thus : three years of work ; five continents covered; twelve hours of broadcasts and twelve subjects. All this was aimed at offering another view of develop\u00ad ment and to enable the South to take the floor. In co\u00adproduction with CRPLF (the Association of French\u00adLang\u00ad uage Public Radio Stations) and with the aid of five journalists, Fran\u00e7ois Milis, executive secretary of Echos Communi\u00ad cation, and Jean\u00adPol Hecq, a journalist and producer at RTBF, produced a series of radio reports 1 in countries as diverse as Burkina Faso, Bolivia, Bangladesh and Switzerland. The topics they covered were also wide\u00adranging : savings and credit, women, resource management and trans\u00ad port. However, all these subjects were treated as integral parts of one and the same problem, namely development. The series of broadcasts entitled 'Democracy, environment and develop\u00ad ment : the intercultural dialogue for sa\u00ad feguarding the planet' was aimed princip\u00ad ally at making audiences in French\u00adspeak\u00ad ing countries in the North and South aware of the interdependence between the self\u00ad determination of peoples and preservation of the global environment. These popu\u00ad lations are still too often perceived as recipients of aid and as 'incompetents' who know no other language than that of grievances. Echos Communication wanted to give them the floor to express what Fran\u00e7ois Milis calls their 'citizenship' : 'There is a great desire to participate which is felt by a whole range of players. We wanted to show how these people are taking charge of their environment and their development'. Participation is un\u00ad 1 This project is financed by the AGCD, the DDA and DG VIII. deniably the key word in the various broadcasts: participation with a cultural foundation ; the preservation of culture in order to achieve improved development : 'too many structures have a vertical approach. If a project is based solely on the technical understanding of things, there is every chance of it not succeeding, because cultures and concepts are different. Pro\u00ad jects must therefore incorporate a global view of culture'. Interdependence Each broadcast demonstrates this need for a cultural approach to develop\u00ad ment, but such approaches and ex\u00ad perience, however specific and different they may be, cannot be isolated from one another. In fart, everyone, today, recogn\u00ad ises the interdependence linking all the driving forces of development, in the South and in the North. 'Democracy, Environ\u00ad ment and Development therefore wishes to identify certain characteristics which are similar in the North and in the South'. This is why each topic studied, without claiming to be exhaustive, mixes accounts from both hemispheres. 'The approach will be multi\u00adfaceted: the North/South twinning of subject\u00admatter will reflect debate'. By way of example, the broad\u00ad cast devoted to health is very revealing. It is divided into four parts, each peppered with musical passages. The first part deals with efforts made by a Bolivian association to draw up a suitable policy which takes into account the causes rather than the symptoms of the health problems of the majority Indian population. The second is devoted to possible responses to the question of dealing with problems of access to medicine encountered in Senegal by those living in the bush. Such difficulties are heightened by the reduction in buying power since the devaluation of the CFA franc last year. Next, it is the turn of Bangladesh: a field hospital has been working for over 20 years to train medical auxiliaries and surgeons recruited from a rural community whose members are for the most part illiterate. Very encouraging results have been achieved. Finally, they hand over to the Quebec government Health Minister who gives his opinion on public health worldwide. When listening to these four accounts which come from four very different parts of the world, certain converging aspects very rapidly come to the fore, despite often original solutions : promotion of a national health policy which takes the people's primary needs into account, the need for a global approach which incorporates other ele\u00ad ments, such as education or access to drinking water, the problems of dealing with what is at stake in terms of trade, etc. These are all aspects which bear witness to this multi\u00adfaceted approach and the need for a global approach to problems linked to development. This division is important, ex\u00ad plains Fran\u00e7ois Milis, because it permits two levels of appreciation : ' There is an experi\u00ad mental level, that is to say a more concrete level, which is the result of people's perception of the problems they en\u00ad counter; but there is also a more synthetic level made possible by a more global view of the same problems by those in charge of projects, by researchers or experts'. The same applies to the other 11 topics studied. Of course, some are addressed in a more intellectual or conceptual manner, there are those which are composed only of factual accounts and still others which are dealt with much more critically. Communicating these innov\u00ad ations and local knowledge via radio enables them to be appreciated, and accessible to a greater number of people and communities. This is why, in addition to programming on the French, Belgian, Swiss and Canadian public airwaves, Echos Communication now envisages broadcast\u00ad ing on national and local radio in the South 2 . \u25a0 TG. 2 The first broadcast will be on Sunday 11 June at 1315 on RTBF Channel 1.

        "I n f o r m a t i o n: f o od f or t h o u g ht by Sarah Reynolds Agriculture feeds nations, but unless agriculture is nourished by information agricultural produc tion is likely to remain inadequate. This is the case throughout the world, but it is particularly true in Africa. As with food, the quality and availability of information is not equitably shared among nations. Consumers in the deve loped world have access to almost all the information they could possibly want, all highly processed for quick and easy digestion. Con sumers in developing countries often have to go without sufficient information, or are presented with a poor quality product that they find impossible to assimilate or digest. How can agricultural information systems better serve the appetite for knowledge of those who are at present information- undernourished ? While much is being done to facilitate the flow of information from north to south, the Fourth Lom\u00e9 Conven tion, like its predecessor, lays emphasis on the need to encourage the development by ACP countries of their own capacities for the production, acquisition, processing and dissemination of information for agricultural and rural development. CTA has held a series of four regional work- CTA Technical centre for Agriculture and Rural cooperation (CFA), \"De Rietkampen\", Galvanistraat 9, 6716 AE Ede Postal address P.O.B. 380, 6700 AJ Wageningen, The Netherlands Tel. (0) 8380 60400 - Telex 30169 shops in Africa to give representatives from the region the opportunity to discuss how such information services could best be developed. The fourth workshop, for Southern Africa, was held in Windhoek on 14-18 November 1994 and was attended by participants from nine countries within the region and by representatives of regional and international organisations. The workshop was sponsored by the CTA and organised jointly by the CTA, the\" Southern Africa Centre for Cooperation in Agricultural Research (SACCAR) and the Ministry of Agriculture of Namibia, the host country. CTA intended that the workshop should give participating coun tries the opportunity to consider a regional approach to handling technical inform ation on agriculture, by pooling existing resources and developing common services on a regional basis. Such a policy makes more efficient use of limited resources within the countries concerned and this, in the longer term, will lead to the self- sufficiency that the Lom\u00e9 Convention seeks to stimulate. In the shorter term, r\u00e9 gionalisation is attractive to potential donors whose own sources of funding are also limited. Effective regional cooperation in agricultural information systems is likely to depend on the strength of national insti tutions. Libraries and documentation cen tres are too often in competition for Christopher Lungu of SACCAR presents newsletter to the Namibian Minister of Agriculture, Nangolo Mbumba at the Windhoek workshop \"i the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u00b7 may-june 1995 recognition and resources and, although library staff are often cooperating with each other on an informal basis, there may be little or no cooperation at an official level. Furthermore, information services are often undervalued by policy-makers who fail to appreciate that information is an essential tool of development without which their policies cannot be effectively implemented. So in what ways can agricul ture information services be better man aged and upon whom does the respons ibility lie for achieving that improvement ? Although there is obviously a degree of overlap, there are three principal categories of people who have some power to implement change : the policy makers themselves, users of information services including researchers and ex- tensionists, and the information specialists who staff the libraries and documentation centres. Some countries have yet to for mulate an agricultural information policy and in others, the policy is weak and ineffective. Proper recognition of the relationship between agricultural inform ation and agricultural development is an area of responsibility that can only be undertaken by policy-makers who have to find, or allocate, resources to fund the service. This means not only adequate buildings and equipment but also a well- trained and adequately paid staff who can look forward to opportunities for advance ment within their chosen career. A point which is often overlooked by those re sponsible for funding documentation cen tres, perhaps because they do not use the sen/ice themselves, is that the staff are there to serve the needs of, among others, highly trained scientists. To be able to do their job properly, documentalista must be able to understand the needs of such users and if they cannot do so the results may, indirectly, be very costly. Agricultural information may not appear to be as valuable as agricultural research, but research which has not been based on an accurate assessment of current needs, and a review of other such work being under taken, is likely to be either inappropriate or a duplication of effort. And what are extensionists to extend if not accurate, reliable and up-to-date information ? ",
        "e t a \u00ad b u l l e t in In these days of increased en\u00ad vironmental awareness, agriculture, fish\u00ad eries and forestry information is inter\u00ad related and very much in demand, and yet few of the countries in the region have an effective national agricultural information network. Among the many causes are a lack of awareness of the need for network\u00ad ing, lack of communications media to keep the network alive (such as telephones, e\u00ad mail, newsletters, etc) and lack of money for transport, subsistence, training and equipment such as computers and photo\u00ad copiers to develop products in support of the network. Information \u2014 on time Just as policy makers have a responsibility to provide good information services, users of those services have a responsibility to insist upon it. No politician is going to be able to justify funding a service that no\u00adone demands. And users should draw upon and respect the talents of the library staff, a number of whom have been trained to degree standard and above. One of the most frequently voiced disappointments of library staff is that they are informed too late, or not at all, of forthcoming programmes. It can take weeks to obtain relevant literature from distant sources and it is frustrating for both librarian and user to have to wait when more forethought could have avoided the delay. If researchers, extensionists and other users take librarians into their confidence from the outset, more inform\u00ad ation, information of better quality and information from sources that might otherwise have remained unexplored, will be available to help when making deci\u00ad sions. Malawi has found an innovative solution to the frequent problem of marginalisation of the information/do\u00ad cumentation sector from the decision\u00ad making process. Research within the De\u00ad partment of Agriculture is organised into commodity and service groups. For ex\u00ad ample, there is a maize commodity group and a crop storage service group. Inform\u00ad ation is also a service group. At the project meetings when plans are drawn up, and constraints and results are discussed, the librarian is automatically included as leader of a service group. This can benefit in two ways : it markets the information service to the key players and it keeps the Inform\u00ad ation Service Group informed of upcoming programmes in time to have the inform\u00ad ation resources available to support the programme. Just as users of library services must respect the professional nature of I \u00a1brary staff, the staff must accord the same respect and courtesy to the users of their service. An attitude of indifference or superiority may discourage the shy, young researcher who needs all the help he can get at the start of his career but who may rise to a position of influence in later years. While it is true that many libraries and documentation centres are short of books, journals, computers and staff time, lib\u00ad rarians and documentalists can neverthe\u00ad less do much to influence those who have the power to improve the situation by making the best of what they have rather than sitting back and lamenting what they lack. Shortage of qualified staff is a recurring problem. In Mozambique, junior staff educated to Grade 6 or 7 are trained to undertake' specific tasks as one part of the whole job or process. Each learns a specific routine and then hands the work on to the next person for them to carry out the next stage of the process. Although there are initially many mistakes, these can be corrected and everyone learns how to do better. The encouragement that is given, and the resulting job satisfaction at all levels, boosts staff morale and attracts support for the library. So policy makers, users of docum\u00ad entation centres and the information specialists themselves all have some power to improve agricultural information ser\u00ad vices, but what specific services need to be addressed ? One of the problems that faces many libraries is the shortage of foreign exchange for the purchase of periodicals. A further cause for concern is the late appearance and high mortality rate of national and regional scientific journals. Although the 'Zimbabwe Journal of Agric\u00ad ultural Research' is designated as the SACCAR regional journal, there are many problems, not the least of which are the lack of paper and printing materials and a backlog of articles waiting to be printed. These are problems that affect not only those working in agricultural research but also those working in the extension services. Like their colleagues in research, they cannot afford to subscribe individually to international journals. They may also find it difficult to gain access to scientific literature coming into the country which is usually channelled to established libraries. Custodians of the future Extensionists face a further chal\u00ad lenge. There is a growing realisation that traditional risk reduction and survival strategies are being lost as young people ignore the wisdom of their elders, prefer\u00ad ring to leave the rural areas and head for the bright lights of town. They see no relevance to their lives of knowing what wild plants can be taken from the bush for food when rains fail and there are no crops. In the CFA franc zone of West Africa, western drugs have more than doubled in price since devaluation of the currency and, throughout Africa, foreign exchange for importing costly drugs is scarce. Know\u00ad ledge of the medicinal and healing pro\u00ad perties of indigenous plants must not be lost, because if the knowledge is lost so too are the plants, for no\u00adone will ensure their survival. The droughts in recent years have highlighted the danger of losing this knowledge and information specialists are being asked to work with extensionists and researchers to find ways of document\u00ad ing it for use by present and future generations. Information specialists are usually kept fully occupied in collecting, catalogu\u00ad ing and storing information. As electronic communication becomes more widely available, the amount of information within reach could well become over\u00ad whelming. Will information specialists be given the support they need from their managers, departments heads and, ulti\u00ad mately, the politicians? Information is valueless unless it is properly handled and used to support the knowledge system. It is knowledge that must be communicated. There is a big difference between 'I know' and 'I am informed that...'. Given the resources to do their job properly, inform\u00ad ation specialists are key players in the knowledge system. They are, after all, the custodians of our future. ^U S.R. the Courier n\u00b0 151 \u25a0 mayiune 1995 r ",
        "ISLAMS D'EUROPE\u00ad Int\u00e9gration ou insertion communautaire? (ISLAM IN EUROPE \u2014 Integ\u00ad ration or insertion into the com\u00ad munity?) Under the direction of Robert Bistolfi and Fran\u00e7ois Zabbal. Editions de l'Aube, La Tour d'Aigu\u00ebs, Collection Monde en cours, 1995, 383 pp. A significant proportion of the population of the European Union is of foreign origin. Recent immigration, during the last 30 or 40 years, has increased the Islamic component and Islam is often the second religion. In socio\u00adcultural terms, eight to 13 million people, perhaps more, are involved. Is there one type of Islam or many? There is no obvious un\u00ad iform concept of Islam, the range being very wide from traditional Islam exhibiting cultural entrench\u00ad ment varying over time and in space, to concepts confirmed by different politico\u00adreligious move\u00ad ments. In the face of this complex Islamic reality, two approaches clash from the outset : briefly, one aims to assimilate and the other to integrate but, today, the debate cannot be reduced to this simple choice of alternatives. The way in which Islam finds its niche will obviously have repercussions on the cultural and political future of the host countries as well as on overall cohesion of the European Community. By confir\u00ad ming its secular position, this form of Islam could develop a more egalitarian dialogue with Islam in the Arab\u00adIslamic world, and this element will also shape relations between Europe and the Mediterranean. Islams d'Europe studies the con\u00ad text of integration in a number of European countries (Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Italy and Greece). The specific nature of the experience of each country is examined, together with current questions. The aim was to add\u00ad ress shifting socio\u00adcultural and socio\u00adpolitical realities, to com\u00ad pare concurrent approaches and possible points of convergence. The authors invited sociologists, legal experts, political analysts, people in the field (from the community movement), analysts from politico\u00adreligious publi\u00ad cations, theologians, etc. to ex\u00ad amine the dynamics at work. There are many factors which, taken together, form the struc\u00ad ture which receives the new\u00ad comers. Some are legal, others are institutional or symbolic and are reflected in the different ap\u00ad proaches to immigration and alien status, the notion of natio\u00ad nality and citizenship (with the predominance, here, of right of residence and right of descen\u00ad dance), Church/State relation\u00ad ships, etc. Drawing on national history, the success of integration therefore depends on a move\u00ad ment towards, and the conditions of, acceptance. In this context, societies must examine themsel\u00ad ves and the background to the obligations they impose as the price for acceptance. Extreme 'models' have had to evolve. The French model par ex\u00ad cellence, that of assimilation, has had to be established in an ad\u00ad hoc manner with cultural diver\u00ad sity. Conversely, with the various models of integration, there has been alarm at the erosion of common values linked with a dogmatic respect for cultural dif\u00ad ferences. Yet, is there a 'European integ\u00ad ration model' ? This is still unclear from the convergence of concerns in Europe. Do the thoughts and sometimes the serf\u00adcritique deve\u00ad loped in this work nevertheless make it possible to define future prospects? One might think that this model ought simultaneously to take into account two require\u00ad ments \u2014 firstly and as a matter of priority it would monitor pre\u00ad servation and enrichment of the common 'basis' of individual values against all Community\u00adori\u00ad ented machinations. However, on the other hand, whilst still avoid\u00ad ing division into groups, it would include recognition of the collect\u00ad ive entrenchment of any current membership of a cultural group. If it has to exist, this European model must be confirmed in a context of conflict between these requirements. Given the evolution in progress, it appears that the French approach to integration is not the least well equipped to re\u00ad concile all sides.

This work is published under the direction of Pierre Maillet, Emer\u00ad itus Professor at the University of Lille I (France), Honorary Director General at the Commission of the European Communities, General Secretary of the Confederation of European Associations of Econ\u00ad omists, and by Dario Velo, lec\u00ad turer at the University of Pavia (Italy) and Chairman of the Centro Studi Sulle Comunit\u00e0 Europee. They have been assisted by a multinational editorial com\u00ad mittee consisting of eight people from the Member States. If one adds that the European Perspec\u00ad tives Collection, under the direc\u00ad tion of Pierre Maillet, is part of the European Community's Jean Monnet Action and that it is the result of joint work by the hol\u00ad ders of European 'Jean Monnet' economics chairs, it will be under\u00ad stood that this book is a serious work advocating consolidation of Europe's structure. The Maastricht Treaty undoub\u00ad tedly pointed the way but it is set in the context of the Treaty of Rome, all the partners making the same undertaking. However, in point of fact, there is some\u00ad thing slightly unrealistic about a process which, for example, enab\u00ad les the United Kingdom to take advantage of opt\u00adout clauses. Thought must be given to the diverse characteristics which would be further enhanced given the future prospects for expan\u00ad sion towards Eastern Europe. The 1996 intergovernmental confer\u00ad ence will probably be the forum for these adjustments. We are familiar with 'Europe \u00e0 la carte' and 'Two\u00adspeed Europe', but it is preferable to speak of a variable\u00adgeometry Europe with each state contributing to the effort towards the common goal but at its own pace and in ac\u00ad cordance with its capabilities and particular wishes. The book's sub\u00ad title clearly indicates the aim \u2014 'transition towards integration' \u00ad and only the transitional formula of an enlarged Europe operating on the basis of variable geometry, but organised so as to guarantee consistency in all ac\u00ad tions undertaken, makes it possible to take optimal advan\u00ad tage of the potential and wishes of each country. This is the re\u00ad quired response to today's econ\u00ad omic and political challenges pre\u00ad paring us for tomorrow's more complete integration. Without lingering on the road, progress must be made while still taking account of the actual situation and sometimes, as has been said, giving time time.

        "THE CONVENTION AT WORK EU-South Africa relations The Commission sets out its stall On 29 May, the European Commission ad opted a proposal from Commissioner Pin heiro for a Council decision authorising the negotiation of a new framework for relations between the EU and South Africa. Below we reprint an abridged ver sion of the press statement issued by the Spokesman's Service of the Commission. The Commission is aiming for a twin-track approach : on the one hand, a protocol to the Lom\u00e9 Convention covering the terms and conditions of South Africa's accession to the Convention and, on the other, a trade and co-operation agreement bet ween the European Community and the Republic, which could lead to the establish ment of a Free Trade Area. In close connec tion with these two instruments, the Com mission is willing to endorse South Africa's request to continue to benefit from the European Programme for Reconstruction and Development (EPRD) which is financed by a special Community budget line. The Commission proposes allocating ECU 500 million for this programme for the period 1996-1999 (The figure for 1995 was ECU 125 million). 'This is an ambitious approach which con firms our determination to strengthen our links with South Africa', said Professor Pin heiro after the approval of his proposals. 'I believe South Africa is a special case that deserves a special effort from our side. It merits the best possible arrangement we can offer for future relations', he added. The Commission's twin-track approach takes into consideration the specific econ omic, social and political conditions in South Africa, the issue of regional integration, and the wishes expressed by the South Af rican government. South Africa has asked to open negotiations 'with a view to es tablishing the closest possible relationship with the Lom\u00e9 Convention', as well as an agreement with the European Union 'on specific elements that might more approp riately be accommodated outside the Lom\u00e9 Convention, to the benefit of the existing Lom\u00e9 members and South Africa itself'. The proposal is designed to contribute to sustainable social and economic develop ment in South Africa by providing easier access to the Union's market and a gradual and smooth integration into the world economy. It would also enable South Africa to play a role as the 'powerhouse' for economic development and regional cooperation in Southern Africa to the benefit of ACP countries in that region and beyond. These objectives will be pursued without risking negative consequences for ACP countries that could arise from South Africa's full membership of the Lom\u00e9 Con vention, given its relatively strong econ omic performance (South Africa's exports to the EU are the equivalent of more than 50% of the exports of all 70 ACP countries combined). Protocol on accession to the Lom\u00e9 Convention The Commission is proposing that the Protocol should describe the terms and con ditions of South Africa's admission to Lom\u00e9 IV. A decision in favour of the Protocol will be required from the joint EU/ACP Council of Ministers. As a member of the ACP Group, South Africa would participate in the institutions of the Convention and in all areas of ACP-EU cooperation, as set out in Part Two of the Convention. The econ omic structure and production of South Afr ica is, to a considerable extent, comparable with those of the ACP countries. However, given the strength of certain sectors of the country's economy the parties would agree to limit South Africa's eligibility under cer tain articles of the Convention. The situ ation would be reviewed in the framework of negotiations on future new arrange ments between the EU and the ACP coun tries. A special article on South Africa's ac cession to the Convention, referring to such a Protocol, could be included in the final text emerging from the current Lom\u00e9 IV mid-term review. The bilateral agreement The Commission envisages a very ambitious trade and cooperation agreement covering the possibility, if South Africa so desires, of establishing a Free Trade Area. The Agree ment would govern all economic and trade relations between the Community and South Africa (insofar as they are not ad dressed by the Protocol to the Lom\u00e9 Con vention). It would provide for cooperation in the financial, technical and economic spheres, as well in a wide range of other areas of mutual interest. Plans for a poli tical dialogue, together with institutional arrangements, are also envisaged and the Agreement would contain a strong focus on the promotion of regional cooperation and integration. A clause stating that re lations between the Community and South Africa should be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles, is viewed by the Commission as an essential element of the agreement. Within the framework of a possible Free Trade Area, the Commission proposal envi sages an asymmetric time frame. This would allow South Africa, at an early stage, to gain improved access to the EU market without initially having to grant re ciprocal treatment to the Union's exports. South African industry would thereby gain a breathing space to restructure and en hance its competitiveness, and to prepare itself for a situation of decreased protection against EU exports. For certain sensitive products longer transitional periods may be necessary for both parties. Development co-operation \u2014 a special budget line In principle South Africa will be eligible to benefit from the financial cooperation pro visions in the Lom\u00e9 Convention. However, the parties could agree that, for a certain period, this eligibility would be suspended (except as regards regional projects and emergency assistance), in favour of a spe cial financial facility in support of the devel opment process in South Africa. This fa- the Courier no. 151 \u00b7 may-june 1995 ",
        "cility, the European Programme for Rec onstruction and Development (EPRD), aims to contribute to the improvement of the living standards of South Africans, with particular emphasis on the poorest sections of the population, during the initial period of transition. The facility would also pro vide financial resources for South Africa's participation in regional cooperation under the Lom\u00e9 Convention. i EUROPEAN BB DEVELOPMENT FUND Following, where required, favourable opinions from the EDF Committee, the Commission has decided to provide grants and special loans from the 5th, 6th and 7th EDFs to finance the following operations (grants unless otherwise stated). Major pro jects and programmes are highlighted. Economic and social infras tructure Gabon : ECU 8.6 million for a village water supply programme and for microprojects designed to improve the marketing of ag ricultural products in three provinces Djibouti: ECU 1 1 5 000 to build a laboratory for the analysis and control of water and ground salinity and for monitoring aquifers Malawi and Mozambique: ECU 36.26 million for the rehabilitation of the road between Limbe and the Mozambique frontier Mozambique : ECU 5 million towards the restoration of the Cahora Bassa high ten sion electricity link with South Africa. This grant supplements an EIB special loan of ECU 15 million for this project Haiti : ECU 16 million for a rehabilitation programme in the energy sector Trade promotion/structural adjustment Guinea: ECU 13.5 million under the Struc tural Adjustment Facility for a general import programme Agriculture C\u00f4te d'Ivoire: ECU 15.7 million for an irri gated rice development project in the central and north-central regions Health Burundi : ECU 5.5 million for a health sector reconstruction and rehabilitation prog ramme in the provinces of Bubanza, Ci- bitoke, Rutana, Ruyigi and Cankuso Tanzania : ECU 4 million to support the programme against HIV/AIDS and sexually- transmitted diseases Education Cameroun, Central African Republic, Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and Chad : ECU 1.8 million towards the construction in Yaound\u00e9 of a second campus for the Cath olic University of Central Africa, with a view to supporting the training of man agers Institutional support Guinea-Bissau : ECU 473 000 for technical assistance to the EDF national authorising officer EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK Loans Cameroun : ECU 20.5 million for the exten sion and strengthening of Douala's trans port and electricity distribution systems. ECU 12.5 million is in the form of risk ca pital made available to the government of Cameroun while the remaining ECU 8 mil lion is a loan from the ElB's own resources for the national electricity company Dominican Republic: ECU 8 million for ADEMI (Asociaci\u00f3n para el Desarrollo de Microempresas) to support future invest ments by small and medium-sized enter prises in a variety of sectors VISIT Vice-President Mbeki of South Africa The Vice-President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, paid a visit to the Commission on 24-25 February. He met with President San ter, Vice-President Brittan and Com missioners Pinheiro and Bangemann. In a meeting with Mr Santer and Mr Pin heiro, Mr Mbeki discussed relations bet ween South Africa and the European Union with a focus on three main areas: the 1995 aid programme, the framework for future bilateral relations and the proposed align ment of South Africa with the Lom\u00e9 Convention. The two sides agreed to speed up the dis cussions on the 1995 aid programme with a view to signing the agreement before the end of the spring. ECU 125 million would be provided immediately for operations in support of South Africa's reconstruction process within the framework of the Euro pean Programme for Reconstruction and Development. As regards a new bilateral agreement, Mr Pinheiro indicated the Commission's inten tion to present a proposed negotiating mandate to the Council in the coming weeks (see page I of this News Round-Up). The aim would be to reach the final ne gotiating phase during the summer. In the course of the joint press conference held by Mr Mbeki and Mr Pinheiro, the latter stated that it would be an 'ambitious ag reement covering economic and financial cooperation and a political dialogue' with a particular focus on regional cooperation in Southern Africa. Both sides expressed the hope that an agreement could be con cluded before the end of the year. As for the alignment of South Africa with the Lom\u00e9 Convention, Mr Pinheiro indi cated that the specific nature of South Af rica's situation would need to be taken into account so as to avoid any disruption of the Lom\u00e9 mechanisms. Mr Mbeki went on to stress his country's 'ambitious vision' as regards regional cooperation. This, he believed, should in clude not just the political and economic aspects but also the wider issue of security and stability in Southern Africa. It needed to be a global system of cooperation, he insisted. Mr Pinheiro lent strong support to the Courier no. 151 \u00b7 may-june 1995 ",
        "this vision promising the full support of the Commission. Mr Mbeki and Mr Pinheiro also exchanged views on current political and regional issues involving Lesotho, Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi. In his meeting with Commissioner Ban gemann, Vice-President Mbeki received as surances about the Union's firm commit ment to the participation of developing countries in the emerging 'information society'. MISCELLANEOUS Togo: progressive resumption of aid The European Union is to resume progress ively its assistance to Togo. Aid was frozen in 1992 because of attempts by the author ities to hinder democratic change in the country. The EU will begin by unblocking funds for rural development, education and the fight against AIDS. The Commission hopes, by this action, to encourage Togo's efforts in the field of d\u00e9 mocratisation. A resumption of European aid, even if only partial, should help to pro vide a respite for the economy of the country which has suffered very seriously as a result of protest strikes organised by the supporters of democracy. EUROPEAN UNION COUNCIL Racism and xenophobia The General Affairs Council of 6 March dis cussed the interim report of Mr Kahn, Pre sident of the Consultative Committee on Racism and Xenophobia. The Council shared the concerns expressed in this report about recent attacks of a racist and xeno phobic nature which have been carried out in several Member States. It also underlined the importance it attaches to a global strategy in the fight against racism and xenophobia, in advance of the European Council which will be held in Cannes (France) in June. In an oral presentation of his interim report, Mr Kahn spoke of the concerns of the members of the Consultative Commit tee about increasing displays of intolerance. He made the point that racism was a re ality which disfigured the construction of Europe and threatened its underlying prin ciples. Indicating that the Committee over which he presided would submit its final report to the Council during its May session, Mr Kahn nevertheless wished to apprise members at this stage of certain proposals that would be contained in the report : the creation of a European 'observatory' for racism and xenophobia, a European programme tar- getted at 'problem' neighbourhoods and the prolongation of the Committee's own mandate. As regards the first proposal, Mr Kahn said that an observatory would be particularly useful given the scale of the problem to be tackled and its 'transfrontier' nature. The observatory would be able to study the problems and put forward concrete meas ures to remedy them. As for the Consultat ive Committee's mandate, the speaker drew the Council's attention to the fact that six months was too short a period to address all the issues in a comprehensive manner and propose solutions. This was why he felt the mandate should be exten ded, assuming the Council was satisfied with the Committee's work to date. COMMON FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY In the framework of its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), the European Union has recently issued a number of statements, details of which are set out below : Burundi Statement of 19 March 1995 The European Union's objectives and priorities regarding Burundi are to conso lidate the process of national reconciliation and a return to normal democratic life, in particular by restoring the rule of law, and to promote the economic and social re covery of the country. Following the appointment, by the Presi dent of the Republic of Burundi, of Mr Nduwayo as Prime Minister and the form ing of a new Government, the European Union wishes them both every success in their task. The EU is however still concerned at the way the political situation is developing and the worsening of security conditions in Burundi. That concern prompted it to send a mission to Bujumbura on 10 and 11 Feb ruary 1995. The EU is determined to give strong backing to the 'Government Convention' concluded on 10 September 1994 with pro visions forming the institutional framework for necessary national reconciliation, and would urge all political parties, military forces and sectors of civilian society to re spect and implement it in a spirit of dia logue, moderation and compromise. The EU supports the action being taken in Burundi by the international community, and in particular bu the United Nations Or ganisation and the Organisation of African Unity, and is resolved to step up the efforts which it is already making to help strengthen stability in Burundi. The European Union is therefore prepared to: \u2014 assist the Burundi Government in orga nising a 'national debate' of the kind pro vided for by the 'Government Convention' with the participation of all sectors of the Burundi nation in order to consolidate national reconciliation and reconstruct de mocracy, \u2014 help strengthen the action already being taken by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, inter alia, by support for the sending of experts as provided for in Resolution 1995/90 adopted on 8 March 1995 by the UN Commission for Human Rights, \u2014 contribute to restoring the rule of law and strengthening the Burundi legal system, inter alia, by giving help in the training of magistrates. In view of the role which could be played by an international Commission of Enquiry into the attempted coup in 1993 and the massacres which followed, the European the Courier no. 151 - may-June 1995 ",
        "Union hopes that the United Nations will be able to adopt a position quickly on the request submitted to it by the Burundi Authorities. It also pays tribute to the action taken by the OAU, which it hopes will be extended further and is prepared to support. The EU is convinced that the economic and social recovery of Burundi will facilitate a return to stability and its consolidation for the future, and it would like a round table of donors to be organised swiftly with the participation of international institutions and all countries which are friends of Burundi. The EU is also prepared to help implement and follow up the action plan adopted by the regional conference on assistance to re fugees, returnees and displaced persons in the Great Lakes region, held in Bujumubra from 15 to 17 February 1995. By way of support for the Burundi nation in its search for peaceful and democratic solutions, the EU would encourage all par tners to take any measures they deem ne cessary against extremist elements in Bur undi in order to prevent them travelling abroad and receiving assistance. The European Union is aware of the close links which exist between the various hu manitarian and political problems facing the region and the considerable danger of d\u00e9stabilisation which persists, calls for the organisation of the conference on peace, security and stability desired by the United Nations Security Council and reiterates its strongest support for all forces in Burundi which are working towards peace, dialogue and national reconciliation. Burundi: common position ad opted Written procedure of 24 March 1995 1. The European Union will pursue, with regard to Burundi, the objectives set out in its Declaration of 19 March 1995 defining its overall priorities. 2. The Ministerial Troika will visit Burundi on 24 March 1995 in order to demonstrate the European Union's support for national reconciliation as provided for in the Government Convention of 10 September 1994. 3. The European Union is prepared to assist the Burundi Government in organising a national debate with the participation of all sections of the Burundi nation in order to consolidate national reconciliation and reconstruct democracy. The Presidency, acting under the conditions set out in Ar ticle J.5(3) of the Treaty, will contact the Burundi authorities with a view to submit ting an assessment of requirements to the Council as soon as possible. 4. The Presidency and the Commission, acting within the scope of their respective competences, will establish the contacts ne cessary for implementing this common po sition and will together make the envi saged representations to third parties. 4.1. The European Union is prepared to lend its support at an early date to sending human rights experts within the framework put in place by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. \u2014 The necessary contacts will be establi shed with the United Nations High Com missioner for Human Rights in order to define the conditions for the European Un ion's participation; \u2014 the Commission intends to propose that the European Community contribute as soon as possible to the funding of this operation an approximate amount of ECU 3 million, to be reassessed by the Commis sion in the light of the results of the Troika's visit and ongoing contacts. 4.2. The European Union is prepared to assist in restoring the rule of law and strengthening Burundi's judicial system, inter alia, by giving help with the training of magistrates. The necessary contacts will be established with the Burundi authorities in order to enable the Council to adopt a programme of assistance to the judiciary system as soon as possible. 4.3. The European Union supports the rapid convening of a round table of donors with the participation of international insti tutions, in particular international financial institutions, and all countries friendly with Burundi. The necessary representations will be made in order to secure the broadest possible support for this proposal. 4.4. The European Union is prepared to help implement for Burundi, and to follow up, the action plan adopted by the Re gional Conference on assistance to re fugees, displaced persons and returnees in the Great Lakes region, held in Bujumbura from 15 to 17 February 1995. The necessary representations will be made to encourage third States to support the action plan. 4.5. The European Union is prepared to support the action taken by the OAU. 5. All the other European Union objectives and priorities as defined in the declaration adopted in Carcassonne on 19 March 1995 will be pursued as soon as possible and will be covered, if appropriate, by a supplemen tary common position. 6. This common position will be followed up by the relevant Council working parties, to which the Presidency and the Commis sion will regularly report. 7. This common position shall be published in the Official Journal. Gambia: EU concerns about military government Statement of 21 March 1995 The European Union has noted the report by the National Consultative Committee and the statement made on 3 February by the Chairman of the Armed Forces Provi sional Ruling Council. Whilst noting with satisfaction that the period for transition towards a civil govern ment has been reduced, the EU remains concerned that a military government will remain in place until July 1996. It greatly regrets that the opportunity has not been availed of to hand over to an interim ci vilian government and that effective con trol of the government consequently re mains in the hands of the military. The EU would ask the AFPRC to take prac tical steps without delay to restore consti tutional government, thereby enabling the Union to resume its cooperation with the Gambia gradually and in the light of developments. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia associate themselves with this declaration. Nigeria : appeal for reinstatement of a constitutional regime Statement of 22 March 1995 The fresh arrests carried out by the Ni gerian authorities in recent days, in parti cular those of General Olusegun Obasanjo, the former Head of State, and General Yar Adua, the former Vice-President of the Fe deration, causes the European Union se rious concern. the Courier no. 151 * may-june 1995 ",
        "These arrests of prominent figures dem onstrate the impasse in which the military authorities in Nigeria have placed themsel ves. They confirm the EU's belief that the re-establishment of a constitutional regime and public liberties is essential for civil peace in Nigeria. The EU, in particular, calls upon the Nigerian authorities to release the political prisoners, to restore freedom of expression and the independence of the judiciary and to guarantee the safety of all persons who remain imprisoned. The im prisonment for nine months now of Mr Abiola prompts continuing disquiet. The EU is convinced that the stability and prosperity of a major country like Nigeria cannot come about through increased re pression, nor the prolongation of military rule. It calls on the Nigerian authorities to establish a democratic constitutional regime as soon as possible. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia associate themselves with this declaration. GENERAL INFORMATION SUPPORT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS Rwanda: European human rights observers Professor Pinheiro, the European Com missioner with responsibility for relations with ACP countries and South Africa has signed an administrative agreement with Ambassador Ayama Lasso, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, regarding the sending of a contingent of EU obser vers to Rwanda in support of the UN's ob server mission. Under the agreement, the EU will provide 40 observers from its 15 Member States, for a maximum period of five months. The European contingent will be integrated into the UN mission but will retain suf ficient autonomy to ensure the EU's vis ibility in its own right. The agreement fore sees the sending of the first group in the middle of March, to be followed shortly thereafter by two further teams of obser vers. The agreement has been hailed by High Commissioner Lasso and by the European Commission as an important step forward in international cooperation offering a pre cedent for future cooperation in the area of safeguarding and encouraging respect for human rights.

        "A g ro I n d u s t r i es U p m a r k et c r o ps Quality products are not only made in the developed countries. In the agri\u00adfoodstuffs field, there are some market niches which can be a source of substantial value added for developing regions, with a considerable knock\u00adon effect for rural areas. The CDI supports such innova\u00ad tive projects through original made\u00adto\u00admeasure interventions. Three examples serve to dem\u00ad onstrate this: early vegetables in Cameroon, roses in Tanzania and exotic fruit processing in the Dominican Republic. C a m e r o on P R O L EG Project: \" G a r d e n\" b e a ns n Western Cameroon, the land is very fertile. But it is also underde\u00ad veloped due to the fact that it is a land\u00ad locked region far from the coast. Victor Fotso, a local industrialist specialising in leather processing (Sitacuir), realised that this was an opportunity to diversify his ac\u00ad tivities. He opted for agro\u00adindustry \u00ad growing high\u00adquality extra\u00adfine green beans for export \u00ad and founded the PRO\u00ad LEG company in 1992, in which 2.5 mil\u00ad lion ECU has been invested. This African group has largely used its own funds, topped up by financing from Proparco and the AEF (Africa Enterprise Fund of the IFC) (670,000 ECU). Initially, the CDI's contribution consisted in cofinancing fea\u00ad sibility studies on this type of crop and providing assistance \u00ad especially through the presence of experts on the spot \u00ad as regards technology, training and manage\u00ad ment. During the first year, Proleg collaborated with small farmers working traditional village\u00adstyle plots of land. A pyramidal structure of responsibilities was estab\u00ad lished, with a European head of farming supervising five large sectors each run by a manager; within these sectors there are regional heads who in turn are in charge of a number of farming assistants. This technical staff provides its support in planting, irrigation, fertilisers and health\u00ad care treatment. Daily harvesting is carried out by rural workers, along with sorting and packing. Part of production is intend\u00ad ed for European markets in fresh prod\u00ad ucts, whilst another part is earmarked for quick\u00adfreezing. \"The essential thing first of all was to in\u00ad still a sense of quality into the staff in a job that calls for motivation and dedication. Growinggreen beans is easy. Growingtra\u00ad ditional \"garden\" beans which have a much superior taste and cannot now be found in Europe is something else\", ex\u00ad plains Olivier Draulette, sales manager of CIS (Compagnie Industrielle de Services), a French company holding shares in Pro\u00ad leg and in charge of the distribution of its products in Europe. A refined vegetable (very different from the varieties produced by cloning which can be harvested mechanically in 24 hours), this garden bean must be hand\u00ad picked in the cool of the morning with\u00ad in two hours. Maximum delivery time is 48 hours. The products are therefore packed immediately and then trans\u00ad ported by night in lorries (Proleg now has a fleet of some 200 vehicles) to the airport: a seven\u00adhour journey over 300 km of tracks. A fine example of just\u00adin\u00ad time. \u03a7? extra\u00adfins r t$ cueillis et \u00e9bout\u00e9s main lejmnu\u00eeouria\u00ees Packaging of quick\u00adfrozen beans by Proleg in Cameroon, sold in French supermarkets under the brand name \"le Bandjounais\" Whilst this process works perfectly in the rainy season, production runs up against climatic constraints during the dry season from November to May, when demand in Europe is very high. The first harvest ( 1992\u00ad93) led to production of 214 tonnes and the second to some 300 tonnes, of which 200 tonnes were frozen. \"In the be\u00ad ginning we froze more than planned but we have since adjusted to meet the de\u00ad mand for fresh products more closely and to deal more effectively with the dry sea\u00ad son. Fotso has invested in the acquisition and clearing of land, irrigation processes, agricultural equipment and cold chains.\" In fact, the group has acquired a hundred hectares in the Bandjoun Foumbott Baf\u00ad fousam region. Proleg employs 430 peo\u00ad ple full\u00adtime and 850 part\u00adtime, and also provides a living for some 1,500 self\u00ad employed farmers in the region. Partnership No 19 I May/June 1995 ",
        "g At the moment, Proleg exports mostly to France. Its fresh products are distributed on the markets of Rungis, Toulouse and Lyons. Quick-frozen production (which should rise from 800 tonnes in 93-94 to 1,400 tonnes in 94-95) is being marketed initially by large French distribution com panies such as Auchan, Carrigel and Po mona. This approach is far from uninte resting when we realise that the \"quick-frozen\" formula accounts for 54.7% of sales of vegetables in this coun try and that demand in this field is increas ing by 5.5% a year there. CDI intervention. Keen to develop this approach, Proleg is conducting systematic research into new quick-frozen markets. What bet ter way to influence decision-makers than to show them on the spot the quality of the products and the pro cessing method ? In 1994, the CDI pro vided this project with an original kind of support. A number of potential cus tomers were invited to visit the instal lations in Cameroon and see the har vesting techniques for themselves. A competition (cofinanced by the CFD) was also organised for salesmen in ex isting distribution channels, with the prize-winners being offered a similar trip to Africa after a promotional period. These different interventions by the CDI illustrate its desire to give prior ity to initiatives involving projects with a significant impact in rural areas. To tie everything up, it now remains to convince the European clientele. \"Last year, we showed the decision makers who we were. We must now demonstrate to the consumer the superior quality of this traditionally grown, hand-picked product. In a way, it is a return to the old days. The con sumer realises that this is a different taste. That it the aspect that we must now develop in our marketing cam paigns in Europe.\" T a n z a n ia FLORISSA Project: Top-quality roses Omari Issa, Manager of Florissa H nother African country: Tanza nia. In the Kilimanjaro region there are now two hectares of glass houses in which roses of exceptional quality are grown. The climatic condi tions allow them to be cultivated 365 days a year. This project is the brain child of a Moshi entrepreneur, Omari Issa, who trained in management at a development finance institution and set up the FLORISSA company in 1992. Considerable investments have been made (ECU I million): soil analysis, glasshouse construction, high- performance irrigation system, pur chase of plants suitable for local con ditions, installation of a refrigerated packing room, studies on the best packaging for this refined product, etc. Clientele targeted as a priority: the major cut-flower markets in Europe. CDI intervention. A dual partnership agreement was signed, firstly with the Moerheim flower-growing companies (Nether lands) for technical assistance, and sec ondly with Universal Plants (France) which supplied plants patented by the French firm Meilland. The CDI's inter vention consisted in financing the cooperation of Eric Vellinga, a Dutch expert (Moerheim) who helped Floris sa in horticultural techniques and the management of the project. In 1994, he supervised soil preparation, irrigation and the construction of glasshouses. The latter, of French manufacture, were erected first of all under the di rection of one of the company's tech nicians from whom the Africans quick ly acquired sufficient know-how to carry out subsequent installation themselves. Jean Dyens (Universal Plants) was also involved from the be ginning in selecting the site, preparing the soil, planting the flowers and - in collaboration with Eric Vellinga - train ing the personnel. In effect, Tanzania has no tradition of its own in this field. Partnership No 19 May/June 1995 ",
        "A g At the moment, there are four glass\u00ad houses (covering two hectares) in which different varieties of roses are grown. More extensive work to lay on water and electricity has proved nec\u00ad essary than initially anticipated. Three African executives have been recruit\u00ad ed and Florissa now employs some fif\u00ad ty staff for an annual production capac\u00ad D o m i n i c an R e p u b l ic m.~'.#es FL\u00b7 \u03b9: new rosebushes ity of 3 to 3.5 million cut flowers. Exports, which began last November, have been very favourably received in Holland, the main export market, but also at local level (Moshi, Arusha, Dar\u00ad Es\u00adSalaam). A third partnership agree\u00ad ment has just been signed with the Dutch marketing company AA Flor. \"I am sure that there is a substantial clientele for high\u00adquality roses of this kind, even if the marketing always proves more difficult when products from faraway countries are con\u00ad cerned,\" concludes Mrs Meilland, sales administration manager at Universal Plants. \"Florissa's exports are also faced with the problem of the lack of flights. Flowers must be transported very quickly, which is possible to Lon\u00ad don, Parisand Amsterdam. If airfreight to Japan existed, I am certain that an entire market could be developed there too.\" ESQUIZ DOMINICANA Projet Tropical flavours consultant can become an entre\u00ad preneur, as demonstrated by Bel\u00ad gian Paul Vlaminck, Chairman of ES\u00ad QUIZ DOMINICANA, a marketing company which he has founded with four Dominican SMEs. This marketing man \u00ad he has worked for Proctor & Gamble in particular \u00ad specialises in the field of beverages based on fruit juices. During a mission to the Dominican Re\u00ad public in 1994 on behalf of the CDI, he saw for himself the quality of the re\u00ad gion's tropical fruit, the development potentials for derived products (drinks, purees, syrups, etc.) and the dynamism of some SMEs: \"I met industrial part\u00ad ners who filled me with such enthu\u00ad siasm that I decided to launch a com\u00ad pany to market their current products and new products that we could create together.\" These four Dominican companies, op\u00ad erating in different fields, have valuable complementary qualities allowingthem to work in synergy to meet other needs. BON produce fruit\u00adbased prep\u00ad arations, llguiflod specialise in coco\u00ad nuts, which are frozen by Tropigugos, and Latin Fruit manufacture exotic pu\u00ad rees. In October 1994, the CDI supported these different companies by financing their attendance at the famous SIAL (Paris), where they were able to present their products, establish con\u00ad tacts with potential clients and propose studies on new developments on re\u00ad quest. More than sixty clients ex\u00ad pressed an interest. The sales arising from these contacts are estimated at some $ 800,000 a year \u00ad not to men\u00ad tion the potential as regards products yet to be created. \"Some of the products already being marketed do not suit European tastes because they are too sweet, but it is not really difficult to change\", says Paul Vlaminck. \"On the other hand, there is an enormous demand for new products based on tropical fruit. Given the gen\u00ad eral curb on drinking and driving, peo\u00ad ple need light, tasty drinks, and tropi\u00ad cal fruit is the ideal solution. Consequently, there is a whole market to be explored and satisfied.\" Examples: original \"cocktails\" of bana\u00ad na and passion fruit juice or nectars of tamarind, cocoa and guava. These fresh products, manufactured in the Domin\u00ad ican Republic, will henceforth meet in\u00ad creasingly strict European standard as regards quality and hygiene (ISO 9000, Hazard Analysis, Quality Management, etc.). More and more is expected of another potential product: pieces of fruit fro\u00ad zen by the AQF method (\u00ad40\u00b0C to \u00ad50\u00b0C). The advantage of this presen\u00ad tation is that it offers quality products to rival fresh fruit. \"These pieces of fruit can be used at the rate of 100%, whereas if you buy a fresh pineapple you may have to throw some of it away... It is a field that we intend to de\u00ad velop, which will be of particular inter\u00ad est to hotels, airline catering services, etc.\" \"Competition already exists\", con\u00ad cludes Paul Vlaminck, \"especially from other Latin American countries and In\u00ad dia. But I think that the know\u00adhow of these Dominican companies, the qual\u00ad ity of the basic products and the crea\u00ad tivity that they have demonstrated in meeting demand bode well for the future ...\" \u25a0 Partnership No 19 I May/June 1995 ",

ROWELA-Cap-Vert is a footwear manufacturing company created by three Portuguese companies - GROWELA-Portugal, Selco and SET - which have invested 1.7 million ECU in specifically export-oriented produc tion. The factory started up in March 1994 and the first objectives of the fea sibility study were attained during the second half of the year, when the foot wear line was running at 1,850 pairs a day (December 1994) with a productiv ity level barely 5% to 10% lower than that of the parent company and a reject rate of around 5%. When full output is achieved, the factory will produce 442,000 pairs a year. GROWELA-Cap- Vert intends to treat the hides itself: start-up of a unit with a capacity of 743,000 hides a year is planned for 1995. CDI intervention. In the beginning, the CDI helped the Portuguese industrialists to present their project to the two finance institu tions which agreed to back it - the BFE (Banco de Fomento e Exterior) in Por tugal and the AEF (World Bank Group). For the 1994 start-up, the Centre and its institutional partners ICEP (Investi mentos, Commercio e Turismo- Portugal and FCE (Fundo para a Coopera\u00e7\u00e3o Economica) contributed towards the establishment of a training programme in Portugal for 3 senior managers and 18 middle managers and skilled workers. At the same time, 45 people received basic training in the Cape Verde Islands in cutting, stitching and assembly techniques.

CDI intervention. Following the professional meeting on \"compound feedstuffs\" organised by the Centre in Saly (Senegal, end of 1993), an additional stage was achieved, upstream with the start-up of an industrial abattoir with a capacity of 700 chickens per hour and downstream with a breeding unit for egg-layers (3,400 head). The CDI provid ed its assistance in organising a market ing campaign to launch products from the abattoir under the \"Mister Poulet\" label. Along with media activities, this opera tion also comprised a promotion cam paign through tie-in sales and a merchan dising action. SEDIMA is continuing its integrated de velopment, still with the Centre's sup port. Eggs for consumption are laid by 20,000 battery hens in two ultramodern buildings. Three other units now under construction will allow 50,000 layers to be housed by the end of 1995. Other pro- Partnership No 19 May/June 1995 ",

SEDIMA's rapid development is the result of a vigorous management policy and a careful investment strategy pursued by the company management. Until 1994, they managed to achieve this growth sole\u00ad ly through funds generated by the com\u00ad pany's activities. It was in this way that the firm found it possible to obtain loans for the substantial investments currently in the pipeline. SEDIMA now has a turnover of 2,000 mil\u00ad lion FCFA. It employs a hundred people and generates a large number of indirect jobs among poultry\u00adfarmers and distrib\u00ad utors. F L O R Y C H A N TE / M A U R I T US C e r a m i c s: from craft to i n d u s t ry Florychante Ltd is an illustration of the support provided by the CDI to an SME faced with expansion and modernisation problems. Shot of the workshop at Florychante et up some ten years ago, Flor\u00ad ychante Ltd was initially a ce\u00ad ramics workshop whose hand\u00admade products were intended for the lo\u00ad cal tourist industry. The company has slowly developed since then, but only with a limited technical and pro\u00ad duction capacity. This gradual expan\u00ad sion therefore ran up against numer\u00ad ous production problems. Not available locally, essential raw materials such as clay and varnish, together with moulds, had to be im\u00ad ported from South Africa. The com\u00ad pany's development problems were reflected in the quality of the finished product, whilst attempts to enlarge its commercial base remained very limited. Faced with competition from imports from South Africa and China, Florychante can meet only a very small percentage of demand from local consumers for quality products. C DI intervention. In October 1993, a CDI mission con\u00ad ducted an in\u00addepth examination of the company's technical and manu\u00ad facturing problems and made a se\u00ad ries of recommendations to the management. Further support was then provided by the Centre to en\u00ad able the general manager of Flory\u00ad chante to go to the United Kingdom to visit several firms in the Stoke\u00adon\u00ad Trent region specialising in a wide range of equipment for the ceramics sector. During this trip, he ordered basic equipment representing an overall investment of 500,000 ECU, with the machines being delivered to Mauritius in August 1994. The following month, a further mis\u00ad sion was organised, financed by the CDI, to supervise the commission\u00ad ing of the new unit and to train the staff in all the technical and practical aspects of the new production tools. Great importance was also placed on improving product quality and the production methods used so far. Florychante Ltd now produces 60 tonnes of earthenware articles a year, with a turnover of 400,000 ECU, and employs a staff of 29. Im\u00ad ports of materials from South Afri\u00ad ca have been reduced in volume by over 80%. C u r r e nt p r o d u c t i on meets international standards as re\u00ad gards quality and durability. And the company now has a sufficiently strong base to consider subsequent expansion on a large scale with real prospects of soon being able to ex\u00ad port a wide range of products to South Africa and neighbouring markets. \u25a0 Partnership No 19 I May/June 1995 ",
        "S u a r y CDI 1994 in brief In 1994, the CDI's capacity to support ACP enterprises was significantly increased compared to the previous year. The number of projects supported by the Centre rose by 25%, whilst the number of interventions was up by 20%. A detailed breakdown of this development is given in the tables below. o carry out this task of supporting ACP industrial projects, the CDI has continued to strengthen the two net\u00ad works established in these countries and in the European Union. When it comes to financing, the CDI also has close synergies with a network of a dozen national or international finance in\u00ad stitutions. The latter contributed towards the financing of over 20% of the projects supported by the Centre in 1994. Finally, the CDI's activities are not limited to individual support for projects. To encour\u00ad age new partnerships between EU and ACP entrepreneurs, it also makes a major effort to promote industrial growth sectors in the ACP countries. Two lines of action have been given special priority to this effect: \u2022 The organisation of three new Europe\u00ad ACP professional meetings focused on fishing (Namibia), ornamental stone (Do\u00ad minican Republic) and 2nd\u00ad and 3rd\u00adstage timber processing (Cameroon). The Cen\u00ad tre also contributed towards the Mining Forum in Lusaka (Zambia), organised by the European Commission, and was one of the linchpins in the Conference on the industrial integration of South Africa held in Athens on the initiative of the Greek government when it held the Presidency of the European Council. \u2022 The CDI developed its publications cat\u00ad alogue with 8 technical and thematic guides (6 others are in course of prepar\u00ad ation).

        "This leaflet is intended particul\u00ad arly for agronomists and those conducting surveys in countries in the Sahel region who may have to deal with the problem of parasitic plants. It will enable weed researchers rapidly to ident\u00ad ify the pathogenic species and help them in deciding which ag\u00ad ronomic approach to recommend. DES MANOELS SCOLAIRES SUR MESURE \u2014 Guide pratique \u00e0 l'in\u00ad tention des auteurs de manuels scolaires pour le primaire dans les pays en d\u00e9veloppement (MADE\u00adTO\u00adMEASURE SCHOOL MANUALS \u2014 a practical guide for authors of primary school manuals in developing countries) By Marie Chatry\u00adKomarek. Publi\u00ad shers : L'Harmattan <5\u00ad7, rue de l'Ecole Polytechnique, F\u00ad75005 Paris). 1994, 239 pp., 140 FF. ISBN 2\u00ad7384\u00ad2874\u00ad6. The author, who has worked in Africa and Latin America for over 15 years, in the field of primary\u00ad education school manuals in national languages, summarises, in this volume, a German\u00adMadag\u00ad ascan educational project, suppor\u00ad ted by bilateral German aid, whose objective was to equip pupils and their teachers with manuals in the local language of Madagascar. This is a guide which demonstrates the feasibility of the work it describes. DITS DE LA NUIT \u2014 Anthologie de contes et de l\u00e9gendes d'Af\u00ad rique centrale (TALES OF THE NIGHT \u2014 an an\u00ad thology of stories and legends from Central Africa) Choice of texts by V\u00e9ronique Jago\u00adAntoine and Antoine Tshit\u00ad ungu Kongolo. Publishers: Labor. 1994,298 pp. ISBN2 8040\u00ad1013\u00ad9. An anthology of stories, humor\u00ad ous or satirical bestiaries and leg\u00ad ends which will enchant with the universal appeal of its topics and the unusually free spirit of its traditions. This book makes it possible to renew one's acquaint\u00ad ance with African history, which has long remained separate from written civilizations, offering the original, strong flavour of the tales. LES ENTREPRISES INFORMELLES DANS LE MONDE (INFORMAL ENTERPRISES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD) Under the direction of Rolando Arellano, Yvon Gasse and G\u00e9rard Verna. Publishers: Laval Univer\u00ad sity Press (Cit\u00e9 universitaire, Sainte Foy (Quebec), Canada Gl \u039a 7P4). 1994, 484 pp. ISBN 2\u00ad 7637\u00ad7361\u00ad3. The informal sector has been the subject of numerous research pro\u00ad jects for nearly twenty years and is now recognised as a major phenomenon in the world economy. Specialists from America, Africa, Asia and Europe met to debate the subject at an international colloquium and the proceedings are collected in this volume. They are variously termed under\u00ad ground, parallel or subsistence, but informal enterprises have in common the fact that they evade state control. They exist every\u00ad where \u2014 in the Third World as a means of survival or in Western countries as a reaction to increas\u00ad ingly burdensome charges and rules. By dealing with a number of aspects of the informal sector (emergence strategy, state of the situation worldwide, nature and formal or informal environmental links), the book is intended for those interested in the concept and the extent of the pheno\u00ad menon. LA ZONE FRANC \u2014 La dyna\u00ad mique de l'int\u00e9gration mon\u00e9taire et ses contraintes. Tome 2 (THE FRANC AREA \u2014 The dy\u00ad namics of monetary integration and its constraints. Volume 2) By Hubert G\u00e9rardin. Publishers : L'Harmattan (5\u00ad7, rue de l'Ecole Polytechnique \u2014 F\u00ad75005 Paris). 1994, 477 pp. 250 FF. ISBN 2\u00ad 7384\u00ad2953X. In Volume 1, 'La zone franc, his\u00ad toire et institutions'. ['The franc zone, its history and institutions'], the author gave a precise descrip\u00ad tion of the history and operating mechanisms of the franc area which today still consists of a group of 14 African countries using a currency linked to the French franc. In Volume 2, he retraces econ\u00ad omic, monetary and financial de\u00ad velopments which have occurred in the franc area since the various countries gained their indepen\u00ad dence. Through a number of stat\u00ad istical tables and graphs, this work offers material permitting long\u00adterm analysis and provides a status report on the countries for evaluating what is at stake in current debates (CFA parity, ca\u00ad pital flow, choice of monetary policy, European and African in\u00ad tegration). MADAGASCAR: DEMOCRAZIA IN CAMMINO (MADAGASCAR : THE ROAD TO DEMOCRACY) Under the direction of A. Tosolini, H. Rakotondratsima, M. Bigi and R. Zanoli. Publishers: Alfazeta (CP. 475, 1\u00ad43100 Parma). 1994, 144 pp., Lit. 18). At a time when Africa's appear\u00ad ance in the media signals yet another catastrophe, RTM (Reggio Tiers Monde), an inter\u00ad national voluntary agency, and the journal ALFAZETA have de\u00ad cided to describe the current state of democracy in Madagas\u00ad car, emphasising the prospects for a country which, through its own strength of character, has been able to rid itself of a dictatorship without recourse to violence and to take the first steps on the road to democracy. LES CREOLES (THE CREOLES) By Robert Chaudenson. Publi\u00ad shers: Presses Universitaires de France. 'Que sais\u00adje?'. Encyc\u00ad lopaedic Collection. (108, boulevard Saint\u00adGermain, F\u00ad75006 Paris). 1995, 127 pp. ISBN 2\u00ad13\u00ad 047009\u00ad2. The author is a specialist in Creole cultures and particularly Creole dialects which are a variety of languages found in certain former European colonies and which, while being obviously an evol\u00ad ution of the colonists' languages, are also special and independent systems. The approach, here, is socio\u00adhistorical and sociolinguistic and concludes in favour of the exceptional interest of studying these dialects for the purposes of language\u00adscience research. In addition to actual scientific aspects, it argues that the emer\u00ad gence of the Creole cultures and dialects illustrates Man's remar\u00ad kable abilities to create new sys\u00ad tems out of slavery, tm The Courier Africa \u00ad Caribbean \u00ad Pacific \u00ad European Union Address : Postal address (mail only) 'The ACP\u00adEU Courier' Commission of the European Communities 200, rue de la Loi 1049 Brussels Belgium The Courier office address (visitors) First floor Astrid Building 1, rue de Gen\u00e8ve Evere \u00ad Brussels Belgium Publisher Steffen Smidt Commission of the European Communities 200, rue de la Loi 1049\u00adBRUSSELS (Belgium) Tel. 00\u00ad32\u00ad2\u00ad299 1111 Director of Publications Dominique David Editor Simon Horner Production Manager Roger De Backer Assistant editors Augustin Oyowe Jeanne Remade Associate assistant editor Hegel Goutier Secretariat: Carmela Peters Fax : 299\u00ad30\u00ad02 Circulation : Margriet Mahy\u00advan der Werf (299\u00ad30\u00ad12) Bock cover: A street scene in Paramaribo, capital of Suriname.
