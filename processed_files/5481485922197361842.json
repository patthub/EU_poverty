        "F O R E W O RD This work describes the practical experience of many health workers in the Community countries. In March 1980. at the initiative of the Commission of the European Communities, the World Health Organization and the Belgian Inter-university Centre Health and Psycho-social Factors, a seminar was held to examine the progress recently made in assessing mental health care. The chapters in this book follow the logical order of the stages in health planning, i.e. determining needs and defining constraints, devising a programme of action and. finally, assessing the results obtained. This publication has benefited from the collaboration of the heads of research teams from almost all the Member States of the European Community and of persons responsible for high-level decisions concerning the implemen tation of medical and social programmes. This work provides the reader with a new and original discussion of the main aspects of mental health planning. It should be noted that only a few documents covering all the successive stages in such health programmes have so far been published. Finally, the authors sincerely hope that personal contacts will be established between readers and the writers who collaborated on this work. This will undoubtedly lead to a fruitful dialogue aimed at fostering mental health among the general public by implementing programmes of increasing relevance. ",

        "OPENING ADDRESS DR. H. ERISKAT, LUXEMBOURG Ladies and Gentlemen, To begin with, let me welcome you to Luxembourg for this 3rd European seminar on health policy. I work for the Health and Safety Directorate of the Directorate-General for Employment and Social Affairs, and am in charge of the Division dealing with questions of public health and radiation protection. I wish to apologize on behalf of Dr. Recht, who was to have opened the seminar but was unfortunately unable to come to Luxembourg because of a meeting of the Council of Ministers in Brussels. This 3rd European seminar on health policy owes its existence to the Belgian Inter-university Centre Health and Psycho-social Factors and in particular to its director. Professor Sand of the r-'ree University of Brussels. The general theme concerns problems of mental health, including the detection and understanding of such problems, the most effective methods of resolving or tackling problems of mental health policy, how prevention can and must be improved for certain social groups and hew these social groups, for example the handicapped, can be reintegrated into society - as quickly as possible. Ladles and gentlemen, you know that the Commission is devoting more and more attention to questions of social policy and health policy. In 1977 and 1973 the Council of Health Ministers of the Member States of the E.C. met twice to give a political impetus to the activities of the Commission in the field of public health and to lay dawn the general guidelines for these. Health expenditure is increasing rapidly, often much more rapidly than the gross national product of the various countries. Consequently, we must not only attempt to make health expenditure more efficient, but also to ascertain the real needs of the populations with regard to health. This is why the other problems, whose importance was stressed by the Ministers, concern health education in general and, more particularly, nutrition, anti-smoking campaigns and other questions which will certainly be touched on during this seminar. ",
        "By defining our positions on such subjects at Community level we make the public more aware of the objectives of European integration which, to be truly affective, must mean much more than simple economic integration. The importance which we attach to this seminar, which will continue for the next two days. Is therefore clear, and I would particularly like to thank Professor Sand who has been personally involved in the preparations. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will enjoy your stay in Luxembourg, that your work will be fruitful and that you will go away with the feeling of having accomplished something positive. I hops we shall be able to make concrete recommendations which will assist future measures at national, regional and local levels in the Member Statesi clearly, such recommendations could also have a bearing on the future work of the Commission in the field of public health. ",
        "-5- INTRODUCTORY ALLOCUTION PROF, DR. S. HALTER Ladies and Gentlemen, A few weeks ago I was asked by Prof. SANO and Prof. BARO to take part in this meeting and in my capacity of Chief Medical Officer of the Balgian Ministry of Health, it was a duty for me to make the effort to come to Luxembourg and address this meeting in the opening session, so as to give you the feeling of a responsible civil servant about the importance of this meeting and the expectancies we have of the results which you will. I am sure, book after these days of common work. I would like to start by thanking very specially the Commission for having accepted to organize this seminar and support it so that you have been able to come to Luxembourg to discuss on the very Important problem which is at the agenda. I would like to ask M. ERISKAT to transfer to the E.C.C, and I am sure I can speak in your name, the thanks for the opportunity. The second point I would like to raise is that I am specially pleased that this meeting has been organized by the \"Interunlversity Centre for the study of the psycho-social factors related to health\". As a matter of fact, you may know that Belgium has been cosponsor In the World Health Assembly, for the program of development of a comprehensive study of the psycho-social factors in the modern communities and their relationship with health. I am particularly pleased to greet Dr. SARTORIUS from the W.H.O. who has come to participate in this meeting and who is responsible for the development of the program of W.H.O. In the year 1975, at the Assembly, the Belgian Minister of Health, Mr DE SAEGER, addressed the Assembly and stated the interest he himself as Minister of Health, had for these problems. Because mental health is considered by the population in general and by the politicians in particular, as part of psychiatry and we know that psychiatry is caring with mad people or in any case, with people who have got rather Important mental disorders, difficulties arise in coping with the mild cases. ",
        "We all have been able to state that in the recent times slight mental disturbances have become more delicate, less easy to handle because a great number of factors of modern life, are influencing the psychological evolution of our population. Therefore, I would like to address again my deepest thanks to Dr. SARTORIUS for his worry psycho social aspects , ask him also to carry to Dr. LAMBD, the Deputy Director General of W.H.O. and to Or. MAHLER, the Director General, my compliments for the activities which have been developping in this field, because we are convinced that these aspects are very important. I am in particular, grateful to W.H.O. for having accepted to recognize as a reference centre the centre which is lead by Dr. BARO and Dr. SAND in Brussels and which is entitled to investigate and do research works on the health related to the psycho-social factors of the environment. You will then understand why I felt absolutely necessary to be here with you this morning and address this meeting. Now to the ground itself of this meeting I would like to tell you that, when I saw for the first time the title of this meeting, I got a shock. If you look, you will see that the title is \"Evaluation and mental health care\". Having the responsibility in my department for planning problems and having had a certain idea about evaluation, I thought at first that it was a problem to get mental care for those people who have to do evaluation and who often get mad when they try to do that. But of course, when I went through the program I saw that it was mors classical. It is really trying to introduce in the mental care program, the notion of evaluation and this is of course more reasonnabls. I think that the Importance of this particular aspect of mental health care is very great. Indeed you cannot speak of evaluation if you haven't got in mind a certain projection in time and if you haven't got also the feeling that something has to be done and programmed in the particular field which you want to evaluate. Whenever you are planning an action, you need evaluation of the situation, and therefore develop indicators which can give you measuring units for assessing the situation and also give you a possibility to evaluate what this situation will become after a certain time when you have developped your action. ",
        "-7- We know that evaluation may show an evolution which is not in line with what Is expected. Some disorders may get worse instead of Improving. In any case, evaluation process is one of the main tools which Is needed by those who bare responsibility for public health, as well as health care of the population. It Is not In front of such an assembly that I ought to make a fuss about the situation of mental care in our countries. You know much better than I do what the situation is and what should be done. I am sure that this is going to be your valuable contribution to this meeting. But, may I allow myself to give my vision of this problem ? I think that today, mental health is like an iceberg. You see a little part of it and the greatest part of this problem is hidden under the water. When I look at the figures, for example, in my own country. I note that we have got a system of psychiatric care for deeply mentally disturbed people kept in psychiatric institutions, this is about 2,7 or 2,8 beds for 1.000 Inhabitants. When in the population of the Belgian community, about 3 to 4 persons on 1.000 need some type of psychiatric care, I think this is already one first problem. We need further care for handicapped , which-means atout the same amount of people needing some type of care in institutions. Besides, this evaluation is needed on ambulatory care status. One starts thinking that you get very near to 1 t of the population who needs active intervention in the psychiatric field. Other disorders must be taken into consideration, which do not necessarily lead the people to psychiatric Intervention, we must add to this number of people those who have got other trouble of their behaviour which are not identifiable exactly under the same flag, like alcoholists, drug abuses, all kinds ofcalinquency or criminality... who have to be added as well as this very Important mass of the public which is dissatisfied, which is not happy to live, those people who feel themselves badly in their skin, you must then consider that this is the bottom part of the iceberg, that need to be better known and cared for. In my capacity of civil servant of a public health department, I do not have the necessary background to appreciate and to quantify the real morbidity which you would find in the population in the sphere of psycho-social disorders. ",
        "Besides that, we see that a considerable number of factors are playing in our surrounding on our mental status on our psychological components, so that again, our people are getting away from the de-inltion of health by W.H.O. which is not only physical well being, but also mental well being. I want also to draw your attention on an important epidemiological aspect. May I recall that morbidity is a two-fold matter coping with the number of cases and also with the severity of these. Our action must be evaluated on these two aspects : degree of recovery must be looked as even important as the lessening of number of cases. Therefore, I think the time is right to start searching what the situations are really. This is for sure an important aspect of evaluation and may be the main Justification of a meeting like this, evaluate situations, evaluate the morbidity in our population is one of the first aim we should envisage, and besides that I will be very happy to learn more about the approach of various speakers which have been announced in the program. When results will be available of some actions which have already been developing in some specific fields and in some specific circumstances, this will be very useful to those who must propose and defend new programs for action in countries. So these are. Mister Chairman, a certain number of elements and reasons which made me fell grateful to all of those very competent and distinguished people you have chosen to participate in this meeting and I am expecting that my colleagues of the various departments of public health, not only in the European community but also in the World Health Assembly, will gain by knowing the results of a meeting like this. I hope also that this meeting will not be a single one and that it will be a start for further collaboration between the E.C.C, and the various W.H.O. centres like the centre which took this initiative to bring us together today. ",
        "-9- INTRODUCTION DR. N. SARTORIUS, W.H.O. Ladies and Gentlemen, I bring you the best wishes for a successful meeting from the Director- General of the W.H.O., Dr. H. Mahlen from the Deputy Director-General, Or. T.A. Lambo; and from the Regional Director for Europe, Or. L. Kaprio, who has asked me to convey his regrets for not being able to Join you today. Personally. I am pleased to be here because this gives me an opportunity to work with a group of outstanding people, many of whom have made important contributions to W.H.O. programmes, and because I hope to be able to assist the slendid effort which Prof. Sand and Prof. Baro and their collaborators have made in the organization of this meeting on behalf of the E.E.C. I sincerely thank the organizers for the invitation to come here and wish to use this opportunity to acknowledge the tremendous contributions of Prof. Halter to the programme of W.H.O. in general and to mental health in particular. It was Prof. Halter and other progressive thinkers in the field of public health, like Mr De Saeger, who have helped W.H.O. to define mental health in a broad sense, dealing not only with the care for the mentally ill but also with psychosocial aspects of general health care and psychosocial aspects of development in general. The W.H.O. Collaborating Centre on Psychosocial Factors and Health in Brussels, which has organized this meeting, is by its orientation and goals an exponent of these new points of emphasis of the W.H.O. Mental Health Programme. I see your meeting as an important step in bringing about collaboration among countries necessary to resolve the many technical and practical difficulties facing evaluation in the field of mental health and look forward to learning from your deliberations. Experience, which will be presented here, will be of great interest to other countries, particularly in the developing world where the resources are extremely scarce and must therefore be used wisely. ",
        "-10- In most developing countries, there is no more than perhaps one psychiatrist for two million population and the situation is similarly worrying with regard to other mental health professionals. \u00b7 The priority given to mental health programmes is low and the position of the patient often horrible. Dur estimates show that there are at least 40,000,000 people who are severely mentally ill in the world and some 200,000,000 more who are handicapped by problems such as those linked to alcohol and drug dependence, mental retardation and so on. Many physical desorders are accompanied by mental health problems. Mental health skills and knowledge are not used sufficiently in general health services nor in overall development programmes. If countries are to provide mental health care using new strategies of care delivery and if they are to deal adequately with psychosocial aspects of general health and development, they will need better technology of evaluation! and I hope that this meeting and collaborative work that will fallow it will make an important contribution in this respect. In Europe, also, although resources for mental health care are more abundant, evaluation remains important. The tremendous investments in the field of health in Europe do not seem to bear appropriate results. Satisfaction of the population with services provided is decreasing in spite of achievements in terms of the usual criteria for public health progress - for example, reduced morbidity. There are more and more voices which ask whether the money which is being spent could be spent in even better ways. Criteria such as the satisfaction of the population and of the mental health service providers are being more and mors frequently proposed for evaluation. Evaluation is a systematic way of learning from experience and can be useful in selecting options for the future. Decision-makers in. countries can use results of evaluation in making rational decisions about the way in which resources are spent. Unfortunately, it often happens that the results of evaluation are available when the decison-makers who are to use them are not in a position to use them, and vice-versa - there are no up-to-date results when the decision-makers need them. Evaluation must therefore be a continuous process. This costs money and calls for commitment on the part of all concerned. It also raises the question of who should carry out the evaluation. ",
        "Nobody likes to be evaluated and evaluation by someone from \"the outside\" immediately brings into action mechanisms of defense developed to enaole institutions to present a positive rather than a true picture of their work to the world. Yet, objective evaluation is important and ways have to be found to do it. It should not, however, prevent evaluation by those who do the work. When people undertake evaluation of their own work and look back at their own activities, the manner of doing things often improves. A simple questionnaire sent to a hospital can change the traditional practices because people start asking themselves how things are done and why. This process is useful and effective. Therefore, I am arguing for both types of evaluation - that is an objective evaluation by someone not involved in the activities which are being evaluated and an evaluation by the people who do the work themselves. Both types will have to use the same sources of information - including opinions of the community, patients, their families and of other participants in the process of providing health care : OU\u00cf the interpretation and use of this information may be very different. Evaluation can thus produce results for the decison-makers and change people's work practices, attitudes and behaviour) but in order to carry out evaluation, much has to be done beforehand. The technology that we have for the measurement of change and for the quantification of objectives is poor. There is.very little understanding among scientists working in the field and little common language between decision-makers and those working in institutions. There are no well-developed mechanisms to ensure dialogue of health services with consumers of care an communities. Many of the activities listed and much of the other work that needs to be done requires that people get together, talk to each other, exchange experiences, create new alliances, and later on, continue helping each other and working together. I see this meeting as a crucial step in this direction of achieving collaboration which is of such Importance in this field. ",

        "-13- ASSESSMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS - THE AIMS OF THE SEMINAR E. ALFRED SAND, BRUSSELS The need for assessment of medical treatment is becoming increasingly clear. Dr N. Sartorius quite rightly points out that clinicians (including doctors and non-medical staff), healjth administrators and indeed anyone responsible for dispensing or organizing medical treatment should automatically assess any action taken. It is not easy to define assessment , which in practice involes a number of procedures. For planning purposes, to find out what effects a programme of work Is having, it is useful to make an assessment at the end [or during] the programme. PROBLEM A OBJECTIVES ASSFSSMENT LV PROGRAMME In other wprds, the extend to which a programme has achieved its objectives, for example,, can be established through assessment. At the second CEC Seminar CIspra, 1979), Rumeau-Rouquette and Br\u00e9art drew attention to definitions proposed by the W.H.O. in 1971, the main indicators for assessment being : efficacy, effectiveness, and efficiency. ",
        "-14- Efficacy : benefit or utility, to the individual or the service, treatment, regimen, drug, preventive or control measure advocated or applied tW.H.O., Technical Report. 472,1971. Statistical indicators for the planning and evaluation of public health programme). Effectiveness : the effect cf the activity and the end results, outcomes or benefits for the population achieved in relation to the stated objectives (same reference). Efficiency : the effects or end results achieved in relation to the effort expended in terms of money, resources and time (same reference). 2, The organization of medical treatment In general and of the treatment of mental health in particular seems to have been developing rapidly in the past few years. Emphasis has been given for example, to the idea of 'sectors' of mental health, and to services outside the hospital system (France, United States, Belgium) ; in a number of countries, such as Italy, this is particularly striking (R. Misiti, see below). This development must be seen in a broader context : - there is a constant decrease (proportionally) in the resources available while expenditure on health is, for various reasons, on the increase. - rational planning is becoming morB common in health services. This applies to all levels of health policy, from primary and secondary preventive medicine and services primarily concerned with healing (primary treatment, hospitals) to rehabilitation. - important decisions about health policy are taken without assessment and often without contact with the surveyors of treatment. - there is a marked tendency for patients to be treated by specialized or multi-disciplinary teams (group practices, clinics, health centres, co-ordinated networks, psychiatric sectors). - a change has taken place in the psycho-social relationship between the patients and the healers. An example of this is the way in which communities help themselves and g-roups of people take on responsibilities (health, education, self-help)\u03b9 likewise, health teams Involve the population of an area in dealing with the local health problems (W.H.O., Newell, 1975). - because of the above factors, existing services need to be reorganized and new services created to meet the present day needs of population groups. In most cases, however, any initiative usually leads in the short run to increased expenditure, whereas the benefits may not be felt for a long time. ",
        "-15- 3. Research into the assessment of medical treatment has been going on for sone years both in Europe and in the United States (Armitage, 1977; Bergenstam. 1977; Holland and K-arhausen, 1978; W.H.O., 1980). Where mental health Is concerned, priority is being given to deinstitutionalization policies (Rose and al.. 1979; Cartel and all., 1973). Mental health assessment has its own problems. The epidemiological psychiatrist, for example, encounters a number of stumbling-blocks when he tries to define clinical categories : . disagreement among specialists about the meaning to be attached to classifications of mental disorders, and even to diagnoses. Certain schooi s tend to avoid sticking diagnostic 'tags' on mental patients. . the difficulty of getting together a series of comparable subjects in order to make comparisons between experimental and control groups. . the need for extended follow-up observations from which conclusions cannot be drawn for many years. . passible disagreement on the criteria to be used to judge the results and to decide whether a patient has been 'cured'. Research into mental health policies also has its limitations, of a methodological nature. Here the aim should be, as far as possible, to compara different health policies applied to papulations with similar cultural, demographic and other characteristics. Another point is that the innovatory effect of action In the field of health, for both individuals and groups, may have certain consequences, quite aside from the actual features of the action (Hawthorn effect). Furthermore, in studying a psychiatric sector, for example, one should not forget the profound effects of a change in the nature af the relationship between patients and therapists. In the course cf the research into psychiatric sectors that we are at present conducting in Belgium, we have found that this paint is stressed by centre directors. What is new and important is their work involves not only new psychiatric, social and therapeutic techniques, but also a considerable change in the attitudes of the staff to the patients. Now, it is clearly very difficult indeed to assess the attitudes of doctors and other medical staff. Moreover, it has been found, in connection with general practice that the physician's attitude often decisively influences the effectiveness of the treatment given. ",
        "-16- The research teams are sometimes faced with certain ethical problems despite the high quality of the demarcation classifications normally used. 4. Luckily, in the face of these difficulties, we have new methods to hand. The systemic approach to analysis , for example, enables one to treat the patients and the therapy team in their relationships as a whole rather than as separate units. In a broader context, the mental health system can similarly be treated in its social or economic framework, etc. (W.H.O., 1976; Greenblatt, 1978). Sociological research, also can provide qualitative information on various social facts, such as the relationship between a therapeutic system and its patients (Sills, 1968). And one may mention the advantages of recent advances in connection with the statistical processing of data. Many 'multivariate' analysis methods from factor analysis to path analysis (J\u00f6resky, 1977 and 1978; Bentler, 19B0) or 'correspondence' analysis (Benz\u00e9cri, 1973) are available. 5. The aims of this seminar can therefore be set out as follows : - to create the right conditions for a dialogue between the representatives of all the categories of persons responsible for mental health : psychiatrists and clinical psychologists (within and outside the hospital system), regional and national policy - makers, epidemiologists, sociologists, economists. - to make known and distribute the methods and results of high-level work done by teams in all the Community countries. - to give all participants an opportunity to discuss probl\u00e8me, including the various ways in which their work is being hampered, and consider possible solutions. - to encourage action on these problems which may be proposed as a result of contact between participants from the various countries during the meeting. The three days of the seminar form an Indivisible whole. The papers - which will be brief - are to serve as a basis for the discussions or group work to take place tomorrow afternoon and Friday morning. The organizers hope that once we have heard the introductory papers, discussion will be continuous and will also go on between the sessions. ",

WING, LONDON AIMS OF PLANNERS AND EVALUATORS Planning consists of anticipating the problems that arc likely to arise when trying to achieve a given aim, such as an innovation in or modification to the pattern of services. (\u00b0) In planning socicmedical services, the aim is to decrease or contain morbidity in the population and to decrease mortality as far as possible. The problems are likely to be complex, varied, conti nuously arising, and often unexpected, so that the organisational framework for dealing with them must be both stable and flexible. The more systematic and informed the anticipation, the more effective the decisions are likely to be. Certair principles are coming to be accepted as fundamental to good service provision. . Responsibility Service authorities should accept responsibility for the whole of a defined gecgraphical district. Services should be accessible from all parts of the area and usually be situated within it, though there must be reasonable freedom of choice. 2. Comprehensiveness Services should be comprehensive and varied enough to allow for the treatment, care and counselling of all those in need. Staff should be well-trained and have sufficient time and continuity to devote to their clients. 3. Integration The various units making up the service should be sufficiently integrated to ensure that tnere are no delays when a patient (or client) needs to move from one to another ano there should be no sudden charges in the level of social oerformance demanded. Communications should be free so !\u00b0) Primary prevention will not be considered here. It deserves a pacer in its own right. ",
        "-23- that staff in each part of the service know what is available elsewhere and can readily take over when a client is transferred. The aims of service evaluation, in the last resort, are much the same as those of planning, i.e. to ensure that service planners nave the most relevant information available to ensure that they can make the best decisions. However, the attitudes of evaluators are scientific rather than acministrative and their role is quite different to that of planners. The relationship between the two is part of the larger matter of \"science and government\". Causes of social disablement Social disablement is recognised in different forms in different societies, according to the degree to which an individual is unable tc maintain the level of social (particularly role) performance which is generally expected within each society; by relatives, \"important others\", and the individual concerned. This paper deals chiefly with severe disablement, which is likely to be recognised in most societies, particularly in the industrialised countries of Western Europe. Social disablement has three main types of cause : (i) disease and impairment (il) social disadvantage, (iii) adverse personal reactions. Brie- examples of each will be given. (1) Disease_and_impalrment In schizophrenia, for example, there are acute episodes of disorder which are severely disabling while they last. Even when the patient recovers completely from an acute attack there is a chance of relapse (which can to some extent be calculated); if the risk is high, this constitutes a definite \"invisible\" impairment (and also a social disadvantage). In addition, there are chronic impairments, such as slowness, underactivity, poor verbal and non-verbal language skills, and \"though disorder\" . The clinical severity of all these impairments can be measured in terms of symptoms and behaviour rating scales (Wing and Brown, 1970; Wing, Cooper and Sartorius, 1S74). Epidemiological and follow-up studies have established the frequency of the conuition in various populations and the likelihood of chronic impairments supervening Orown et al., 1965; W.H.O., 1979). The chronicity of the condition means that there is a high use of services (Wing, \"975\u00ef. ",
        "-24- At the opposite end of the spectrum, copulation surveys demonstrate a substantial proportion of people who have \"minor neurotic disorders\" (Shepherd et al., 1956). Particularly at risk are women with young children (Hare and Shaw, 1965) and those exposed to unsatisfactory living conditons (Brown and Harris, 1978; Srole et al., 1962). Standard techniques of measuring symptom severity and defining a \"case\" have been developed (Wing et al., 1978) and applied in different cultural conditions (Orley and Wing. 1979). There are many other kinds of clinically identifiable disorders and impairments, including severe dementia and mental retardation, acute and sub-acute delirium, manic depressive psychoses, paranoid psychoses, crippling neuroses, etc. In each case, measuring instruments have been constructed to assess clinical severity and course and basic epidemiological data are available for many countries. It is important to remember that physical disabilities often co-exist with mental impairment. (ii) Social_disadvantage We are not here concerned with social disadvantage as the sole cause of social disablement (as when ethnic prejudice, for example, leads to a restriction of employment opportunities) but as a factor predisposing to disease and impairment, or amplifying their contribution to social disablement. Typical examples are poverty, deprivation, lack of vocational or social skills, social isolation, and prejudice or ignorance (in general public, employers, relatives, staff). Some of these factors are quite difficult to measure but some are relatively easy. The social isolation of the area in which patients are living can be estimated, for example, from census data such as the frequency of \"single-person-dwellings\", lodging houses and hotels, the amount of dally movement Into or out of the area, length of residence in the area, and frequency of stable marriages (Sainsbury, 1955). Social Isolation affecting an individual can be measured in more detail by con\u00e4rjctirg a time-budget showing the number of social contacts made within a given time-period, although this may , of course, be affected by the severity of any impairments present. ",
        "-25- (iii) Adverse gersonal reactions Adverses reactions to disease, disability and disadvantage can take many forms. The most obvious is distress which, when it takes the form of chronic \"neurotic\" symptoms (depression, worrying, muscular tension, anxiety, irritability), can itself be disabling. Another reaction is loss of confidence and lowered self-esteem and morale (Wing, 1966) , so that the individual is not motivated to try to achieve standards of performance that are actually within his competence. Another, more subtle, problem is the development of dependence on some form of protection or shelter that shields the disabled person from having to make an effort to become more independent. The most famous example of this dependence is \"institutionalism\", which can be approximately measured (Wing anc Brown, 1970), but there are many other forms. Many of these adverse reactions depend upon a stigmatising reaction of \"important others\" to the disabled person, who sees himself reflected in their eyes. Measuring social disablement Social disablement is a complex concept since it contains elements of disease, disability, disadvantage, dependence, demoralisation and distress. It Is a mistake to suppose that it can be measured simply by using administrative indices, such as length of stay in hospital. (The use of such indices can lead to incorrect assumptions; for example, that early discharge Is equivalent to reduction of social disablement, whereas it might actually lead to an increase). Another mistake is to assume that a diagnosis (e.g. of schizophrenia or mental retardation or dementia) can be used as more than an indicator of approximate risk. A long-term study of schizophrenic patients before the days of the phenothiazines showed that 35 % had a good social outcome (Mayer-Cross, 1932) and the social prognosis had improved since then. Some severely mentally retarded people, e.g. those with Down's syndrome, have social and language skills consonant with their general intellectual ability, others with the same \"intelligence quotient\" have serious social and language deficits and are far more socially disabled (Wing and Gould, 1979). Social disadvantage, by itself, is not an index of social disablement, \"lany people with a severely disadvantaged background never become disabled. It is the combination of disease, disability, disadvantage and adverse reactions such as dependence or demoralisation that is most likely to be accompanied by severe social disablement. Measurement has to be nade ",
        "-26- directly in terms of a decreased performance of social roles. Several instruments are available including one under development by the World Health Organisation. An example of a policy problem ; the \"new\" long-stay By way of illustration, we can take a particularly important policy problem now facing administrators all over the Western world. It is generally agreed that there snould be a movement away from long-term care of psychiatrically disabled people in large institutions such as hospitals towards care (if needed) in small domestic-scale environments \"in the community\". This principle was explicitly adopted in the U.K. more than twenty years ago but it is clear that seme people, even among those who were admitted to hospital during recent times, still become \"long-stay\" (e.g. stay in hospital for more than one but less than -lve years). Why is this and what can be done about it ? The first approach is to discover the size of the problem and the nature of the difficulties encountered by the people concerned. The size of the group can be estimated from national statistics because data are collected routinely about all patients admitted to anc discharged from English psychiatric hospitals. (The system is known as the Mental Health Enquiry). Table 1 shows the trends between 1966 and 1976 for three groups : the short-stay, new long-stay, and old long-stay (OHSS, 1979). The short- stay group appears to be stabilising at about 60 beds per 100,000 and the new long-stay at about 40 per 100,000. The old long-stay group Is still declining and it is not obvious from the figures when a balance will be achieved, at which the decline (now mainly due to deaths rather than discharges) will be equal to recruits from the new long-stay group.

It was found that 44 % had been given a diagnosis of schizophrenia, 16 % manic-depressive psychosis, 14 \\ pre-senile dementia. 7 % personality disorders and 19 '-. multiple problems, including mental retardation, physical disabilities, epilepsy, blindness, deafness and alcoholism. Each of these groups has a varied and complex set of impairments, mostly of severe degree. In addition to their Impairments, there was a characteristic pattern of social disadvantage. In general, they were socially isolated, unmarried, out of touch or at odds with their families or friends, and had few occupational or social skills. Asked about the future, only 29 \\ has a definite wish to leave hospital. This \"institutionalism\" had developed much more quickly than in the old long-stay group (Wing and Brown, 1S70) and was not, therefore, due simply to being cut off from the outside world, but to a reaction to impairments and disadvantages. Doctors, nurses and social workers were asked what provision needed to be made for the patients in the sample. About one-third were thought to need further hospital treatment or care, with the possibility of eventual discharge. This group included people on cumpulsory orders, those with severely distrubed behaviour and those with florid psychotic symptoms that ",
        "-28- had not responded to treatment. A second group (22 \"i) needed a degree of supervision, because of a tendency to self-neglect, wandering, inactivity, or failure to maintain medication. Such people are too disabled to be accepted by most \"community hostels\" and day centres (Wing and Olsen, 1973). A third group (15 %i were ready for discharge to less supervised accommodation,such as group homes. This was a less disabled group than the first two and there was a less marked history of social disadvantage. Unfortunately, alternative accommodation was usually not available. Finally, there was a group of people with multiple disabilities (25 ';) who could have been transferred to more appropriate accommodation, e.g. for the mentally retarded, or blind, etc.. if it had been available. This study gives a broad picture of the problems of the group. The' question of the forms of help needed and the services required to provide them will be considered later. Dealing with the causes of disablement Methods of helping people who have the kinds of problem defined above include secondary and tertiary prevention : treatment, rehabilitation, counselling, education, training, sheltering, nursing, behaviour modification, management. Methods of compensating for impairment and improving the quality of life in general should also be considered here. Research is directed at determining which methods are most effective, acceptable and econcmic. The methods of overcoming social disablement are basically to reduce impairment and disadvantage as far as possible and to demonstrate the results to the patient or client. Many impairments are chronic but show very slow improvement over a long time, while others are irremediable. Adopting an aim of full independence is sometimes unrealistic and causes disillusionment to staff, relatives and patients, because it results in \"failure\". A more sensi ble policy is to provide a wide range of options so that patients can make as much progress as they can and then find an environment in which they can live with as little disadvantage and as high a quality of life as possible. Such an outcome, even if not full \"resettlement\", should be regarded as success, not failure. Self-help and self-understanding is an important part of this process (Wing and Olsen, 1978). A wide range of techniques and methods of measurement is available. Effectiveness must be measured in terms of decrease in or containment of factors causirg disablement. Acceptability is measured by quantifying attitudes of patients, relatives and staff. It is important to remember that an attitude of satisfaction means very little unless the informants have been given a realistic choice between different types of help, or between help and ",
        "-29- no help. The type of help provided can also be measured, e.g. direct social stimulation by nurses (Wing and Freudenberg, 1961); amount of time that a patient does nothing (Wing and Brown, 1970); observation of activities in a rehabilitation workshop (Wing, 1960; Wing. Bennett and Denham. 1964); assessment of the number and types of problems in patients that nurses . actually deal with (Acker. Wykes and Wing, 1979); whether patients actually take their medication (Leff and Wing, 1971); the attitudes and behaviour of relatives towards patients (Vaughn and Leff, 1975) and the methods they use to cope with difficult behaviour (Creer and Wing. 1974). Evaluation of services Knowledge concerning patients' problems (level 1) and the most effective methods of relieving them (level 2) provides the best foundation for evaluative research into health and social services. Research is then concentrated on discovering the most efficient, acceptable and economic way of identifying people with problems and assessing their needs for treatment or care, training staff (or relatives, self-help groups, etc.), working out optimum staff-patient ratios, investigating administrative and management problems, and developing a network of services that will be responsible, comprehensive and integrated (Wing and Hefner, 1973). It is useful to use locally collected statistics in order tc describe the service units available and the contacts patients or clients make with them. Case-registers are useful for this purpose, since they can also monitor trends over time (Wing and Fryers, 1976; Wing and Halley. 1972). A grid of services can be constructed along the line suggested by Or. D. Early. This involves details of all the work (daytime) environments (including hospital, employment agencies, local authority, voluntary organisations and open industry) along one axis, and all the various types of residential accommoda tion along the other. The cells in this grid should provide a very wide range of options, from sheltered communities to complete independence, and it can be seen at a glance where the gaps are. A third axis is provided by facilities available for helping people during \"asocial\" hours; in the evenings, at night and at weekends. This not only involves crisis help and support to relatives but also leisure provision; lunch clubs, social clubs, outings, evening classes, and other activities for people who would otherwise lead very empty lives. ",
        "-30- It is not possible to summarise all the methods of evaluating such services (see Wing and Hailey, 1972, for a range of studies) and an assessment of an innovative service for new long-stay patients will be used by way of illustrating what can be done. A hcspital-hostel for the new long-stay It was mentioned earlier that a substantial group of patients is still accumulating in hospital in spite of all the efforts being made to prevent this. As a result of those researches it was suggested (Wing and Hailey, 1972) that many of the patients were too severely disabled to be accepted in most varieties of alternative accommodation and that hospitals sited within their own catchment arBas should be given the responsibility to set up hostels of their own. These would be sited in houses on the edge of the hospital grounds, with the front door opening on to a public road but the back door opening on to the private hospital grounds. Staffing would be at hospital levels. Daytime occupation and rehabilitation activities would take place elsewhere, in local day hospitals, day centres, etc. The first such \"hospital-hostel\" was set up at the Maudsley hospital in the autumn of 1377. All patients under 65 years of age who had become long-stay (over one year in hospital) since 31 December 1970 were eligible for transfer and all these patients have been regularly followed-up since. Any further patients who stay as long as a year in hospital are assessed as soon as they reach this point. Evaluation of the hostel has taken the form of ; a) assessing patients at regular intervals to determine their impairments, disadvantages and personal reactions, and how these change over time; b) describing the daily routine of patients in the hostel and outside it, including the methods used by nurses and occupational therapists to minimise the problems they regard as most amenable to help; c) monitoring transfers back to hospital wards, admissions, discharges, the social life of the hostel, uss of amenities, visits by relatives, etc. Eligible patients not transferred to the hostel are also being assessed and followed up in the same way. Two other hospital-hostels are planned In districts covered by a case- register, so that comparisons can be made. Studies are also being made of clients who become \"new long-stay\" In alternative day and residential accommodation, such as hostels, group homes, day hospitals and day centres. The information gathered in this way will be of assistance in planning the future development of both the health and the social services. ",
        "-31- TECHNIOUES OF MONITORING National and regional statistics A national or regional statistical system is of prime importance in monitoring trends in the hospital population. It is not feasible to collect detailed information about all those who contact health and social services. A minimal data base includes all admissions to and separations from psychiatric hospitals, with identifying data (name, address and date of birth), sex. type of admission, number of previous admissions and diagnosis. Diagnosis may appear to be an unreliable indicator but differences In first admission rates between different countries can lead to useful studies of clinical practice, as in the case of the USA-UK Diagnostic Project (Cooper et al., 1972). Ideally, there should be a computer facility for linking the records of individual patients so that cohort studies can be carried out. Strict precautions must be taken in order to preserva confidentiality and prevent the identity of patients becoming known to unauthorised people (Baldwin. Leff and Wing, 1976). The data in Table 1 were obtained from the English \"Mental Health Enquiry\", which has been running for ovsr 30 years. There has not been a single complaint of breach of confidentiality during this time. Local case-reglstsrs Smaller psychiatric case-registers, sat up under local medical control, can collect more data from more types of health and social services. There are seven such registers In England (Camberwell, Cardiff, Nottingham, Oxford. Salford, Southampton and Worcester), two in Scotland (Aberdeen and Edinburgh), and others In Aarhus, Dublin, Groningen, Hawaii, Mannheim and Rochester, N.Y. The English registers collect data according to a standard pattern and the first comparative statistics are now being produced. Services covered usually include in-patients, day-patients, out-patients, domiciliary visits, psychiatric examination carried out on general medical and surgical wards, and clients in hospitals and group homes. Some registers include contacts with psychiatric social workers. Several registers cover services -or the mentally retarded. The advantages of registers are : a) that they record all the contacts made by people from a defined geographical area, thus allowing rates to be calculated per unit population and compared according to census indices; ",
        "-32- b) that double counting is avoided; c) that follow-up studies can be carried out, tracing the path of patients through the various agencies over time. In addition to these monitoring functions (particularly important if innovations are introduced), registers act as a sampling frame for more intensive studies. Finally, it is possible to carry out sample survBys of groups (including samples of the general population) that are not represen ted on the register. It is not necessary or feasible for each local district to set up a register but each region of 3-5 million inhabitants can usefully maintain a register in order to monitor, evaluate and plan services with maximum efficiency. RELATION BETWEEN EVALUATION AND PLANNING At a national or regional level it is necessary for those who are responsible for planning and administering the health and social services to mest regularly with representatives of the professionals who run them and with scientific advisers who understand the constraints imposed by evaluative research. Such a group has two Important objectives. The first is to define policy problems which can be illuminated by the collection of pertinent data or mounting specific research projects. The second is to bring the results of research projects to bear on policy problems as they arise. The Department of Health and Social Security has appointed a Chief Scientist with responsibility for promoting these objectives in England and Wales. At the local level, each district also needs a committee where administra tors and clinicians can consider the priorities to be attached to innovations in the local services. In this way, services can gradually develop in ways that match more and more closely the needs of disabled people and their families. ",

        "-36- SCREENING FOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER IN ELDERLY PERSONS RESIDENT IN THE COMMUNITY : A SEARCH FOR MANIFEST DISEASE K. BERGMANN MD., LONDON. Psychiatric disorder in elderly persons too often presents as a crisis in which ad hoc responses are the rule and no element of planning is manifest. Under such circumstances, there is little opportunity for developing a preventative approach. In discussion prevention with elderly people it is not yet possible to consider primary prevention, but only secondary or tertiary prevention. Manifest psychiatric disorder has been demonstrated in many community studies and agreement as to the prevalence of various types is fairly good (1). About 5 H of all people over 65 years have an organic dementing disorder, 5 '-. some mile or borderline condition suggestive of organic cerebral involve ment, 2 % severe depressive or persecutory disorders and 12 \\ have neurosis or personality disorders of at least moderate severity, though only 5 \\ of the sample could be estimated to have a disorder of sufficient severity to merit treatment as \"clinical case\" (2,3). However, though the majority of elderly people have good mental health, there is about six times as many people with serious mental impairment in the community as there are in institutions. Such morbidity has considerable effects. The mortality of subjects with dementia was significantly higher (4), dragging with it a greater demand for care in the predeath period, and creating a pressure on caring families and also on institutions, since in England the majority of deaths now take place in hospitals. Institutional care of a more extended type is also required with much greater frequency by demented subjects than by normal elderly people, even when these are matched with the dementia group for age and sex (5). In fact, it could be demonstrated that the diagnosis of dementia alone could predict admission to some sort of care in 60 % of cases. During the follow-up period functional psychiatric disorder showed the above effects to a lesser extent, but in other studies (S) the evidence points to the excess provision of domiciliary services to this group, where in the first Instance treatment of an affective disorder might have been more appropriately instituted. If it can be accepted that the viability of the elderly in the community is very substantially threatened by organic and functional psychiatric illnesses the next question to be asked is : how much of this type of disability is known to those who are responsible for the basic care of the ",
        "-37- elderly ? In Britain this responsibility rests with the general practitioner and his team. The studies in which the relationships between psychiatric disorder, ageing and rBcognition and rsfsrral for cars are examined indicate the following situation ; with increasing age neurosis and affective disorders are no longer referred to hospital outpatient clinics, new cases of conspicuous morbidity are not recognized in general practice, even where such cases are seen, specifically psychiatric treatment is less likely.to be given (8), about 70 '-. of depressions and 80 \u0390 of dementias are unknown to their general practitioners (9), and even when they are encouraged to refer such patients their recognition of potential referrals is very limited (10), but, nevertheless, the community contains a large reservoir of unfulfilled need for services such as out-patient care, home visiting, day hospital and day centre care (11). Why does this situation exist ? There can be no single or simple answer. Among the more Important factors must be the loss of role function in the elderly which reduces the pressure on them to seek treatment for psychiatric disorders, the stereotype that elderly people must expect to suffer memory loss, depression and anxiety because they are part of normal ageing, the fact that there is a shortage of acceptable facilities to meet their needs, and that the pattern of care in general practice is based on patients reporting their problems to the general practitioners. It may be that there is a need for a different approach to the mental health care of the elderly, and that a preventive and community orientated element will be an important component. We can already identify vulnerable sub-groups of the community resident population; the recently bereaved, those recently discharged from hospital, those living alone and over 75 years of age, those applying for social support without gross evidence of severe physical disability and those who have just moved into the home of a younger relative. These groups are associated with a high risk of psychiatric illness In old age. In Britain today, there are many professional workers in contact with elderly people living in the community. These include health visitors, district nurses, social workers and Increasingly committed voluntary workers. They all have contact with older people in the at risk groups, but are frequently not aware of the existence of psychiatric disorder, and are not, at present, able to identify potential cases. ",
        "-38- The need for a screening instrument is therefore indicated and It is suggested that it should confirm to the following criteria : 1. It should be capable of being applied by psychiatrically untrained staff who already work in a caring role with the elderly. 2. It should be acceptable to the 80 \u0390 of the elderly who do not have any appreciable psychiatric disorder. 3. It should be modelled on the diagnostic decision making process. 4. The psychiatric \"illness\" detected should correspond in severity the the kind of illness for which medical assessment and management would be considered appropriate. 5. There should be a built in \"teaching\" element. In most screening instruments a high level of sensitivity is more important than specificity, (12) but in this situation with an overwhelming number of normal elderly people, who would be extremely upset and shocked if they were to be investigated for psychological deficits or affective disorders, and where the majority of their morbidity is undetected, the opposite may be more appropriate. A feasibility study was initially carried out, to see whether the use of mathematically derived cut-off points could usefully be employed to separate diagncstlc groups. Fortunately this proved to be the case (13). A full field study was then carried out employing 70 psychiatric patients attending a day hospital and 103 community resident subjects randomly selected from a general practice age/sex register. All subjects were seen independently by a non-medical field worker, without formal mental health training, but with experience in working with the elderly, and a research psychiatrist. The former using an adapted version of the screening questionnaire and the latter a semi-structured psychiatric interview schedule(14). The diagnostic groups consisted of 81 normal subjects, 33 with functional psychiatric disorder and 59 with dementia. A good measure of agreement was reached between the screening instrument and the psychiatrist's diagnosis and the instrument's inter-rater reliability between two field workers was satisfactory (Kappa : 0.81 & 0.93 respectively). Replication in an independent sample was made more stringent by matching psychiatrilly ill subjects with normal controls for age and sex. The replication sample consisted entirely of an independent practice sample, randomly selected, comprising 85 normal, 17 functional and 14 organic subjects. Agreement figures were still highly significant, but less so than in the previous study (Kappa : 0.51). For the organic group the sensitivity ",
        "-39- was 92.9 '-. and the specificity 38.8 H. However, overall the sensitivity was only 72.5 %t though the specificity was 30.6 '-.. It would appear that the screening instrument picked up too many false positives for functional disorder, who would therefore require a second stage assessment. Selected vulnerable populations can be screened for manifest psychiatric illness. Apart from the obvious advantages of treating affective disorders there are possibilities for treating the dementias. Handicap in 'the latter group is not only derived from the results of irreversible brain damage, but also from social stress, physical ill-health, symptomatic psychosis, and neurosis, and the effects of neglect and isolation. There are therefore many potentially reversible deficits even in organic psychiatric disorders, and trials of early intervention and treatment are long overdue. The possibility of rational therapy for some dementias also appears to be on the horizon, but the advanced cases in institutions are unlikely to yield significant results. Finally, nosology and classification are unlikely to advance much further until we identify and follow up early cases.

        "-44- HIGH-RISK FAMILIES AND THEIR NEEDS FRANZ BARO INTRODUCTION As a result of examining and following a large population of Huntington's chorea sufferers, the author is continuously faced with the problem of high-risk families. These families are involved with many medical and social services at the same time. Their consumption of services is very high but their benefit seems rather small. Mostly, their problems are tackled in a fragmentary way. In order to illustrate the human, social and economical Importance of this phenomenon, where, from the viewpoint of mental health and in very distinct and specific problem areas, all family members are at high risk, a few examples are given, with a closer look at the Sheffield study on \"Families without hope\". FAMILIES WITH HUNTINGTON'S CHOREA In Belgium about 1.000 people currently suffer of the symptoms of Huntington's chorea. A progressive and ultimately fatal disorder of the central nervous system, Huntington's chorea is in all probability transmitted from generation to generation by an as yet unidentified single autosomal dominant gene. This means that there is a 50 per cent chance for the child of a 'carrier' parent to bear the disorder. Both sexes are equally affected. The prevalence of manifest Huntington's chorea ranges, in European countries at least, between 4 and 7 per 100.000 total population. In Belgium, about 5.000 people stand a one to two or one to four chance of developing the condition in later years, the average age of onset being Professor at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium). Medical Director of the University Psychiatric Hospital St-Kamlllus Krijkelberg 1, 3043 Bierbeek. ",
        "-45- roughly 4D. For those who are experisncing its distressing physical and psychological effects (which are characterized by involuntary 'choreic' movements and progressive mental deterioration), for those living in the shadow of being at high risk of becoming Huntington's chorea's victim and for their relatives by marriage the burden is potentially devastating. In Belgium, in all approaches 10.000 individuals are involved. Not all the individuals who display its physical symptoms will undergo mental distress (BRUYN e.a., 1974), but many do so, some even before any form of chorea is observable. In the early stages the psychiatric sequelae of the disease range from schizophreniform syndromes on the one hand to personality changes on the other. The latter may take the form of 'moody' obstinate behaviour, perhaps punctuated with periods of illogical anger and even violence. Cases of Irrational Jealousy, paranoia and sexual disinhibition have also been commonly reported, whilst suicide rates In choreic families in America are seven times that nation's average (Summary Report of the American Commission for the Control of Huntington's Disease and its Consequences, 1977). Ultimately a state of profound dementia may occur, especially in early onset cases. The reasons for these linked psychological and behavioural effects are likely to involve both endogenous pathological and exogenous social and allied factors. The impact of symptomatic chorea, coming as it normally does in middle life when an individual's career and his or her relationships with the children he or she may have are at an especially important stage, is often dramatic. For example, a study (DEWHURST et al., 1970) indicated that significant proportions of choreics attempted suicide (10 per cent), mutilated themselves (13 per cent), became alcoholic (19 per cent) and/or became involved in legal proceedings (18 per cent). Charges included assault and cruelty to children. About a third had suffered a broken marriage and raised rates of illigitimacy and aberrant sexual behaviour were suggested. Even today in Belgium, despite the provisions of the 'welfare state\", they frequently face hardships at simply a material level. The mental changes the condition can directly or indirectly cause can exacerbate such disadvantages, very probably creating 'cycles of deprivation' across the generations which have their basis in social as well as genetic inheritance. Moreover, in many instances the quality of medical and social services for these families appears inadequate, not at least because of poor coordi nation of national and local authority and service provisions. ",
        "-46- From our own experience, one fundamental suggestion for improving the situation is that, in localities with known concentrations of cases, specialist social workers and/or nurses with a particular knowledge of Huntington's chorea could be employed. Ideally they might liaise with education, health care, and social support providers, to create a more integrated and effective service capable of helping all family members through difficult life phases. Ideally also, these efforts have to be coupled with the self-help of those families affected by the condition, not at least in the field of primary prevention. As well in Belgium, as In some other countries, this setting hasiactually been made operational and is object of constant evaluation. FAMILIES WITHOUT HOPE Another example of high-risk families, distinct from the former, is the Sheffield project described by Tange, James and Hillam (1975). This project was designed to evaluate the contribution of psychiatric pathology in problem families and. to distinguish its effects from those of socio economic pressures an the social (mal)adjustment of these families. Problem families were defined as those which were currently involved with a large number of medical and social agencies. After the exclusion of fatherless and immigrant families, a total of 33 families were identified. For each problem family a comparison family was selected, matched for site of residence and age of wife; none of the comparison families were involved with more than one social agency. The prevalence of the following problems was found to be significantly increased in the problem families : 1. the physique and health of the parente More miscarriages, often associated with a large number of pregnancies and with poorer health of the pregnant wifes. 2. the mental health and personality of the parenta More psychiatric illness, especially neurosis in women. More personality disorder, especially in the men who have had fathers in the lowest socio-economic group, come from the largest families and experienced a separation from their fathers during childhood. ",
        "-47- 3. intelligence teets of parents and children Lower test intelligence (although seldom frank mental handicap) 4. the social and developmental characteristics of the children More children, also before marriage. More attendance of special schools. Higher child mortality rate. More difficulties in discipline and toilet training. More temper tantrums. 5. the health and personality of the children Lower weight, often associated with smaller parents, more chronic ill health and extreme poverty. Very high prevalence of psychiatric disorder (30 per cent), associated with personality disorder and also physical illness in the father; a high score by the mother on a symptom inventory; separation from parents in early life; marital disharmony of the parents. S. poverty, unemployment and debt More poverty, often associated with psychiatric illness in men. long-standing absence from work and low earnings. More debt, often associated with poverty and personality disorder in the wife. 7. criminal behaviour Much higher rate of offending for the men. Much more adult recidivism, associated with personality disorder in men. Much higher rate for criminal convictions in the children over 1B years. 8. family disorganisation More gross marital disharmony, more dirty and uncared homes, and insufficient attention for the children, all closely associated with personality disorders in one or both parents. 9. problem families and the community More isolation from the neighbours and smaller part in social organisation, both associated, in the case of the wives, with being unhappy married or to having delinquent children or, in the case of the men, with the experience of having undergone a prison sentence or had psychiatric treatment. The wife usually are very ready to seek help of the local doctor or social worker; the husbands are hostile or indifferent to help; both, husbands and wives, are suspicious of education and schools. ",
        "\u00ad48\u00ad Discussion : The high rate of personality disorders in men and of neurosis in women are the outstanding psychiatric findings. The illness of the wives nay be a response to their husbands' disorder, suspected to be primary. The most serious damage shown by the children is without question their high rate of psychiatric disorders; the high child mortality rate is also very important. There is a general agreement in the literature that children with a psychotic parent fare better than might be expected. It appears that \u25a0 psychotic mothers can often continue to cope with their children but difficulties occur if both parents are affected by mental illness. The position is more gloomy for the children of parents with neurosis or certain disorders of personality (RUTTER, 1966). Different assumptions underlie different ways of understanding high risk families : (1) inherited deficits of intelligence and character (2) emotional pathology, due to psychosocial deprivation (3) conflict between the families and the local community (4) a well\u00addefined subculture, 'the culture of poverty' (high risk ?) (5) retreat as an outcome of a situation of despair (6) habitual neglect of children (7) fragmentation of services It is easy to read the drive of the reformer between the lines. The earlier writers, who thought that inherited deficits of Intelligence and character were the most important cause, were preoccupied by eugenic consi\u00ad derations of birth control and sterilization. To what extent is personality disorder inborn or the product of disastrous early life ? No clear answer can be returned. Reasonably one must suppose that heredity sets a' limit to the potential of everyone, but no one would suggest that the adult members of problem families had reached those limits. Most contemporary writers avoid any discussion of constitutional factors, perhaps in an attempt to deny the pessimism of the eugenists. On the contrary, they draw attention to the inadequate expectations and performances of the welfare services, or to the effect of unwilled unemployment, or to the societal rejection of these families by their own class. ",
        "-49- Psychiatric pathology however is not a sufficient factor to account \u25a0 for all aspects of social maladjustment in these families. The authors of the Sheffield project assume that a value system is held in common by many problem families with the following characteristics : (1) rules are ignored (2) discomfort is ignored (3) long-term consequences of actions are ignored (4) education is distrusted. Such a way of life expresses living without hope. In this way it is assumed that the more seriously disorganised families have given up even trying to reach the normal standards of society. With a better knowledge of genetics one no longer fears that the reproductive efforts of these families will destroy civilized society, but much attention is paid to child-rearing practices, as one of the most important ways in which a 'culture of high-risk' could be transmitted. These practices may include the actual physical neglect of the infant, but also the lack of restrictions, leading to a complete failure to develop a coherent system of internal controls. Can 'culture of high-risk' be understood as a true subculture, into which participants may be admitted and which will be handed down to the next generation ? Or is it, rather, a style of life forced on families who live perpetually in a crisis of massive deprivation, material hardship, social isolation and emotional damage ? Probably it can be both. In a given family multiple factors all contribute to a particular outcome. Conversely a particular factor may be capable of contributing to a number of possible outcomes. Because of the complexity of these relationships nobody expects the prevention of mental disorder to be simple. But to some Bxtent it is already possible to develop preventive intervention programmes. INTERVENTION PROGRAMMES. The first step is to identify the families who are at high risk. This identification is possible with respect to both primary and secundary prevention. In the caee of primary prevention we must locate families who are exposed to factors known to increase risk. In the case of secundary prevention we must locate families who start showing mental health problems. A systematic list of high risk factors is given in the report of the Council of Europe's working party on the Organization of Preventive Services in Mental Illness (1977). This report subdivides the population at risk ",
        "-50- into four sections : children, adolescents, adults and the aged. It also lists the persons who are in a position to detect risk and the persons who are in a position to intervene to reduce that risk (see Appendix l\u00ec. Granted that we can now identify high risk families and workers who are in a position to help them, what evidence do we have that preventive intervention can work ? Recent research has demonstrated not only the damaging effects upon the young child of parental separation and deprivation, but also the extent to which these effects are reversible given appropriate substitute parenting (RUTTER, 1972). This is only but one impressive example of preventive intervention. The authors of the Sheffield project make the following proposals : (a) adequate methods of contraception (b) casework, especially for the husbands' problems (c) the closest cooperation with the general practitioner, psychiatrist, child guidance centre and schools. CONCLUSION The aim of this paper is not to review the literature on high-risk families (SCHLESINGER, 1963. provides an excellent annotated bilblography), but to stimulate the management of this most important problem. Only an interdisciplinary and engaged approach can comprehend adequately the problems of these families, to which there is no simple cr single solution. ",

        "-58- FAMILIES WITH A HANDICAPPED PERSON AND THEIR NEEDS ANNALISE DUPONT, AARHUS My paper concerns the evaluation of community care. Is it possible to evaluate the community care ? In this Danish investigation performed by a social psychiatric team in Aarhus, we have tried to analyze the problems in connection with the tendency to keep chronically handicapped persons in the community and avoid permanent life at institutions. Goffmann's (1970) criticism of institutional life and Tlzard's (1960,1964) and Lyle's (1959. 1960) proof of a better development of imbecile children in the brooklands residential family units caused parents' organizations and administrators to leave the policy of institutional care and start the community care for mentally handicapped. However, is the community care possible without severe damage to the life of the handicapped family and its individual members ? This paper can confirm what Or. Sartorius said - the evaluation has already changed the mind of the decision-makers and the complete Danish book on this investigation has had an impact upon the life of these families. This investigation rises the problem : is it possible to establish integrated care for the handicapped family with advisory services, day-care institutions, financial and technical support, short-term Institutions (in case of acute illness in the family) etc. so that the movement through the network of social and medical services Is facilitated and there are no gaps or overlaps. The planning of such services is only possible if it is known, how the new staff members, the relatives of the handicapped, are able to cope with the Job in the family and what they need. There is now a tendency to keep many different groups of chronically handicapped persons in the community and avoid a permanent life at institutions. As an example of a handicapping condition I will speak of mental retardation and In the present paper I will only mention cases with an 10 below 50 who in the following are called severely mentally handicapped. According to the Danish computerized system for all registered mentally retarded we know that also about half of the registered mentally retarded grown-ups in Denmark are living with parents or other relatives in their own family, and therefore we know that the question we will discuss in this paper is not only limited to childhood and adolescence. ",
        "-59- I consider the severely mentally retarded living at home as a very typical example of a handicapped person in need of constant supervision and protection sometimes throughout all his life but especially during the childhood. This study is based on the population of Aarhus municipality (about 240,000 persons from the 1970 census survey by Bernsen (1975)). Figure 1. The aga group which was chosen for the Aarhus study was 6 - 14, as the normal child leaves the period of heavy dependence on the parents at the age of six and steps into the period of adaptation to dally life and life at school, and has been able to manage toilet-visits etc. for years. The upper linit of 14 years is directed by the Danish limit for dlsaplement pension. Fortyfour of the 171 families of the census study had a child in this age-group, but three children had entered a care-institution, one had died and one family had left for another country - families who had moved to other parts of Denmark were included. All 39 families lad one child with severe mental handicap (10 below 50). The material Table 1 - table 2. The handicapped children had a total of 63 siblings and only in 5 families there were no siblings. The age of the siblings was 0-35. Table 3 The table shows that only 2 mothers were younger than 30. Table 4 Table 4 shows that the distribution of these families according to social class does not differ from the Danish population. In order to perform the study it was important to describe and analyze the need of the families. It is amazing how little we know about the impact on tha environment and living conditions of the family members when a severely handicapped person is living at home. For each \"symptom\" we had to make lists of objects and time needed. For instance about two thirds of the children of the analyzed age-groups are not toilet-trained. Tha consequences regarding equipment and time consuming activities were listed. Table 5 If the child is hyperactive and sometimes destructive other needs can be listed. ",
        "-60- Table 6 In this way 16 lists were worked out and used as a basis for some of the questions in the structured interview. The lists did not only concern the consequences of the mental retardation but also the many supple mentary handicaps : cerebral palsy, epilepsy, sense handicaps, skin diseases, the special need for dental care, etc. Bernsan (1980) found that only 11 per cent of the severely retarded are not suffering from at least one other handicap. Oupont (1980) found - as a result of the nation-wide computerized statistics - that on average the severely handicapped registered had 1,6 supplementary handicap. For the staff (the mother) there is a need for time for the many dally activities : training, sometimes more than once, time for cara and nursing, the child's toilet visits, dressing, undressing, feeding, and the use of special equipments as special shoes, boots, and bandages. All these are very time-consuming. In cases with other handicaps as cerebral palsy ate. time is also spent occasionally with the maintenance of the wheel chair and the hearing aid. and other special equipment makes it necessary to visit hospitals, clinics, etc. The study was carried out by means of the following : registrations performed by the family itself and by interviews. The family's registration consisted of two things : a registration of time throughout every minute of a whole week and a registration of the expanses throughout four weeks. The interview schedule consisted of questions concerning the time spant occasionally and not included In the registration of daily time spent, money spent by routine during a month and on big purchases and also questions about the stress caused by the handicapped on the family. The questionnaire consisted of 160 questions when it had been controlled and supplemented after a pilot study in families outside the study group. All 39 families agreed to participate in the study. They were all visited, instructed, and interviewed by the same social worker. All data were computerized in a S.P.S.S. programme (Nie et al, 1975). Results By means of the Handicaps, Behaviour and Skills Schedule (Wing & Gould, 1978). used by Bernsen (1980) it was possible to divide the children into four groups according to handicaps, type, and degree. ",
        "-61- Table 7 Group 1 : 10 children (26 %). Totally non-mobile children In need of help for all daily activities, often multiply handicapped (e.g. with epilepsy), language and social communication absent or severely impairad, prone to infections, and disturbed slaap pattern Table 3 Group 2 : 17 children (44 '-.). Hyperactive, destructive, non- communicating children or passiva, in need of much help. Often with sense and language impairment or other handicaps. Some of them have repetitive routine or other behaviour problems. Table 9 Group 3 : nine children (23 '-.) . Mobile, not toilet-trained during night, often with epilepsy or other handicaps (of mild degree), needing some help for daily activities. Table 10 Group 4 : 3 children (7 %) . Manage daily life routines with social interaction and skills of the normal child at a chronologically higher age. Table 11 Tha many different handicaps, needs or symptoms were also given weights from one to three, where e.g. \"hyperactive without knowledge of danger \" was given three, \"disturbed sleap\" thraa, \"minor epileptic fits\" two, \"drivelling\" two, \"skin disease\" ona. Some of the 23 \"symptoms\" were alternatives and therefore the highest score was 38. 26 of the families (67 %) had a score between 25 and 38. Table 12 The results of the parents' registration of time are shown at table 12. As the registration was carried out during a whole week it was not surprising that the average time spent was higher on Saturday and Sunday, when the child did not attend a school or other day-institution (only one of the children did not attend a day-care-institution). Besides this the interviews showed additional time used. For one third of the families many of the time-consuming visits to medical and other specialists take about 30 to more than 100 hours a year. Asked about the most heavy burden the parents answered : the constant need of supervision of the child : eight per cent of tha children ",
        "-62- always had to be supervised by a family member, 64 '-. could be left alone for five minutas, and 28 % could sometimes be left alone about half an hour. The familias were interviewed about the limitations of other activities and table 13 shows the results. In 66 H of the families the parents could never accompany the siblings to their activities. The siblings participated in the supervision and sometimes the care of the handicapped in cases, where thay were living at home and were old enough to help. In seven families the siblings were too young to participate in the work with the mentally retarded child, in 25 families the siblings participated in the supervision, and in 15 families they participated in the care. One third of the siblings told that they had difficulties with their friend and were teased because their brother or sister was handicapped. From the answers to our interview schedules we found that in all the families the main part of the work was done by the mothers. I have had the opportunity to compare the results of this study with an English study performed by the sociologist David Wilkin in Manchester. He examined a similar group of handicapped mentally retarded children. He described the results of his investigation in hisbook \"Caring for the Mentally Handicapped Child\" (1979). He found that large proportions of mothers received no help with the various aspects of child care, and unfortunately this lack of support was not compensated for by an increased level of help with basic household chores. For the mothers there were two principle effects on the day-to-day running of the home which varied in relative importance depending on the particular circumstances, but the effect of both was to Increase the burden of ordinary household chores : first the handicapped child tended to create extra work, and secondly many of the children prevented mothers, from doing house work by demanding constant attention. He gives some very interesting figures for the father's participation in child care and house-hold tasks, for instance of fathers who had an incontinent child 60 '-. provided no assistance in changing nappies. He also found that the level of fathers' participation in house work was generally lower than in child care. Concerning help from relatives, friends, and neighbours, the sociologist found that neither relatives nor friends nor neighbours participated or supported the mother in her heavy work with the child care and house work.

        "-63- These two papers, the Aarhus study and tha Manchester study, evaluate a relatively new problem of community care. In the past, the severely mentally retarded died during infancy and the few survivors were put into institutions. During the sixties and seventies many more survive and the community care of these often multiply and severely brain-damaged persons is now the normal solution. However, as I have shown in this paper the network of supporting persons and facilities is not existing - except for the day care institutions, and the mother is rather alone with the heavy burden - It is not a community care but a care by overworked mothers. Concluding it can be said : in reality the term \"community care for a mentally handicapped child\" refers to care In the community, but not care by the community. An evaluation of this care shows that the nuclear family is a framework in which the child is cared for, and within the family it is the mother who carries the major burden of care usually with relatively little support from other family members. The contribution of people outside the family to the practical burden of care is almost negligible. Our Danish study of Aarhus municipality is representatively based on an epidemiological study. To a varying degree the problems described are of importance to thousands of families. ",

        "-72- EVALUATION OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN CHILDREN DURING HOSPITAL STAYS AILEEN O'HARE, DUBLIN Mental health is, I believe, more difficult to define than mental illness. The World Health Organization definition of health as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely an absence of disease and infirmity\" (1) has never been operationalised and, therefore, has little utility for research purposes - a similar dilemna pertains to other definitions of health. The evaluation of mental health needs consequently poses problems in the absence of agreed criteria for mental health. In this paper I suggest that research findings from the behavioural sciences provide us with information on children's needs during hospital stays. The dissemination of this knowledge seems largely confined to voluntary organizations. Given existing knowledge of children's needs when hospitalised I have looked at the Irish general hospital services in an attempt to evaluate how these needs are met. The first statement on the mental health needs of children based on research findings came in 1951 from John Bowlby. In a report written under the auspices of W.H.O. (2) he stated, that deprivation of mother's love in early childhood had far reaching effects on mental health developement. He arrived at this conclusion from his own and other studies ranging'over 25 years, of children in institutions, hospitals and foster homes, from retro spective studies of disturbed adolescents and from follow-up studies of children who had experienced early deprivation. Concern with children's more specific mental health needs when hospitalised became possible in the 1950's whan a high standard of medical care was achieved in the developed countries. At that time the insurance of a warm continuous relationship between a child and his mother or mother substitute was regarded as the essential requirement for mental health. Information on the mental health needs, as distinct from the physical needs, of children during hospital stays comes from tha three major disciplines in the behavioural sciences viz : psychiatry, psychology and sociology. In summarising the major contributions from these disciplines I am not suggesting that there are no areas of common interest and overlap, rather that ",
        "-73- the focus of each discipline is different. Bowlby. a child psychiatrist, distinguished between \"partial\" and \"complete\" deprivation (3). \"Partial\" deprivatipn he saw as arising when a child is deprived of his mother's loving care but receives proper care from someone who is not a known or stable figure in the child's environment. \"Complete\" deprivation he saw as occurring in situations where, for example, a child was hospitalised without someone to care for him in a secure personal fashion. \"Complete\" deprivation he believed, could result in the development of an affectionless personality. In support of this he cited, for example, evidence given to the Curtis Committee in England of the isolation, aimlessness and uncertainty of children in Ion-stay hospitals and the effects such deprivation had on them. Subsequent research findings have attempted to differentiate between the effects of separation and change of environment which a child experiences in hospital (4). Findings show that separation and a strange environment occurring together produce more distress than when they occur singly. However, strange environments are much less stressful for the child if the mother is present (5), Ruttar in his book \"Maternal Deprivation Reassessed\" critically reviews the collection of studies involved with the concept of maternal deprivation and modifies some of Bowlby's original positions (6). Deprivation and ics consequences he concludes are significantly dependent on factors such as. the type and length of separation, the type of previous relationship of the child with parents and family.previous relationship of the child with parent's and family, previous separation experience and the child's own temperament and age. Ha notas, however, that systematic observations of children admitted to hospital have shown that emotional distress is most marked in children aged under five years. In older children distress is less severe, less prolonged and occurs in a lower proportion of children. Psychologists have added to our understanding of children's mental health needs when hospitalised through their studies of normal growth and development (in contrast to the psychiatrist's focus \u03b1\u03c0 morbidity). One of the major areas of interest for the psychologist is to determine the influence of early life experiences on subsequent development. There is ample evidence to show the short-term deterioration of personality in many children subjected to a stressful experience; one of the films made by the Robertsons (the psychologist husband and wife team) entitled \"A Two Year Old Goes to Hospital\" highlights this in a most dramatic way (7). In an attempt to measure the possible long-term effects or irreversibi\u00ad lity of such adverse experiences, psychologists have engaged in animal studies. ",
        "-74- The existence of critical or sensitive periods has been shown in many animal and bird species during which their increased susceptibility to experience has been demonstrated, for example, the persistence of severe social defects in monkeys kept by Harlow in complete isolation for the first six months of their lives (8) and the Lorenz experiment of imprinting in birds (9). Extrapolation of findings from animals and birds must be viewed with caution; what findings there are relating to children are inconclusive. There have been disappointing results from schemes such as Operation Headstart in the U.S.A. aimed at compensatory education for deprived pre-school children (10). It suggests that the ill-effects of long standing and persistent deprivation cannot be compensated by short-term means if the child returns'to unfavourable circumstances. Work done by the Clerkes is more optimistic about the reversibility of early adverse life experiences of children. They tend to emphasise the capacity of the child for restitution to the normal pattern following experiences which Bowlby would consider to result in irreparable damage (11). In conclusion, reversal seems more likely if the'changa of environment if favourable, permanent and if it occurs in infancy. Whereas psychiatric and psychologic research on children In hospital has been primarily fooussed on the child, his characteristics and those of his family, sociological research emphasises the importance of the social situation in which the hospitalisation of a child occurs and in so doing can also suggest how findings from psychiatrists and psychologists can best be Implemented. Recent work has concluded that part of the difficulty in implementing the findings of the 1959 Piatt Report in Britain (aimed at the Improvement of non-medical aspects of the treatment of children in hospital) was, that sociological evidence had not been presented or considered by the committee (12). While Piatt recommended that, where possible, mothers should accompany their young children to hospital and where this was not pssible, that parents should be allowed into the wards at any reasonable hour, they failed to take cognisance of the role conflict that might ensue between mother and nurse an the wards. Understandably, the expectations of a mother to do on the wards what she would do at home for her child, affects the authority of the nurse and may be a threat to her status. To effect a smooth implementation of a policy of unrestricted visiting, Stacey and her co-workers suggest that nurses should be trained to understand and accept the role of \"mother and child\" on the wards and not Just that of child (13). ",
        "-75- To facilitate understanding of the strange environment encountered by the child, hospitals can be analysed in terms of Goffman's \"total institution\". (14) In hospital, separation from the outside world is virtually complete, role scheduling is disrupted, the child no longer plays his role of, for example, son, sibling, pupil, and norms concerning medication, sleeping and eating are rigorously enforced. Findings from sociological field studies have demonstrated the benefit to the child, both psychological and physiological, when accompanied to hospital by mother. There is evidence too to show that stress among children in hospital can be diminished by reducing the stress on their mothers, through a policy of interaction which allows far the communication of infor mation to mother and freedom on her part to verbalise her possible fear and anxiety. (15) Some work has been done to identify those children most vulnerable to hospitalisation (16). Further insights -on children's requirements when hospitalised have come from geneticists and paediatricians. Jolly, a paediatrician (17). stressed the need for children in hospital to have toys, play facilities and play leaders, reinforcing the emphasis psychologists place on play, as crucial to children's development. Paediatricians are most insistent that children when hospitalised should always be nursed in children's wards. Geneticists hava drawn attention to the individual temperament of children and that their response to the environment is influenced by their genetic make-up (18). Thus, a body of knowledge, much of it empirically derived, is currently available, which makes it possible to formulate certain guidelines regarding the mental health needs of children during hospital stays. Ascertainment of the awareness administrators, hospital personnel and parents have of such needs is difficult to gauge. A report by the W.H.O. Regional Office for Europe, on Cost/Banefit Analysis in Mental Health Services, in 1976 stated that (19) \"70 % of W.H.O. member states have no direct information on the mental health status of their population. Monitoring and evaluation of mental health services is, therefore, considered an important tool in the rational planning of health services\". Hospital services and facilities for children, particularly non-medical ones, are ",
        "-76- certain indicators of how needs are met, but information at national level, of the type and quality of such services is not readily available. Voluntary organizations, concerned with the welfare of children while in hospital are active in many countries, for example, the National Association of the Welfare of Children in Hospital in Britain, the Kind in Het Ziekenhuus in Holland and the Kind in Krankenhaus in Germany. They disseminate information on the mental health needs of sick and hospitalised children. Community involvement, through voluntary organizations, is an important element in patient care, \"It reflects public concern and helps to modify and educate public attitudes and direct official attention to special aspects of political need\" (20). On behalf of one such organization, the Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital (Ireland). I carried out a study in 1978. with the help of a student, of \"Provisions made in Irish Hospitals fpr the Special Needs of Children\" (21). It was the first time such a project was undertaken in Ireland. The main section of the study was designed to collect certain items of information from every general hospital in Ireland which had admitted children in 1976 and had children resident in hospital on a particular census night in 1977 - mental illness and mental handicap hospitals were excluded. In the study a child was defined as being under 16 years. A questionnaire was used to collect this data. Additionally, a subsidiary section collected information from Dublin city and county matrons, through interview and participant Pbservation, on their attitudes to certain hospital services. One hundred and eleven of the 112 hospitals, or 99 % , in tha main section of the study responded and completed the questionnaire. The response rate in the subsidiary study was 93 %. The following table shows the number of children admitted to Irish hospitals in 1976 by age. Table 1. Admissions of children to Irish hospitals 1976 by age (\u039d\u038a11). Age Group Admissions < 5 years 39,746 5 - < 12 years 30.456 12 - < 16 years 12,018 All admissions 82,919 ",
        "-77- The three main areas I have selected for evaluation from data obtained from the study are : 1. Children's accommodation when hospitalised, 2. The availability of unrestricted visiting and overnight accommodation for parents, and 3. The existence of play facilities, in particular for the under 5 years old in hospital because we know from research findings that such services are important for the mental health need of children. The British Piatt Report strongly recommends that children should not be nursed in adult wards whether medical or surgical (22). Children need the company of other children and the provision of special facilities like visiting, play and teaching. In an adult ward children are likely to see and hear sights and sounds that are frightening and upsetting. The more recent Court Report also makes similar recommendations (23). Under the Irish Health Act 1947 a person under 16 is regarded as a child (24). The study we carried out showed that 36 of the 111 hospitals who admitted children in 1976 used under 16 years as their definitions of child. The majority, or 75 hospitals, had differing age definitions, some a3 young as five years, for the cut-off paint between child and adult. The consequence of this was that children as young as six years were accommodated in adult beds. A further problem was that cots rather than beds were often available in children'3 wards and if a child was too big physically for a cot he was put into an adult bed. Table 2 shows the distribution of children in Irish general hospital beds on census night in 1977. Table 2. Accommodation for children in Irish hospitals (N=111) census night 1977 Accommodation Number \u039d\u03b1. in hospital 2,200 No. in children's beds 1,918 No. in adult beds 282 '-. in adult beds 13 ",
        "-78- This table shows that 13 % of children were accommodated in adult beds on census night. We believe the figures to be an under-estimation as the census was carried out in summer. Thirteen per cent of children in adult beds on a particular night represents approximately 10,500 admissions a year to the type of hospital accommodation which could be considered detrimental to their mental health. Unrestricted visiting and overnight accommodation for parents are probably the most important facilities for hospitalised children. All the research findings stress the possible adverse effects that separation and change of environment can have on the hospitalised child. Children we know, differ in their responses and some are more vulnerable to hospitalisation than others. In the absence of more exact information it is important, especially in the case of the under 5 years old, that hospital services should include unrestricted visiting and overnight accommodation for parents. In our study, unrestricted visiting was defined as eight or more hours daily; although in most countries unrestricted means what it says and parents have reasonable access to their children at any time of the day or night. Sixty one per cent of Irish hospitals had unrestricted visiting, 14 % had visiting hours of four to under eight hours daily and 25 % had less than four hours daily. The Dublin matrons' attitudes to unrestricted visiting, which may not be typical of the country as a whole, were generally favourable. They felt it was important 'to move with tha times and facilitate people rather than the hospital \"we accept what is good for the child\" being a typical comment. Those matrons who were opposed to unrestricted visiting felt that children were better off with regular, but restricted hours admitting that with a large number of parents constantly on the wards there would be a problem with supervision. Parents' presence on the wards could also interfere, they believed, with children's medical treatment. Overnight accommodation in the study included a room or other facilities, such as. a bedside chair. In Iraland, 42 % of general hospitals provided some type of overnight facility for parents. We were able to establish that the amount of time assigned to a course on child psychology in nurses' training was \"minimal at bast\". . Consequently, little opportunity is given to nurses to develop awareness of children's mental health needs or current thinking on, for example, the concept of the \"mother and child unit\" on the ward. ",
        "-79- Play has bean described as \"a vital factor in the intellectual, social and emotional development of every child\".(25) For the child in hospital the opportunity for play is essential. As well as being enjoyable, play for the child is a link with former activities of home and schooi. Play brings the child in hospital into contact with other children, encouraging friendships and lessening the isolation that separation from home brings. Play can provide a useful putlet for the child's handling of aggression and frustration. Thirty eight per cant of hospitals in our study provided a play area of some typB. The play area could be on the ward, separate from the ward or outdoor. Sixty two per cent of hospitals had no play area whatsoever. Of tha 111 hospitals in the study nine employed a play leader. Again we have soma insight on attitudes to play from the Dublin matrons. It appeared to us that hospitals do not always realise the importance of play and from some of the comments received, perhaps view it, as a contradiction in terms of illness, for example, \"if a child is well enough to play and run around he is well snough to go home\". Table 3 summarises the Irish hospitals' service provision of \"unrestricted\" visiting, overnight facilities for parents and play areas thus showing the extend to which hospitals are meeting important mental health needs of children during their hospital stays. Table 3. Specified children'3 facilities in Irish hospitals 1977. Facility All hospitals (N- 111) \"unrestricted\"visiting (eight or mora hours daily) overnight facilities (bed or bedside chair) play areas 68 - 61 47 - 42 42 - 38 \u00b7-. - % - \\ - ",
        "-80- Recognition of children's mental health needs when hospitalised should precede an evaluation of such needs. In Ireland we found hospital services did not always reflect a recognition of children's needs; there is evidence also to show that mothers can be unaware of the effact hospi talisation can have on their children (26). Voluntary organizations concerned with the welfare of children in hospital may be best suited to disseminate information an need and could be given more official recognition and support. Research, preferably of an interdisciplinary nature, should continue to determine the effects of both short- and long-term hospitalisation, and to identify those children most vulnerable to hospital stay. Finally, the evaluation of hospital services vis \u00e0 vis their recognition of children's mental health needs should be approached in a standard way, far instance, by using the age categories recommended by the International Classification of Diseases (27) and agreed definitions of unrestricted visiting and overnight accommodation for parents, thereby allowing for cross-national comparison and exchange of information.

The subject of this paper, the assessment of the effectiveness of methods of treatment, or secondary prevention, in the alcohol field poses little difficulty in this respect. All authorities are unanimous that the consumption of alcohol and the extent of consequent alcohol-related problems has increased considerably within most of the countries of the Commission of the European Communities in recent years. The Commission itself has acknowledged that alcohol-related problems feature among conditions of major public health importance by convening a seminar on \"The Medico-Social Risks of Alcohol Consumption\" held here in Luxembourg in 1977. The report of this meeting has Just recently bean published. In addition, the Commission has recently completed a preliminary study on \"Public Health Aspects of Alcohol-Related Problems\" (carried out for them Jointly by the Department of Sociology, University of Aberdeen, Scotland and the Medico-Social Researcg Board of Ireland). Arising from this a proposal for a European programme in the field of alcohol-related problems has been made to the specialised working group on epidemiology of the Committee for Medical Research of the CEC. The World Health Organization now includes, as one of the main objectives of its regional programme for Europe, the prevention and reduction of alcohol- and drug-related problems. It is clear, therefore, that thare is, internationally, major concern at the extent and continuing growth of the problems and damages caused by alcohol. The last fifteen years have seen a trebling of the consumption of alcohol in some countries of the Commission and admissions for alcoholism constitute the largest single cause of admission to psychiatric hospitals in more than one European country. The toll of death on the road in which alcohol plays a part is enormous and it is calculated that, at a minimal, estimate, alcohol is implicated in at least one quarter of all road fatalities in Europe. ",
        "-87- The number of admissions to general hospitals in which alcohol plays a role is very substantial but its total extent is never fully appreciated. A sizeable proportion of suicides are triggered by alcohol and this same drug plays a substantial role in inducing people to attempt suicide. Alcohol-related crime, particularly among young people, is generally believed to be on the increase. The effect of alcohol on family life and in particular on the welfare of young children is a continuing source of anxiety to workers in the health and social fields. All of this makes it clear beyond the shadow of a doubt that the application of modern scientific technology towards both the prevention and treatment of alcoholism is a health priority in our nine countries. Some countries have acknowledged this formally in their declarations of health policy. Others have yat to do so. Thus, in theory, anyway, the field of evaluation of the effectiveness of our approaches to prevention and treatment in the alcohol field is totally vindicated. Alcoholism and Alcoholics The basis of any epidemiological approach to problems in the medical field usually starts with the question of definition. There has to be a denominator from which the strategy of delineating characterological aspects and the extent of the problem begins. Unfortunately, in the alcohol field there are many problems. Alcohol causes problems to indivi duals , families and societies in a great variety of different ways. Research endeavour in the past has too infrequently attempted to define and refine these various parameters of alcohol damage. Many alcohol-related problems have only partial visibility because their consequences ara non-fatal and the proportion of each particular problem that comes to epidemiological notice is determined by factors that are noso cornial. Community tolerance of such pathology as drunk-driving and family disorder that is alcohol-precipitated, ara determined by community attitudes which differ over time and place and from place to place at the same time. They are also affected by the availability of services developed to cater for them. Thus, surprisingly, the number of people hospitalised for alcoholism in Europe at the close of the nineteenth century was very small by comparison with to-day and yet the consumption that time was much greater. Presumably individuals suffered withdrawal, even delirium tremens without having recourse to hospital. ",
        "-88- The one alcohol-related prpblem that results in definable and classifiable fatality and that, therefore, is \"hard\" in the epidemiological sense is, of course, cirrhosis of the liver. This particular alcohol- rslatsd problem has served us well as an indicator of trends in the overall alcohol field because of its fairly close and barometric response to alcohol consumption levels. There are, however some difficulties in the use of this statistic, but overall it has proved more valuable than other yardsticks applied-to alcohol problems. \"Alcoholism\" is a term much beloved by professionals and public alike but unfortunately it is hardly satisfactorily defined, even by international organisations concerned with health care. Nowadays there appears to be a tendency to restrict the word \"alcoholism\" to the so-called \"alcohol-dependence syndrome\" to the exclusion of other forms of alcohol-related damage. Unfortunately , the term is not particularly precise and so it is worth giving a few thoughts to it. The basic concept underlying it Is that a person who is drinking alcohol for a sufficient period of time, which may be relatively short, and to a sufficient degree, will develop certain symptoms, which must be physiologically mediated, on the cessation of alcohol intake or even sometimes whila ha is still continuing to drink. These symptoms collectively are referred to as \"withdrawal\" symptoms. Tha causative behaviour leading to this situation i.e. heavy drinking, is what has classically been called \"alcoholism\" and the person who engages in such behaviour is known as an \"alcohqlic\". Unfortunately the term alcohol-dependence syndrome is not itself above reproach. The word dependence implies an incapacity to do without, which in this case is thought to be mediated physiologically. However, it is obvious that a person who is drinking to the point where he will develop withdrawal symptoms were he to suddenly stop, can, by gradually reducing his daily intake, lead himself back to a level of alcohol intake at which he will not develop withdrawal symptoms should he stop drinking. In that sense the word dependence is a tautology. (And a bad one at that). The alcohol field then is strewn with definitions and conceptualisations that spring form a rigid, biologically and constitutionally-rooted concept of alcohol problems which sees the \"alcoholic\" as qualitatively different from the normal body of people who drink. It implies also an input into the problem drinking scene that is over-balanced in the genetic, constitutional, physiological and deterministic direction at the expense of the behavioural, which places greater emphasis on the capacity for control and its development and utilisation within the individual himself. In this context it is depressing to read the definition of alcohol-dependence syndrome in the Glossary and ",
        "-89- Guide to the Classification of Mental Disorders in accordance with the ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases. The definition says that the alcohol-dependence syndrome is a state... \"that always includes a compulsion to take alcohol\". Some may find this deterministic and therapeutically limiting, apart altogether from any philosophical abjection to the use of the word \"compulsion\" in this sense. I may seem to have dwelled over-long on these basic issues but I do think that they are fundamental to any strictly scientific evaluation of treatment input in the alcohol field. They have, for example, in dealing with the alcohol-dependence syndrome, limited substantially the treatmsnt approach and they have seriously biased any attempt at scientific evaluation. If it is believed, and I think this is still the majority view within our countries, that \"alcoholism\" is a point in an individual's drinking life where he cannot for any length of tima take alcohol without getting into trouble before long, then the treatment goal of this condition becomes simple. It must be complete abstinence from this drug. However, there is good reason to think that matters may not be as simple as this and that the creation of such a psychological effect in an individual who is characterised as alcoholic creates a need within the indivi dual to Justify his labelling. For example, if a man has been told by knowledgeable physicians that he is an alcoholic, that he must never touch alcohol again and that if he takes even one drink he will end up in trouble, then having taken that drink, inadvertently perhaps or under pressure, he is likely to say to himself \"well that's that, now I have to go on drinking because they told me I am an alcoholic and alcoholics always do\". In this situation the abstinence approach to the alcoholic may be sean as anti- therapeutic. This, of course, is conjectural but it does need research. Furthermore, people who drink too much have adaptation problems in other areas of their lives which not at all stem from their drinking, it is even possible that some of their difficulties in adaptation are actually helped by their drinking. In this context it is well recognised that many formerly alcohol-dependent people who become abstinent do not improve in other aspects of life adaptation and in some cases may even get worse. It is not clear to what extent their maladaptive behaviour antedates their heavy drinking, has grown pari passu with it or has been exacerbated by it. At any rate, it is well known from clinical observation that many alcoholics who have been told to follow the abstinence regime often, in fact, drink more or less normally for very considerable periods before increasing their Intake to pathological levais once again. ",
        "-90- Incrsasing evidence from many sources and the quantitative model of graded alcohol intake, suggest that many persons drinking at the pathological level, return to an alcohol intake that is not damaging. Some of these are known from samples of treated patients, others do it themselves without any intervention and we do not know what the numbers of such people may be; it may indeed be very substantial. For this reason preconceptions about the alcohol-dependence syndrome and physiological determinism may be counter productive and in many cases, which may be gauged by clinical intuition, a \"modified intake\" therapeutic goal with family support and involvement may give better pay-off than the traditional, but often unattainable, abstinence target. Desiderata for Adequate Outcome Evaluation in the Field of Alcohol-Relatsd Problems Some crude and yet broadly reliable indicators in the alcohol field may monitor success or otherwise of alcohol prevention programmas nationwide. For example, the rise and fall ofmortality from cirrhosis of the liver gives us a crude idea how things are going on a national front. In circumstances where approaches to alcohol problems such as drunk-driving and crime are standardised and unchanging over time, police statistics may indicate the success of \"drive sober\" campaigns if they are of sufficient quality and reliability. Hospital admission data for alcoholism are on the whole rather soft and certainly not of much value for international comparisons, but over a limited time period, without much service or community change, may be useful within countries. Methods of evaluation of specific alcohol treatment programmes in the alcohol-dependence f leid must take cognizance of many factors. These include target goals, evaluation of recovery or performance and many other functional araas apart from alcohol intake. Family, inter-personal and inter-social behaviour and function, together with Job performance, are crucial as part of a multi-factorial assessment of outcome. The problem of selection bias is an Inherent snag in any alcohol treatment programme. Too often clients are self-selecting and self-rejecting so that what one ends up with is a biased sample of the universe from which patients for treatment were drawn. Exclusion of persons with established brain damage, of poor intelligence, lower socio-economic groups, and individuals without families are all commonplace and all seriously bias outcome studies as all of these variables are known to Influence prognosis. Adequate control studies are difficult to achieve so that they control for one programme against another. ",
        "\u25a091\u00ad 3\u03b1 programmes being comparad h\u00e2ve to the same outcome objectives and do they measure outcome in the same way ? What about comparison with no treatment at all ? And what about the effect of extrinsic factors not normally irvestigatsd or considered in evaluation programmes. Job changes, for example, even if slight, have significant effects on drinking behaviour, What about wider social\u00adeconomic changes ? A sudden sharp increase in the price of alcohol :r more likely a decrease in personal income may well lead to substantial charges in alcohcl intake which has nothing to do with treatment. To sum up then it can be said that there is a substantial justification for evaluation of intervention programmes in the alcohol field whether at the primary prevention cr secondary prevention level as these problems make a substantial impact on social and medical services throughout Europe. It is, therefore, important to choose the form of intervention that has been demons\u00ad trated to ce most effective. There are substantial conceptual problems in the perception of alcoholism and the alcoholic, which render evaluation difficult in certain circumstances. There is not yet agr\u00e9ment as to what represents satisfactory outcome. On top of all this, the difficulties of organising a strictly case controlled evaluation programme uninfluenced by extraneous or fortuitous circumstances are substantial. Nevertheless, the recognition of these difficulties is a first step towards overcoming them. ",

        "-94- EVALUATION OF TREATMENT OF ALCOHOLIC PATIENTS JIM ORFORD, EXETER I should like to thank the organizers for inviting me to this conference, but also to express regret that I appear tp be the only clinical psychologist on the programme. This is as much the fault of psychologists as of the organizers of the conference, because psychologists have I believe been slow to involve themselves in wider issues of health care planning and evaluation. I can assure the meeting that this situation is changing. The Present Position Research on the evaluation of alcoholism treatment has brought us to a position which many find depressing. The position is that successes, though common, are out numbered by failures, and that the results of treatment are uniform, varying little either with type or amount of treatment given. For example, Emrick (1975] reviewing several hundred alcoholism treatment studies, found only 72 in which patients had been randomly assigned to two or more treatment groups or had been matched on important variables. Of these, only five produced results showing significant differences between groups more than six months after treatment. In each of these cases he believed there was evidence that differences derived, not from the particularly beneficial treatment offered to one group, but rather to the harmful treatment given to a group of patients as a result of their knowledge that other patients were receiving better or more intensive treatment. Over the years there have been studies showing that brief inpatient treatment produces results as good as lengthy inpatient treatment, that outpatient treatment is as efficacious as inpatient treatment, and recently in a study in which I was personally involved, that assessment, brief advice, and follow-up can be as effective for married male problem drinkers as can relatively intensive multidisciplinary treatment (Orford and Edwards, 1977). ",
        "-95- Furthar analyses by Emrick, as well as the well known but controversial study carried out in the U.S. by the RAND corporation (Armor et al, 1975) showed a modest difference in outcome in favour of less than minimal treatment when patient characteristics were uncontrolled. In a meta-analysis of a very large number of treatment studies. Costello (1960) demonstrated that the largest slice of the variance pie when predicting outcome could be accounted for by client characteristics, and in particular by social stability, and much smaller proportions by treatment differences. His measure of social stability was simple; it consisted of adding the proportion of a treatment sample who were married to the proportion gainfully employed, and dividing by two. Regretably, this simple index goes a long way towards explaining the differences in outcome rates between different treatment samples. Costello's paper was presented at a conference held at the Institute of Psychiatry in April 1979. entitled Alcoholism Treatment : Finding New Directions (Edwards and Grant. 1980). The vary title of the conference expresses the dilemma that we are in. However. I believe there are two separate sets of reasons why we should be cautious in accepting the apparent results of alcoholism treatment studies to date at face value. There are both problems of research design and conceptual problems to be faced, and I propose to discuss some of the issues that arise under those two headings in turn. Alcoholism Treatment Evaluation Oesjgn Problems Some of the research design problems are peculiar to the alcohol problem treatment field, or at least take on a special form. For example, the outcome criterion problem. In particular, it is uncertain how much weight to give to drinking per se in comparison with other aspects of outcome. Even confining consideration to drinking outcomes, the validation of self-reports of drinking problem must be faced - a variety of the general reactivity of measures problem in psychotherapy research (Smith and Glass, 1977). Attempa have been made to replace, or at least supplement, self-reports by apparently more objective procedures such as the observation of quantity consumed during \"taste tests\", or the estimation of alcohol content in breath. However these procedures raise as many methodological problems as they solve, and besides involve deception or unwarranted intrusion. Judging from the audience's reaction at the April conference last year when Mark Sobell suggested the routine use of breathylizers in treatment, many workers in my country would consider such a procedure unethical. ",
        "-96 In addition, the appropriateness of abstinence a\u00ec treatmenf goal has recently been in dispute, and there is much controversy over appropria;e criteria for \"controlled drinking\". One of the most controversial findings of the RAND report (Armor et al, 1976) was that a substantial proportion of people treated for serious drinking problems had at follow-up ceased drinking excessively but, rather than being abstinent, were drinking in a \"controlled\" or \"social\" fashion. This finding in fact merely confirms the results of a very large number of treatment studies accumulated over the last 20 years or more, and in Britain the proposal that a proportion of abnormal drinkers can expect to return to controlled drinking is no longer controversial in most quarters. I would oe interested to know whether this development in treatment philosophy is accepted In other European countries now, or whether the proposal arouses the same heated dispute which tt seems to engender in the U.S.A. Attention has also been drawn to the problem of averaging outcome over time. Treatment studies have mostly assigned clients to one of a small number of outcome categories on the basis of some process of averaging or summarizing drinking behaviour over a period of six or twelve months or more. Monitoring drinking at more frequent intervals after treatment show, however, that the matter is much more complex. Total unbroken abstinence is quite unusual in the period ufter treatment, and so to is continuous unbroken moderata drinking. Experiencing soma periods of ona or nthar type of outcome, even though these may be brokan by shorter or longer periods of heavier drinking, are quite common on the other hand (e.g. Yates, 1979). Most of the main design problems, however, are those that beset psychological treatment research in any field. In general these problems may be subsumed under the treatment package assumption which has guided most empirical treatment research (Athey and Coyne. 1979). This is the assumption that a treatment can ba specified and applied in standard form by any competent therapist to many different clients. There are a number of Impor tant respects in which this assumption is invalid in the case of psychological treatments. Firstly treatment techniques are rarely so well specified that they remain invariant. It is difficult to make certain that treatments are always given and \"taken\" in tha \"dosages\" prescribed. In any case, psychological treatments are usually complex and we can rarely be certain which components are \"taken\" and have impact. We know that patients frequently ignore their ",

There is a further oroolem, particularly pertinent to alcoholism treatment, concerning the relative importance of treatment and the post\u00ad treatment environment. Low success rates in alcoholism treatment are largnly attributable to relapse in the early weeks following treatment. Treatment itsel f may Ca relatively less imoortant than a patient's environmental resources (Bromet and Moos. 1977). A 'urther result of Costello's r 1980) meta\u00adanalysis of treatment studies was that \"vigorous follow\u00adup\" m.\u00add;\u00a1 a contribution to outcome variance, indicating that continuity of contact \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00bb, be as important as the initial treatment Itself. Conceptual problems : Taking A Wider Perspective T he apparent uniformity of outcome following different forms of alcoholism treatment should perhaps make us think again about the role of treatment Itself, as well as question the adequacy of research design. Our assumption all along has been that \"alcoholism requires treatment\". There are two sources of doubt about this statement. One source consists of survey results suggesting that many people in the community are problem drinkers unrecognised by treatment agencies, and that a proportion cease problem drinking without formal help. There havd baan studies from the U.S. (e.g. Clark and Cahalan, 1976). and recently one from Scotland (Saunders. 1979) showing that the process of moving from the status of problem drinker to that of abstainer or moderate drinker is one that occurs naturally and more often than rarely. It is possible that this process is less likely to occur naturally the greater the degree of alcohol dependence or the greater the amount of damage which alcoholism has caused to the individual. However this is not known at pr\u00e4sent and we can at least be confident now of the statement \"serious problems with drinking do not always require treatment\". ",
        "-98- The second source of doubt about the simple statement that alcoholism requires treatment, at least in the sense of formal, professional treatment. is the endurance and continued growth of Alcoholics Anonymus as a non professional self-help group, coupled with the growing popularity in the alcohol field and the apparent success generally of non-professional counsel ling. Alcoholics Anonymous will celebrate its 50th anniversary during the present decade and yet its membership is still growing in Britain year by year (Robinson, 1979) and has spread to many countries around the world. The non-professional contribution is increasingly recognised in other ways, far example in Britain in the form of the National Council on Alcoholism's Training Scheme for volunteer alcoholism counsellors. Part of the motivation tc train volunteers for this kind of work may stem from cost considerations. Indeed elsewhere I have argued, on grounds of estimated casts alone, that a professional worker with special respcnsibilities fnr alcohol services, should spend part of his/her time recruiting . training, and supporting non- specialist professionals, non-professional paid employees of health, social service or voluntary organizations, and unpaid volunteers, rather than work exclusively in direct contact with clients him/herself (Orford, 1973). In general it can be argued that we have in the past over-estimated the importance of formal, professional treatment and have under-estimated what might be termed \"natural healing processes\". Under this heading would fall both the abilities of problem drinkers to make decisions to altar their drinking behaviour, and also the influence of supportive and helping networks in the community. The tendency to believe that behaviour Is unchangeable without special treatment is perhaps correlated with the behaviour's rarity and with our perception that it is confined to sub-groups of which wa are not members . This tendency has not been apparent with regard to tobacco smoking, although many would regard smoking addiction as one of the most difficult to remove, has been more evident with alcohol dependence, and perhaps stronger still with heroine addiction. Interestingly enough, research is now showing a similar need exists to re-think basic assumptions on the nature and modiflability of heroin usa (Room). Some Tentative Solutions I am not able to offer any perfect solutions to these methodological and conceptual problems, nor I may say were the participants at the April 1979 conference at tha Institute of Psychiatry in London (Edwards and Grant, 1980). I can perhaps offer very tentatively soma suggestions which 'have been made by others however. ",
        "-99- I believe Athey and Coyne (1979) are thinking along the right lines when they advocate the employment of \"naturalistic research design\" in place of the conventional treatment package approach. The former, thay claim, assumes that treatment is : \"... inherently multivariate and that any alteration of treatment from the path it would naturally take is a distortion of the events under study... treatment is intrinsically experiential, as opposed to procedual. That is, the nature of treatment is defined more by the nature of the experience of the patient-traatar relationship than by the formal procedures in which that relationship is embedded\" (P. 344). Yates (1979)has similarly argued that our research strategies should do far greater justice to the vagaries of treatment processes in the real world, and that in particular they should allow for clients' individuality in making use of those aspects of treatment which are to their linking. Unfortunately, neither Athey and Coyne nor Yates can tell us in any detail how we should design our research projects in order to preserve the validity of interpretation which we have always felt the controlled trial and other similar strategies gave us. Progress can be expected in the development of \"quasi-experimental\" designs originally proposed by Campbell and Stanley (1966) in the context of educational research, and of designs for the study of treatment in single cases which have arisen in the context of behaviour modification treatment and research (\"single case designs\"). One of Campbell and Stanley's designs which promises to be of most general use is the \"time series with comparison group\" design which involves the repeated measurement of criterion variables, both before and after treatment, both of the treatment group and a matched comparison grcup. Some of the single case designs used in behaviour modification work have limited utility in clinical research. For example, the ABAB design requires the repeated Introduction followed by removal of the treatment condition on the assumption that the ffects of \"treatment\" only last while the treatment is in operation. Tha \"multiple base-line design\" involves the successive presen tation of the treatments targeted at a succession of separate problems or symptoms, on the assumption that the treatment of one symptom or problem will not directly effect others. None of these assumptions appears valid in the psychological treatment field. Nevertheless good clinical treatment research requires innovation and it is probably in this area of single case design that developments will occur. Advances have already been made in the development of suitable statistical procedures to accompany singla case design (e.g. Hersen and Barlow, 1978). ",
        "100 The other Direction in wnicn 1 expect alcoholism treauTis^t evaluatio'- to move is towards a \"programme development design\" (Gottman ano Markman, 1976). This will involve viewing treatment within the /ader conte.t of what Professor Sand, in his contribution to this conference, calls \"the total system\". To illustrate what I mean perhaps I could refer to work on alcoholism hcstels or halfway houses, a suoject in which I nave had a sDecial interest (Otto and Orford, 1973!. Work in this area shows quite clearly haw limiting it is to consider the treatment component without reference to considerations such as how clients become residents in hostels (only a minority of those referred become residents) now some remain for a length of time which staff consider adequate (most residents leave within a very few weeks), and now ex-residents remain sober afterwards (most do not'\u00b7 Essential to a programme development design is the discovery of faults or imperfections in the present total system of detection, referral treatment involvement, and after-care, plus the production of change In a system in an attempt tp right such faults. The utilization of Glaser's (1980) \"matching hypothesis\" fits well within such a design. Glaser's argument is that proponents of the uniformity of alcoholism treatment outcomes position have neglected indications in the literature that some clients have a better outcome following certain treat ments, others following others. He pointed out, for example, evidence suggesting that people with drinking problems coupled with depressed mood may do better with anti-depressant medication; that clients with a preference for structure may have a better outcome in a more highly structured treatment programme whereas those with preference for lack of structure may do relatively well in a more chaotic programme; and that clients with low levels of alcohol dependence may do better with brief advice whilst those with higher levels of dependence may do better under more Intensive treatment. It is probably true that treatment research has not on the whole employed sufficiently large or homogeneous samples, or has employed sufficiently sophisticated research design, to reveal such Interaction effects, and Glaser's approach is currently one of the most hopefuL It is on this rather more optimistic note that I shall concluda. The alcohol problems treatment field is an exciting one in which to be working currently. Radically new approaches to treatment, and to treatment evaluation, are possible. In the process we have a lot to learn from those involved in related fields, and parhaps a little to teach them also. ",

        "-104 MENTAL HEALTH POLICY-AN ASSESSMENT DR. P. BAILLY-SALIN. PARIS Assessing a health policy, whatever the object o* :nis policy may ae, clearly implies a different approach and a different kind o f assessment -rom that normally used by the clinician, research worker or even the ordinary physician. A country's health policy follows, or shoula follow soecific objectives, leading quite simply to good health for everyone; chis very praiseworthy aim has to be adapted to the country's resources in terms of manpower ana equipment. As always, the purpose of the assessment is therefore twofold - a critical appraisal of the objectives (in this case, a mental health policy) and the adjustment of this policy to suit actual situations. It is perhaps no accident that a physician - a clinician - nas been asked to talk to you about a subject which is essentially political in that it affects the life of the people. I suppose the reason for asking a French person to present this paper is that France has a very consistent health policy with clear guidelines ana. as we shall see, because the initial texts go back to March i960, we are now able to view it with a certain degree of hindsight which a \u03b9 lows us to see what resistance the policy has met, the problems encountered In applying It and its advantages and disadvantages in practice. Unfortunately, France doas not have a long tradition of assessment but this is not the place to go into the historical reasons. I shall of course, use figures In my assessment, misleading though they often are. Dut most of my arguments will be based on general comments about health policy assessment. Before starting, I shoula like to remina *ou briefly about the regional nature of France's mental health policy am outline rhe ge^e^-fi orTv.lDles without going into datall. ",
        "10b \u0393\u03bf state the situation simply, ever IT it means presenting an incomplete and inaccurate picture, a regional policy means that a single team assumes responsibility for all the mental health problems of the population of a given geographical area. This means general overall responsibility for mental health without any Distinction between the specializea aspect of it. Taking responsibility -or all mental health oroblems does not mean being responsible for all tentai health cases. In fact, France has a lcng tradition of private psvchiatry which does not lend itself easily ta a totalitarian approach. I should therefore like to stress the fact that the stata psychiatric health cnam is Deing given neither special status nor a monopoly nor is it otiing asKed to deal with everything; others can do similar work though in - :;+' x erent context. r he principles underlying chis policy are a regional attribution of -jmpetence and a recognition o* the indivisible nature of psychiatric ^pdlcinB as a whole which means that. = cingle team car be in charge of -a\u03b9 \". \u03c1\u03c0-\u039b\u03af health recoras What is r.ne thinning Dahind the general onnciples of this mental nealt oolicy ? The policy was established at a time when psychiatry could only ne oractised in a hospital: this procedure was clearly totally inadequate 'he term 'mental illness\" is so vague that it can be applied to a wide range of situations and, in view of this, it has been argued that confining mentally sick patients to hospitals conditions them and produces symptoms which are not necessarily, or at lsast not entirely, due to their mental condition. These then are the general paints. The second factor motivating the regional mentai nealth policy was tne appearance of what may be called 'fringe' needs. The extent of these fringe needs ano the difficulty in defining them posed problems for the French health authorities. We became very quickly aware of the danger of applying psychiatry to all human conditions. I for one dp not believe that psychiatry is necessary wherever there Is distress. We all have to suffer at some time and I do net see why a psychiatrist should go Into the motives o* the people involved ir domestic rows or quarrels with their neighbours. ",
        "-106- Nevertheless, the extent of these fringe needs worried us because there was a real risk that the psychiatric teams would be siphoned off to this new unexplored field while the real work of the psychiatrist and his team - the treatment of psychoses, particularly severe psychoses, which gave the work dignity and value - were neglected. The existence of these fringe needs brought with it a risk of diversification within the psychiatric system requiring the prpvision far whole range of different kinds of treatment from complete hospitalization to small clinics, day centres, therapeutic workshops, sheltered lodgings and flats - a complete mosaic of Institutions which, if they were not united with a single aim and under a single authority, were likely , like all Institutions, to tailor their activities to suit themselves; they would therefore no longer be working for the common good or attending to the basic needs of the population. After this outline of the motives behind the policy it is interesting to sea how long it took for the administrative wheels to turn - the gestation period required reminds one more of an elephant than of a rabbit. It in fact lasted for 6 years. Tha unusual side of this mental health policy Is that it was agreed on by union officials representing both administrators and practicians and this has a certain rarety value. The first official, ministerial text on the regional policy which was a mandatory document, or at least a forceful indication of the direction to be followed, appeared in March 1960. You will see later from the figures how long it has taken for this policy to get off the ground and produce results. It was never really applied throughout the country until 1971; it therefore took about eleven years to put into practice the intentions expressed in a text drafted 11 years previously with the complete agreement of the psychiatric profession. We wanted to make a point of avoiding pilot zones in an assessment of this regional health policy. In our view, the use of pilot zones on a national basis is not a good method of assessment. A pilot zone may help to determine the important aspects of a policy but once the policy has been decided it tends to discourage other teams. Moreover, such pilot zones are often overequipped and use an enormous amount of money which discourages other teams and deprives them of their resources. ",
        "-107- It appears to me essential for any national assessment of a mental health policy that it should be reproducible (whicn cuts out control zones) so that it can very quickly cover the whole of the territory. The principle is not to provide a privileged population group with high quality teams; the policy must be based on the actual or potential manpower resources of the nation as a whole. Similarly, a policy should not depend on exceptional people whose achievements, although undoubtedly exciting, cannot easily be repeated by the 1.000 of sa teams we need in our country. The second point about this policy is that we are working with mental health anc not pure psychiatry. In other words, all the needs must be covered from the most Involved psychiatric treatment and the least rewarding cases to very sophisticated preventive work and no preference should be given to any particular aspect. Having a unified psychiatric team and a regional breakdown of respon sibility avoids the problem of shortage of equipment and ensures that priority is not given to certain activities or certain types of equipment at the expense of others. Under the pressure of the needs of the papulation the team cannot, without neglecting its duties, drop one area of psychiatric work for another and, in our view, this is one of the main merits of a regional health policy. The first positive result of the application of the mental health policy in France was that it acted in the same way as Outline' legislation and this was an extremely Important source of inspiration for both the users (the psychiatric teams) and the elected administrators who, seeing the aims set out reasonably clearly, understood at once the purpose and the limitations of the policy and worked on this basis. This 'stimulus' effect is a normal feature of outline legislation and, in my opinion, is a good test of the value of the policy concerned. The figures will show us just how valuable it has been. We estimated that 1.025 tBams would be necessary to cover geographical areas which, according to the 1960 ministerial circulars, would have from 50 to 70.000 Inhabitants approximately. 769 teams were required for adults and 256 for children. Table 1 clearly shows the substantial increase in the number of teams resulting from the ciruclar. We hava now nearly reached the 1960 ideal. Table 2 shows a considerable increase in the number of advisory units and It is clear that the geographical distribution of the increase in the number of teams is very satisfactory. ",
        "-108 These two effects (the number of teams and the number of advisory units) were reflected, of course, in a considerable increase in the number of consultants and an increase in the number of new consultant as shown in Tables 3 and 4. Later on we shall see that this increase in the number of new consultants does not entirely correspond to the increase in the amount o-f work resulting from the increased number of teams. It is nevertheless important to remember that the Increase in the number of advisory units means closer contact with the user and also a more regular presence in the community whose mental health needs are being covered by the team. This has resulted In preventive work which is difficult to quantify in statistical terms but which perhaps explains (Table 3) why the increase in the number of consultants has not been in proportion to the increase in the number of teams; the teams spend a certain amount of their time acting as mediators in high-risk population groups and with key figures in the community. It is therefore the team which gradually, as it goes along, decides on the type of equipment it requires; this decision is taken in close cooperation with the people responsible for political, financial and health matters at all levels In the community concerned. I should like at this point to stress the need not only for programming at national level but also for coordination in the provision of resources for each area of 70.000 inhabitants. These must be structured to fulfil needs and provide a balanced service without making any aspect of the team's work too cumbersome. It is absolutely essential for the team to have the expertisa required to deal with all aspects of the mental health of the population. Otherwise the chances are that some or all of the team has allocated itself will not match the most urgent needs of the population which then, seeking assistance elsewhere, will be weight of numbers disrupt the routine of another institution not equipped to cope with its demands. Looked at from this standpoint, a national health policy can also be seen as a framework to be adapted with flexibility to local needs and to the psychiatric or para- psychiatric unita already existing In the areas concerned. Having had a look at the advantages of the health policy and of our assessment of it, we must also point out the dangers and disadvantages . ",
        "-109- One of the first things assessment of this extended mental health policy reveals is that each unit is very small; this provides a family atmosphere which makes the surveillance of treatment easier but it also makes for an Indiscriminate grouping of patients with differing levels of sociability who may react by rejecting one another. Reducing the size of treatment units can therefore make the management of treatment mora difficult and this should be stressed. Similarly, the teams must refrain from ever-increasing degress uf specialization in one area of treatment, preventive medicine or mental health work. The teams have to be multipurpose which means that they may well have their limitations in overspecialized fields. To deal with this problem supraregional systems exist - either in the form of a grouping of several regions or on a broader geographical basis. One final problem is that the work of the team is very often completely decentralized. This of course has the advantage of giving responsibility to more of the staff but it is important to recognize the risk of seriously diluting the strength of the team from both a material and technical point of view, because of the number of institutions it has to manage. This risk applies particularly to responsibility at the highest levels and has given rise to a number of operational problems which should not be understimated. In conclusion an assessment of a national mental health policy should satisfy the fallowing criteria : 1. The real resources of a country both in terms uf buildings and manpower should be taken into account. 2. The policy must be applicable to the country as a whole. Reproducibility is an essential factcr. 3. Each region must be able to equip Itself with the means of implementing the mantal health policy drawn up at national level knowing that the team's overall responsibility for all aspects *f mental health will enable it to avoid excessive emphasis on any one area of treatment, overequipment In some fields, shortage of equipment in others and to ensure that needs are balanced according to the various treatment systems available. 4. The Increase in the number of teams has meant an increase in the number of advisory units and should also be reflected in an increase in the work of the teams which depends not only on the number of consultants but also en the quality of the services rendered to the community in terms of an increasingly sophisticated system of preventive work.

        "-114- HOW TO WELD HETEROGENEOUS INSTITUTIONS INTO A HOMOGENEOUS SYSTEM OF PSYCHIATRIC CARE : THE BELGIAN EXPERIENCE J. ORENBUCH, BRUSSELS- I. INTRODUCTION One would expect an assessment of Belgium's mental health policy to consist mainly of figures. I have myself comoleted a study of the position of psychiatry in Belgium (1) in collaboration with tne research workers of the Study Group on Social Change (GECS) which I run. This is based mainly on the analysis of figures and h^s a substantial statistical appendix (2). Hcwever, althdugh this study contains exhaustive data, some unpublished, on the organization and staff of the psychiatric institutions, presented in very varied combinations, the information on patients is incomplete, because, either the number is not known (as in the case of non-residential centres) or, more generally, because basic information on these patients is missing -which suggests that, in organizing its data collection, the Ministry of Health has not so far taken much interest in the epidemiological side of the question. Although figures cannot be avoided in assessing a medical policy, we do not feel that they can stand alone, firstly, because a critical assessment of the categories to which they apply is essential and, secondly, because even perfect records of methods of treatment and persons entitled to treatment do not tell us whether the psychiatric institutions are functioning (1) J. Orenbuch, in collaboration with C. Bastyns, I. Domb and M. Toledo : The effects of the new psychiatric policy on the staff situation.

Where the last point is concerned - and the people responsible for organizing treatment would be the last to deny it - an assessment will very dften be a list of shortcomings. The reduction in the number of beds expected with the develdpment of non-residential centres has been vary slow 1 \\ per year since 1975 - and this cannct really be attributed to the work of these centres. It is more likely to be the result of improvements in the management and living ccnditions of the hospital. In assessing factors such as good coordination between the teams of hospitals and non-residential centres, the relevance of treatment to a particular conditon, continuity in the approach to a given patient's treatment whatever organization he comes under in the course of his \"career\" with various institutions, etc., one should not rely too much on figures except for data on, for Bxample, tha ways in which organizations \u00e9marge and are run, the options they offer, their social - and particularly economic - conditions and all the problems inherent in coordinating groups and individuals. This is wny I propose to start with a brief historical outline of the situation with which the organizers of the new policy of integrated treatment were faced in the mid - 1970s , I shall then go on to the ways in which the authorities have applied themselves to the problem of coordinating the work of organizations with different origins, powers of organization, allegiances and even patiants; finally I shall describe the present links between in-patients and out-patients services and discuss how their work can be assessed. II. HISTORICAL OUTLINE In its attempt to establish an Integrated system of psychiatric treatment, Belgium was dependent on a variety of organizations which hed been set up with no overall plan of coordination. For this reason the new ",
        "-116- psyohlatrlc policy drawn up between 1974 and 1976 (1) has to be seen in the light of the history of thesa institutions and the schools of thought which produced them. Unlike the situation in France immediately after the war, the development of non-residential centres in Belgium did not arise because of the need of hospitals to find alternatives. As the vast majority of Belgian psychiatric hospitals were private meant simply improving living and working conditions within the Institution itself. Clearly the prime concern of the people running privata establishments for the mentally sick was to ensure that their institutions lasted; they were therefore interested only in the patients being treated then and there. People likely to be admitted or to be discharged , borderline cases, were not relevant to the administrators. Similarly, the requirements of tha patients could not conflict with the smooth running of the institution.There were price increases par day, institutions ware converted into hospitals with specialist psychiatric staff, standards went up in terms of staff and equipment but the size was never reduced and there was nowhere for patients leaving early to go and no system to save them from being admitted in the first place. The concept of the clinic therefore emerged from another quarter and attention was drawn to the hygiene and health needs of the whole population. Tha ideas used to combat tuberculosis or to institute infant welfare were applied to psychiatry and the mental health clinics became centres of preventive medicine (2). (1) A series of three Arr\u00eat\u00e9s Royaux (one per year) amending the psychiatric policy. The first Arr\u00eat\u00e9 (A.R. of 15 February 1974, Moniteur belge of 5 March 1974) did away with tha old psychiatric serices for adults and replaced them with two new types of service based exclusively an active treatment. The second (A.R. of 20 March 1975, Moniteur belge of 24 May 1975) institutionalized non-residantial mental health centres and laid down how they should be classified and subsidized. The \"-hird (A.R. of 3 August 1976, Moniteur belge of 17 September 1976) laid down criteria for tha planning of psychiatric hospitals, such as the maximum number of beds or places per thpusand inhabitants. (2) The Ligue Nationale Belge d'Hygi\u00e8ne Mantale (Belgian National Mental Health League) was set up in 1923 on the lines of the National Committee for Mental Health set up in the United States in 1909. By 1930 there were about ten mental health clinics in urb an centres in the country, many of them using Red Cross premises. ",
        "-117- Initially, this preventive work was restricted to diagnosing the problem and sending the person to a psychiatric hospital or another organization and checking up on patients who had been discharged to prevent a relapse. While a non-residential centre of this kind is tha counterpart of the hospital, the work it does is not complementary. It acts as a kind of bridge between the normal and medical worlds or, more accurately, between no treatment at all and the maximum amount of treatment - as an in-patient in a hospital and keeps the two worlds apart. The idea that prevention consists solely of diagnosis gives the hospitals a complete monopoly where treatment i<* concerned and, as a result, they are under no pressure to reform. This is a typical divlson of labour. Without a clear objective of cooperation in the interests of the whole system (i.e. in tha interasts of the patients) and not of a part of it, changes in the services offered would have turned the two sides into competitors. Because the idea was a sequence rather than complementary and care was divided into prevention and cure, non-residential centres remained out in the cold whilst the hospitals maintained their established prerogatives. The work of the clinics nevertheless brake the monopoly of hospital psychiatry. Although their approach was not in itself an alternative to old-fashioned treatment, it did open up other possibilities, mainly for tha following three reasons : 1. the clinic introduced the idea that new methods ware required to help and support a mentally sick person whose condition was not, or was no longer, bad enough for in-patiant hospital treatment; 2. the emphasis put on the need for early preventive medicine as an aid to effective treatment helped to integrate the \"madman\" into the field of social medicine which implied a shift of emphasis in the work of tha psychiatrist; 3. the gradual introduction of a social worker into the clinic vindicated social work as a relevant part of psychiatric work and brought with it specific types of assistance. To this ware added epidemiological studies (1) and psychoanalytical theories which, by pinpointing tha importance of the environment - in both (1) e.g. larga-scala American studies such as \"Social Class and Mental Illness , a community study\" by A.B. Hollingshead and F.G. Redlich, J. Wiley, New York - London, 1958. ",
        "-118- the broadest and the most restricted sense (social and family) - in the aetiology of mental disorders, made room for more realistic and sophisticated preventive work alongside individual fallow-up or diagnosis. As the underlying causes of certain behavioral disorders were still too difficult to fight In view af the social inequality which existed (and still exists), preventive medicine was geared to the medical aspects of the problem and treatment for people in danger of having to go to hospital rather than the causes of the disease and the condition giving rise to it. This new approach to prevention, which now covered early treatment, made the work of non-residential centres what it is today - the emphasis on psychotherapy and rehabilitation (psychoanalysis, games therapy, speech training, reeducation for dyslexia, etc.) and a different kind of patient from those undergoing in-patient treatment in hospitals - less serious cases, younger people, more women, better social background, etc. In fact this practice did not have legal forca until 1975, when the Arr\u00eat\u00e9 Royal on the mental health services (SSM) as they are today was issued. The 1953 ArrSt\u00e9 Royal, which had been the first to recognize mental health clinics in fact sanctioned only the preventive aspect of their work in the strictest sens (1). From that date until they were given satisfaction, the clinics went on asking for increases in subsidies and staff in line with the trend towards treatment. There is nevertheless an enormous difference between what the clinics do in practica and what is said In Belgium about preventive medicine. One may well ask what makes the members and directors of tha SSM's go on saying that their purpose Is preventive medicine when they have neither the resources nor the time to do it for the moment; it is perhaps the knowledge that as they cannot cure they can only aim to prevent C2). (1) N.B. this A.R. restricted the number of consultations per patient per year to 10 which of course affected the treatment available. (2) e.g. Dr. L. Cassiers : \"Most of our attention will, however, have to be given to the preventive side of our work in 1976. A mental health team cannot justify its existence if it does not try to diagnose psychiatric disorders long before they become apparent\". St Gilles SSM Progress report for 1977, p. 15 ",
        "-119- This aim has not yet been achieved. The difficulties they face may be put down to the division of their work into small units of time, their lack of specific training and especially their often overt refusal to hand over to non-psychiatric organizations and inform them about thp \"roblems for which they cannot take responsibility despite the fact that they would be in a position to observe them through their patients. They do not really see themselves as a pressure group reporting on the potential causes of disease and making all the people responsible do something about it. Another reason why, although they still regard prevention as their ideal function, what the SSM's are actually doing is treating , is probably that they cannot resign themselves to admitting that their work is comparable to that of the psychiatric hospital. Because of the way in which they came about, non-residential centres in Belgium, unlike those in France, did not develop at the instigation of the hospitals in order to create alternatives to the only kind of treatment which the latter could offer. The polntlessness of the concept of prevention as a way of cutting out hos pitalization rather than psychiatry in general, and the conscious or sub-conscious refusal to deal with people who have to be sent to hospital has resulted in this curious hybrid, the SSM's which appear to work on the basis of ultra- personal treatment geared tp cure and have unrealized aspirations where Pr\u00e4vention is concerned. Faced with the need to preserve the private institutipns, the demands of the existing non-residential centres and the need for an integrated system like that of other countries, tha authorities finally opted for an amalgam of very different elements. Instead of going for overall reform through a new law reorganizing the whole of the psychiatric sector - which would have been rather a chancy business in Belgium - the authorities chose to concentrate on reforming the hospital and non-residential sectors individually and in so doing make a functional link between the two possible. The differences between the two sectors which in the past had produced differing, even contradictory practices, the economic interests involved and the resistance axpectad from many quarters to any restrictive reform, also contributed to the decision to abandon any attempt to wipe tha slata clean and start again from the beginning. In an attempt to take all thesa factors into account, tha experts drew up a series of provisions, sector by sector; the Arr\u00eat\u00e9s Royaux of 1974, 1975 and 1976 are the result of this. The logic binding the three Arr\u00eat\u00e9s Royaux never theless bears witness to their overall scope as does the order in which they ",
        "-120- appeared. The tasks allocated to the non-residential sector by the Arr\u00eat\u00e9 Royal of 1975 are in fact impossible if Standards A and \u03a4 defined in the Arr\u00eat\u00e9 Royal of 1974 are not imposed on the hospitals. Similarly, the standards fixed by the Commission on Bed Availability (A.R. of 1976) are meaningless unless seen in the context of the provisions In the A.R.'s of 1974 and 1975. At this point I shall bring my historical analysis to a close and look at what is actually being done now. The purpose of the historical outline was to pinpoint trends in the development of practice outside, and often working against,the influential psychiatric hospital. The aim of the new policy is to close the gap between the two approaches to psychiatry as the first stage in the real integration process. Let us now look at the way in which the people involved implement this new policy and the political and administrative context in which they work. In tha study mentioned (1), our approach to analysis of the problems of integrating treatment was twofold. The first part involved questioning the parsons affected at various levels by tha implementation of the 1975 documents. We also analysed documents, whether published or not. describing the situation at the time the Arr\u00eat\u00e9 was issued. The second part was empirical and Involved visits to six mental health centres where we were able to axamine the way work was organized, the possibility of integrated care, team work, etc. (with several or all members of the team, according to the centre). SamB of the centres gave us information from the files on their patiants (without disclosing the identity, in accordance with medical ethics). We also consulted the progress reports of a number of centres other than those we visited, for supplementary information on these points. III. HOSPITALS AND NON-RESIOENTIAL CENTRES : PRACTICAL WAYS OF COORDINATING THE VARIOUS BODIES RESPONSIBLE FOR PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH Consideration of the relationship between the hospitals and the non-residential centres brings us to the key requirements of the integrated cara policy - continuity of treatment and fulfilment of the needs of the population of a specific geographical araa. The question of continuity of care determines the type of relationship to be (1) Footnote (1), page 1. ",
        "-121 instituted between the departments working in the geographical and population area under consideration. The repeated mention of the nasd for coordination between the hospitals \u25a0 and non-residential centres in the A.R. of 1975 is indicative of the fact that continuity is the guiding principle of the new psychiatric policy. In the first place, by giving the SSM's a basic psycho-medico-social team corresponding to that provided for in the A.R. of 1974 for hospitals, the authorities are giving the members of the hospital and non-residential centre teams a chance to find a common languags which breaks through the structural barriers of the institutions themselves and even to work part time for both systems. The A.R. also makes it compulsory for each SSM to conclude a written agreement with the hospital psychiatric services and with other centres and departments. This measure represents a more detailed version of a similar provision in tha A.R. of 1974 on the relationship between A and \u03a4 teams and non-residential centres. The mast notable characteristic of this provision is that the content of this agreement is not defined - it is left to the initiative of the teams concerned. The third provision to ensure coordination requires each SSM to be represented an a coordination committee instituted at the initiative of one of the health organizations of the sector (article 20 of the A.R. of 1975) and consisting of members of the teams linked by the written agreements and representatives pf the preventive medicine departments working in the fiald of mental health. The purpose of the committee is to organiza contacts between the departments tp ensure, for example, ccntinuity of treatment. Finally, there is a national committee (which should be regarded as a regional committee in view of the more recant Arr\u00eat\u00e9 on regionalization) within the Ministry; it is large and consists of representatives of the organizational side of the SSM's and the psychiatric hospitals, SSM workers, and representatives of private medicine and preventive medicine, its Job is to give an opinion on any subject concerning the SSM. By making collaboration possible through the psycho-medico-social nucleus in each of the two sectors, the individual written agreements and the possibility of half-time work, we get round the problem of establishing a single team or a single organizing body which is what has been done in other countries. We also hope to find a way of reconciling the activities of the private and public institutions with a view to collaboration and thus make the hospital much mora open. ",
        "-122- The success of this policy depends firstly on the capacity of the hospital to adapt itself to highly specialized and intensive care. It depends also on the capacity of the non-residential centres to take on serious psychiatric cases which they have so far been glad to pass on to the hospital. As already mentioned, counting on the work of the SSMs - and on a distinction being made between real psychiatric patients and those not really in need of this kind of treatment - the third part of the new policy (A.R. of 1976) provided for a reduction in the number of beds, but over the past five years , this has been happening only very slowly. Furthermore, It is more likely that the slight redudtidn recorded can be put down to a reduction in size in a few hospitals and to increases in staff than to any hiving off by the SSMs. Because there has been no overall demographic and clinical study of people undergoing treatment at the non-residential centres, it is very difficult to check theories about the role and efficiency of the SSMs within the overall system or about the demand for treatment in relation to the incraased supply of centres authorized to dispense it. From the incomplete data we do have, a number of general trends have nevertheless emerged since the publication of the 1975 Arr\u00eat\u00e9 Royal. Although we have no precise figures for the period in question, the increase in the number of patients which started between 1374 and 1975 is apparently continuing. This increase Is not due only to an increase in the number of centres or in the number of new cases but to the increase in the proportion of chronic cases in relation to patients in general. Although tha situation is not dramatic everywhere, the tendency cases is not the prerogative of hospital psychiatry (1). As far as we can see, SSM patients ara mora often chronic cases of economic or social distress than of serious mental disturbance. Because the SSMs are not on tha whole able to do anything about the causes of their problems, great use is made of neuroleptics, anxiolytic agents and other tranquilizers. Communication with other bodies responsible usually takes the form of discussions, information or training rather than Joint management of cases requiring treatment varying in kind and degree. What all this means is that the possibility of integrated treatment depends (1) This phenomena was observed by Werner Fisher who found that the annual increase in the number of chronic cases at tha Genava centre (85 \\ between 1967 and 1973) was much greater than the number of new cases (15 % ).

        "-123- only very marginally on the gcod will of the people mainly concerned. It really depends on radical changes in practice in the two sectors. Can we now stand back sufficiently to be able to assess the way in which continuity of treatment is working in practice ? This is a difficult question to answer. Dr. Dupont told us recently (1) that the people responsible fcr the A.R. estimated that it would take two or three years for the new policy to cerne in and for any initial readjustments to be made. Although no amendments are to be made for the moment we feel that, in view of the effects of the economic crisis on the implementation of subsidy program mes for non-residential centre and hospital teams approved on the basis of standards A and T, it is both possible and useful to draft an initial impression of the trends observed in connection with the integration of the hospital and non-residential centre teams. Generally speaking, there is no doubt that the hopes of the promoters of the new policy both In relation to the teams' functional links and their interpretation have not been realized. In other words there is no integrated psychiatric treatment in Belgium at the moment. Very often the written agreements berween the SSMs and the hospital psychiatric departments have been purely a formal response to the conditions laid down for the mental health departments. They have so little practical value that many SSM workers do not even know the name of the Institution to which they are linked by this agreement. Evan if they do know, it is by no maans certain that they will be informed that one of their patients has been taken into hospital and, if they find out at all, it is whan ha has left tha hospital and come back to consult them. Although the avowed aim of the hospitals and non-residential centres is integrated psychiatry this is not obvious from the demands they make. All, with certain exceptions, have asked 'or Improvements in their own status and resources with no reference to integration. Thay have gone even further, in areas where belief in the work of the sector is particularly strong, the non-residential centres have refused to be shackled by consultations and efforts -albeit fruitless - have been made on more than one occasion to obtain day centres, emergency centres or accommodation independent of the hospital sector. It thus appears that the authorities are alone in their d\u00b0sire to organize integrated treatment. Under these conditions, they are not in a position to CD Interview, July 1979. ",
        "-124- back measures which meet with so little enthusiasm among the people concerned. The measures are therefore indications rather than decrees; this is why, last year, the Ministry had to send the SSMs and hospitals a circular restating the need for functional links between the two bodies. It has often been said (see Workshop, Dave, June 1979) that it is personal contact between the two sectors and not legal provisions which govern collaboration. As this kind of contact would automatically become closer with time, it would form a basis for the gradual establishment of functional links. This brings us back to the problem of flexibility between the teams and the opportunities for joint work provided for in the Arr\u00eat\u00e9 Royal. So far only very few physicians work in both sectors and the number of psychologists and social workers who do so is hardly worth mentioning. IV. PROPOSALS The idea of flexibility between the non-residential centres and hospital teams has remained no mora than a pious Intention. We have examinee all the reasons for this failure and triad to find ways of solving the problem - because encouragement has not been enough. The problems are the same whether SSM workers spend some of their time in psychiatric hospitals or the other way round. The first possibility appears to be blacked, firstly because tha psycho-madico-social teams of the SSMs ara still at tha running-in stags and secondly because the psychiatric hospital is still in many cases a closed world. It would also seem to be more apprppriate fpr the psychiatric hospital workers to come out, even if it is only for the purposes of follow-up, because it is more satisfying for them to extend this work outside than it is for non-residen tial centre workers to try to continue thalr work within an institution which is still too frequently, and with good reason, regarded as an object of resentment. This last suggestion Is difficult to put into practice because tha medlco- psycho-social team of a psychiatric hospital is very small indeed. How could the 280 psychiatrists, 136 psychologists and 180 social workers responsible for some 24.000 patients take on activities outside the hospital ? Apart from this, habits are hard to break and it is also vary difficult to work in places frequently far apart. It \u00cc3 therefore highly unlikely that, having been employed to do a particular job in a particular place, anyone will voluntarily take on the problems ",

Another idea is to set up floating teams aware from the start that Job is to ensure a functional link which is little use on paper if the key staff are not provided. Furthermore, the training period would be the ideal time to introduce the idea of Joint work - with which neither side appears to be familiar. Although it would be ridiculously authoritarian to impose the practice on staff, it would ba both possible and desirable to introduce the idea into tha training courses of psychiatrists, social workers and nurses, psychologists and psychiatric nurses. So much for the link between hospitals and non-residential centres. This improved formula cannot run itself, however. As we have seen the SSMs have by no means sufficient contact with other social assistance or even cultural bodies and these bodies do not have much contact with one another. The result is that they are saddled with patiants who would be quite happy to consult other bodies or these other bodies in conjunction with the SSMs whilst the serious cases are sent to hospital even when they could do something with them or there ara other alternatives. It is up to the coordination committee provided for in the 1975 Arr\u00eat\u00e9 Royal to encourage contact between the various sections of the system but, apart from the fact that hardly any of these committees have really been set up, it would appear that the information thay are supposed to distribute and the contacts they are supposed to organize are still too restricted to the field of health. Furthermore, setting up committees of this kind depends on the initiative of one of the bodies concerned which makes the role of this body doubly difficult; firstly, because of the work and, secondly, because of the problem of status which a decision of this kind would inevitably involve. Moreover, the coordination committee appears to be duplicating the work of the medico-psycho-social teams and to be tied to a particular body within a system which it has to both organize and establish from a series of scattered units. We would propose something like \"travelling salesmen\" allocated to each sector who would move from one to the other getting to know the situation and the opportunities offered and whose job would be to obtain information about the network and to organize any contacts regarded as useful. They would not have to be either medical or psychology experts as their duties would be more like those of social workers or cultural organizers - who are of course not usually very mobile because they are attached to a specific centre. It is therefore up to the State which wants an integrated system to provide the means of implementing its policy. ",
        "-126- We realize that tha proposals we have just made to deal with resistance to the Institution of integrated psychiatry will have little effect if an attack Is not made on the social and economic conditions which produce the segregated system of treatment which everyone wants to maintain and no one is prepared to stand up for. V. THE QUESTION OF FIGURES - QUESTIONABLE FIGURES At the beginning of this paper it was pointed out that figures alone were not an adequate illustration of the position of psychiatry. There are two arguments to justify this based on the two ways of dealing with mental health. Mental health can be seen in a broad sense;it then involves a wide range not only of methods of treatment and institutions to carry it out but also of social and even political action such as making the community more tolerant, integrating patients into the life of their city, linking the question of the independence of \"patients\" to an increase in the decison-making power of the inhabitants of an area or the workers in an undertaking (1), etc. Thus , an area which depends only very marginally on a specifically medical approach, cannot be assessed in terms of the cost of treatment, the amount of technical intervention, the duration of consultations, periods spent in institutions , etc. This is why we can sympathize with the Italian Psychiatrie Democratica which found it impassible to assess its activities according to traditional parameters which hardly reflected the spirit and practice at all - especially as it was done too soon i.e. before it had been possible to establish a basis for'democratic assessment'. Even if the concept of psychiatric work is restricted to specific activities, a quantitative assessment is pointless unless the categories within which the assessment is being made have been decided. Now, although assessment which was originally simply a census, is improving and gradually taking the form of an analysis of the efficiency of treatment involving following up the psychiatric career of the patients, we still feel that there is a serious omission - assessment of the treatment itself. Its range and effects. There is a wide range of treatment because of the variations in the material resources of the institutions (1) We ara thinking here of the experimenta in the integration of mentally- handicapped persons into non-protected work carried out, for example, in Parma and in Brussels in 1973 with the help of the trade union organization Satca - FGTB. ",
        "-127- responsible (from full In-patient troatment to a simple consultation) and because of the fact that there are allegiances to so many different schools of though In psychiatry. This means that psychiatric treatment cannot be assessed in terms of cost, time given, staff and equipment required, unless these items are seen in the context in which they are practised which affects them far mora than the Arr\u00eat\u00e9s Royaux. To disregard these variations in practice - which are often differences of opinion (psychoanalytical, genetic, behavioural, gestaltist, psychopharmaceutlcal, neurological, etc. therorias) is to believe that integrated psychiatric work can be planned by simply transferring integrated scientific practice to psychiatry.

        "-130- THE STATE OF PSYCHIATRIC CARE ONE YEAR AFTER THE COMING INTO EFFECT OF LAW 180 61/5/1979) RAFAELLO MISITI, ROMA Introduction The data presented in the present report were obtained within the framework of a \"finalized\" research programme funded by the Italian National Research Council known as the P.M.M. (Prevention of Mental Illness) project. The starting point for this project consisted of those hypotheses which considered the institutionalization of mental illness, especially of its rejection and alienation by society, to be a serious pathological and pathogenic factor, and that viewed the public \"offer\" of institutionalizing medical treatment as one of the main causes of the corresponding \"demand\" into which mental suffering is channelled. The project is thus characterized by a study of the real situation regarding the old and new psychiatric welfare services in Italy, as well as by the objective study of the ways and means of doing away with the mental hospital institution and of redirecting the welfare demand. Fur the sake of interest, the main aspects touched upon by this research programme are as follows : 1) Reference data a. the new psychiatric service users b. the state of implementation of law 180 in the Italian provinces (partly dealt with in the present repdrt) c. the organisational choices of psychiatric services adopted in the various provinces d. the use of psychopharmacological agBnts during infancy e. the function and legal status of new professional operators (especially psychologists) in the psychiatric services ",

Data gathering methods and instruments a. standard documentation form for the psychiatric services for each intervention b. data summary card concerning admission to public and private structures c. instruments for analysis of organisation and functionality of psychiatric and para-psychiatric services d. data cards concerning : - reconversion of P.H. (psychiatric hospital) function - official activity of tutelary magistrates - financial aspects of psychiatric welfare e. instruments for investigating the quality of life of users of ths social and psychiatric welfare services with special reference to the analysis of the \"purpose\" of everyday activities f. techniques and materials for training psychiatric service operators. 3. Organisational and action models a. comparison of different methods of action in situations of psychiatric crisis and emergency b. comparison of new organisational and socio-medical service models after the psychiatric reform c. comparison of different approaches to the problem of drug addiction. The new psychiatric reform law As you are no doubt aware, in May 1378, the Italian parliament passed a highly innovative law rsforming the psychiatric service (known as law 180). This law, the text of which is reproduced hereafter, basically provides for the closing of psychiatric hospitals to new patients within 3 months (admission Is still possible for patients having bssn admitted before the law came into effect), and the establishment of small \"diagnosis and care sections\" (SDC) within the general hospitals, as well as for the boosting of the community services. This law subsequently became an integral part of the law setting up the National Health Service. ",
        "-132- The data contained in the present report were obtained by mailing a questionnaire to the provincial administrations of the various psychiatric services. By means of continual reminders and checks (both by telephone and personally) tha workers engaged in the P.M.M. project succeeded in getting the questionnaire answered satisfactorily in 95 \\ of the provinces. Significantly, the questionnaire was printed by a ccoperative composed of ex-patients frpm the Trieste Psychiatric Hospital. Table 1 reflects the management of \"direct and indirect\" psychiatric care by the Italian provinces. The fact which emerges is that barely 54 '-. of the provinces administer the entire psychiatric, welfare network directly (i.e. P.H.s and out-patient services). Analytically, this table shows how tha percentage of prpvinces administering welfare directly decreases rapidly as you move from the North to the Centre-South (from 66 \u00b7< to 47.48 Hi. (In this connection, it is significant that 42 H of the charitable Institutions are situated in the South, against 25 H of the public psychiatric hospitals). The fact that only 54 H of the provinces directly administer the entire psychiatric network reveals the lack of resppnsibillty felt by many lpcal authcrlties as regards welfare. By restricting their own function to mara financial suppprt, thay have set many obstacles in the way of those administrations that are desirous of modifying the structure of the psychiatric services. Table 2 shews the results pf the censuses taken on 31.5.78 and 31.5.79 of patients in psychiatric hospitals. This data indicates a decrease , greater in tha South, which is in keeping with the expectations of law 180,even though the problem of what to do with the nearly 10.000 ax-patients remains to be solved. It must In any case be emphasized that, except in a few local cases in which very high percentages compared with the national average are found and whiph, in any case, call for soma clarification as to their underlying causes, the much discussed situation of indiscriminate discharges from hospital did not materialize and, in any case, in tha years preceding the law, there seemed to be a gradual decrease in the number of inmates of psychiatric hospitals. Table 3 sets out the differences between voluntary and compulsory admission to public institutions in the two years taken Into consideration. There is seen to bs a steep, almost uniform drop in compulsory admissions in all the various parts of Italy. ",
        "-133- As for voluntary admissions there appears to have been a gradually declining increase as you go from North to South. In fact, a good deal of the voluntary admissions merely replace tne preceding form of compulsory admission. Moreover, it has been observed also in experiences in other countries that the number of admissions and discharges of the same patients increases during the initial phase of de-institutionalization. If the total number of patients is taken into consideration, there appears to be perfect stability in the North, while there is a certain decrease in the Centre and South. Table 4 refers to admissions to private institutipns during the two years of the survey. It reveals that the much feared switch from public to private did not occur. It must be admitted, however, that in some provinces a certain kind of hctel-cum-home has sprung up almost furtively and has eluded our survey. Table 5 deals with the Diagnosis Services and the General Hospital institutes, again broken down into the three zones. The actual number of services established was 159 (as at 31.5.79). The tables also set out, in terms of real frequency, the typology of the operators employed in the Diagnosis and Care Services and the number of beds available par 10.000 inhabitants. Firstly , it is apparent that the indications sat out in article 6 of law 180 have been implemented by a very large number pf provinces in a comparatively short time. Comparison shows that the greatest contribution has come from operators previously working in the PHs. It is noteworthy however, that tha largest number of operators coming from other territorial services is concentrated in Central Italy. Another observable fact is the almost exact equivalence of available beds per inhabitant between North and South, while the ration in the Centre Is lower. Table 6 refers to community services. It must be pointed out that thera is little homogeneity between provinces regarding the concept and tha practica of territorial service. The opening hpurs mostly coincide with the traditional working hours of public offices (8 A.M. to 2 P.M. , that Is at national level, with a peak of 66 H in the South). Some promise of a service catering for users' needs more adequately (open twalva or twenty-four hours a day) is to be found in the percentages referring to the North and the South in which, although still to a very small extent, tha service also covers the night-time (in six provinces). ",
        "-134- On the whole, the data are conducive to both positive reflections as regards the real possibility of development of the services and to negative one regarding the delays with which the concrete implementation of the reforming principles contained in the law is carried out. The same differences apply also to the existence of family-houses (63 H of the northern provinces and 52 \u03a0 of the southern ones have already begun to set up these structures, as against 8 % of the southern provinces). The average number of users of these structures is 5 persons in tha North, 6 in the Centre and 7 in the South. Furthermore, in the North, thers is ons family-house for every 100,000 inhabitants (it must be noted , however, that 133 of the 295 family-hausos in the North are located at Parma),one family-house every 300,000 inhabitants in the Centre and one every three million inhabitants in tha South. Of interest, although still to be fully evaluated, especially as regards the real level of effectiveness of the services provided, are the data on the composition of the teams formed by the service staff and which, particularly in Central Italy, are found to be composed of operators of nan traditional training background, such as psychologists, sociologists, group leaders, etc. Central Italy has also the highest personnel to population ratio (1.7 per 10.000 inhabitants). The table indicating the expenditure for financial aids paid by the Provincial Administrations has not been included. The indexes cannot be extrapolated as there are too many interacting variables - the data are not uniform for all provinces - there are enormous differences in the amount of expenditure borne by each P.A. and in tha amount of the financial aids themselves (which range from 15,000 to 300,000 lire per month). It Is this very fact which shows that purely quantitative data ars not in any case sufficient for an evaluation of the financial aids problem (even though there should be a levelling of the actual amounts paid) as the basic problem is to ascertain which policy the financial aids are supposed to represent, e.g. welfare, patronage, whether they are a dangerous incentive towards the establishment of a chronic condition or a stimulus to attain a higher degree of independence from the family or institution. It may be added that, at least as far as the official data seem to indicate, there has not been any increase in the number of suicides since the law came into effect. ",
        "-135- Concluslons Clearly, the data contained in this report refer only to quantitative aspects, even though some of them may be interpreted as indicative of certain features of the service (B.g. working hours, numbsr of inmates of family houses, etc.). But all this is obviously not enough. What sort of life do the inmates of the family houses lead; what sort of care do the CIM (Mental Hygiene Centre) users get; what are conditions like in the hospital SDCs (diagnosis and care services); what is the position of the former PH operator in the new organization; what problems do the ex-patients cause to their families; what happens to patients after discharge and what new human rslationship do they establish ? Special research on each of these aspects is obviously necessary, and the P.M.M. intends to do this. Without such research, it is not even possible to assess the true significance of the decrease in the number of compulsory admissions. The PH is now a thing of the past and this is an irrevocable choice. The data indicate that the law is gradually being implemented In all the provinces and Is giving the lie to all alarmist tendencies and preconceived ideas. The problem of the quality of life of the users is tha real problem facing the scientist, politician and welfare worker, and it is hera that the relationship between the day-to-day experience of the services, political and administrative choices, and scientific rasaarch must be closest. We surely have not told you all you wish to know. Let us however hope that the new law will not only come as a healthy shock In the modernization of the psychiatric services in Italy, but that lt'will also serve as a stimulus towards the establishment of regional information services capable In future of providing speedier and more satisfactory answers to questions concerning the effects of the introduction of new welfare and organisational practices.

ITALY The House of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic passed; The President of the Republic promulgates the following law : Art. 1 : Voluntary and compulsory Health Survey ard Treatment. Health survey and treatment are voluntary. In the cases mentioned in thie law and in those cases explicitely foreseen by State laws, the Health Authority can order compulsory health survey and treatment with respect of the person's dignity and the civil and political rights guaranteed by the Constitution, including, inasmuch as possible, the right to freely choose the physician and the health care center. Compulsory health survey and treatment at the expenses of the State, public bodies or institutions, are carried out by public territorial health care centers and, when hospitalisation is needed, in public or state-subsidized hospital facilities. During the compulsory health treatment, those who are under treatment have the right to communicate with any person they think right. Compulsory health survey and treatment mentioned in the previous paragraphs, must be associated with initiatives that will assure the consent and participation of the patient. Compulsory health survey and trealment are ordered by a Mayor proceeding, in his quality of local Health Authority, on a justified proposal made by a physician. Art. 2 : Compulsory Health Survey and Treatment for mental Disorder. The measures mentioned in paragraph 2 of article 1, can be taken against those persons suffering from mental disorder. In the cases mentioned in the previous paragraph, the proposal for compulsory health treatment can envisage hospitalization care only if mental disturbances are such as to require urgent therapeutical interventions; if these interventions are not accepted by the patient, and if there are not the conditions and the circumstances for taking immediate and timely health care measures outside the hospital. ",
        "-138- The measure implementing compulsory health treatment in hospitalisation conditions, must be Preceededby the ratification of the proposal mentioned in the last paragraph of Art. 1, made by a public health service physician, and must be justified in accordance with what foreseen in the previous paragraph. Art. 3 : Procedure relative to acmvulsory Health Survey and Treatment in Hospitalisation Conditions for mental Disorder. The measure, mentioned in Art. 2, by which the Mayor vnposes compulsory health trealment in hospitalisation conditions, supplemented with the justi fied proposal of a physician - as mentioned in the last paragraph of Art. 1 - and with the confirmation - as mentioned in the last paragraph of Art. 2 - mu3t be notified by a communal Messenger within 48 hours from the admission into the health center, to the tutelary judge of the some district of the communal administration. The tutelary judge within the following 48 hours, after having made inquiries and ordered the necessary controls, issues a justified decree for the confirmation or non confirmation of the measure, and communicates it to the Mayor. In case of non-confirmation, the Mayor orders the cessation of the compulsory health treatment in hospitalisation conditions. If the measure mentioned in the first paragraph of this article, is taken by the Mayor of a communal administration different from the patient place of residence, the Mayor of this place must be informed. If the measure mentioned in the first paragraph of this article is taken against aliens or stateless persons, the Prefect must inform the Home Office and the competent Consulates. Should compulsory health treatment exceed 7 days or should it furtherly prolonged, the physician responsible for the mental health service, as mentioned in Art. 6, must in due time send a justified proposal (indicating the further assumable duration of the treatment itself) to the Mayor who has ordered the hospitalisation of trie patient; and the Mayor must inform of it , the tutelary judge, with the formalities and for the accomplish ments mentioned in paragraph 1 and 2 of this article. The physician mentioned in the previous paragraph is obliged to inform the Mayor (either the patient is discharged or remains in the hospital) of the cessation of the conditions which require compulsory health treatment; moreover, he is obliged to communicate the eventual impossibility to carry on the treatment itself. The Mayor within 48 hours from the receipt of the communication of the physician , must inform the tutelary judge. ",
        "-139- If necessary, the tutelary judge takes the required urgent measures to preserve and administer the patient's properties. Omission of the communications mentioned in paragraph 1, 4 and S of this article causes the cessation of all effects of the measure, and is considered omission of office deeds crime, unless there is not sufficient evidence for a more serious crime. Art. 4 : Revocation and Modification of comptxlscry Health Treatment Measures. Anyone can make a request to the Mayor for the revocation of modification of the measure enforcing or prolonging compulsory health treatment The Mayor decides within 10 days on the request of revocation or modification. Revocation of modification measures are put into force with the same procedure as for modified or revoked measures. Art. S : Jurisdictional Protection. Anyone who undergoes the compulsory health treatment and anyone who has interest in it, can appeal against the measure ratified by the tutelary judge, to the Court of his jurisdiction. Within 30 days, beginning from the expiry of the period of time as mentioned in the second paragraph of Art. 3, the Mayor can appeal against the non-ratification of the measure enforcing the compulsory health treatment. In the trial held in a court of law, the parties can stand without defence counsels and can be represented by a person in possession of a mandate written at foot of the appeal or in a separate document. The appeal can be sent to the Court by means of registered letter with receipt notice. The president of the Court fixes the hearing of the parties with a decree written at foot of the appeal which is notified to the parties and to the Public Prosecutor by the Registrar. The President of the Court, after having received the measure enforcing the compulsory health treatment and after having heard the Public Prosecutor can suspend the treatment itself even before the hearing. The President of the Court decides on the request of suspension within 10 day8. ",

Art. 6 : Procedures relative to compulsory Health SuirJey zrd Treatment in Hospitalisation Conditions for mental Disorder. Prevention, care and re-habilitation relative to mental illness are usually carried out by mental health service centers outside the hospital. From the coming into force of this law, mental health treatments which require hospitalisation and which are at the expenses of the State or public bodies and institutions are carried cut in the mental care centers mentioned in the following paragraphs, except for what specified in the following Art. 8. The autonomous regional and provincial administrations of Trento and Bolzano - taking also into account the territorial ambits foreseen in paragraph 2 and 3 of article 25 of the Decree of the President of the Republic n. 816 of July 24, 1977 - single out the general hospitals in which appropriate mental health centers for diagnosis and care must be created within 60 days from the coming into force of this law. Tne centers mentioned in paragraph 2 and 3 of this article, - which are regulated in accordance with the Decree of the President of the Republic iV. 128 of March 28, 1969, concerning compulsory special centers in the general hospitals and which must not have more than 15 beds - with the purpose of guaranteeing the continuity of the health service for the protection of mental health, are linked to the other mental health service centers of the territory, as far as staff and functions are concerned, in a departimental organisation. The autonomous regional and provincial administrations of Trento and Bolzano single out the private medical establishments which have the compulsory requirements necessary for voluntary and compulsory health treatments in hospitalisation condition. As to health service needs, the provincial administrations can draw up conventions with the establishments mentioned in the previous paragraph in accordance with the following Art. 7. ",

The autonomous provincial administrations of Trento and Bolzano maintain their present competence. Hospital health service - regulated under articles 12 and 13 of the Decree N. 264 of July 8, 1974, afterwards modified and transformed in Law N. 386 of August 17, 1974 - includes hospitalisation for mental disorders.

Until the date of coming into force of the National Health Service Reform, and at any rate not further than January 1, 1979, the provincial administrations continue to perform the administrative functions relative to the management of the mental hospitals, and any other function relative to mental health and hygiene centers. The autonomous regional and provincial administrations of Trento and Bolzano plan and coordinate the organisation of mental health and hygiene centers with the other health service facilities of the territory, and carry out the gradual removal of the mental hospitals and the different utilisation of the existing facilities. These initiatives cannot involve higher expenses in the provincial administrations budgets. At any rate it is forbidden to build new mental hospitals, to use the existing ones as specialised mental departments of general hospitals, to create mental departments or units in general hospitals, and to use for this purpose neurological or neuropsychiatrie departments or units. The prohibitions - mentioned in Art. 6 of the Decree n. 946 of December 29, 197?, afterwards modified and transformed in Law H. 43 of February 27, 1978 - are applied to mental hospitals which depend upon provincial administrations or other public bodies, or upon public welfare and charity institutions.

        "-150- THE USE OF A MENTAL HEALTH CASE REGISTER FOR THE EVALUATION OF MENTAL HEALTH POLICY G.H.M.M. TEN HORN, GRONINGEN (\u00b0) The overall picture of mental health care in the Netherlands is rich, varied and at times confusing, care is delivered by a variety of agencies, services and institutions and is administered by a great variety of associations, foundations and authorities. Long ago mental hospitals were built on purpose in the more tranquil and green areas of the country, which leaves us today with their uneven geographical distribution. In addition, there Is an increasing number of psychiatric units in general hospitals and of psychogeriatic institutions, boarding houses, long- and short-stay houses. Shortly before and immediately after the Second World War out-patient services were developed to deliver differentiated care, such as after-care, care for the mentally retarded, alcoholics, delinquents, psychogeriatrlc patients, disturbed children, people with marrital and family problems or with problems of living and for prevention. The result is a large variety of Institutions with different objectives, different orientations and strategies, originating from various denomina tional bases, and financed in different ways. This situation is fertile ground for various forms of overlapping care and for sarious gaps, particularly because services feel only responsible for patients who already passed thair Intake procedure, the concept of responsibility for a defined catchment area is not yet readily accepted by the Dutch mental health care system (Dewez at al. 1973!. Partly because of criticism from anti-psychiatrists and from patient-organizations and partly because of its high cost, our system is Increasingly under discussion. In 1974, the unsatisfactory situation was discussed extensively In Dutch parliament (memorandum 1973-1374). Since this time many committees, initiated by the Minister of Health or by regional authorities or by the institutions themselves, have studied problems and (\u00b0) sociologist at the department of Social Psychiatry, University of Groningen, the Netherlands. I am grateful for the assistance and guidance of professor dr. R. Giel, head of the department. This article was presented earlier at tha 3th World Congress of Sociology Uppsala, Sweden, 1378 ",
        "-151- written proposals for change. More rational planning is attempted at several levels. However, one of the major obstacles is our lack of insight in the functioning of services. Neither the specific needs of particular categories of patients are known nor the contribution of various types of services to the total delivery of care. Our knowledge concerning outcome and efficiency of different treatment programmes is Just as deficient. One question, for example. Is whether a more closely organized and continuous system of care would prevent a number of patients from being admitted. The reason for our lack of insight in the functioning of services could be that we have been caught In the same pitfalls as were discussed by Mechanic (1968), when he commented on tha sociological literature concerning general hospitals. He observed that most studies have been descriptive of one or two services, and have failed to capture the diversity in size, organizations and oomplexity that characterize the mental health care system. In addition, there is little agreement about the most lmpprtant variables waranting study. As a result, there is no way of accumulating knowledge. Often research took place in too small a part of the system, with ad hoc Instruments and with little concern for the relationship between the stated objectives of an organization and its actual performance. An attempt to gain insight The department of social psychiatry of the university of Groningen has been studying the functioning of mental health services in the area for tha past ten years. Giel participated In an international pilot study. Initiated by the World Health Organization. He conducted his study in the province of Friesland, in the north of the Netherlands (Giel, 1974 a, 1974 b, 1977). The first step was an inventory of all in-, day- and out-patient psychiatric services in the area. This was already an Improvement on earlier studies which were Just concerned with the mental hospitals in the Netherlands. It was fait, that tha period of time covered by the study in Friesland was too short to answer some essential questions concerning the delivery of mental health care. Therefore a psychiatric casa register was set up In 1973. It seemed that a register would be more helpful to gain Insight in tha complex structure of mental health services In the Netherlands, particularly If it could be continued over a prolonged period of time. ",
        "-152- The advantages of such a register have been discussed by Wing et al (1967) : 1. tha information can be compared with data concerning the total population of the area and with results of other counties, because a register is based on a defined pppulation. 2. the common bias which arises from considering only one or a few psychiatric agencies can be avoided and unduplicated cohorts of patients can be made, because in a register the (demographic, social and clinical) information about each patient collected is ordered patiant-wise and combined with a full record of all the contacts the patient makes with all the agencies and services invclved in the register, 3. the pathway of anyone patient can ba traced through contacts with many agencies, time trends in the pattern of contact can be studied and the effect of Introducing new services into an area can be observed, because in a register the information is longitudinal on all contacts of anyone from the area with all different psychiatric services serving the area. 4. complex sampling for special studies can easily be undertaken with a register because it consists of records of total samples. A register helps us to obtain basic information for rational planning and for evaluating the implementation of change. Tha start of the register The case register was organized in 1973 and started to function on the 1st of January 1974 (Giel et al, 1976). It is a record-system, modelled after the Camberwell register (Wing, 1967), for accumulating data on contacts with psychiatric services of all people living in a geographical defined urban area in tha north of the Netherlands, with a population \u00f3f approximately 43.000, mainly In middle class and upper-working class occupations. There is an abundance of mental hospital beds In the neighbourhood of the register area and a wide range of ambulatory services within 'easy reach of the population. The register began with a census of patients in contact with psychiatric services on the 31st of December 1973. All patients residing in mantal hospital. In a psychiatric unit of a general hospital, in an addiction clinic, a hospital for the mentally retarded or in a psychiatric nursing home ware included in the census, as ware all day-patients attending on that day. All out-patients, attending an out-patient service with at least one psychiatrist ",
        "-153- (full- or part-time) on its pay-roll, who had contacted the service at least twice within three months around censusday, were also included. Patients not counted during the census, who began an episode of contac subsequent years, have been included since. To guarantee confidentiality and tha maximum of privacy tha choict was made to link the records of contacts with a probability record- linkage method. In this way collection of personal data such as name and address is avoided. Further safeguards ware a supervisory committee with memfcers from the participating institutions and the inspectorate for mental health, and regulations concerning the collections, storage and use of data. Point - and one year - prevalence In 1974 tha average number of beds occupied on any one day was 4.02 per 1000 of the total population. Almost two-third (64 Hi were patients who remained in hospital all year. In the same year the inventory in Friesland, a neighbouring province, revealed 3.89 occupied beds which are comparable with 3.76 beds of the register area, as can be seen from table 1. The point-prevalence count showed that 53 H of tha occupied beds in the register area were in the mental hospital, compared with only 28 H of the occupied beds in the province of Friesland. This province has fewer mental hospital beds than most other provinces of the Netherlands (Oewez et al., 1973). There is, however, as can also be seen from table 1, another major difference between the register area and Friesland : compared with the latter (34 %) , the register area has a vary low percentage of beds for mentally retarded occupied (21 \u00ef) and also a lower percentage of psychogeriatric bed3 occupied ; 16 H In our registar area and 31 H in Friesland. It appears that, whatever the pattern of in-patient services, we have to reckon with approximately 4 psychiatric in-patients or mentally retarded people In hospitals per 1000 of the population. A more or less fixed number of patients occupy beds, whatever the nature of the latter and their suitability. ",
        "-154- The annual rate of first or new episodes in psychiatric out-patient care was different for the two areas. In 1974, 10.7 people per 1000 of the total population in the register area had a first or new episode in psychiatric out-patient care, compared with 7,5 in Friesland in 1971. Changes since 1971, as well as an abundance of services in the register area can probably explain the difference. In the register area roughly 1.2 H of the total population was in contact with a service on censusday and another 1.4 % made contact during the subsequent year. It might be that these figures reflect only that whenever services are offered they will be used, or that as long as beds are available they will be occupied, no matter the wealth of out-patient services. In the Netherlands in- and out- patient services developed as separate organizations, which explains why more emphasis on one type does not result in closure of the other. Both types will fight for survival. The point-prevalence and one-year prevalence rates hava remained stable over the past five years. Examples of the use of a register In the next few paragraphs we will present some examples of the particular type of information that can be collected by means of a register. Wa want to demonstrate what it means to avoid the common bias which arises from considering only one or a few services. In addition, we want to illustrate the value of cummulative data in showing the pathway of patients through many agencies. Multiple service users On census day and during the subsequent years of 1974 and 1975 we registered a total of 1594 patients. Up to the 1st of November 1976 28 H (446) had contacted mora than one service. Some with even more than two agencies : 110 people contacted three services, 31 four and 8 five. Of patients who used more than one service 20 H went to several out-patient services, most of the social psychiatric service in combination with the out-patient department of a mental hospital. Apparently for these patients several services had to offer something. However it is not yet clear whether these services have to be sean as complementary or overlapping. It has been suggested by their staff that It may concern one of the following : ",
        "-155- . the services are not aware of that they deliver the same or different type of care to one and the same patient. . patients hike from one service to another, all the time discontinuing contact with the previous one. or . patients contact various services with their knowledge for different types of care. For example, one for medical treatment and the other for family therapy. Our findings suggest that a detailed analysis of register-data ccncerning the type of care given by the out-patient services, is necessary. They throw also some light on possibilities for change and indicate that the total number of people In out-patient care will be overestimated if it is based on the totals of Individual out-patient agencies. The remaining 80 H of patients who used more than one service, switched from an out-patient to an In-patient service or vice versa. An analysis of the data on the pathway of these patients through the service system will throw light en the degree of the integration of care. Degree of integration of services - continuity of cars Although the picture of the Dutch mental health care systerr is quite comolex, it is possible to distinguish groups of agencies that ere to some extend affiliated. There is the mental hospital with its out-patient department, secondly the psychiatric unit In a general hospital with its out-patient department and thirdly the group of in- and out-patient services for people with alcohol or drug problems. We will use the term \"sector\" for such a group of affiliated agencies : the M.H. sector (mental hospital), the P.U. sector (the psychiatric unit) and the A.D. sector (services for alcohol and drug problems). From our findings the latter two sectors appear more Integrated than the first one. Half of the patients in de A.D. sector who changed agencias did so within the same sector. The same occurred In the P.U. sector. Of patients In the M.H. sector only 26 H remained within that sector, when they changed. The majority contacted the social psychiatric service after leaving the mental hospital. The latter pattern is not unexpected, since the social psychiatric service, although It was organized separately from the M.H. sector, was set up around 1930 to screen patients before admission and to deliver after-care. ",
        "-156- Durlng the past 10 to 15 years most mental hospitals started their own out-patient departments. On the one hand, this development may have complicated after-care because patients now contact two different out patient services, but on the other hand it may have improved continuity or- care. Our findings suggest that in order to guarantee continuity of care, closer collaboration is necessary between services already affiliated in a sector, but also between agencies that do not belong to the same sector. From figure 1 it can be seen that for the 'patients with alcohol or drug problems close collaboration is necessary not only between services within the A.D. sector, but also between out-patient services of the A.C. sector and in-patient services of the M.H. and P.U. sectors, since all treat such patients. The in-patients services of the M.H. and P.U. sectors should not only collaborate with the out-patient services in their own sector, but also with a wide variety of other out-patient services, particularly with the social psychiatric services. The category of multiple service users can be considered when continuity of care is discussed, the category of discharged patients though also. From our register we know that 25 H of patients who were discharged in 1974, after having been admitted for a maximum of six months, did not receive any follow-up as out-patients of a mental health service in the year following discharge. Another 14 H were readmitted during the first year after discharge, also without any intervening out-patient contact (ten Horn, 1976). Thus, in the complex organization of our services certain patients become users of several services but others loose contact with all of them. Without longitudinal unduplicated data on contacts with all services It would be very difficult to reveal these consequences of the complexity of our mental health care system. Specificity of care The question with which we deal briefly in this paragraph is : \"Do patients with comparable problems receive pare which differs according to the agency they contact ?\" The analysis of data concerning patients with alcohol or drug problems, who entered tha register in 1974 or 1975. underlines the variety of treatments. Some contacted only specialized services, the services of the A.D. sector, while others got involved with a mixture of specialized (A.D. sector) and non-specialized agencies or with non-specialized agencies only (i.e. tha M.H., P.U. sector and the S.P.S.) (ten Horn,\u00b7 1976). Among the latter two groups were more women and elderly people, who were more often referred by a ",
        "\u00ad157\u00ad doctor. The first group was more often referred by police or Justice\u00ad department, and fewer had previously had contact with a psychiatric agency. Although it is questionable to speak of comparable patients or problems, their treatment differed tremendously, both in number of contacts per patient and in length of stay (table 2]\u25a0 Why is it that patients who attend a specialized out\u00adpatient service (the A.D. sector) receive many more contacts than others who go to non\u00adspecialized out\u00adpatient services ? And why is it' that patients in the in\u00adpatients services of the M.H. and P.U. sectors do stay on average more than twice as long as those in a hospital of the A.D. sector ? The above example of how a register can be used for special studies on a total sample without time consuming complex sampling. Further more, this type of information brings services to discussing the meaning of the various kinds of care they deliver : are they meaningful differences or traditions which are continued without full conslderence ? New services From two examples, one of a new service and one of an enlargement of an existing out\u00adpatient service, we have the impression that increasing such services results in increased (administrative) morbidity rates. The most obvious example was that of the initiation of a psychcgeriatric out\u00ad patient service. It reached new cases whom it could keep out of mental hospital or psychcgeriatric nursing home. However the number of psychoge\u00ad riatric in\u00adpatients decreased only slightly between 1\u00ad974 and 1975, as can be seen from table 3. Their length of stay in hospital increased slightly, mainly because of the number of people remaining all year. It appears that an expansion of out\u00adpatient services does not automatically offer an opportunity for reducing the number of beds for psychogeriatric patients. Perhaps the fact that in the past the availability of these beds has not kept up with the growing number of elderly people, or a passible change In society's tolerance for psychogeriatric problems can explain this finding. The^second example was that of an out\u00adpatient department of a mental hospital increasing its availability by shorteningand changing the intake procedure. During the period the change took place, the total number of their intakes increased significantly, from 671 intakes in the 50 weeks before the change of the intake procedure in november 1977 ta 939 in the 50 weeks after. ",
        "-158- No concurrent decrease or increase in number of intakes at any ether in-, day- or out-patient service in the register area could be established. It was clear from the data that with the new intake procedure the out-patient department catched to some extent a different patient papulation, with milder symptomatology but quite some contacts previously with other services. The above examples serve to illustrate that it is possible with a register to measure not only the effects of changing a service just for that particular service, but also for the entire mental health care system. Sudden Interruption of care Because the register produces a complete record of the patient's contacts with all agencies, it Is not only possible to observe effects of changes for the system as a whole but also for only one service, such as are due to illness of a staff member. In this example we discuss only the effects for patients already in contact at the time the staff member fell ill. Our findings from studies of several of such events, indicate that patients do not switch to another service. In larger institutions soma might start contacting another staff member. On the whole, patients Just wait for their professional helper to return. During the months following such an interruption of care, they appear to make up for the missing number of contacts, ending up with the usual annual total. An example of the practical use of tha register is the following. In case the patient is out of contact already for three months, without'a notice at the last contact that It would ba the final one. In such cases the ragisterteam asked the services to fill out a form with a question about the reason etc. Initially this form was used purely for register purposes to complete data. Now it is used by many of the participating services to identify drop-outs or as a tool to prevent loosing contact with patients in need and to provide the services with a day to day picture of their actual case-load. Discussion A psychiatric case register is a rather expensive tool which funds generally have to be wrasted from the government during rather tiresome transaction, in which the researchers have to prove its value. In our case these transactions harbour an interesting paradox. On the one hand, the government is very keen on evaluation research to develop a more rational basis for planning, which up to now was mainly based on ideological statements. On tha other hand, when the researcher asks for evaluative questions to which he can put his skills and research instruments, ha finds ",
        "-159- that the authorities have difficulty in formulating such questions. In the end, it tends to be the researcher who starts defining a problem and seme questions distillatlng them from official policy statements or from his own experience. The obvious danger is that the authorities are unable to digest and put into practice findings which are sometimes more of scientific rather than of practical interest. To give some examples from our register and some other epidemiological surveys the following may serve. One of the questions which we could extract from policy statements, is whether strenthening out-patient services results in a reduction in the use of psychiatric bads. Our findings indicate that our produce out patient services reach new and other patients without any evidence of a reduction in the use of beds. This suggest that the only way to reduce the number of beds is the painful decision on the part of the governement to clcse down particular wards. However, it has to expect that in case it takes thi3 line of action, the majority of expelled patients will show up in some other institution. Another topic, introduced mainly by public opinion, concerns the need for more specialized beds for psychogeriatric patients. When comparing tha different regions in the Netherlands, we found an unvarying total of elderly patients In a variety of institutions. In the register area mental hospital beds appeared to be a substitute for beds in psychogeriatric institutions in the province of Friesland. This indicates that it may be necessary to develop more specialized institutions in certain regions, provided that other institutions reduce their number of beds. This involves again painful decisions on the part of the government. So far. one of the main obstacles to change appeared our lack of Insight in the functioning of services. This is only part of truth. Other factors,such as differences in the funding of various services and the administrative independence of institutions, have to be included. At quite another level, this type of evaluation research has considerable implications for the participants. To run a register needs the loyal and continuous collaboration of the staff of mental health services, in our case close to one hundred fieldworkere. When a register is being Introduced fisldworksrs require much persuasion. The register-team is looked upon as people mainly furthering thair own scientific interest. One has to admit that scientific reports hardly aver provide a guide for practical application of results. Therefore separate reports specially geared to the needs of the services have to be written and many hours have to be dedicated to discussion with fieldworkers at all laveis, as well as with ",
        "-160- clerical staff. The matter of confidentiality concerning patients is an important subject to be settled before hand. As described earlier, we decided to use a probability record linkage method to avoid collection of data through which people could be easily identified, like name and address. Storing data, also computer material, in locked cupboards and rooms and having a set of regulations for register-teammembers, under supervision of a committee with representatives from the services and from the inspectorate for mental health were necessary measures. Another subject for intensive discussion was the diagnostic classification of unique people and their unique problems. We nave used several exercises In diagnostic classification to overcome resistance against labelling people. We found that introduction of a register does not stop with its introduction. It is a continuing process, with at least monthly contacts with all agencies and with regular meetings during which results . are discussed with small groups of collaborating fieldworkers. Sometimes we have to discuss individual tables or even results displayed in one cclumn in a table to assure that the meaning of the findings gets across, because most fieldworkers are not used to reading figures. After soma five years with the register in operation, we can say that by now the various services participating in it are formulating their own questiqns for research and avaluation or are putting results into practice. The question of a service to evaluate the change of their intake procedure is an examplB. Another service asked for an analysis of the functioning of its multidiscipllnary teams yet another asked for an estimate of the discrepancy between the number of people contacting services with marital or family problems and the amount of marriage- guidanca or family therapy given in the region. In these cases questions came in the initial phase of planning a change. We soon hope to produce our first paper authored Jointly by the register-team and some fieldworkers. If we had foreseen the amount of time contacts with the field would involve, we would have planned and asked for additional and special staff for this purppse. We npw find that we have to spend more and more time on answering questions from the field, which is essential, but at times occurs at the expanse of our own theoretical interests in epidemiological studies. Particularly since following patients over a large number of years enables us now to design special epidemiological studies. ",
        "\u00ad161\u00ad In summary, the above amply illustrates that a case register can provide a solution to deficiencies as outlined in the Introduction. It enables us to obtain insight in the structure and functioning of the mental health care system, although additional and special studies are ultimately needed to answer questions on the effectiveness of treatment.

        "-167- Working Group 1 Chairman : prof. P.L. Morosini Rapporteur : drs. G.H.M.M. ten Horn The group consisted of 10 members : 8 psychiatrists, of whom four in administration positions and four in either research or working in a mental health service, and a economist and sociologist, from 8 European countries. Discussion Prof. Wing started the discussion with the proposal to differentiate monitoring and evaluation , in order to clarify the different needs that have to be met by particular data-collBCtion-systems and studies. The Working Group felt the proposal very worthwhile and started with the discussion an information needed for monitoring. It was felt that in each country a minimum of relevant, centrally available, nationally based Information, which should be readily accessible, is absolute necessary \u00a1 information on In-patient services (number of inpatients, length of stay, number of r\u00e9admissions ate.) as well as on day- and out-patient services (number of attendances, contacts etc.) Furthermore, such information should be comparable with that available in other Europaan countries. It was fait, that at the moment, international comparison is unreliable and because of lack of certain information sometimes even impossible. Oftan data are not readily available. The W.H.O. report \"Mental Health services in Europe\" (1976) by late Dr. A.R. May was discussed as an example In this context. Since a considerable investment of labour and effort is involved In the collection of data for current national information systems but hardly comparable and readily available, the working group recommended : [recommendation 1) : to apoint (and finance) a group of experts to set standards for a minimum data collection in the mental health field in all European countries and to develop a common terminology. In addition tha working group thought it would be advisable to collect these minimum national data on a regional level. This should be done by collectors that do work part-time in the clinical field to bridge the gap between planners and clinicians, to guarantee feedback of information and to higher the level of reliability of the data. ",
        "-168- It seemed to the working group that at the moment, drug-prescription is one of the few better defined and agreed upon subjects in the mental health field. Thus the output from data systems could be credible and reliable and extremely relavant, because some members thought information feedback to the clinicians could already help in lowering the drug prescription. Therefore, the working group recommended (recommendation 2) : to promote in each european country an active monitoring information system on drug prescription in the field of mental health. Preferable in collaboration with health insurance-companies. Members of the working group questioned the usefullness of much of these national collected data in the mental health field If soclodemo- graphic data and morbidity data in the general population are rot available. Therefore it was thought needed to repeat periodically population-surveys to have some notion about the population characteristics such as the mor bidity, the attitude towards mental illness and towards mental health services. Whereas the foregoing concerned promoting data systems for monitoring, members of the group felt that local case registers and cohort studies would be a better starting point for evaluation. A local case register is in itself a monitory instrument but the output of data can give clues for special studies. It was felt that in these pilot study areas experimental studies could be undertaken to evaluate the outcome of different types of treatment. This can be done rather easily because of easy entrance and contact with the field. The working group believed that more financial assistance should be made available in most of the European countries to guarantee research groups of good quality. Important changes, on a nationwide level should not be made till good evaluation of experiments is available. Therefore the working group recommended (recommandation 3) : to promote financing several research groups of good quality in each european country and to concentrate evaluation research in these pilot areas. When it came to consider the outcome-criteria of evaluation studies, the working group found itself grappling with difficult problems. It did not seem that there are many self-evident criteria adopted by the different countries or by different psychiatrists. Nevertheless the working group thought that it Is of great importance to develop such criteria. Preferable this can be done by the mentioned research-groups, assisted by the earlier mentioned group of experts. In the discussion suggestions were made to explore crude outcome criteria such as : number of inpatients oer 1000 of ",
        "-169- the population, length of stay, proportion of the population living on a disability-pension because of mental illness, proportion of days on sick leave, percentage of the population consuming psychotropic drugs etc. As to the jse of information of monitoring data systems and of evaluations studies it seemed to the working group that there is, in most european countries, a lack of skills in interpreting statistical data. The relative feedback cf information should be different for planners, clinicians and scientists . Only then the output can be seen to be credible, relevant and reliable so that its use can become increasingly important and frequent in policymaking, programme planning, clinical management and health education. The working group felt that on local and national level there is a need for committees in which planners, researchers and clinicians are represented. These committees should promote the use of the information systems. To overcome the lack of skills the working group recommended (recommendation 4j : to develop a European-study centre where administrators, clinicians and researchers can be trained in monitoring and evaluation. The group of experts already mentioned could be the core group of lecturers. Furthermore, the working group though that interpreting and using statistical data is in most countries a neglected area in the training of psychiatrists, of whom many are (or will be) in positions responsible for planning. It is desirable therefore in the view of the working group that (recommendation 5] : in the education of clinicians more attention should be given to the training in knowledge and skills in interpreting statistical data and in mental health administration. Owing to shortage of time the working group did not find it possible to explore in any depth or in a systematic way the totality of the theme \"evaluation and mental health care\", but members of the group felt satisfied with the outcome of exchange of ideas of different disciplines from different countries. Indeed most members mentioned they felt the topics discussed most interesting to take back home and to reflect on. ",
        "-170- Working group 2 Chairman : Prof. H. DILLING Rapporteur : Dr. VAN DER WERFF Objectives of evaluation were the main subject of the group discussions. We had the impression of an illimited field into which we first had to put limits. Needs : Needs and demands in a given population are not to be regarded a3 a standard on a fixed level. Mental health services as well as general health services very much depend of the sociocultural factors of a given society. For instance highly urbanised populations will show a much higher demand than agricultural with traditional family clans. Wa compared as an example the needs and services In Tansania with those in Luxembourg or Denmark. As a first step of evaluation we would have to measure the existing services, study the functioning and the usa of those services, as well as their economical resources. The presently not fulfilled needs may be determined by epidemiological methods. The next steps have to be the change of services according to the need of the population, followed by the evaluation of the new services. Constraints to evaluation : An important obstacle is the lack of motivation among the fieldworkers who feel that they have to serve their clients but who often are not motivated to report scientifically about their work. Then there is a lack of interest among those who are dealing with health policy. The policy makars vary often do not recognize mental health as a topic of first order. Further thara is concurrence between different services : at the administrative, local, intermediate and the higher level there are problems of coordination. Cuite important seem to be legal restrictions concerning the privacy of data about the patients in mental health services. ",
        "-171- F.ec emmerda t io n s : Concerning basic information about treated patients and institutions it is recommended an international comparative frame as to collect the minimum of necessary informations. The same preferably standar dized data atcut services and patients should be available in the different memoer countries. In connection with this there is need for a common glossary concerning the mental health terminology. At each country level : after having cevelopped, on an international basis, those information systems, there shcuid ce d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e national registers concerning services and institutions, like inasxes which have to be provided regularly by data of the health services. On a local level special case registers for certain purposes are to be recommended. Those registers should not be limited to research only. Juridical measures, at the European level, should be harmonised as to protect the patients privacy. Governments should elaborate long-term research programs, including the field of evaluation. There should be included different kind of users in coooperation with the scientists. Public health policy programs of health objectives should be connected with research programs as to be evaluated. This work could be enabled by national institutes entrusted to do the coordination and management of this research. Information about the mental health systems should be collected by the Institute and redistributed to the users. A very important field of action for this research would be the alcohol problem, a field in research where the results could by rapidly applied. As a general principle changes in the health field should be introduced only after pilot-studies which reveal many different aspects, later to be regarded in applying the new policy. ",
        "-1 72- Worklng Group 3 Chairman : Or. J. Casselman Rapporteur : Dr. W.J. Hardeman. I. What is Evaluation ? The group stressed the distinction between data collecting, description and evaluation, the latter being comparison of data according fixed criteria. In addition to evaluation proper the group distinguished other evaluative activities of a more subjective nature. It was thought that both, objective and subjective, evaluative activities are needed in the process of decision making. Some group members f e lt that decision-makers rarely mads use of objective evaluation whereas others showed examples of good cooperation between research workers and decision makers. I I. Problems in Evaluation. Evaluative processes in mental health are faced with the following problems : 1. In mental health, conceptualization is much more complex than in general health. 2. Demands of the administration to research workers are broad in scope, vague in ccnception and net specific enough in objectives. 3. The time schedule of decision makers is usually not at a ll congruent to that of research designers. 4. The administration wants short-term answers. 5. The administration often changes its policy before evaluation has been carried out properly. 6. Communication between administration and research workers is not continuous and rarely in both directions. 7. Field workers are net motivated to supply necessary data. All these problems are multiplied in evaluation of prevention programmes. ",
        "-173- III Recommendations. To solve the problems, the group thought of the following recommandations : 1. Teach (future) professional field workers to build in simple evaluative procedures in their daily activities. 2. Feed back to field workers the evaluated information they have supplied . 3. Legislate the - if necessary complsory - output of a minimum amount of data that are required for rational administration; safeguard In this legislation the privacy of patients. 4. Insert special staff between decision makers and research workers to promote good two-way communication between both groups and more use of objective evaluation procedures. IV Priorities for evaluative research 1. Epidemiological and social psychiatric studies, not only of patients, but also of the community in general. 2. Delivery of care of mental health service systems, e.g. by case-register studies. 3. Evaluation of preventive programmes, e.g. in alcohol problems and in suicide. N.B. The feasibility of outcome studies was thought to be problematic. ",
        "-174- Worklng Group 4 Chairman : prof. J.E. Cooper Rapporteur : Dr. G.C Timbury 1. General IntrodJC.tion The group discussed the concept of evaluation and cama to a definition which included the elements of : . description of services . measurement of change resulting from new services . making a \"value\" judgement - I.e. was service or change \"good\" or \"bad\". \"Value\" might be (a) financial (cheaper ?) (b) clinical (recovery ?) (c) political/ideological. The group did not discuss specific clinical treatment prpgrammes but considerad general principles only. The group than attempted tp review the various methods of description available in the countries represented by the members and the factors which should be examined when measuring a change of policy or of service provision. The group also discussed the ways in which a change of policy or practice might come about. Four possible ways were considered : (i) Natural evolution - this would include the adoption cr \"Imitation\" of practices from elsewhere, til) Professional innovation - the introduction of change on the basis of \"the good Idea\" by one or more of the key members of a service or department, (iii) Political change - a new national policy imposed by new legislation. (Iv) Rational change - introduced after adequate previous evaluation (This is the rarest form but the most favoured by the group. ) Evaluation as the group defined it (i.e. description, measurement, judgement) may be conducted at various levels. For example (1) Individual - \"self assessment\", (II) Local service - \"peer group\" or assessment by neighbouring team, (iii) Regional or National - a larger scale examination using a research programme based on a case register or national data collection system. ",
        "-175- The group favoured the use of all three apprpaches but in order to attain local acceptance would recommend their introduction in the order described. The group's highest priority would be tc educate all mental health workers to regard an \"evaluative apprpach\" as an essential part of their professional work. Thus the first objective of any evaluation should be to attempt to Improve patient care but other considerations - financial; acceptability by the families of patiente and the general public and staff satisfaction; are all important. Within the various groups of mentally ill patients requiring care our members believed that the problems of elderly persons with mental disability demanded the most urgent attention by policy makers and those concerned with evaluation. 2. Some descriptive or measurement systems available in countries represented by the group's members 1. GERMANY : Local case registers. Proposed population opinion survey. 2. DENMARK : Case Registers. 3. HOLLAND : Case Pegisters. Financial information. 4. U.K. : Mental Health Statistical Returns. Health Advisory Service. Mental Welfare Commission (Scotland) Local Case Registers (Camberwell, Aberdeen, etc.) Health Service Accounts (Financial Comparisons) Educational Inspections (doctors, nurses, psychologists, etc.) 5. CHINA : Local Mental Hospital Data. There was considerable discussion about the political acceptability of national data collection systems and of the potential dangers of political control and loss of confidentiality. In addition limitations are Imposed by the existence of a large private treatment sector in many countries. National data collection did not usually Include Information on out-patients or clients of social services. ",
        "-176- 3. Discussion of the consequences of a change in policy, to illustrate the many changes in a mental health service that might need to be evaluated. The group decided to consider an example of a policy change, and to list some of the consequences that could be evaluated - in this way the many levels and varieties of \"evaluation\" can be illustrated. The example chosen was of a policy change, taken centrally, to reduce the number of acute psychiatric bads by 50 H over a short period of time (six months to a year) and over a large region or a whole country. It was noted that if at all possible, such a major policy change should result -rom systematic evaluation, rather than from sudden political or economic considerations, so that baseline data could be obtained against which change could be measured. As a minimum requirement implementation of a policy change should be delayed until some basic information about services and patients has been collected, for use in subsequent comparisons. Two basic types of information for evaluation of such a change can be differentiated - (1) objective factual accounts, such as number of admissions and discharges and contacts with services, and (2) subjective opinions and value Judgements which may come from patients, relatives pr the professional workers concerned. These two types of information should be regarded as complementary and decision for action will be likely to be more satisfactory If both are taken into account. The following were considered to be the main consequences of the policy change used in the hypothetical example : (a) Effects uppn tha patient as an individual, such as his place of living, style of life and pattern of activities, enjoyment and quality of life, as well as clinical change In symptoms and behaviour. (Case registers were agreed to be a vary good way of following some of these aspects.) (b) Effects upon the family of the patients, such as : . increase in the expensa of domestic help . changes In daily living patterns and personal relationships . changes in the personal health (both mental and physical) of other family members. ",
        "-177- (c) Effects upon local communities : . at the level of streets or lccal districts, in terms of resistance to the founding of hostels and homes fcr the patients by local residents' associations etc. . increases In the use of existing community facilities such as lodging houses, group homes, hostels provided by churches and voluntary services . an increased burden upon community agencies with professional staff and responsibilities such as Social Services ana prooation services . effects upon unemployment rates, minor crime rates and any local financial support agencies. (d ) Effects on other parts of the Health Service, such as : . the rest of the psychiatric services, particularly out-patients and day-patients; . medical, surgical and geriatric services . the use of emergency and casualty departments of general hospitals . the use of Drimary care systems. This list illustrates the complexity of the changes which could be evaluated and the many different types of agency that would be Involved. 4. Conclusion The group agreed that discussion of the topic of evaluation by members working in dlffferent countries and in very diverse settings had been of great interest and had helped In understanding some of the practical difficulties which had to be -faced. ",
        "-178- Working Group n\u00b0 5 Chairman : Professor \u0392. PISSARRO Rapporteur : Mr J. CRENSUCH Good mental health should not be defined as merely being an absence of psychiatric illness or syndrome, whether this is under treatment or not, but as a balanced state (a state of \"total well-being\") on which psychological, social, biological and economic factors weigh (these factors themselves are inter-related) and to which individuals respond either by adapting, by exhibiting minor symptoms, by becoming ill or by dying. But the notion of \"good health\" is especially difficult to define, in particular in the field of mBntal health. EVALUATION should as a result have as Its aim : to make clear exactly how an overall policy on mental healtn (preventive measures and treatment, organisation of health services, etc.) can lead to an improvement in the standard of health of the population for which it is intended. The diagram underneath shows how this health policy might appear : Situating the problems 1 Choosing priorities I Objectives I Programmes Implementatipn According to this diagram evaluation constantly provides feedback information which makes it possible to substantiate, invalidate or modify what has already been done. ",
        "-179- The fact is that often for reasons of methodology and approach, evaluation is only (or can only) be carried out for : - measuring the activity and operation of health services in relation to the means at their disposal, with no reference to effectiveness; - sometimes, the effectiveness of the treatment used in psychiatric practice can be evaluated; - sometimes, mental health policy can be evaluated by means of the legislation which is its basis. I. Situating the needs of a population means taking account not only of those people on whom mental health services have already focused because they are under treatment or have requested treatment, but also involves those people who are potential patients or who find another and/or different outlet for their feelings. But this involves making a definition of what mental health \"needs\" are. \"his is very difficult because of the underlying ethical, social, political and cultural factors, which are to some extent to blame for the fact that the meaning of the word \"needs\" and the notion behind it has been reduced to the number of requests received for psychiatric treatment. Even then, it Is difficult to obtain precise data on the prevalence pf psychiatric illness. Generally, this is done using consumption indices, basad on either the health insurance system, but of course not everybody belongs to this system, in the Fourth World for example, or on the number of people who are undergoing treatment in a psychiatric institution. If this method is used, the same patient may well be counted two or three times, given that there are a large number of services to which he may address himself. Indeed, it does happen that institutions which have no psychiatric calling have on their list of patients cases which would generally be ascribed to \"mental health\", and this means that the index used can no longer include them. One way of correcting this tendency, which would not however do away with it completely, would be to send questionnaires not only to \"mental health\" institutions but also to other institions such as the C.P.A.S. (Centres publics d'aide sociale - French Social Assistance Centres). We had an exemple of this when suicide rates for teenagers were drawn up, based on a study covering five test areas which were selected at random, and which meant that there was great danger of the feedback from the results of this survey being applied to the whole population. ",
        "-180- Surveys before a decision is taken can be carried out on a national scale, but far more relevant measures can be applied if surveys are conducted at regional or lpcal level. These surveys should be largely devoted to Identifying the risk factors, in particular in the social and economic field. II. Just as there are no real indicators of needs at the moment, neither are there any criteria of efficiency which are relevant and can be applied. The nature of the institution to which the evaluation survey is addressed largely defines both which questions will be asked and what value may be accorded to the results. For example, a survey, financed by the insurance council, on \"out-patients\", was not completed, because the department concerned refused to participate. Ano.her case, where the council wished to discover how much time each professionel in a department granted to each of his patients, provided uninteresting results because the people questioned did not agree on the definition of a measuring unit (the Netherlands). Thus it would seem advisable, at present, to encourage the survey teams themselves to evaluate their own work and to grant them complete freedom in defining their own criteria so that their evaluation may succeed. Example : an experiment carried out in the Vend\u00e9e regien of France in which the main criteria applied were reintegration into society, the working environment and the family environment, and whose main characteristic was a refusal to take into consideration overall well-being. Cf. also surveys carried out in Lyons and Grenoble , together with the \u0399\u039d\u039e\u0395\u0395 survey (France). III. Under such circumstances, what is needed is an increase in the research work carried out on these various levels, whilst at the same time avoiding giving priority to problems which are so complex, and for which there are so few resources in methodology and equipment, that they cannot be properly dealt with. (Example : it is extremely difficult to ascertain how effective the campaign against alcoholism has been). Since there are no reliable Indicators of effectiveness, we suggest that, as a first step, a common corpus of questions be drawn up, which would reflect the level of activity of tha health services and the means at their disposal. ",
        "-181- By making clear who does what, to whom, how, when and where, this should be a simple method which would both ensure that results wBre comparable and strengthEn the survey taams' desire to assess how effective their work has been. In addition to the problems involved in defining level of activity indicators, account should also be taken of the scientific and general instruments of assessment which the teams have at their disposal. At local level, the common corpus should be complemented by questions which are in particular centred on the macro- and microeconomic background against which the mental health medicine is practised. It is reasonable to assume that if this tool is used systematically it should be possible for the teams to extract from their assessments efficiency level indicators which could be used elsewhere. It would appear necessary both to stimulate ini tiatives of this sort and to enumerate assessment experiments now being carried out, so that they may be given methodological and financial support. It also appears necessary to assess, using the same methodological principles, experiments in alternative medical practices. If the underlying principles of such experiments were highlighted then this might lead to new notions of needs and effectiveness of treatment. IV. A policy can be assessed by comparing the means planned tc achieve its aims, and the means, method of operation and activities of the institutions which are responsible for implementing that policy. The way in which policy measures are appliad makes it possible to pinpoint the lack of momentum and aven resistance offered to the planned reforms. Although such research is often expensive, it ought to provide an essential data base for decision-making, and it is somewhat surprising tp note how little interest the authorities deign to show in such research (Mr Van der Grinten). Ir conclusion, the Working Group feels that : 1. The basic problem in mental health is that of effectiveness. The Working Group has observed that up to now there have been no indicators of needs and effectiveness available which could be applied in mental health. ",
        "-182- 2. The working group considered the following points to be essential : a) the drawing up of lists of experiments now being carried out in assessment (one cost/efficiency experiment being carried out in the Vend\u00e9e region of France was mentioned, whose focal point was the definition of efficiency criteria by the teams themselves). b) to stimulate others into carrying out efficiency assessment tests, of various types and at specific moments in time, and provide support, both from the financial and methodological point of view, for the teams who intend to undertake such experiments. The working group emphasizes that for some time to come any such measures can only be taken in a purely research capacity, and that no means of assessment should be taken as the sole basis for evaluating the efficiency of a medical practice. c) research into methodology should be continued, in particular in order to determine and circumscribe relevant, reliable and usable efficiency indicators. 3. The recent changes which have taken place in the psychiatric health policy of various countries were based on assessment projects, which concentrated on the activities of mental health institutions and their resources. These new policies must, in turn, be assessed by study projects of the same type and by examining how relevant the measures arB which have implemented them. A research project should be started in order to perfect some simple and comparable methods which could place the mental health practice of various countries within their own macro- and micro-economic contexts. This means that a common corpus of questions is necessary, covering all the aspects of who is doing what, to whom, how, when and where, whether this be in conventional psychological practice or in forms. The corpus of questions must also shed light on developments in these alternative fprms which motivates them, at least in part. This shared data pool could be complemented at local level by the necessary explanatory notes, and will In particular allow the teams to carry out self-assessment. The working group feels that developing the assessments both of activities and of legal measures will encourage the various organizations involved in mental health to assess Just how efficient their own work is. ",
        "-183- SYNTHESIS OF THE WORKING GROUPS REPORTS R. SAOOUN, PARIS As Chairman of this meeting, it is my task to make a 15-minute summary of the contents of the various reports. This does not seem so difficult as I at first feared, because in many cases, quite fortuitously, the working parties have produced similar or complementary recommendations. The aims of an assessment can be defined as to describe, to analyse and to interpret the data subjected to the assessment. In their recommendations, the various working parties have emphasized the need to use standardized procedures whan collecting the data needed for assess ment. It is essential that the surveys should ba held under tha sama conditions, that tha number and type of data to be collected should be decided in joint discus sions and, finally, that there should be prior agreement as to the terms used. It is vital that all these conditions be fulfilled, despite the difficulties involved, since they determine whether the results can be processed and are valid. The recommendations also stress the need to provide informants in the field with the result of the analys\u00e9e carried out on the basis of the Information which they have collected. The success of evaluative research depends partly on this. In this context, it is the methods used for making the results available which should be standardized. All too often It is difficult or, indeed, impossible, to compare the results because the manner In which they are presented (e.g. in the form of tables or graphs) does not follow the normal conventions for such cases. In general, for data assessment are concerned with events and individuals. They also have to nover services and the work they do. Thus, events and individuals on the one hand and services and activities on the other are the first two parts of an equation whose third part Is the reference population. Although all the Community countries regularly carry out population censuses, here too the census methods and results are far from being comparable. The need to tak\u00b0 Into account, at one and tha same time, data on individuals or events, on institutions or measures aa well as demographic data on the reference population means that the evaluative research should be car'fully planned - always bearing In mind, once more, that it is only if all these data are standardized that the results derived from them can be ",
        "-184- compared. The rapporteur of Working Party 2 stressed how valuable it would be to have precise information on the laws and administrative regulations governing the activities to be assessed. It Is true that serious errors of interpretation can be made when there is no precise information on laws and regulations. Thus, In France, voluntary confinement means admission to hospital with the consent of tha patient's relatives but not of the patient himself. In other words, it is the relative who agrees that the admission should take place. In contrast , in other Community countries the patient himself must agree before admission can take place. What should be done to ensure that the assessments are carried out using the methods we have Just outlined ? What recommendations have to be made so that assessments are carried out not only at national but alsi. at European level ? At national level, the first requirement is that there should be good teams in tha field. Once the data hava been collected, they should be centralized. Should this centralization be at local, regional or national level ? The further away from collecting points centralization takes place, the mors complicated the problems of processing and feedback are. All too often, the results derivad from tha data which informants have provided are sent back to the informants by the central organization in a form which does not take due account of the aspects which particularly interest the informants themselves. One of the most important requirements for the proper functioning of Information systems is that the relationships existing between informants in the field and tha bodies responsible for processing the data should ba made quite clear. In some European countries, informants are not sufficiently independant of the government bodies which employ them. This constraint has a very detrimental effect on the quality of information. In general, researchers always have great difficulty in carrying out work requested by administrative bodies. These bodies always need to have the results to hand quickly, and those who actually have to do the work usually think that the time given to them is mucn too short. Experience shows that, in most cases, it is possible to reconcile the need of the authorities to obtain the information they require without delay with the need of tha researchers to have sufficient time to provide it. So that thare should be a good relationship between the providers and the users of information, i.e. so that work can be done properly Instead of becoming more and more bogged down, as is often tr\u00b0 case, because of misunderstandings, contradictions or insuperable difficulties, it is essential that programmes should be drawn up Jointly by all interested parties. ",
        "-185- In addition to work done nationally, international cooperation and, in particular, coordination at European level should be developed. The latter cannot be achieved unless the Community countries wish it to succeed. On the ether hand, if this desire does exist, there will have to be a European organiza tion somewhere in Europe to assume responsibility for this coordination. As all the rapporteurs pointed out, there will be no decisive progress in t h e area of assessment unless training programmes pay due attention to medical statistics, epidemiology and assessment methods. This specialized teaching should be given not only to persons intending to specialize in mental health but also to those who provide the information, i.e. to informants, whether or not they ara doctors, who work in the field. If informants in the field have not received basic training which has convinced them of the usefulness of these methods, they will never become able to provide good data. Apart frpm teaching, progress In assessment also depends on the degree of priority given to research focusing on hospitals, social medicine, disease prevention and health promotion. One of the working parties made a recommendation emphasizing tha values of a system for actively monitoring the prescription of drugs. This is only one asoect of assessment but it reflects the concern caused by the considerable development of chemotherapy and by the undoubted risks facsd by patients if the prescription, administration and supervision of treatment are not subject to precise information and strict control. Befura finishing, two points are worth making. For years, people have been saying that decision-making bodies can work under proper conditions only if they possess reliable scientific information, without which programmes are vary likely to fail or to prove unrealistic. It must not be forgotten, however, that decision-making, by its very nature, may well not be purely rational. The information needed by decision-makers may be qualitative and not statistical. Such information Is sometimes just as important as quantified data and. in some cases, this type of information may even be t h e main basis on which the decision is made. Indeed, decisions sometimes have to be taken before all the requisita quantified information can be collected. However, whenever decisions have bean taken and programmes of action launched, there can be no excuse for not assessing the results and the degree to which they meet the objectives sat. It should be pointed out here that there are two typas uf assessments : those which precede a decision, and those which follow It and ara aimed at gauging its resulta. ",
        "-186- A second important point concerns the need to distinguish between an assessment which is strictly medical and an assessment of mental health. It is likaly that the future will see attempts to assess in an overall way the effacts of treatment or assistance given on the families or the social groups concerned. Towards this end. it should become normal practice for programmes to take into account the consequences of preventive, curative or rehabilitative measures, not only for tha recipients themselves but also for persons around them. This brief summary shows not only the value but also the difficulty and limits of evaluative research. Methods do exist, and many people say they are convinced of their importance, although fewer are ready to use them. In general, a big effort must be made if achievements i n the area of assessment are to match ambitions. The European Community countries can only benefit from international cooperation in this sector. Let us hope that it will come about. ",

SUMMARY REPORT INTRODUCTION Transition from institutional care to comprehensive community care for the mentally ill, including those with chronic disabling conditions, is a major objective of the WHO regional long\u00adterm programma in mental health. Under this programme, the Regional Office is engaged in a series of coordinated activities to examine and stimulate new developments In the patterns of care and service provision for the mentally disordered. In pursuance of this policy, the group was convened to examine ways in which changes are being made in the organization of mental health cara in coun\u00ad tries of the region and to determina how far such developments can increase the effectiveness of care for the mentally ill and disabled. The group consisted of 23 psychiatrists, public health administrators and other experts from 13 countries, appointed as temporary advisers, and 2 members of the Regional Office secretariat. DISCUSSION Chancing itxUat and m\u00e9dical backgivund. Contemporary development of mental health care In many parts of the Region is taking place against a background of demographic and social change. In some countries, reduced mortalit\u00e9 and birth rates have led to an increase in the proportion of the elderly In the population, to a point at which age\u00adrelated problems of illness and dependency are becoming critical. Economic recession has multiplied the numbers of the unemployed, creating massive social problems especially among such vulnerable groups as unskilled workers, immigrants and ",
        "-200- school-leavers. The housing situation is deteriorating in many large cities, while at the same time various indices of social pathology, including rates of crime and juvenile delinquency, are on the upswing. Less dramatic, yet also of great significance for mental health care, are changes in the medical and social services. Costs of health care generally have escalated, with continuing inflation, and in some countries have reached a level at which they are difficult to support. The consequences can already be seen in a cutting-back of medical and social programmes and in shortages of skilled manpower. Simultaneously, demands for greater specialization and more advanced technology have led to the construction of huge new hospital complexes, which are often distant from the centres cf population they serve. Not all current change Is inimical to the principles and progress of community health care. Important favourable trends can also be discerned. Psychiatric departments have been established in many general hospitals. General medical practice in some countries is based more and more on other professionals. There is a growing readiness, among physicians in all specialties, to acknowledge the importance of psychological and social factors of disease. The emergence from medical schools of a new generation of physicians who have received some grounding in the behavioural and social sciences may be expected to reinforce this tendency. Changu in the demand \u00bfox mental health ienuicei. Against this background, it is not surprising that the nature and content of psychiatric practice are changing, even in those regions wnere the service structure has been little altered in recent years. Certain bread trends are recognizable across the Region and ara already being reflected in national statistics. Rates for alcohol-related diseases and for attempted suicide, especially salf-poisoning, are climbing steeply, as is also indicated by epi demiological findings. The numbers of treated psychogeriatric disorders are rising, and these conditions represent an increasing priority in mental health care. The frequency of alcoholism, drug abuse, delinquency and behaviour disorders appears to ba on the increase-among young people, while the age pf onset of such problems is falling. It is seldom possible, from the available statistics, to decide if the observed trends reflect real changes in morbidity, or determine how far they are due to changes in the pattern of service utilization. Seme, such as the rising rates of alcoholism and suicidal behaviour, ara probably independent of service provision, whereas others, such as the increase in psychosocial \"crises\" reported from many centres, may ba more closely linked to the availability of care agencies. ",
        "-201- Whatever the underlying causes, there can be no doubt that the content of psychiatric practice, as well as the demand for care, is altering in ways which the psychiatrist cannot always foresee and can seldom control. It follows that mental health services must bs sufficiently flexible to adapt to changing condi tions, simply In order to keep pace with events in society. But this kind of response is not in itself sufficient, since in no country up to now has a satisfactory standard of prpvision of mental health services as a whole been achieved. The services must therefore not simply adapt to change; they must also improve. Planned innovations in mental health cote. A series of WHO studies have reaffirmed the goal of comprehensive community mental health care. Recently, however, tha working group on Constraints in Mental Health Services Development (Cork, 1977) concluded that the concept was not yet being satisfactorily applied on a wide scale and that changes in public and professional attitudes, as wall as in the legislation, were urgently required. The task of the present group was to examine soma possible strategies for reaching the above goal, as exemplified by experimental projects being conducted at regional or local level in Trieste (Italy), Nacka (Sweden), Leningrad (USSR) and Mannheim (Federal Republic of Germany), and to assess, on . the basis of this evidence, the feasibility of effecting the transition from institutional to community-based forms of care under differing national conditions. Some of the projects were set up specifically with the goal of comprehensiva community mental health cara in view; others have more limited objectives, such as the provision of services for the elderly, for young persons or for crisis intervention. Scientific evaluation, or even the possibility of systematic assessment based on adequate descriptive statistics, is still lacking for many of the services in question. Taken together, the projects provide nonetheless a convincing practical demonstration that progress towards the goal of comprehensive community care can be achieved , given the will and determination, by planned change in the structure and organization of existing services. Moreover, soma of the experiments suggest that such progress can be made without any large capital expenditure or increase in running costs. CONCLUSIONS The group noted with much interest the experimental projects which were reported, based on new patterns for the organization of mental health care in the ",
        "-202- Community. In the projects, which are broadly in line with the recommendations of earlier working groups, favourable results are being obtained by taking special account of the social aspects of mental illness. Such experiments should be developed and pursued in all countries, but there is an urgent need for more systematic monitoring of their results and for scientific evaluation of a number of different experimental strategies. The Regional Office can play a vital role in promoting such research and in publicizing the results as well as national changes in service structure and legislation concerning the mentally ill. No single experimental project can serve as a blueprint for change, since local projects must be planned and designed to meet local needs and to adapt to the prevailing conditions. It is therefore important to recall the following general principles underlying the concept of comprehensive community mental health care, since these also constitute the essential criteria by which the success of individual projects can be Judged. . The service should be community-based, i.e., it snould provide facilities for a defined area pppulation small enough to permit most patients to be treated within easy travelling distance of their homes. . The service should be comprehensive, in the sense that it provides a ranga of facilities, differentiated to meet the needs of persons suffering from any form of mental illness or handicap to ba found in the area population. Specialized forms of care which must be provided on a regional basis should be linked to the community-based service. . The various agendas and services engaged in mental health care for each area population should be so effectively coordinated that each part of the system can contribute to the care of individual patients, according to need, and that patients or their families do not suffer any disadvantage as a result of being transferred from one part of the system to another. This point applies equally to care given by medical and social agencies and nonmedical residential care. . An equal quality and standard of service provision should be available to all persons in the service populatipn who stand in need of mental health care. Irrespective of financial or other considerations. In quality and availability, care for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped should be of a standard not lower than that provided for the physically ill. ",
        "-203- By applying these broad principles, it should be possible to monitor and evaluate the changes made in individual services, and to compare the merits and disadvantages of Innovations made in different areas. The working papers presented during the meeting, together with the discussion arising from them, maoe it clear that mental health care in many parts of the Region is In a state of transition and pointed to certain fairly specific , practical measures which could be applied more widely in order'to initiate or accelerate progress from traditional custodial care towards ccmpre- hensive community mental health care. In this situation, the group considered it a matter for great regret that in some countries large new mental hospitals are still under construction, was of the opinion that no more such institutions should oe built and urged that in futura new inpatient units should be situated in. or closely linked with, general hospitals. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. The running down of existing mental hospitals should be phased so as to overlap with the building up of alternative, community-based services. In no case should chronically ill or handicapped patients be discharged from hospital until or unless adequate supporting services arB prpvided in the community. 2. Facilities for after-care and rehabilitation should ba developed for each service population, within the service area. Joint funding or subsidy schemes should permit costs of continuing mental health care to be mat outside the hospital system, whether In residential homes, hostels, sheltered workshops or other nonmedical facilities. 3. Firm guidelines should be established in each country and region for the allocation of specialist manpower and working time to activities not directly connected with clinical care of patients, particularly consultative counselling and preventiva work. Duties of this kind should, where appropriate, be specified in the contracts of mental health services. 4. Domiciliary visiting by psychiatrists and other members of\u00b7 the mental health team should be made possible, as an accepted part of the duties and responsi bilities, in relation especially to pre-admission screening and to after-care following hospital discharge. ",
        "-204- 5. In the planning of mental health services, a clear distinction should be drawn between primary and secondary levels of care. The contribution of medical practitioners, social workers and other professionals to primary care of the mentally ill should wherever possible, be supported and rein forced by the formation of effective working links with area psychiatric services, as wall as by the provision of opportunities for continuing education in mental health cars for all the professional groups. 6. A simple type of basic documentation should be developed in each area, with careful regard for the confidentiality of personal data, so as to permit monitoring of the activities and utilization of different parts of the service and reliable computing of basic statistics on patient care in all parts of the system, a.g. for Inpatients, day patients, outpatients, prevention, rehabilitation and after-care.
