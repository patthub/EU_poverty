        "Workshop summary After Ispra-2003, Brussels-2004, Tallin-2005, Budapest-2006, the fifth edition of the JRC Enlargement workshop on electricity end-use efficiency and energy services was organised in Krakow, Poland between 12 and 14 of September 2007. The overall aim of the workshop was to contribute through data gathering and expert discussions to the implementation of the new energy efficiency measures and policies in New Member States, Candidate and neighbouring countries in the building sector and to foster a real market for energy efficiency, with a particular focus on the implementation of EPBD and EE&ES Directives and the European Commission Action Plan for Energy Efficiency for achieving a 20% reduction in energy consumption by 2020. According with this aim, through the three days of the workshop the main topic of the presentations and discussing were: financing end-use efficiency, national energy efficiency Action Plans, energy services companies and developed projects, policies and programmes. The 32 presentations from the Agenda were structured in 4 sessions: 1. Financing Energy Efficiency Projects 2. National Action Plans for Energy Efficiency 3. ESCOS projects 4. Policies and Programmes for Appliances, Equipments and Lighting in the Building Sector Mr. Bertoldi from DG-JRC opened the workshop introducing the recent developments of EU energy efficiency policies related to buildings and highlighted the EU targets for 2020, presenting the Action Plan for energy efficiency, the labelling Directives, the Eco-design framework Directive, the Energy performance of buildings Directive, the Energy Services Directive, and subsequently financial aspects and instruments (white certificates). The first session of the workshop, focused on financing instruments and projects for energy efficiency, concentrated together the achievements of international financial institutions and local commercial banks, funds, ministries and investing consultants. Over the session were presented financial instruments, mechanisms and case studies of implemented projects for energy efficiency in buildings, both by International (EBRD, IFC-CEEF) and National (Unicredit, Bulgaria, Dexia, Slovak Republic, Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, Poland) institutions and banks. Greenmax Capital Advisors (Consultancy Company) presented an innovative mechanism and shared the experience in financing energy efficiency in buildings from NMS and CC. An interesting presentation about the Green Investment Scheme in Hungary was done by the representative of Hungarian Ministry for Environment and Water and the UNECE speaker shown the potential for financing energy efficiency in buildings through the UNECE EE 21 Project The second session, comprising speeches held by representatives of National States Ministries or Energy Agencies, offered a panorama of the new National Action Plans for Energy Efficiency (EENAP) in several NMS (KAPE-Poland, CEA-Czech Republic, RTU-Latvia, ARCE-Romania, JSI-Slovenia, ECH-Hungary, SIEA-Slovak Republic), showing the status, the main priorities foreseen but also indicating the main barriers in future implementation. An evaluation of the Energy performance of Buildings Directive (EPB) implementation results in NMSs was done by the REEEP representative. The reports covers: the main findings on the impact of the 2004 Enlargement in the field of energy efficiency, the current energy efficiency policies and measures, the status of transposition of the EPBD in, challenges for the transposition and effective implementation of the EPBD and recommendations for the buildings sector. The Rockwool International speaker presented after a very comprehensive analysis of the EENAP but also the level of harmonisation and the status of implementation for the EPB Directive in European Union, summarising in this way the second session of the workshop. The third session of the workshop was focused on energy services companies and included presentations of the experience in five countries in developing projects on energy efficiency in buildings. After the first presentation of the Central European University representative who presented the major findings of the last ESCO market report prepared by DG_JRC, the representatives of Siemens BT-Poland, Honeywell-Poland, POE-'ESCO'-Krakow-POLAND, REC-Estonia, EL-TEC Mulej- Slovenia, Bulgarian Energy Efficiency Fund-Bulgaria and National Energy Conservation Agency- JRC Workshop on \"Effective Policies for Improving Energy Efficiency in Buildings\", Krakow, Poland, 12-14 September 2007 1 ",
        "Poland showed the main results, the market barriers and the lessons learned concerning ESCOs activities in their own country. The fourth session of the workshop was devoted to policies and programmes for appliances, equipments and lighting in the building sector. Mr. Atanasiu of DG-JRC opened the session presented the last 2006 JRC report on Electricity Consumption and Efficiency Trends with particular attention to the NMSs, report who was also distributed through the participants during the three days of the event. GfK presentation highlight the last market trends for appliances sales on EU market in terms of energy efficiency, it is interesting to note that the appliance market in terms of energy performance is almost identical between EU-15 and EU-12 MS The EURIMA (European Insulation Manufacturers Association) presentation about ways to improve the energy performance of buildings ended the first part of the day offering, together with the previous presentations, a complete overview of the consumption status and the energy savings potential in European Union. The second part of this session was dedicated to the presentations of the three initiatives of European Commission, managed by DG-JRC and supported by IEE additional projects: GreenLight (presented by KAPE-Poland representative), MotorChallenge (presented by KAPE-Poland representative) and GreenBuilding (presented by Mr. Bertoldi, EC DG-JRC). A lot of fruitful and interesting debates started after each presentation and were continued during the general discussions organised after each session. All the presentations can be also found and downloaded on-line on the EC DG-JRC energy efficiency site at: http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/energyefficiency/ To the success of the workshop contributed around 60 participants from 18 European Countries, representing national ministries and local administrations, energy agencies, universities, local energy companies, International and European financing groups, commercial companies and industry associations.

        "Main findings (1) \u2022 The period between mid-90s and Accession was characterised by a rapid decrease in energy intensities in NMSs. Final energy intensity cleared from the impact of structural changes declined by approximately 30 % between 1996 and 2004 on the average in the post-communist NMSs (faster in NMSs than the EU-15 average). \u2022 However adjusted energy intensities in NMSs still remain above EU-15 average for many NMSs and in general higher than can be expected for their level of economic development, however since mid-90s energy intensities have been falling . \u2022 This indicates that there is still a considerable need for further efficiency improvements and for scaling up the ambitions and commitment of NMSs in the energy efficiency field.

        "Main findings (2) \u2022 General economic drivers and indirect policy impacts associated with the Accession process have had a greater effect on the improvement in energy intensities than the impact of the transposition of the energy efficiency acquis. \u2022 These drivers include rising energy prices , growing economic output and economic cooperation with EU-15 countries bringing higher added-value branches , the shutdown and/or modernisation of inefficient Soviet-era technologies and processes, and competitive pressures in an ever-globalising world. \u2022 Given the looseness of many national efforts in the field of energy efficiency, the existing loopholes in implementing the energy efficiency acquis also due to institutional weaknesses and the \u2018mechanical\u2019 transposition, the energy efficiency acquis had some effect on energy intensity decrease in NMSs, but they are not likely to have been a major direct driver in the indicated significant improvement in energy intensities. Main findings (3) \u2022 NMSs have focused policy efforts on transposing European directives, but shown less commitment to actual implementation, proper enforcement, and pro-active energy efficiency related policy-making beyond the acquis largely due to very limited institutional capacity and still low priority on national policy agendas of energy efficiency measures; \u2022 In 2007-2013 NMSs plan to channel to sustainable energy only a very minor fraction of EU funds, amounting to 2-3 % on average which falls short of scale of the action needed to realise the EU's strategic energy objectives (best performers LT, CZ and SK); \u2022 Energy efficiency institutions are a weak point in NMSs, marked by inadequate coverage of efficiency related tasks by institutional structures and insufficient staffing.

Russia \u2022 ESCOs have a relatively long history: start in 1996, today few dozen companies,; \u2022 Targets: boiler automation, bio-fuel pre-furnace installation, economizers, DH, automation of centralized compressed air production facilities; \u2022 Payback time is normally max. 6-7 years; \u2022 Financial and technical assistance from IFIs; \u2022 Financing is problematic: ESCOs dont have the own funding, while high interest rates hinder profitability, lack of appropriate guarantees; \u2022 Administrative burden, changing circumstances, varying political support, \u201elow energy price\u201d, wasting attitude; \u2022 While the potential is huge \u2013 one of the highest energy intensity in the world (3-5 times of Western countries); This has hardly improved in spite of the pronounced efforts for energy savings in the legislation since 1990s.

        "Main restraints of Energy Efficiency Policies in Buildings at present From 2000, there have been several government programmes to encourage improving energy efficiency in residential buildings, in the framework of which over 75,000 flats in prefabricated residential buildings were modernised with public support (state and/or municipal) between 2000 and 2006. Control tests in prefabricated buildings modernised between 2000\u20132006 found that though there were some energy savings and improvement in the technical conditions of the buildings, a number of negative circumstances made the effectiveness and expediency of the programmes questionable. Main restraints of Energy Efficiency Policies in Buildings at present (cid:137) A lack of complexity: the planned technical interventions usually offered only partial solutions (e.g., thermal insulation of walls, replacement of doors and windows without heat control) and were often ill- considered (heat bridges, mould growth); (cid:137) A low rate of return: the relatively low unit cost of investment (\u20ac1000\u20132000/flat) results in extremely long periods of return. (cid:137) Encouraged high costs : Government programmes made the amount of support relative to costs, setting no condition on the efficiency of energy savings. (cid:137) High level of subvention intensity : till 67 % of the total investment costs (cid:137) Shortcomings in quality: owner-occupiers' wish to minimise costs was realised to the detriment of the quality of materials and workmanship. Contractors and suppliers assumed little responsibility for the quality of their products, renewal and installation works Enrique GROSSER LAGOS - Hunesco, Hungary JRC Workshop on \"Effective Policies for Improving Energy Efficiency in Buildings\", Krakow, Poland, 12-14 September 2007 316 ",

The goal of the 2nd CECED commitment is a reduction of the fleet energy consumption. The commitment calls for achieving a European production weighted average of 0,20 KWh/Kg for the year 2008. In addition at the latest by 31 December 2003 the participant manufacturers have stopped production and import in the Community Market domestic washing machines, which belong to energy efficiency class D. \u2022 The share of A class appliances was already above 50% in 2002, in 2005 in some Member States (Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium) there is a large penetration of A+ appliances (not defined in the labelling Directive but agreed among CECED manufacturers), and the combination of A and A+ in these markets is approaching the 100% market. \u2022 The most remarkable market change from 2002 for washing machines has happened in the UK due to the Energy Efficiency Commitment (about 800000 washing machines have been subsidised each year under EEC). \u2022 It is also interesting noting that the class B is almost disappeared from the market, but there is an increased share of not labelled appliances. Class A appliances are seen by consumers as a high quality product (most of A class appliances are AAA, associating to the low energy consump-tion, high spin speed and good washing performances).

[in DELight average household lighting electricity use ranges from 240 kWh pa to 920 kWh] . This consumption reflects the size (square meters) of the household, the burning hours, and the penetration of efficient lamps (explaining the very low consumption in Germany and high consumption in Ireland). The data for Greece is still under investigation, as the specific household lighting consumption is very high (but similar to the one of Cyprus and Malta). The lowest in New MS is in Slovakia, 240 kWh. \u2022 The average number of CFLs per household ranges in EU-15 from 1 in Finland and Greece to 6,5 in Germany , where several promotion campaigns took place [in DELight the highest was NL with 2,7 followed by Germany with 2,1] \u2022 In the new Member States the number of CFLs per household is substantially lower than in the EU-15 Member States, with the exception of the Czech Republic.

        "Workshop on: \"Effective Policies for Improving Energy Efficiencyin Buildings\", 12-14 September, Krakow, Poland 35 Tertiary Sector Building Energy Consumption \u2022 Total electricity consumption for the tertiary sector for the EU-25 was 628 TWh in year 1999 and 726 TWh in year 2004. The electricity in the tertiary sector has grown by 15.6 % in the period 1999-2004 and by 2.0 % in the period 2003-2004. \u2022 The gas consumption in the tertiary sector has continued to grow in the period 1999 to 2004 in the EU-25 from 2070 PJ to 2362 PJ with an increase of 14 %, while the yearly growth rate in the period 2003-2004 has been 1.9 %. \u2022 For the tertiary sector (in this report it is the public sector, education, healthcare, services and commerce there is much less data available for individual electricity end-uses than for the residential sector, and only a few sources attempted to divide the total electricity consumption among the different end-uses. \u2022 This is also know as the 'commercial sector' and represent non-residential buildings in the service sector.

        "Workshop on: \"Effective Policies for Improving Energy Efficiencyin Buildings\", 12-14 September, Krakow, Poland 37 Lighting (1) \u2022 Lighting is by far the major end-use category in tertiary sector consumption, responsible for about 175 TWh or 26% of total electricity consumption in the tertiary sector. \u2022 The T8 lamp now dominates the linear fluorescent market. The existing mix of lamps is still two-thirds halo phosphate lamps with the remaining third being three-band phosphor lamps which are currently increasing their market share year by year. \u2022 The new technology, T5 which has a higher efficiency and is designed to be fed only by electronic ballasts has small market penetration, though slightly increasing overtime. \u2022 About 207 millions are new installed lamps in 2004 [CEL2005], which tends to be of higher efficiency compared to already install lamps. Tertiary Electricity Consumption Workshop on: \"Effective Policies for Improving Energy Efficiencyin Buildings\", 12-14 September, Krakow, Poland 38 Lighting (2) \u2022 There is a voluntary classification scheme for the combination of lamp ballasts introduced in the year 1998 by the lighting equipment manufacturers\u2019 trade association, CELMA. \u2022 The classifications scheme together with the minimum efficiency requirements for ballasts (Directive 2000/55/EC), which came into effect in 2002, have resulted in a gradual market transformation. \u2022 The Directive foresees two gradual steps for phasing out low and medium efficiency ballasts. The first steps took place in year 2002 and phased out low efficiency magnetic ballasts (class D). The second steps took place in November 2005 and phased out Class C ballast representing the largest shared of the market.

Eurovent established classification for full load Energy Efficiency Ratio of each type of chillers. The classification follows the A to G approach used in the European Energy Label. \u2022 Another important share of electricity is consumed by fans for ventilation systems (including fans), which results in about 94 TWh. For the time being there are no existing European polices to improve efficiency of ventilation systems. \u2022 A similarly important sector in term of consumption is commercial refrigeration . Estimate for the total European consumption range from 70 to 100 TWh per year. The specific refrigeration products covered by commercial refrigeration equipment, are: process chillers, refrigerated display and service cabinets, cellar cooling, ice making machines (non domestic), walk-in cold stores, refrigerated vending machines, refrigeration compressors, air-cooled condensing units, heat exchangers (process/industrial applications). \u2022 For office equipment there are no much data available on the total energy consumption. According to the Ecodesign study in 2005 there where 44 Million desktop computers installed in non residential applications, and another 36,5 million laptops, and about 44 million monitors, of which 45% were flat panel. In 2003 a rapid penetration of LCD screens occurred, ad was sustained in 2004 and 2005, which should have led to a decrease of the total monitor consumption. It is assumed by the authors that office equipment (ICT equipment) is responsible for about 60 to 80 TWh per year in the tertiary sector. More research is needed to arrive at a more precise evaluation. In the residential sector ICT is responsible for about 10 to 20 TWh.

The building is in average insulated with a 16 centimeter layer of insulation and all thermal bridges are eliminated. Basically the temperature of the building in winter and as well in summer is maintained by maintaining a suitable temperature of the buildings concrete construction. At the lowest outside temperatures in winter, room temperatures around 20\u00b0C are achieved with water temperature in the concrete construction thermal activation system around 22- 23\u00b0C. In summer the room temperatures never exceed over 26\u00b0C because of the combination of water temperature in concrete construction and cool inlet air temperature (inlet air temperature around 19\u00b0C).
