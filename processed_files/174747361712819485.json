        "Building a Europe of active, critical and responsible citizens 2013 has been designated the European Year of Citizens, to raise awareness of the rights and responsibilities of EU citizens and to encourage discussion at every level of society on the future of Europe. This comes at a time of global crisis, awakening old prejudices and stereotypes in contradiction to the community spirit which sustains the European project. Young people have been particularly hard hit by the crisis and, in some Member States, youth unemployment is exceeding 50 %, blighting the prospects for a happy and independent life. Yet the role of young people remains crucial in preserving the shared values on which Europe has been built and in ensuring its future. The projects presented in this brochure describe a fascinating panorama of activities undertaken by groups of young people or young individuals in all the Member States of the European Union and beyond, which reflect their active, critical and responsible citizenship. They were all supported by the Youth in Action programme, in the form of Youth Exchanges, European Voluntary Service projects or training and networking projects for youth workers and youth organisations. There are projects involving young people bent on making a difference in the community or in society at large by combatting poverty, discrimination and bullying at school, by sharing their experience of living in a divided community and discussing ways of resolving conflict without resorting to violence, or by helping to protect the precious heritage of a local community. All these projects contribute to establishing the identities of the participants as active young citizens of Europe. 3 ",
        "Androulla Vassiliou Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth Other projects have been devised in response to young people taking a critical attitude to the world as they see it, displaying their commitment to the common European values of human rights, democracy and tolerance. The young people in their different projects embrace the exceptional benefits of the Internet but call for more media literacy, create a manifesto in support of feminism, produce a comic as a tool to combat violence against young women or stand up for minorities and the rights of refugees. And still other projects showcase how young people exercise their responsibility towards society, inspired as they are by their concerns for social inclusion and for disadvantaged groups, such as the disabled, the elderly or young people in detention, as well as by their commitment to the environment. Being involved in these projects places the participants in an intercultural setting and empowers them; it provides them with new skills and competences and raises their awareness of being European. But what unites these young citizens of Europe above all is their freely-given commitment to be of service \u2015 to each other, to their communities, to the environment \u2015 and by so doing achieve a positive change in their lives and make the world a better place for us all. 4 ",

        "The AcTive europeAn ciTizens 6 Young people from seven different countries who organised the Youth Ambassadors Summer Institute in Flanders, Belgium, had become firm friends at a youth event in the United States sponsored by the Benjamin Franklin Transatlantic Fellowship. They were so inspired by the experience that on their return home they remained in touch and set up a similar 11-day event at a European level in July 2012, inviting young participants from the countries they represented: Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Luxembourg, Moldova, Norway and Poland. The purpose of the Summer Institute was to broaden the horizons of the young participants beyond national borders and to give them a sense of being European citizens. By creating a forum for debate on a wide range of current issues that affect the lives of young people today, they encouraged the participants to think seriously about their own role and responsibility as citizens. Because of the many economic, social and cultural differences between the countries they represented there was a rich menu of topics to YouTh amBassadors For EuropE ",

The negative image of Greece, projected by the media following the economic crisis, was held up as an example of this distortion and led to fruitful discussions with the young participants from Greece. The ultimate aim of the Institute was to encourage the young people to become active citizens in their home countries and to understand what it means to be an active citizen in Europe. Workshops, brainstorming sessions and simulation exercises were held on issues such as what can you do as a European citizen, what can the European Union do for you and what is the role of the European Council? And how can the new social media be used in a positive way to spread ideas and broaden people\u2019s perception? The young people from different cultural and social backgrounds also benefited from the bridge building exercises held throughout the exchange enabling them to respect difference and to appreciate more clearly what it is to be a European citizen. Following an information session on the Youth in Action programme at the end of the project they were encouraged to use their initiative on returning home to continue the work of the Institute in promoting active European citizenship by creating networks of \u2018change makers\u2019 and by initiating follow-up activities, based on the ideas developed during the meeting.

Subsequently, he worked with a youth exchange, \u2018Euro Camp\u2019, and filmed a theatre project focusing on schemes for volunteering in Europe. As a personal project, Damian made another film about volunteering aimed at Polish youngsters to support the town- twinning between Magdeburg and Radom in his native Poland. He also took part in a local project aimed at combating racism and helped to prepare activities for \u2018Europe Week\u2019. He also helped to organise the \u2018Sprachcaf\u00e9\u2019 in the One World House in the town which enabled the international community to meet local people and use their different languages. His EVS service proved to be a very rich experience for Damian. His daily contact with volunteers from other countries and his work with local people in the TV centre broadened his outlook on Europe and his competence in foreign languages greatly improved. He followed a course in German throughout his stay. But the most precious gain for Damian was that through his work on the TV channel, which helped to empower local young people, he himself became an \u2018agent of change\u2019. \u2018The volunteer gained a unique cultural experience by living and working with people from different backgrounds, but he was also able to bring about a change in the lives of local people with his projects, turning into a tangible experience the meaning of tolerance and democracy, as well as the active participation in society.\u2019 ",

        "11 \u2018Ten days of a youth exchange created a wonderful and memorable mixture of a successful project, geysers, waterfalls, new friendships, midnight sun and most of all: confident and committed young people who will keep on working against bullying and for respect!\u2019 The youth exchange that took place in Reykjavik, Iceland in July 2012 involving 30 young people from Iceland and 30 from Germany was the second part of a project, the first one having been hosted in Germany the year before on the theme of conservation. The purpose of the exchange in Iceland was to raise awareness about bullying, particularly among teenagers, as an attack on human rights. The young people, almost all in their teens and mainly from church-led youth organisations in Iceland and Germany, had carefully prepared their 10-day project during the preceding winter. They were clearly motivated to treat the subject very seriously and planned a number of activities, among others a parade through the streets of Reykjavik. The group included an autistic girl, a young lesbian and a boy who was gay. All three had been victims of bullying. There were also young people from a rural area without access to youth work, and two participants were unemployed. The programme first focused on defining bullying. For this they had the help of organisations set up to combat bullying which spoke to them about their experience and how best to tackle the problem of bullying when it arose. Much of their discussion centred around human rights and active citizenship. Workshops were organised subsequently when the young people produced posters, postcards and short films illustrating scenarios where bullying takes place. Work was also carried out in preparation for the parade which took place at the end of the week. Information about the theme of the parade was widely disseminated which attracted a number of people. There was coverage of the exchange and the parade in both Icelandic and German newspapers and TV. With the realisation that much was still to be done, the young people returned home fully committed to continue the fight in their own schools and places of work, as well as at regional and national youth events.

The purpose of the exchange was to take the young people out of their usual environment and, through a variety of different non-formal learning strategies, raise their self-esteem and empower them to take their place in society.

Project carried out by The ASHA Foundation, the United Kingdom, in partnership with Pryyateli Ditey Ukraine, Tegyunk Egyutt az Ifjusagert Alapitvany, Hungary, Youth Initiative Center Gyumri, Armenia. All forms of drama, including pantomime, role plays and improvisation, were used as a means of tackling the issues dealt with during the project. As some of the participants spoke no English, many of the activities were based on non-verbal communication which did not limit in any way the commitment and enjoyment of the participants. Most of the announcements and verbal presentations during the programme were also translated into Russian, which was the lingua franca for a number of the participants from Eastern Europe. Growing up and becoming an adult looking for work and raising a family, these life issues formed the core of the exchange. In the case of young people looking for work mock interviews were set up to give the participants an idea of what to expect in such a situation. Identifying skills needed to overcome social obstacles and preparing young people to become fully independent and take responsibility as citizens were among the challenges that were discussed or enacted. The activities allowed the young people to establish a safe and creative space for self-expression, progressing through verbal and non-verbal communication, enacting and reflecting on the themes and finally presenting their opinions and their emotions in an intercultural context. The ASHA Centre, which hosted the exchange, is housed in a large Georgian house, surrounded by five acres of gardens, in a secluded area of the Forest of Dean. For many of the young people, coming from severely disadvantaged backgrounds, the centre became their home for the duration of the project. Thanks to the success of this first exercise a second exchange was planned the following year, along similar lines, entitled \u2018Act the Part\u2019, with the same partner countries and Poland, and with young people from the same target group. \u2018I met people from countries I will probably never visit and learnt about their culture and language. The language barrier made the whole experience all the more enjoyable as we had to resort to other means to express ourselves. I feel like the whole experience boosted my confidence infinitely. All in all it was one of the most memorable weeks of my life.\u2019 ",

His mission was to promote youth work by interviewing and filming projects being undertaken by youth organisations in various regions of the country. The purpose was to showcase the positive contributions made by these organisations and enhance their attractiveness and accessibility for young people. Armed with a camera, Alberto visited a number of different places talking with young people, interviewing their youth leaders and filming their projects. On returning to the office of his host in the capital Tartu he edited the films he had shot and uploaded them to Youtube. In all, Alberto made 15 videos telling the stories of different youth projects. Alberto\u2019s work resulted in a fascinating panorama of different aspects of youth work in the country and the variety of opportunities that now exist for young people. It also catalogued the various ways in which the Youth in Action programme is being made use of to bring an experience of Europe into the lives of young people. His record not only had much to offer local youth organisations but was also of value to project partners elsewhere in Europe. His work as a volunteer gave Alberto a comprehensive insight into the nature of youth work, its impact on young people and the methods used. He improved his interpersonal skills, his knowledge of multimedia techniques and his communication skills, including his foreign language competence. Most important, however, was that Alberto developed the self-confidence and the skills to travel the country, interviewing perfect strangers and creating a very useful multimedia promotional documentary on youth work in Estonia.

The purpose of the exchange was to provide a forum in which to discuss the question of poverty and the way it is afflicting the lives of people in different parts of Europe.

Activities included creating an exhibition at the museum, making short films and producing posters and postcards for use as street art. The exchange culminated in six exhibitions in the centre of Svendborg, where local people gave generously in return for the postcards which had been produced from photos taken by the young people. There were several gains for the young people after spending a week discussing this theme with other members of the group, not least their cultural awareness of other parts of Europe. Their communicative skills were clearly enhanced as well as their spoken English which was the language used for the exchange. Using various electronic tools and making films improved their digital skills. The overall impact of the exchange on the young people was to considerably increase their self-esteem. By sharing views and experience on this subject and talking about how it is in their own country the young people recognised that there was a common European understanding about many of the issues discussed and that it is only by working together as European citizens that many of the problems resulting from poverty and marginalisation can be resolved.

There were also workshops aimed at building trust between members of the group, and participants, throughout the exchange, were invited to record their impressions of peace in the world today, in writing or through art and craft or by using photography They learned about the need for leadership skills and how to conduct non-violent communications. Being encouraged to speak their minds, considerably improved their self-confidence. On one occasion they hosted a group of young people from Derry in Northern Ireland who were able to tell them what it was like to grow up in such a divided community. A number of individuals, who had experienced conflict in their lives and had chosen to respond to this through non-violent activism, also met and spoke with the group. Because of their feelings of trust towards each other the young people were at ease to express themselves freely about their own experience of conflict which helped to heal psychological wounds that they had suffered. A book was produced at the end of the exchange which contained reports from the workshops written by the students and including their art work and photos. There was also coverage of the ideas they had expressed, in the various sessions of the exchange, on how to successfully resolve conflict. ",

The young volunteers were all from countries taking part and their role was to encourage an awareness of the countries, whose teams were competing, and to assist with the Basketball Fans Sport and Culture Festival which had been set up to coincide with the championship. One of the main tasks for the volunteers at the Festival was to describe the culture of basketball in their country and where it stood compared with other sports. They also helped their own embassies and cultural institutes to organise presentations of their countries at the Festival and assisted the organisers to arrange sporting and other activities. After the Festival the volunteers continued to make presentations in schools, libraries and youth clubs as well as in the local orphanage and social care centre.

The volunteers undertook a number of other tasks: some of them organised cooking workshops in the local vocational school; others arranged evening meetings at the youth centre on discovering new countries and encouraged young people to be curious and open to new ideas and different values. The impact on the local community of the young volunteers\u2019 work was far reaching. Not only did they get to know more about the world outside, particularly about the countries of the eleven young visitors, but the young people they mobilised continued to offer their help with local projects, such as renovating sports facilities, well after the departure of the volunteers. The young volunteers themselves greatly benefited from the experience. Delphine from France, for example, who had contacted the French team at the championship for help in presenting the basketball scene in France, found a job working in the same field on her return home. Laima from Latvia became head of the European Students Forum on returning home and Julia found a job as coordinator for local youth activities and international youth events in her native Germany. When evaluating their experience the young volunteers all agreed that the most memorable aspect of their service had been the impact they had on young people in the local community; they were fascinated by meeting young Europeans and learning about their way of life and many of them expressed the desire some day to have a similar experience of voluntary service abroad. \u2018In the orphanage with the other volunteers I will never forget the joy children manifested when spending time with us.

The mutual respect between young people and the elderly was well illustrated with the willingness of retired craftsmen to share their skills and knowledge with the group. One elderly pensioner who lived near the chapel lent his tools to the young people for the duration of their stay and often visited them on site, giving advice and expressing his attachment to the tal-Hniena chapel. A sense of community among young people was built up during the working day as they shared tasks. And in the evening different members of the group volunteered to prepare dinner, usually based on their own traditional dishes. Contact with the local community was enhanced by the group\u2019s open-door policy allowing passers-by to walk in and look around at the work they were doing. A question and answer session often ensued and the locals enjoyed telling the young people about their association with the chapel. The young people were empowered by the trust placed in them by the experts and craftsmen to grow in self-confidence, with an increased knowledge of the techniques of project management and team building. They also returned home with better communication skills and an improved knowledge of foreign languages. The other beneficiaries of this project were of course the local people who were invited to a reception in the chapel on the last day to witness and celebrate the improvements that had been made to their chapel, the result of European cooperation and the commitment of a younger generation to protect their cultural heritage.

The purpose of the exchange was to promote solidarity among the young people, an awareness and acceptance of cultural difference and a sense of European citizenship. To achieve this objective most of the activities centred around the preparation of a street theatre performance planned for the end of the project. The young people themselves wrote the play together and carried out all the other tasks, such as making the costumes and props, erecting the stage, playing all the parts and directing the two performances they gave in the town centre. This group activity brought the young people together around a common goal and established a bond of solidarity between them where questions of nationality were forgotten. A parallel was drawn with the common objectives of the European project which had created a space in which they were all European citizens. The street performance created a lot of local interest but was not the only occasion when the group interacted with the local community. For example, the young people insisted on only eating locally grown produce and in return for giving a helping hand in an organic garden in the town, they received free fruit and vegetables. The local youth centre made their facilities and equipment available and helped the group develop graphic posters publicising the street performance. Throughout the exchange a local arts group \u2015 Animation Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Nature \u2015 made their services available in the preparation of the play.

The training course was devised to provide a forum for discussion on all forms of violence, but in particular gender-based, and the opportunity to consider new ways of preventing sexual violence among young people and encouraging respect towards the opposite sex. Producing a comic to play such a role in this sensitive area of human behaviour was an imaginative way of harnessing the skills, creativity and social concern of the young people in the project as citizens. It was a method of work that later became attractive to other youth organisations. It was important at the outset of the course to create among the participants feelings of trust towards each other so that they felt secure in talking about their own feelings related to intimate relations with the opposite sex.

Case studies of all types of abusive behaviour were discussed and various role playing activities organised. Interspersed with these discussions were sessions introducing the group to the world of comics and comparing the different approaches used in the comics they had brought from their home countries. The participants were taught the techniques of putting a comic together and how to use it as a vehicle for messages raising awareness of ways to prevent sexual violence. The production of the comic was a group effort involving some of the participants in drawing and others in devising the script. Before the course ended they laid plans to develop together future projects in this field. The result was an attractive comic with six stories for eventual distribution to schools, youth centres and specialist organisations working in this field. Since the project took place, the comic has been on display at a number of festivals in the participants\u2019 countries of origin, such as in Belgrade in Serbia, and was featured at the International Day Against Violence against Women in Lorca in Spain. The course organiser, Cazalla-Intercultural in Lorca, has also agreed with the local administration on a strategy to combat gender-based violence in the area.

They spent a week there in July 2011, sharing their experience of young women\u2019s lives in Europe. They brought with them the different approaches of feminists in their countries to conduct campaigns in support of gender equality and the protection of women from sexual violence. They also shared information about their different customs where subjects such as motherhood and marriage were concerned. Most of the participants spent the week under canvas and the camp was self- managed, involving every participant in all the daily tasks, from providing meals to mending the showers. To accomplish this form of management, daily assemblies were held when each individual had the right to contribute to decision making and where session leaders were regularly changed.

The \u2018Manifesto of Young Feminists in Europe\u2019 was produced, collectively by all the participants. The manifesto was written in eight chapters: solidarity; discrimination; the economy; the environment; health issues; violence; sexuality and LGBTQI 1 ; sex education; and the promotion of feminism. The last two days were devoted to making contact with the general public in Toulouse. A march was organised through the streets, accompanied by music, singing and the chanting of slogans in support of issues concerning women. The march took place without any incident to mar the day and the colourful good humour of the all-female marchers and the message they communicated was appreciated by the onlookers. Finally a public debate was held on the question of feminism and inclusion. The impact on a number of participants was life-changing. Young women who had never attended a meeting of this kind before went home feeling empowered to take a stronger line in promoting the cause of women. Talking in public was easier and their knowledge about Europe vastly expanded. Such was the success of this first European camp of its kind and such was the strength of the networks that were created in Toulouse that another camp has already taken place in Romania and a third one is planned for Portugal in 2013. 1 LGBTQ \u2013 Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer or Questioning and Intersex.

It was to contribute to a lessening of this deficit that this training course was set up. The course was led by an international team of trainers who used non-formal learning methods to animate discussion in plenary and workshop sessions. Games were used as a tool, particularly attractive to young people, to illustrate points and to make the themes covered less dry and more accessible. Discussions were held on subjects such as common European values, respect for cultures other than one\u2019s own, European Union institutions and the philosophy and operation of the Youth in Action programme. Participants also shared experience of good practice and planned follow-up activities promoting European citizenship to young people. Participants benefited in many ways from the course. They received both theoretical knowledge about European citizenship and concrete methodologies for youth activities in this field; the international group extended their intercultural understanding and their debating and leadership skills; they became acquainted with non-formal training methods and gained valuable experience in communicating with others in a foreign language. They also established a network of organisations dealing with this topic for future partnerships and projects under Youth in Action.

They all learned more about how young people can find a voice in the political process through an intelligent use of the social media. The issues raised on the exchange were of particular interest to the young people from Armenia, Georgia and Poland which had become democracies after many years under totalitarian regimes.

Workshops were held during the exchange in which participants were invited to create a European fairy tale as a vehicle for telling their own stories based on their personal experience. There were also opportunities for street theatre and performing juggling acts in public. At the end of the exchange the group put on a performance of the fairy tale at a local primary school in Barra in front of school children and their parents and other members of the community. It proved a most effective way of involving local people who responded by joining in with the performance. The exchange benefited all the young people in different ways. The young Italians in the group learned from their new Czech friends about a way of life which was not dominated by criminal influences. The young Czechs were able to reflect on their own safe situation compared to the hard reality of growing up in the difficult environment of the young Italians. As the main language of communication during the exchange was English, the whole group benefited from improved language skills. The young Italians who normally speak in dialect with each other also improved their standard Italian skills. In fact the exchange was an exciting experience for the whole community, including the teachers at the primary school who were enthusiastic about the project. Plans were being laid to hold further encounters of this kind with young people from different countries. Their presence in Barra promoted a sense of belonging to a wider community from which they could learn and make lifelong friendships. \u2018The exchange proved to be a fascinating exercise in imagining a better world together and helping young people in a city with major problems of crime and poverty to develop a more positive attitude towards society and the self- confidence to break with the cycle of deprivation.\u2019 ",

The months that Adina carried out her voluntary service in the former concentration camp were very formative; it was a remarkable lesson in European history for her and the time she spent working on the exhibition taught her many things about the history of art and architecture. During her service she was also able to visit other places in Eastern Germany which gave her an idea of life under a totalitarian communist regime in the former German Democratic Republic (DDR).

Care was also taken about the food on offer in the catering arrangements made for the course. The participants benefited from the experience in several ways, not least from having to design and run the workshops themselves. They also improved their knowledge of how to use media technology in setting up a campaign, writing press releases, developing media tools to enhance gender equality and non-discrimination and using mobile phones for information sharing and recording human rights violations. Their self-confidence was enhanced and they learned to listen to each other and to work in a team.

The 16 young people who gathered for six days in October 2011 in Nicosia, from Cyprus, Italy, Portugal and Spain, followed a training course which introduced the \u2018human library\u2019 technique, aimed at enhancing participants\u2019 awareness of how certain minorities or individuals are socially excluded on the basis of their status, life choices or beliefs.

Other young people were the \u2018readers\u2019 and clearly benefited from the stories they \u2018read\u2019. Members of the local community were also invited to take part both as \u2018books\u2019 and as \u2018readers\u2019. This first attempt at creating a \u2018human library\u2019 proved to be a very successful tool for removing prejudice and creating tolerance and solidarity among all of those who took part. Although the programme of the course was scrupulously prepared well in advance it was not set in stone and was adapted throughout its duration following suggestions from the daily evaluations carried out by participants. According to the final evaluation and a questionnaire completed by all the participants, the course not only extended the intercultural knowledge and skills range of the young people but also proved to be a most successful exercise in personal development. All the groups returned home firmly committed to setting up their own \u2018human libraries\u2019 and remaining in touch so as to continue learning from each others\u2019 experience. The course was presented with the national Charlemagne Youth Prize in 2012 in the European contest jointly organised by the European Parliament and the International Prize Foundation in Aachen, Germany, for projects undertaken by young people which offer practical examples of Europeans living together as one community.

Topics of the workshops included home-made cheese and other dairy product making, home-made cosmetics and soaps using natural materials and reviving traditional handicrafts made of recycled materials. These were practices very well known to an older generation. The volunteers assisted with the workshops which were very popular and, instead of the six sessions that were planned, 18 were held to meet demand. Learning by doing proved far more successful than simply distributing leaflets or giving lectures on the subject. One of the principles of the Academy is to avoid waste and a number of recycling activities were organised. The young volunteers described in their blog the many ways in which used clothes and bottles and other objects can be recycled. Promoting local produce and home-made foodstuffs was another principal activity of the Academy. The volunteers helped a local food cooperative to make weekly deliveries of locally grown vegetables to reduce the negative effect of transportation on climate change and to support employment and the local economy. To be \u2018local\u2019 the produce would have to be grown within a limit of 50 kilometres.

By avoiding activities with a strong competitive nature or over-reliant on the use of language or other specific skills, and putting an emphasis on team spirit, all the young people, including those with mental disabilities, could learn more about themselves and about each other and come away with higher self-esteem. The guiding theme of the exchange was \u2018time travel\u2019 and in between the sporting activities workshops were held when the young people had the opportunity to learn more about the different cultures represented among the participants. By using non-formal learning methods they were able to overcome the language barriers and problems faced by those with a mental disability. The latter were able to discover other strengths that they had and which they could make use of in the future. The experience of working with different cultures and making allowances for those with a mental disability made a profound effect on the participants and confirmed for some their intention to continue working in this field. Three of the teenagers in the group have embarked on a course of social studies since the exchange and two others have joined a project set up to combat bullying and discrimination. ",

In spite of its short duration, the seminar acted as a starting point for collaboration between the participants in this crucial cross-border work of nature conservation.

The dates of the seminar coincided with the biennial conference of the Taiga Rescue Network, the international network of more than 200 NGOs and individuals working to defend the world\u2019s boreal forests, which extend in broad bands across the northern latitudes of North America, Europe and Asia. The Taiga conference, which also took place in Petrozavodsk, gave the young participants at the seminar an idea of the importance of their work as well as providing high profile experts to address and take part in the seminar. The seminar provided a rare opportunity for all the stakeholders in EVS projects \u2015 volunteers, hosts and trainers \u2015 to meet together and share their experience.

He spent much time preparing a visual library of activities that had taken place at the school over the years and in so doing had lots of contact with pupils, staff and parents at the school. He also organised a video exchange in which he conducted a dialogue with parents on creating more opportunities for all the pupils in an inclusive school such as their\u2019s. During the afternoon he often took part in games with pupils which taught them how to make allowances for the disabled as well as developing in them respect and tolerence for each other. With the help of other volunteers he also set up an exhibition displaying the drawings and texts of the pupils about how inclusion worked in their school. The controversies surrounding this recent change in the way the young disabled are educated, through inclusion rather than in special schools, was not absent from their discussions and one of the other young volunteers opened up the debate in a video film entitled \u2018Inclusion or Illusion\u2019. The background of the volunteer from Austria was very often the subject of his talks with the children and on one occasion he gave a presentation to the whole school about his family and schooling and how the systems were different in the two countries.

Various non-formal education methods were used on the course involving the young detainees in simulations of cultural conflicts, debates and team sports. They were invited to voice their difficulties in reintegrating and revealed a perceived sense of injustice. A puppet theatre was used to animate these sessions. More formal presentations were also made and the youth workers pooled their experience to produce a guide to good practice on dealing with young people in prison. Not only did the course provide the youth workers with a number of new non-formal education techniques but also gave them a more positive attitude towards detainees and enhanced their communication skills. The young detainees, who had taken part in the course, also benefited by developing a more positive outlook on the choices they would have when starting a new life after leaving prison. The guide to good practice and the non-formal education tools developed during the course are now regularly used by prison educators in the rehabilitation centres in Romania and have influenced the approach to young detainees in the other countries represented at the course. Among the young detainees who took part in the course three of them, who have since been released, have jobs or have continued with their studies. Before the conclusion of the course the participants laid plans for further projects under the Youth in Action programme. \u2018Immediately after release from prison one of the most active participants on the course managed to find employment as an engineer at one of the largest tele- communications companies in Romania.\u2019 ",

        "77 \u2018Given their disadvantaged backgrounds it was a big challenge for all of them to go abroad, to adapt to the local culture and get involved in a volunteering project. But mobility made a really positive contribution to their social and civic development and cultural awareness as well as to their self- esteem and future career prospects.\u2019 cultural awareness but also to their self-esteem and future career prospects. Many of the young people had never been abroad before and the experience of adapting to a new culture helped to give them more self-confidence in coping with the new global challenges facing young people today. The activities undertaken by the young volunteers were mainly in the area of the social services, environmental protection, education and leisure. One young man, for example, helped lay the spawning beds in a canal in Belgium and was complimented by his host for his curiosity and enthusiasm and the way in which he easily fitted into the team. Other young people carried out their voluntary service in the community, working in old peoples\u2019 care homes and with the disabled. They also worked with children, particularly from disadvantaged backgrounds. Another important aim of this multiple project, which involved so many young people and organisations, both sending and hosting, was to create an on-line tool for assessing the effect of the voluntary service experience on the skills\u2019 acquisition and future employability of the young people. The Mobility Management System which resulted from this project was an on-line questionnaire completed by volunteers six months after finishing their voluntary service. It provided organisations working in this field with a valuable database on the overall impact of the European Voluntary Service projects.
