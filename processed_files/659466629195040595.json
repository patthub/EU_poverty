        "Introduction Culture statistics 8 Introduction Culture is one of Europe\u2019s greatest strengths: it is a source of values and identity and gives the continent a sense of belonging. It also contributes to people\u2019s well-being, to social cohesion and inclusion. The cultural and creative sectors are a driver of economic growth, job creation and external trade. That is why culture is becoming increasingly important at EU level. In accordance with Article 167 of the Lisbon Treaty, the EU \u2018shall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common heritage to the fore\u2019. The EU supports these objectives through the Creative Europe programme, as well as a number of policy actions set out in the Work Plan for Culture for 2015\u20132018. This work plan, adopted by EU culture ministers in December 2014, sets out the main priorities for European cooperation in cultural policymaking: inclusive and accessible culture, the promotion of cultural heritage, support to the flowering of the cultural and creative sectors, and promotion of cultural diversity and of culture in EU external relations. The production of reliable, comparable and up-to-date culture statistics, which are the basis of sound cultural policy-making, is also a cross- sectorial priority of this work plan. Eurostat compiles statistics on culture from several data collections conducted at EU level to provide policy-makers and other users with information on the main trends in employment, business, international trade, participation and consumption patterns in the field of culture. This book can be considered as a third edition of the Eurostat publication on culture statistics. Previous editions of the pocketbook \u2018Cultural statistics\u2019 were released in 2007 and 2011. The current edition was prepared by Eurostat with the substantial support of the Directorate General Education and Culture. Compared to the previous publications, even if the fields covered are the same, a lot has been done in terms of methodological developments. A new European framework for cultural statistics (based on 2009 UNESCO Framework for Cultural Statistics) was elaborated by the European Statistical System network on Culture and presented in the ESSnet-Culture final report (2012). The group of national experts made methodological recommendations in various areas (employment, enterprises, public and private expenditure, participation) and defined the cultural scope in relation with international classifications. For example, ESSnet-Culture proposed a new methodology for estimating cultural employment through both NACE Rev. 2 and ISCO-08 classifications; the chapter devoted to cultural employment follows that algorithm. Chapters on cultural enterprises and international trade in cultural goods, together with that on cultural employment, present the economic dimension of culture. ",
        "Introduction Culture statistics 9 From the side of cultural participation, data on participation in cultural activities (including the use of ICT for cultural purposes) and private expenditure on cultural goods and services were explored. Finally, as in the previous editions, data on culture were put in a larger context, mainly of cultural heritage. Here, some findings of the experimental project \u2018Big data\u2019 have been added in an attempt to assess the population interest in cultural heritage, through the number of views of World Heritage Sites in Wikipedia. All data presented in this book are available in the specific domain \u2018Culture\u2019 of Eurobase (Eurostat statistics on-line). Most chapters in this publication are published on-line as \u2018Statistics Explained\u2018 articles which will be regularly updated, taking into account new available data. Access to Eurostat data The simplest way to access Eurostat\u2019s broad range of statistical information is through the Eurostat website (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat). Eurostat provides users with free access to its databases and all of its publications in PDF via the internet. The website is updated daily and gives access to the latest and most comprehensive statistical information available on: the EU and euro area; the EU Member States; the EFTA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland); and the candidate countries (Albania, Montenegro, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey). Eurostat online data code(s) \u2014 easy access to the freshest data Eurostat online data codes, such as tps00001and nama_10_gdp (1), allow users easy access to the most recent data in the Eurobase database on Eurostat\u2019s website. In this publication these online data codes are given as part of the source below each table and figure that makes use of Eurobase data. In the PDF version of this publication, the reader is led directly to the freshest data when clicking on the hyper-links for each online data code. Readers can access the freshest data by typing a standardised hyper-link into a web browser, http:// ec.europa.eu/eurostat/product?code=<data_ code>&mode=view, where <data_code> is to be replaced by the online data code in question. Online data codes can also be fed into the \u2018Search\u2019 function on Eurostat\u2019s website, which is found in the upper-right corner of the Eurostat homepage, at http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat. The results from such a search are hyper-links which take users to a dataset detail page (2), which provide information about each dataset. Note that the data on Eurostat\u2019s website is frequently updated and that the description above presents the situation as of June 2016. (1) There are two types of online data codes: Tables (accessed using the TGM interface) have 8\u2013character codes, which consist of 3 or 5 letters \u2014 the first of which is \u2018t\u2019 \u2014 followed by 5 or 3 digits, e.g. tps00001 and tsdph220. Databases (accessed using the Data Explorer interface) have codes that use an underscore \u2018_\u2019 within the syntax of the code, e.g. nama_10_gdp and proj_13npms. (2) The dataset detail page can also be accessed by using a hyper-link, for example, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/ productsdatasets/-/<data_code>, where <data_code> is to be replaced by the online data code in question.

        "1 Context Culture statistics 20 2. Cultural heritage The concept of cultural heritage tends to be associated with historic monuments and buildings, archaeological sites, paintings, drawings or sculpture. It also brings to mind various types of works of art that are the products of human creativity and artistic expression, such as photographs, books and musical instruments. Cultural heritage is not, however, limited to material objects, but also includes aspects of our heritage that are intangible, such as traditions, music, dance, rituals, knowledge and skills that are passed down from generation to generation. All these aspects of cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible, represent the systems of values, beliefs, traditions and lifestyles that characterise past and present societies. Cultural heritage forms a record of human activity over time, embodying the character of a specific era. It is part of our past and the history we are creating today. Policy makers, associations and institutions of various types develop programmes, policies and strategies with a view to promoting and preserving this heritage, and making it accessible to a large audience. In this chapter, the European cultural heritage is presented through information on: 1. UNESCO World Heritage List 2. Number of views of World Heritage Sites in Wikipedia \u2014 Eurostat big data project 3. European Capitals of Culture 4. European Heritage Label 5. Five most visited museums (EGMUS data) World Heritage List In 1972, UNESCO adopted a Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage in order to protect, conserve and preserve cultural and natural heritage of outstanding universal value. The Convention set up the World Heritage Committee and the World Heritage Fund, whose role is to monitor and support the protection and preservation of sites named on the World Heritage List. This list, which was introduced by the Convention, identifies properties that form part of cultural and natural heritage. Properties proposed for inclusion on the list are reviewed against a set criteria determined by the Convention and the Committee. In 2015, there were 1031 properties on the list (802 classified as belonging to cultural heritage, 197 to natural heritage and 32 mixed), located all over the world. New sites are considered for inclusion on the list each year. This section presents the European cultural sites that are named on the UNESCO World Heritage List from 2015. ",

It was transferred to the Xunta de Galicia by Royal Decree in 1994. The Spanish Constitution reserves certain rights in relation to the heritage to the central government. However, these are delegated to the competent agencies in the Autonomous Communities, in this case the Xunta de Galicia. For the Lugo walls the Xunta is in the position of both owner and competent agency. Under the Galician Heritage Law the Xunta is required to cooperate with the municipal authorities in ensuring the protection and conservation of listed monuments, and certain functions are delegated down to them. The Xunta operates through its General Directorate of Cultural Heritage (Direcci\u00f3n General de Patrimonio Cultural), based in Santiago de Compostela. The Master Plan for the Conservation and Restoration of the Roman Walls of Lugo (1992) covered proposals for actions to be taken in respect of research and techniques of restoration. This was followed in 1997 by the Special Plan for the Protection and Internal Reform of the Fortified Enceinte of the Town of Lugo, which is concerned principally with the urban environment of the historic town. However, it has a direct impact on the protection afforded to the walls, in terms of traffic planning, the creation of open spaces, and regulation of building heights. Another planning instrument which affects the walls is the Special Plan for the Protection of the Mi\u00f1o [river], approved by the municipality at the beginning of 1998. There is at the present time no management plan sensu stricto for the walls in operation in Lugo: work is continuing on the basis of the 1992 plan. Nor is there a technical unit specifically responsible for the conservation and restoration of the walls. It is against this background that serious consideration is being given to the creation of an independent foundation, under royal patronage and with representatives from government, academic, voluntary, and business institutions, to work with the General Directorate of Cultural Heritage of Galicia. The work plan of this body would include the development and implementation of integrated conservation, restoration, and maintenance programmes. ",

        "1 Context Culture statistics 32 Big Data pilot project on the use of Wikipedia page views on World Heritage Sites This section contains first experimental results of a pilot project intended to explore the potential of Big Data for official statistics. The results are based on an analysis of Wikipedia page views of World Heritage Sites. Whenever people use computer-mediated systems, they unintentionally leave digital traces of their activity. These traces are increasingly becoming a relevant source of information for official statistics, in particular due to the potential they offer for improving the timeliness, the detail and, in some cases, the accuracy of the statistics. For the purpose of this project Wikipedia page view counts constituted the main data source. Since its launch in 2001, Wikipedia has grown to hold a total of 39 million articles in 246 languages (1). It is widely used, recording 21 million page views per hour (in April 2016) (2). According to the Community survey on ICT usage in households and by individuals, in 2015 45 % of individuals between the ages of 16 and 74 living in the EU consulted wikis to obtain knowledge (e.g. Wikipedia). The proportion was 66 % amongst 16 to 24 year olds. Such widespread usage means that data about people\u2019s use of Wikipedia could potentially be a relevant big data source for producing official statistics. The pilot project used data on the number of page views per month for all articles in 31 language versions of Wikipedia (3). The data used is made publicly available by the Wikimedia Foundation. The version of Wikipedia designed for use on mobile devices was not included in the number of views. Wikipedia articles were selected for each of the 1 031 World Heritage Sites included on UNESCO\u2019s list in 2015. The initial selection was based on the categorisation feature in the English version of Wikipedia. The articles were linked to the corresponding heritage site on the basis of the information from the info box entitled \u2018World heritage site\u2019. Other language versions of the same articles where then selected, where available. Data analysis was based on the number of page views of around 50 000 articles. This pilot was run in the context of the Big Data Sandbox, an international collaboration project sponsored by the High-Level Group for the Modernisation of Official Statistics, set up by the Conference of European Statisticians. It involved, besides Eurostat, several national statistical institutes and other international statistical bodies. More information can be found on the Eurostat website.

        "1 Context Culture statistics 35 European Heritage Label The European Heritage Label is an EU-level initiative that was developed from an earlier inter-governmental initiative launched in 2006 in Spain. The label is awarded to sites that are recognised as having a symbolic European value and that have played a significant role in the history and culture of Europe and/or the building of the European Union. The types of site eligible are: monuments; natural, underwater, archaeological, industrial or urban sites; cultural landscapes; places of remembrance; cultural goods; objects and intangible heritage associated with a place, including contemporary heritage. There are three essential differences that distinguish the European Heritage Label from the World Heritage List: \u2022 European Heritage sites are chosen for their place in European history and their connection to the EU. The criteria for inclusion go far beyond the aesthetics of a particular site. \u2022 The European Heritage Label puts a particular focus on promoting the European dimension of the sites and providing access to them. This includes organising a wide range of educational activities, especially for young people. \u2022 European Heritage sites can each be appreciated individually, but also form part of a network. By seeing different sites, visitors can get a real feel for the diversity of European culture and the scale of what has been achieved in building the EU. European Capitals of Culture The European capital of culture is a city selected by the European Commission that, during a particular calendar year, hosts a wide range of cultural events, performances, activities and projects that have a strong European dimension. The initiative celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2015. Over its 30 years of existence, it has reached millions of Europeans in more than 50 cities. The initiative has become one of the most prestigious and high profile cultural events in Europe. The aims of the European Capitals of Culture initiative are to: \u2022 highlight the richness and diversity of the cultures present in Europe; \u2022 celebrate the aspects of cultural identity shared by Europeans; \u2022 increase European citizens\u2019 sense of belonging to a common cultural area; and \u2022 foster the contribution of culture to the development of cities In addition to this, experience has also shown that a city\u2019s year as Capital of Culture is an excellent opportunity to: \u2022 regenerate the city; \u2022 raise its international profile; \u2022 improve its image in the eyes of its own inhabitants; \u2022 breathe new life into the city\u2019s culture; and \u2022 boost tourism.

The main objective of EGMUS is to collect and publish comparable statistical data on museums, and also to further develop and standardise the collection of statistics on museums in Europe. To reach this objective, EGMUS developed a standard questionnaire to be used by participating in the network countries as part of their national surveys. Numerous countries follow the definition of museum adopted by the International Council of Museums (ICON). EGMUS publishes data on a number of topics on its own website (e.g. the number and type of museums, their ownership and management, the number of visits and admissions, income, expenditure, the use of computers, participation, etc.). The data are available for 30 countries, for the period from 1998. However, their availability varies between countries as the periodicity of data collection is not the same.

        "1 Context Culture statistics 43 3. Education This section focuses on two of the ties linking education with culture: the study of culture- related fields in tertiary education and the role played by education in facilitating cultural exchange, through the learning of foreign languages and the mobility of students in tertiary education. Some complementary data on people\u2019s knowledge of foreign languages are also included. Students in tertiary education studying culture-related fields Provided by universities and other higher education institutions, tertiary education plays an important role in society in determining employability and the specialisation of the workforce. The following broad fields of education are considered to be culture-related: \u2018Arts\u2019, \u2018Humanities\u2019, \u2018Journalism and information\u2019 and \u2018Architecture and town planning\u2019. In 2014, around one in every six tertiary students in the EU was studying in a culture-related field (see Figure 6), which equates to around 3 million students. The share of students in culture-related fields was above the EU average (16 %) in eight Member States and was highest, at nearly 19 %, in the United Kingdom and Italy. The country with the lowest proportion of students studying in culture-related fields was Bulgaria (10 %).

        "1 Context Culture statistics 45 Table 11 gives a breakdown of the students in the different fields of culture-related tertiary education, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of all tertiary students. In 2014, \u2018Humanities\u2019 was the most popular culture- related field of tertiary education among EU students (accounting for 8 % of total students), with the highest figures of around 10 % recorded in Luxembourg, Germany, Greece and Italy. Students in \u2018Arts\u2019 represented around 4 % of all tertiary students in the EU and here the biggest variation between countries was observed: from 1 % in Luxembourg to 11 % in Ireland. Students in \u2018Architecture and town planning\u2019 accounted for around 2 % of all EU tertiary students. A similar percentage (around 2 %) was noticed for students in \u2018Journalism and information\u2019 (including \u2018Library\u2019 and \u2018Archive\u2019). As can be seen from Figure 7, more women than men were enrolled in tertiary education in culture-related fields in 2014 (64 %), and the share of women students in these areas was 10 percentage points higher than the proportion of women students overall, i.e. across all fields. Two out of every three tertiary students studying in the culture-related fields \u2018Arts\u2019, \u2018Humanities\u2019 and \u2018Journalism and information\u2019 were women. \u2018Architecture and town planning\u2019 was the only field where female participation (50 %) was below the proportion of women students in tertiary education as a whole (54 %).

        "1 Context Culture statistics 46 Learning and knowledge of foreign languages Formal education \u2014 in schools and other educational institutions \u2014 provides the main opportunity for the vast majority of people to learn languages, while linguistic competencies are required and encouraged in many workplaces. In 2014, students in secondary education (ISCED levels 2 and 3) in the EU learnt on average between one and two foreign languages, depending on the educational programme followed (see Figure 8). In all Member States, on average at least one foreign language was taught in lower secondary (ISCED level 2) and general upper secondary (ISCED level 3 \u2014 general) schools, with the exception of the French Community in Belgium (0.9 languages in lower secondary programmes) and Portugal (0.8 languages in general upper secondary programmes). In Romania, Estonia, Finland, Malta and Luxembourg, students studied on average between two and three foreign languages in both lower and general upper secondary schools.

        "1 Context Culture statistics 47 Overall, there was less focus on foreign languages in vocational than in general upper secondary education. In ten Member States, not more than one language on average was taught in the vocational schools, with the figures particularly low in Spain, Denmark and Germany. As concerns the most commonly learnt foreign language in upper secondary general education (see Table 12), 94 % of all EU students at this level were studying English in 2014, compared with slightly less than a quarter (23 %) studying French, the next most widely learnt language in the EU. German and Spanish followed, with just less than a fifth (19 %) of students learning each of these languages in upper secondary general education.

        "1 Context Culture statistics 48 At Member State level, English remained the most commonly studied foreign language: over 90 % of upper secondary general education pupils were taught this language in all Member States, except in Portugal, Denmark, Hungary and Germany (where this percentage was below 90%). The second most widely-studied foreign language in upper-secondary general education was German in ten Member States, French in nine, Spanish in five, Russian in three, Dutch in the French Community in Belgium and Swedish in Finland. In addition to German, Spanish, French, Russian and English, Italian also appeared on the list of the third most widely learnt languages in Member States. The information on foreign language skills presented below is taken from the Adult Education Survey (AES) which collects information \u2014 on a self-reporting basis \u2014 on the number of languages spoken and the level at which they are spoken. As shown in Table 13, two out of every three people aged 25 to 64 living in the EU declared in 2011 knowing at least one foreign language. The proportion of the population stating that they knew at least one foreign language was above 85 % in 11 Member States, with the highest figure recorded in Luxembourg (99 %) and the lowest in Ireland (27 %). The survey also showed Luxembourg to have an exceptionally high proportion of the population (72 %) claiming to know at least three foreign languages (of which two are official languages in the country) while on average in the EU, 9 % of the population declared knowing three foreign languages. The proportion of the population that reported knowing three foreign languages was also important in three other countries: Finland (49 %), Slovenia (45 %) and Sweden (31 %). In the remaining EU Member States, the proportion was below 30 % (in 11 countries below 10 %). As these results come from self-reporting, it is important to also look at the additional information on the level of the best-known language. As can be seen from Table 14, in 2011, only one in every four people aged 25 to 64 in the EU reported being proficient in their best-known foreign language. Nearly half of the EU population (44 %), however, reported having a \u2018fair\u2019 level, i.e. could use the language in relation to familiar things and situations. The self-reported level of knowledge of the best-known language varied significantly between Member States. There were only three Member States (Luxembourg, Latvia and Malta) where over half of the adults considered themselves to be proficient in their best-known foreign language. In Greece and Poland, meanwhile, only 13 % of adults described themselves as proficient users of a foreign language. ",

        "1 Context Culture statistics 51 In the majority of countries, the proportion of the population who had a \u2018fair\u2019 level in their best-known foreign language was higher than the proportion who described themselves as proficient users. In Luxembourg, Latvia, Malta, Sweden, Lithuania and the Netherlands, however, the percentage of proficient users was at least twice as high as that of \u2018fair\u2019 level users. Mobility of students in tertiary education Irrespective of students\u2019 initial motivation for studying abroad, it offers not only an opportunity to experience a new educational system but also to discover (or get to know better) the culture of the host country. In addition, both the students studying abroad and those in their own country benefit from being in contact with students from another country. The data presented here consider two types of mobility during tertiary education: \u2018degree mobility\u2019 (which refers to students enrolled on a programme in another country, with a view to obtaining a degree in that country) and \u2018Erasmus credit mobility\u2019 (which refers to shorter stays abroad, during which the student attends courses and earns credits that are then transferred to the programme they are enrolled on in their home country, with a view to graduating in that country). The data on degree mobility for the EU as a whole show that the higher the level of studies, the more students from abroad there were enrolled: in 2013, the proportion of students enrolled who were not in their home country was highest for doctoral programmes (25 %) (4), followed by Master\u2019s (11 %) and Bachelor\u2019s (6 %). Short-cycle tertiary programmes typically had fewer students from abroad (5 %) (see Table 15). (4) With Germany included, it stands at 21 %.

        "1 Context Culture statistics 53 The relative number of mobile students enrolled on both Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s programmes was especially high in Luxembourg (42 %), Austria and the United Kingdom (20 % and 18 % respectively) and, to a lesser extent, in Cyprus (15 %) and France (10 %). Regarding the origin of those mobile students, at EU level, the number of non-EU students studying in the EU exceeded the number of EU students studying in another EU country at all levels of tertiary education. Considering Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s programmes together, around two thirds of mobile students came from outside the EU. That predominance was especially salient in Finland, France, Lithuania and Portugal, where more than four of every five mobile students came from outside the EU. As regards credit mobile students, the Erasmus exchange programme is open to the EU Member States, the EFTA countries and some EU candidate countries, making a total of 34 countries. In the academic year 2013\u20132014, over 250 000 EU students studied abroad through the Erasmus programme (see Table 16). With over 30 000 outgoing students each, Spain, France and Germany contributed the most to the EU total, and together with Italy accounted for over half (54 %) of the EU Erasmus mobility. These four countries also hosted 47 % of all Erasmus students, resulting in a good balance of \u2018incoming\u2019 and \u2018outgoing\u2019 students. Some countries hosted significantly more students than sending them abroad: in Sweden, Ireland and Cyprus, there were more than twice as many incoming students as outgoing students. The unbalance was even more marked in Malta. The reverse situation was observed in Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia, where there were around twice as many outgoing as incoming students. ",

        "1 Context Culture statistics 55 Methodological notes Education For the needs of compilation of statistics presented in this section, a main EU data source for education statistics was used: Education systems (UOE) data collection. The joint UOE data collection relies on administrative data and is administered jointly by the UNESCO Scientific, and Cultural Organization Institute for Statistics (UNESCO-UIS), the OECD and Eurostat. This common data collection provides annual statistics on participation and completion of education programmes by pupils and students, personnel in education and the expenditure on education. Data on regional enrolments and foreign language learning are collected additionally by Eurostat. The data on education are disaggregated by the levels of education defined in the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011). There are eight educational levels in ISCED. Compared to ISCED 1997 which had seven levels of education, ISCED 2011 distinguishes nine levels - from level 0 to level 8: \u2022 ISCED 0: Early childhood education \u2022 ISCED 1: Primary education \u2022 ISCED 2: Lower secondary education \u2022 ISCED 3: Upper secondary education \u2022 ISCED 4: Post-secondary non-tertiary education Tertiary education: \u2022 ISCED 5: Short-cycle tertiary education \u2022 ISCED 6: Bachelor\u2019s or equivalent level \u2022 ISCED 7: Master\u2019s or equivalent level \u2022 ISCED 8: Doctoral or equivalent level ISCED classifies also fields of education . In the current publication, 2014 data on fields of education are still classified according to ISCED Fields of Education 1997. Within this classification four fields of education were identified as related to culture: \u2022 Arts (fine arts, music and performing arts, audio-visual techniques and media production, design, craft skills); \u2022 Humanities (religion, foreign languages, mother tongue, history and archaeology, philosophy and ethics); \u2022 Journalism and information (journalism and reporting, library, information, archive) and \u2022 Architecture and town planning .

Students can study abroad for up to 12 months (in any cycle of tertiary education) \u2014 there is credit mobility. Within the UOE data collection, Eurostat gathers data on foreign languages teaching in secondary educational programmes. The educational curriculum drawn up in each country defines the languages considered as foreign languages in that country and this definition is applied during data collection. Regional languages are included, if they are considered as alternatives to foreign languages. Non-nationals studying their native language in special classes or those studying the language(s) of the host country are excluded. Adult Education Survey (AES) is a source of data on the knowledge of languages by the adult population (self-reported competencies). The survey focuses on people aged 25\u201364 living in private households and the reference period is the 12-months prior to the respondent\u2019s interview. The last data available refer to the AES 2011. ",

        "2 Culture statistics 58 Cultural employment This chapter presents data on cultural employment derived from the EU Labour Force Survey (LFS) covering the population aged 15 and over. These statistics were obtained using the methodology proposed in the ESSnet-Culture final report (2012). The report defines \u2018cultural employment\u2019 by including all persons working in a sector defined as \u2018cultural\u2019, irrespective of whether they were employed in a cultural occupation. In addition, all occupations relating to culture were included, even where the people concerned were employed in non-cultural sectors. The analysis presented here seeks to provide an overview of cultural employment, comparing it to total employment over time and presenting it in the light of other variables used in the EU-LFS, such as age, gender and educational attainment. Additionally, there is a short section devoted to the characteristics of certain cultural occupations (artists, writers, etc.). More than 6 million cultural jobs in the EU (nearly 3 % of total employment) As regards occupations , cultural jobs embrace such professions as writers, architects, musicians, journalists, actors, dancers, librarians, handicraft workers and graphic designers. Taking the sector approach, cultural jobs relate to activities such as: \u2018creative, arts and entertainment activities\u2019, \u2018libraries, archives, museums and other cultural activities\u2019, \u2018programming and broadcasting activities\u2019, \u2018motion picture, video and television programme production, sound recording and music publishing activities\u2019 and \u2018specialised design activities\u2019. A full list of NACE and ISCO codes relevant to cultural employment is provided in the section \u2018Methodological notes\u2019 below. On the basis of this definition of \u2018cultural employment\u2019, 6.3 million people in the EU were working in a cultural sector or occupation in 2014, that is, 2.9 % of the total number of people in employment (see Figures 1 and 2).

        "2 Culture statistics 59 Cultural employment There was a small but steady increase in the number of people working in culture between 2011 and 2014 (see Table 1). In 2014 there were 230 000 more (+ 4 %) cultural jobs in the EU than in 2011, showing an annual average growth rate (AAGR) of + 1.3 % (see Table 2). The slight increase was also observed in relative terms: cultural employment as a percentage of the total rose from 2.8 % in 2011 to 2.9 % in 2014. In individual countries, the percentage of people employed in culture in 2014 varied from 1.1 % in Romania to 5.2 % in Luxembourg. The share was also high (above 3.5 %) in Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, Slovenia and Sweden. The EFTA countries (Iceland, Switzerland and Norway) all had percentages above the EU average, while the candidate countries (the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey) had shares below the EU average.

        "2 Culture statistics 60 Cultural employment The evolution of the weight of cultural employment in total employment between 2011 and 2014 varied among EU Member States. While the indicator rose slightly or stagnated in general, there was a slight decrease in four countries: Estonia, Germany, Hungary and Finland (see Table 1). In all the others, both the share of cultural employment and the number of people employed rose during the same period. The largest relative increase in the share of cultural employment, by 0.8 percentage points, was recorded in Luxembourg. With around 140 000 more cultural jobs in 2014 than in 2011, the United Kingdom accounted for 59 % of the total increase in cultural employment in the EU. Cultural employment showed some resilience to the 2008 financial crisis From an economic perspective, it is interesting to look at figures on employment after 2008, the year of the financial crisis. However, the ISCO revision was implemented for the reference year 2011, affecting the EU-LFS figures on cultural employment: pre-2011 figures are underestimated compared to those from 2011 onwards. As a result of that break in series, trends are presented separately for 2008\u201310 and 2011\u201314 (see Figure 2 and Table 2). The trend data reveal the extent to which cultural employment was hit by the 2008 crisis (see Table 2), especially in the first two years after the financial crisis (2008\u201310).

        "2 Culture statistics 63 Cultural employment From 2008 to 2010, numbers of cultural jobs rose by an annual average of 0.7 %. Although modest at first sight, this represents quite a good performance compared to total employment, for which a negative average annual growth rate was recorded over the same period (\u2013 1.4 %). In other words, the data show that the cultural sector had a certain resilience to the crisis. Indeed, cultural employment (in millions of people and as a percentage of total employment) rose steadily between 2008 and 2010, while total employment plunged over the same period. That contrast between cultural and total employment trends was still visible after 2011, although to a lesser extent. It finally vanished in 2014, when both growth rates were positive and similar (1.4 % for cultural employment, 1.3 % for total employment). As in total employment, more men than women are employed in culture in the EU Female participation in the labour market is one of the concerns of the European Commission, which is committed to promoting equality between men and women by creating conditions conducive to increasing women\u2019s participation and taking actions to promote it. Men continued to account for a larger share of the EU labour market in 2014 (54 %) \u2014 see Figure 3. Their share in cultural employment was also higher than women\u2019s, at 53 %, mirroring the overall ratio.

        "2 Culture statistics 64 Cultural employment In seven Member States (France, Cyprus, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Spain and the United Kingdom), not only were women\u2019s shares in cultural employment the lowest recorded in the EU (45 % or less), but comparison with total employment figures also showed that women were under-represented in culture. For example, in Austria and the United Kingdom, women\u2019s share in the total labour market stood at 47 %, while it was even lower in the cultural sectors, at 42 %. In Italy and Greece, shares as low as 45 % merely reflected the overall gender gap in employment as a whole. On the other hand, women are in a slight majority in the cultural sectors of 11 EU Member States. Their share in cultural employment rises to over 60 % in the Baltic countries, where women and men are equally represented in total employment. Young people\u2019s share of cultural jobs varies considerably across the EU In the EU overall, 1.14 million people aged between 15 and 29 were working in the cultural field in 2014. This represented 18 % of all cultural jobs and was very close to this age group\u2019s share in overall employment (19 %) (see Figure 4). At Member State level, the proportions of young people in cultural employment varied a lot, from 10 % in Italy to 31 % in Malta. In 16 Member States the share of employed people aged 15\u201329 was above the EU-28 average, while four of them had shares at least 5 percentage points higher than the EU average: Estonia, Malta, Romania and the United Kingdom. On the other hand, Greece, Luxembourg and Italy\u2019s shares of young people were 5 percentage points below the EU average. The young (15\u201329-year-olds) were in general slightly under-represented in cultural jobs by comparison with their shares in total employment (situation observed in 16 Member States). In the remaining 12 Member States, the percentages of young people in cultural employment were higher than those in total employment, Romania recording the highest difference of 6 percentage points. A comparison between the share of the 15\u201329 age group in cultural employment in 2008 and in 2014 shows a 3 percentage point decrease from 21 % to 18 % in the EU as a whole. Young people\u2019s share in cultural employment fell in most EU countries, rising only in Estonia, Denmark, Latvia, Hungary and Sweden. The steepest decreases were in Greece and Slovenia (both \u2013 10 percentage points), Ireland and Spain (both \u2013 9 percentage points), and Portugal (\u2013 8 percentage points) (see Figure 5). The financial and economic crisis that hit Europe in 2008 may explain this fall, as the first age groups to suffer on the labour market in a recession are the youngest (see Figure 6). ",

The share of people with tertiary education working in culture was almost double that in total employment (33 %), representing a difference of 27 percentage points (see Figure 7). Of the three variables analysed so far (sex, age and educational attainment), the last is the one which most closely defines cultural employment. This is not surprising, as many cultural occupations require years of study (e.g. architects, journalists, linguists, often musicians, etc.) In 2014, over half of people working in culture in 23 EU Member States were educated to tertiary level (see Figures 7 and 8); this is very different from the situation in overall employment. The share of people having tertiary educational attainment among all workers with cultural jobs exceeds 60 % in 13 countries: Bulgaria, France, Slovenia, Finland, Ireland, Poland, the United Kingdom, Estonia, Cyprus, Belgium, Lithuania, Spain and Luxembourg (where it peaked at 84 %).

        "2 Culture statistics 68 Cultural employment Focus on artists and writers This section presents some characteristics of two ISCO categories of occupations: \u2018creative and performing artists\u2019 (including visual artists, musicians, dancers, actors and film directors, etc.) and \u2018authors, journalists and linguists\u2019. For simplicity\u2019s sake they are referred to below as \u2018artists and writers\u2019. There were about 1.9 million of them EU-wide in 2014, accounting for 30 % of total cultural employment. This section deals with some features of employment considered relevant to the working conditions of artists and writers: self-employment status, working time (full-time versus part-time), multiple job-holding and, for employees, contractual status (permanent versus temporary contracts). Nearly half (49 %) of all artists and writers in the EU were self-employed in 2014 (see Figure 9). This percentage is much higher than that reported in total employment (15 %). The substantial difference is largely due to the weight of countries such as Germany (where self- employment in cultural jobs reached 55 %), the United Kingdom and the Netherlands (both 65 %).

        "2 Culture statistics 69 Cultural employment This contrasts with countries where self-employment among artists and writers accounted for only around 20 % (Croatia and Luxembourg). But even in those countries, the share of self-employment in these cultural occupations lay above the share in the total working population. Time spent at work is an important determinant of the worker\u2019s position in the labour market and, in most cases, of his or her financial resources. Full-time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part- timers. In the EU, 70 % of artists and writers said they had a full-time job, which is lower than the corresponding proportion of the total workforce: 80 % (see Table 3). Countries where artists and writers reported a full-time job more often than the total workforce are very rare (Denmark, Luxembourg and the EFTA country Iceland). Rather, as a rule artists and writers proportionally less often held full-time positions, while the figures were sometimes far lower, as in Cyprus (64 % of full-time artists and writers, against 86 % in overall employment), Austria (56 %, as opposed to 72 % in the total workforce) and France (64 % by comparison with 81 %). The Netherlands is the only EU country where fewer than half of artists and writers worked full-time (42 %). Part-time work was indeed more widespread here than in other countries (50 %). Part-time employment may lead workers to consider getting a second job. \u2018Full-time part-timers\u2019 sometimes seek to complement their main part-time job with another part-time occupation, to increase income. Holding a second job may thus be an indication of (self-perceived) precarious employment. However, there are various reasons for holding multiple jobs. In particular, people working simultaneously in their own professional practice (self-employed) and for a public or private employer are also considered to hold two jobs. A self-employed person owning two businesses also enters into that category. Table 3 shows the percentage of employed people with only one job. EU-wide, 96 % of employed people held one job, while the figure was 90 % for artists and writers. With notable exceptions in Greece, Malta and Romania, artists and writers were less likely than other workers to have only one job. The biggest differences were recorded in Estonia (where only 77 % of artists and writers had only one job, against 95 % in the whole workforce), France (82 %, by comparison with 96 %) and the Netherlands (79 % versus 92 %). As regards employees, artists and writers stood less chance of securing a contract than employees as a whole. In the EU, 86 % of all employees had a permanent employment contract in 2014, while the figure was just 76 % for artists and writers. This discrepancy was particularly visible in France, where only 56 % of artists and writers had a permanent contract, as opposed to 84 % of the total population of employees. The situation was more favourable for artists and writers working as employees in Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg, Slovakia and, above all, in Lithuania and Romania where all of them reported that they held a permanent contract.

        "2 Culture statistics 71 Cultural employment Methodological notes The statistical concept of cultural employment is derived from the methodology proposed by the European Statistical System (ESS) Network on Culture in the ESSnet-Culture final report (2012). The report defines cultural employment by crossing the NACE Rev. 2 classification (which classifies the main economic activity of the local unit where the person concerned works) and the ISCO- 08 classification (which classifies occupations). As the ESSnet-Culture final report notes, one can speak of \u2018cultural employment\u2019 in three types of situation: \u2022 member of the workforce (a) holds a cultural occupation and (b) works in the cultural sector (e.g. a ballet dancer employed by a ballet company or a journalist working for a daily newspaper); \u2022 member of the workforce holds a cultural occupation outside the cultural sector (e.g. a designer in the automobile industry); \u2022 member of the workforce holds a non-cultural occupation in the cultural sector (e.g. an accountant in a publishing house). Eurostat\u2019s statistics on cultural employment come from the European Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS). Eurostat compiles these data using a specific matrix and structures them using three basic core variables: sex, age and educational attainment. These statistics provide information about cultural jobs and enable cultural employment to be compared with overall employment. The table below lists all ISCO and NACE codes classified as 100 % cultural by the ESSnet-Culture final report (2012).

The 3-digit NACE codes and 4-digit ISCO codes were therefore not identifiable for all countries. In such cases, the cultural employment figures were estimated on the basis of the countries that provide a higher level of detail. When estimating cultural employment, it is difficult to determine what proportion of activities and occupations that are only partly cultural is genuinely culture-related. Activities and occupations for which it was impossible to determine the relevant proportion have been excluded from estimates. For example, ISCO 1431 \u2014 \u2019sports, recreation and cultural centre managers\u2019 \u2014 refers to an occupation with a cultural component; however, it is impossible to estimate the proportion of that occupation ",
        "2 Culture statistics 73 Cultural employment which relates to culture. Taking a conservative approach, it was therefore decided not to include this occupation when calculating cultural employment figures. Moreover, in the EU-LFS survey the lack of information on secondary cultural jobs means that they cannot be included under \u2018cultural employment\u2019 (only the main job of survey respondents has been taken into account). In view of these limitations and the approach chosen, data on cultural employment clearly represent a very conservative estimate. 2011 saw a general break in cultural employment time series when the new international classification of occupations, ISCO-08, was implemented. The old ISCO-88 classification was less able to identify and isolate cultural occupations. For example, architects were lost under the ISCO-88 taxonomy, as they were aggregated at the highest codification detail (4 digits), together with traffic planners (ISCO-88 code 2141). To minimise the impact of the old classification system on employment figures for reference years 2008\u20132010, the number of \u2018lost occupations\u2019 was estimated on the basis of 2011 data. For example, an estimated 202 000 architects EU-wide would have been left out of account in 2011 if ISCO-88 had been used. In all, around 500 000 cultural occupations are in the same situation, accounting for 0.43 % of total employment. Following that rationale, the adjustment was computed for each country and then applied to reference years 2008\u20132010, relying on a stability assumption: it was assumed that, between 2008 and 2011, occupations not identified under ISCO-88 were stable as a share of total employment. However, it was possible to estimate this adjustment only for countries that provided the highest level of detail for NACE (3 digits) and ISCO (4 digits) in 2011. The EU level adjustment for each category of breakdown (sex, age, educational attainment) was applied to all other countries. \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 ",

Cultural enterprises employed close to 2.2 million people (self-employed and employees), an average of 3 persons each. The cultural sectors\u2019 turnover (the total value of market sales of goods and services) was around EUR 300 billion, which represented 5.3 % of the turnover of total services (see Figure 1 and Table 2).

In fact, turnover per head (i.e. by employed person) was about EUR 140 000 in the cultural sectors, as against around EUR 105 000 in total service activities. France and Italy were the only Member States with over 100 000 cultural enterprises, each accounting for 15 % of the EU total number of cultural enterprises. Together with Germany (73 000 enterprises) and Spain (68 000), these four countries represented over half of the EU total. As a proportion of all enterprises in total services, cultural enterprises were most prominent in Belgium, Greece and Sweden (all 8 %), followed by Slovenia, Denmark, France and the Netherlands (all 7 %), all of which ranked above the EU average. Shares were smallest in Lithuania (3 %), Portugal, Latvia and Bulgaria (all 4 %). ",
        "3 Cultural enterprises Culture statistics 78 As regards enterprise size, Lithuania was the only Member State in which the average number of persons employed in cultural enterprises approached that in total services. In all other countries (even the United Kingdom and Germany, where cultural enterprises were the largest in Europe, averaging around six employed persons), cultural enterprises tend to be smaller than in other sectors of activities. With 9.2 % of all EU cultural enterprises in 2013, the United Kingdom accounted for 22.7 % of the turnover of EU cultural businesses. Together with Germany (20.8 %) and France (16.6 %), these three countries generated 60 % of EU cultural turnover. The United Kingdom was also the Member State in which the turnover of cultural businesses was highest as a proportion of total services: 6.4 %, which is more than a percentage point higher than the EU average (5.3 %). In most countries, cultural turnover is struggling to recover from the crisis Turnover is a valid indicator for analysing the impact of the financial crisis that hit the global economy in 2008, as it reveals the amount of market sales of goods and services. In general, the crisis had a big impact on turnover in the cultural sectors. In 2013, most of the 16 Member States for which data are available had yet to return to 2008 performance levels. Exceptions were Germany, Austria, Sweden and the United Kingdom, but even they failed to see the same rates of growth as recorded for total services (see Table 2). Sweden ranked top, with an annual average growth rate (AAGR) of 3.6 % (as against 5.2 % in total services). A few countries recorded some signs of recovery in the middle of the period from 2008 to 2013, but tended to lose the gains subsequently. In France, for example, positive annual growth in 2010 was followed by negative figures until 2013, the last year for which data are available (see Table 3). ",

        "3 Cultural enterprises Culture statistics 84 In 2013, the highest contribution of the cultural sectors to total services value added was registered in Poland (6.9 %). In this country, the weight of the cultural sectors was largely due to the strength of programming and broadcasting activities (2.9 % of total services, while that sector failed to reach 2.0 % in other countries). Germany (5.8 %) and the United Kingdom (5.7 %) also enter the top 3, due to the relative importance of publishing activities (1.9 % of total services in both countries). Publishing activities recorded the highest contribution to total services value added in Finland (2.5 % of total services). As regards the \u2018films, TV and music\u2019 sector, the share was greatest in Hungary (2.1 %), followed by France (1.7 %). \u2018News agency activities\u2019 was the cultural sector accounting for the smallest proportion of total services value added; the United Kingdom stood out with 0.4 %. The relative importance of architectural activities peaked in Greece (1.6 %) and Austria (1.4 %), while that of specialised design activities was greatest in Italy and Sweden (0.7 %). Does the size of cultural enterprises matter? In three NACE divisions/groups (J59: \u2018films, TV and music\u2019, J60: \u2018programming and broadcasting activities\u2019 and M741: \u2018specialised design activities\u2019), it was possible to analyse key economic indicators by enterprise size class. This allows for in-depth analysis of SMEs, which are regarded as essential to the European economy, driving job creation and economic growth. Given their importance to Europe\u2019s economy, SMEs are a major focus of EU policy.

        "3 Cultural enterprises Culture statistics 85 At EU level (see Table 6), micro enterprises (employing fewer than 10 persons) had a preponderant role in total services, where they represented 94 % of all firms in 2013. This is also true of the cultural sectors: across the EU in 2013, there were over 120 000 micro enterprises in films, TV and music (96 % of all firms in that sector) and 160 000 in specialised design activities (99 %). The \u2018programming and broadcasting activities\u2019 sector is more varied: \u2018only\u2019 85 % (10 000) of firms are micro enterprises and there are relatively more small firms (10 to 49 persons employed) and large businesses (250 or more). Cultural SMEs play a massive role in creating employment in both sectors for which data are available: they provided jobs for over 315 000 people in films, TV and music (78 % of the workforce in that sector) and 233 000 in specialised design activities (98 %). These figures are significantly higher than those for total services, where SMEs generated two out of every three jobs in 2013. As compared with other size classes, micro enterprises made the biggest contributions of value added in films, TV and music (around EUR 8 billion, or 32 % of the sectoral total) and specialised design activities (EUR 6 billion, or 61 %). However, these remain below their contribution to employment, suggesting they have relatively low apparent labour productivity (i.e. value added by person employed) as compared with other size classes. Table 6 confirms that micro enterprises are less productive than larger businesses (in terms of value added by person employed). This is not surprising given the pattern in total services, where the data indicate that the larger the enterprise, the more productive it is. The only noticeable exception to this is the films, TV and music sector, where the apparent labour productivity of SMEs outstripped that of large enterprises (EUR 69 000 per head, as against EUR 42 000). Programming and broadcasting activities again displayed a very particular profile, with large enterprises\u2019 value added (82 % of the sector total) far exceeding levels in the other two cultural sectors analysed here (15 % for films, TV and music; 7 % for specialised design activities) and the average in total services (39 %). In addition, large enterprises\u2019 apparent labour productivity in programming and broadcasting activities (EUR 126 000 per person employed) and specialised design activities (EUR 130 000) was more than double that in total services (EUR 53 000). At country level, the prominence of SMEs as a percentage of all enterprises reflected the overall EU pattern, exceeding 99 % in most countries except Germany (96 % in programming and broadcasting activities). The analysis of apparent labour productivity at country level reveals more varied results (see Table 7). In particular, large enterprises were not systematically more productive. For example, in programming and broadcasting activities, micro enterprises were more productive in two (Bulgaria and Germany) of the nine Member States for which comparison is possible. Regarding cultural SMEs as compared with the average SME in total services, programming and broadcasting SMEs were more productive in Germany, Hungary and Poland, but outclassed in the three other Member States for which data are available (Spain, Romania and the United Kingdom). \u2018Programming and broadcasting activities\u2019 is the only cultural sector for which negative added value is recorded (for large enterprises in Bulgaria and small firms in Slovenia). In films, TV and music, SMEs were more productive than large enterprises in four out of six countries for which data are available. In Poland and (even more so) Germany, large enterprises were more than twice as productive as SMEs. The productivity of SMEs in that sector was higher than the average for total services. ",

        "3 Cultural enterprises Culture statistics 89 in all five countries for which data are available. The productivity of SME\u2019s in that sector was especially high in France (EUR 130 000 per person employed). However, the EU\u2019s most productive enterprises in that sector were medium-sized businesses in Hungary (EUR 223 000). National data for specialised design activities are scarce. Micro enterprises were the most competitive firms in the United Kingdom (EUR 70 000 per person employed). In Spain, medium-sized enterprises were exceptionally productive (nearly EUR 400 000). Business demography (BD) \u2014 dynamics of cultural enterprises BD statistics report indicators such as enterprise birth and death rates, allowing analysis of the dynamics of a sector in terms of job creation and survival rates. These statistics cover only some of the cultural sectors referred to in the first part of this article but include market-oriented enterprises in two NACE divisions excluded from SBS: \u2018creative, arts and entertainment activities\u2019 (NACE R90) and \u2018libraries, archives, museums and other cultural activities\u2019 (NACE R91, hereafter referred to as \u2018libraries and museums\u2019) (see Table 1). Merging this NACE 90 and 91 coverage (around 350 000 enterprises) with that of the SBS (675 000), we can cautiously estimate (2) that there were at least 1 million market-oriented enterprises in the cultural sectors in the EU in 2013, accounting for 10 % of all services enterprises (except those in trade and financial activities), or around 4 % of the total business economy (3). Job creation The newly born enterprises have an impact on the labour market, notably in terms of job creation. In 2012, among the cultural sectors, it was especially the case for \u2018specialised design activities\u2019 and \u2018creative, arts and entertainment activities\u2019 (see Figure 3). In \u2018specialised design activities\u2019 new enterprises accounted for 10 % of employment in that sector at EU level in 2012, well above the 2.5 % average for total services. This was true in all Member States, with Romania top-ranking (new enterprises providing 26 % of jobs in specialised design). \u2018Creative, arts and entertainment activities\u2019 was the other cultural sector with a substantial job creation index: this exceeded the average for total services in all Member States, apart from two small negative differences in Austria (2.6 % versus 2.9 % in total services) and the United Kingdom (4.8 % versus 5.2 %). (2) SBS data are collected through statistical surveys or from business registers or administrative sources, at the discretion of the NSIs.

        "3 Cultural enterprises Culture statistics 90 Survival rates: some cultural enterprises coping better than others with the 2008 crisis The focus here is to present information about the life-cycle of newly born enterprises and their ability to survive for up to five years after being set up. Business demography data collection enables the tracking of newly born enterprises over a five-year period. As data are available up to 2013, they allow for reporting on the life-cycle of enterprises set up in the economic watershed year of 2008. On average, across the EU (4), survival rates for enterprises in total services (5) were about 80 % after one year, 60 % after three and 45 % after five (see Table 8). In comparison, enterprises in the films, TV and music did quite well, with survival rates of around 85 % after 1 year, 65 % after 3 years and 55 % after 5 years. In contrast, enterprises involved in the sector of libraries and museums (NACE R91) were less likely to thrive, with an average of 70 % surviving after one year, falling to 45 % after three years and 35 % after five. The three other cultural sectors analysed here were in tune with the average of total services, with a slight reservation as regards the long-term life expectancy of enterprises in \u2018creative, arts and entertainment activities\u2019 (around 40 % survival after five years) (see Figure 4).

Coming back to the robust \u2018films, TV and music\u2019 sector, the highest one-year survival rates at country level were recorded in Cyprus and Luxembourg (both 100 %) and Sweden (99 %). In the cases of Cyprus and Luxembourg, the picture was less positive after five years, when survival rates fell to (or even below) average levels. In the long run (five years), Lithuanian enterprises showed the best powers of endurance, with an outstanding survival rate of 81 %. Sweden, Austria, and France also recorded respectable results (over two thirds of enterprises survived to the age of five). At the other end of the scale, the lowest one-year survival rates (around 70 %) were reported in Germany and Portugal; the situation did not improve with time (an estimated 35 % of German enterprises were still going after five years). Libraries and museums suffered more than most sectors from the decimation of new enterprises. One-year survival rates in Spain and Latvia were by far the lowest ever recorded in all sectors (around 25 %). In Latvia, this rate stabilised in subsequent years, but in Spain it fell even further, to 17 % after five years. In Estonia and Finland, one in two enterprises failed to get through their first year. Even in Cyprus, where all survived the first year, none survived two years later. ",
        "3 Cultural enterprises Culture statistics 94 Methodological notes Eurostat compiles data on culture related businesses from two main data sources: Structural Business Statistics (SBS) and Business Demography (BD). SBS cover industry, construction, trade and service enterprises classified according to the Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (NACE Rev. 2). This classification allows for a detailed sectoral breakdown of business activities (up to three-digit breakdown). SBS indicators describe enterprises from the monetary point of view (value added, turnover, staffing costs) and as regards number of enterprises. When an enterprise exercises more than one economic activity, the value added and turnover that it generates, the persons it employs and the values of all other variables, will be classified under its principal activity (normally the activity that generates the greatest value added). BD statistics cover variables that explain the characteristics and demography of the business population (data on enterprise births and deaths, and derived indicators such as survival rate). They do not take account of enterprises being created or closed solely as a result of restructuring, merger or break-up, for example. The data are basically drawn from business registers, but some countries improve the availability of data on employment and turnover by integrating other sources. As regards the cultural sectors, the coverages of SBS and BD data differ somewhat: \u2022 The SBS contain data on the structure, conduct and performance of industry, construction, trade and services businesses. To focus on the economic dimension of culture, the following NACE Rev. 2 sectors were selected: Code Cultural sectors J5811 Book publishing J5813 Publishing of newspapers J5814 Publishing of journals and periodicals J5821 Publishing of computer games J59 Motion picture, video and television programme production, sound recording and music publishing activities J60 Programming and broadcasting activities J6391 News agency activities M7111 Architectural activities M741 Specialised design activities \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 ",

        "4 Culture statistics 98 International trade in cultural goods Statistics on international trade in cultural goods enable to monitor the value of international exchanges of these goods and show the weight of trade in cultural goods in the whole EU international trade. This chapter covers data from 2008 to 2014 and presents the following groups of indicators pertaining to international trade in cultural goods: \u2022 export and import values in millions of euro; \u2022 extra-EU and intra-EU trade; \u2022 the type of cultural goods traded; and \u2022 the EU\u2019s main trading partners. Cultural trade 2008\u201314, at EU and national levels \u2018Cultural goods\u2019 are the products of artistic creativity that convey artistic, symbolic and aesthetic values; examples are antiques, works of art, books, newspapers, photos, films and music. The category includes CDs, DVDs and video games and consoles, as media enabling access to cultural content. It also includes musical instruments, which are not cultural goods in themselves, but represent means of artistic expression. \u2018Cultural goods\u2019 exclude products of large scale manufacturing even if they facilitate access to cultural content (e.g. TV sets or CD players). Cultural goods do not penetrate markets and are not consumed by households in the same way as other more common products. Moreover, the group of cultural products itself is very heterogeneous. There will be much less interest in embroidery, maps, and architectural plans and drawings, for example, than for CDs and DVDs. These differences in consumption characteristics of cultural goods and also the structure of industrial production and its specialisation in different Member States have an impact on patterns of imports and exports of cultural articles. In EU international trade statistics, the term \u2018goods\u2019 means all movable property, i.e. products having a physical and tangible dimension (but also gas and electricity). International trade in licenses and copyrights is therefore not included. EU cultural trade \u2014 from deficit to surplus The EU\u2019s cultural goods trade balance switched from a trade deficit of EUR 2 068 million in 2008 to a trade surplus of EUR 1 857 million in 2014, which meant an increase in the export/import ratio from 0.8 to 1.2 (see Table 1). This change was the result of an increase in exports (from EUR 10 535 million to EUR 12 725 million) and a decrease in imports (from EUR 12 603 million to EUR 10 868 million). Please note that EU figures presented here exclude intra-EU trade. In other words, the EU is deemed to be a single entity and internal exchanges (between Member States) are not counted. However, national figures refer to both intra- and extra-EU trade. ",

        "4 Culture statistics 100 International trade in cultural goods While the overall annual average growth rate (AAGR) was + 3.2 % for exports and \u2013 2.4 % for imports, a breakdown by product reveals various trends. Between 2008 and 2014, export and import growth rates were positive for \u2018works of art\u2019 and \u2018antiques\u2019, which also had the highest AAGR in terms of exports. \u2018Works of art\u2019 was also one of the largest contributors to the general improvement of the cultural goods trade balance. \u2018Books\u2019 made the second largest contribution, with a significant trade surplus and positive export growth from 2008. An export/ import ratio for \u2018works of art\u2019 in 2014 with export values twice as high as import values also illustrates the ongoing dynamism of this sector on international markets. As regards \u2018newspapers, journals and periodicals\u2019, \u2018films, video games and consoles\u2019, and \u2018CDs, DVDs and gramophone records\u2019, the AAGR between 2008 and 2014 was negative for both exports and imports, with 2014 imports of \u2018CDs, DVDs and gramophone records\u2019 accounting for less than half (\u2013 55 %) of the 2008 value. This falling trend in imports reflects changes in support media for cultural content, which is increasingly available in digital form via the internet. In the case of \u2018books\u2019, \u2018musical instruments\u2019, \u2018photographic plates and films\u2019, and \u2018maps\u2019, exports increased while imports decreased. Two categories of cultural goods displayed opposite tendencies: exports of \u2018embroidery and knitted or crocheted fabrics\u2019 and \u2018architectural plans and drawings\u2019 decreased but imports grew. \u2018Architectural plans and drawings\u2019 saw a particularly sharp decrease by 27 % a year on average since 2008 in exports; as a result, the export/import ratio shifted from 56 in 2008 to 7 in 2014. Uneven trends in cultural trade at country level: from two-digit increase to two-digit fall The analysis of times series for imports and exports of cultural goods in 2008\u20132014 at country level reveals trends from a two-digit increase to a two-digit fall. Twelve EU Member States recorded a positive AAGR in exports. Latvia and Cyprus had the highest cultural export AAGRs (+ 19 % and + 13 % respectively) between 2008 and 2014 (see Figure 1). In Latvia, exports grew from around EUR 35 million in 2008 to around EUR 100 million in 2014. ",

The AAGR of Poland\u2019s cultural imports (+ 11 %) was by far the highest rate in the EU (in large part due to a big increase in the \u2018films, video games and consoles\u2019 category) (see Figure 2). The AAGR was positive in only two other EU Member States: Lithuania and Estonia. Cyprus, which had the second highest AAGR for exports, registered the steepest fall for imports (\u2013 13 % per year), which affected almost all categories of cultural goods. Greece and Portugal saw greater decreases in their cultural import AAGRs (around \u2013 10 %) than in their exports.

        "4 Culture statistics 103 International trade in cultural goods Many factors may have led to the fall in imports of cultural goods. The economic crisis, the digital shift for many support media and challenges created by new technologies, certainly affected the cultural consumption patterns and in consequence the composition of the basket of imports. Contribution of cultural trade to overall trade Despite the growth in the value of extra-EU exports in cultural goods, they accounted for a slightly lower proportion of total extra-EU trade (down from 0.80 % in 2008 to 0.75 % in 2014), meaning that growth in exports of cultural goods was slower than growth in extra-EU exports overall (see Figure 3). The stagnation and decreasing trends in trade in support materials for cultural content (CDs, DVDs, video games and newspapers) certainly contributed to this decrease. The digital shift in recent years does not equate to a fall in the consumption of these goods, but it is impossible to evaluate it on the basis of trade in goods statistics as product classifications capture tangible goods only. As regards (intra- and extra-EU) exports at country level, the majority of EU Member States (21) saw their cultural exports decrease as a proportion of total exports between 2008 and 2014 (see Figure 3). However, seven countries (Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Luxembourg, Hungary, Poland and the United Kingdom) witnessed an increase in the relative value of their cultural exports \u2014 and also in their absolute value (see Figure 1).

        "4 Culture statistics 104 International trade in cultural goods For the United Kingdom, Latvia and Cyprus, the proportion of cultural exports in 2014 was above the EU average, with the United Kingdom ranking top at 2.1 %. Germany, Greece, Finland, Bulgaria and Ireland stood out as seeing the biggest relative reductions in cultural exports between 2008 and 2014, with the percentages falling by at least half. At EU level, cultural goods made up 0.65 % of total extra-EU imports in 2014, 0.15 percentage points less than in 2008 (see Figure 4). Poland and Croatia were the only EU Member States for which the weight of cultural imports in overall imports (intra-EU and extra-EU) was greater in 2014 than in 2008. Poland was also among the EU Member States that recorded an increase in imports in terms of absolute values (the others were Estonia and Lithuania). At 1.04 %, the United Kingdom was the EU Member State for which cultural imports represented the biggest proportion of overall imports in 2014. The proportion also exceeded the overall EU level (0.65 %) in Denmark, Ireland, France, the Netherlands and Austria. The country for which cultural goods made up the lowest percentage of total imports was Hungary, with 0.14 %.

        "4 Culture statistics 105 International trade in cultural goods Intra- and extra-EU trade In 2014, EU trade in cultural goods was mainly intra-EU EU trade can be analysed from two perspectives: as intra-EU trade (between EU Member States) and extra-EU trade (with non EU countries). The ratio between the two is an indication of the heterogeneity of a country\u2019s trade patterns and, to some extent, reflects its historical ties and geographical location. However, the indicator on intra- and extra-EU trade must be interpreted with caution, in particular for the phenomenon of quasi-transit (with particular relevance for some countries, e.g. the Netherlands). In 2014, 53 % of the Member States\u2019 cultural exports went to other EU countries while 47 % were extra-EU exports (see Figure 5). In the cases of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Slovakia, at least 80 % of cultural exports were traded with EU partners. For France, Luxembourg, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom, however, extra-EU exports exceeded intra-EU exports.

        "4 Culture statistics 106 International trade in cultural goods Similarly, as regards imports of cultural goods, intra-EU trade (55 %) exceeded extra-EU trade (see Figure 6). Extra-EU imports predominated in only two EU Member States: the Netherlands (84 %) (1) and the United Kingdom (79 %). In all the other EU Member States, the proportion of intra-EU cultural imports was over 60 %, ranging from 63 % in Italy to 96 % in Slovakia. All EFTA countries reported that the EU was their most important partner in terms of cultural imports, with shares of over 50 % of total imports In the candidate countries for which 2013 data were available (2), this was the case only in Serbia . (1) The high ranking of the Netherlands is due to the impact of quasi-transit of goods, i.e. the \u2018Rotterdam effect\u2019 affecting Member States with big ports at the EU\u2019s external border (see the \u2018Methodological notes\u2019 section for more details).

        "4 Culture statistics 107 International trade in cultural goods EU trade in cultural goods by product 43 % of extra-EU exports of cultural goods were \u2018works of art\u2019 In 2014, \u2018works of art\u2019 (which include paintings, engravings, designs and sculpture) were the leading category of extra-EU exports of cultural goods (43 %). Together, \u2018works of art\u2019, \u2018books\u2019 and \u2018antiques\u2019 made up close to three quarters of extra-EU cultural exports. On the other hand, \u2018photographic plates and films\u2019, \u2018maps\u2019 and \u2018architectural plans and drawings\u2019 each accounted for less than 1 % (see Table 2). When one looks at trade (intra- and extra-EU) in various categories of cultural goods at country level, it appears that certain EU Member States developed particular specialisations (3). \u2018Works of art\u2019 were the main cultural goods exported from Luxembourg (80 %), the United Kingdom (44 %), France (32 %) and Austria (28 %). \u2018Books\u2019 were the leading category of cultural exports from 16 EU Member States, accounting for over 50 % from Spain, Lithuania, Slovenia, Latvia, Cyprus and Malta (the two latter around 90 %). Poland, Croatia, Finland and Estonia exported mostly \u2018newspapers and periodicals\u2019. Italy had the highest proportion of cultural exports in the category of \u2018knitted or crocheted fabrics, embroidery and tapestries\u2019. Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden recorded the highest proportions of \u2018films, video games and consoles\u2019, with the Netherlands ranking top at 64 % (see Methodological notes). As for other minor groups of products, the United Kingdom was the EU\u2019s most specialised country in the export of \u2018antiques\u2019 (12 %). \u2018Musical instruments\u2019 accounted for most in Romania (14 %). Ireland recorded the highest percentage of \u2018photographic plates and films\u2019 (2 %). Greece observed the highest share (6 %) for the export of \u2018maps\u2019, while Finland ranked top in the category of \u2018architectural plans and drawings\u2019 (4 %). More even distribution of extra-EU imports by product The main categories of EU imports of cultural products from non-EU countries were \u2018films, video games and consoles\u2019 (31 %), \u2018works of art\u2019 (24 %) and \u2018books\u2019 (16 %). These three categories made up 70 % of the total extra-EU imports (see Table 3). In general, Member States\u2019 (intra- and extra-EU) import patterns tended to follow their export patterns. The Netherlands, for instance, was the EU Member State with the highest percentage of imports in the field of \u2018films, video games and consoles\u2019 (69 %), mirroring its export figures (see footnote 1). Patterns in the import and export of \u2018books\u2019 were also similar: this category represented the biggest proportion of cultural imports for 13 EU Member States, with Malta again having the largest percentage (50 %). For the United Kingdom (28 %) and France (22 %), \u2018works of art\u2019 was the biggest category; the two countries were also second and third when it came to exporting \u2018works of art\u2019. (3) The exports and imports by EU Member State include all of the world\u2019s countries as trading partners (including the other EU Member States) so the figures by country in Tables 2 and 3 are not the breakdown of the EU aggregates which only relate to extra-EU trade.

Together, the United States and Switzerland accounted for almost 54 % of EU exports to non-EU countries (see Figure 7), mostly in the \u2018works of art\u2019 category. The part of trade with the United States became even more significant between 2008 and 2014 (from 27 % to 33 %), while the percentage for Switzerland remained largely unchanged (at around 21 %). Between 2008 and 2014, the top 10 destinations for EU cultural exports (in which China replaced South Africa) increased their share from close to 75 % to 78 % of the total. The proportion going to Hong Kong rose considerably \u2014 from 2 % in 2008 to 6 % in 2014.

        "4 Culture statistics 112 International trade in cultural goods Methodological notes Eurostat extracts and compiles data on international trade in cultural goods from the Comext database, which contains data on overall international trade in goods of the EU Member States, EFTA countries and candidate countries. Among the most commonly used classifications in Comext are the Harmonized System (HS) and the Combined Nomenclature (CN). For the purpose of the analysis of the international trade in cultural goods, the list of cultural goods was established based on the HS and CN classifications. In the selection process, ten cultural domains were analysed from a product perspective and numerous HS and CN codes at the lowest level of disaggregation were dissected according to the criterion of \u2018artistic creation\u2019 set out in the ESSnet-Culture final report (2012). As a result, a number of products that convey and encompass symbolic, aesthetic, artistic and spiritual values were identified. However, some products that do not meet the \u2018artistic creation\u2019 criterion were added in the scope because they enable artistic expression or facilitate the access to cultural content (e.g. musical instruments, CDs and DVDs). Equipment in the wider sense (e.g. TV sets, CD players, cameras) was excluded. For the sake of consistency and in order to facilitate the analysis of trends, the cultural goods were aggregated into 11 meaningful groups as shown in the table below: Antiques, collections and collectors' pieces, postage or revenu stamps Heritage CULTURAL DOMAIN CULTURAL GOODS Books and press Visual arts Art craft Performing arts Audiovisual and multimedia Architecture \u2022 Knitted or crocheted fabrics, embroidery in the piece, tapestries \u2022 Musical instruments \u2022 Architecture plans and drawings \u2022 Cinematograph films, video games and consoles Recorded media (CDs, DVDs, gramophone records) \u2022 \u2022 Works of art (paintings, engravings, sculpture, designs etc.) Photographic plates and films developed \u2022 \u2022 Books Newspapers, journals and periodicals Maps and hydrographical and similar charts \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 ",
        "4 Culture statistics 113 International trade in cultural goods The dimensions available in Comext allow for the computation of several indicators on imports and exports of cultural goods: value of total trade, value of intra EU-28 trade, value of extra EU-28 trade and value of trade with individual partners. The data are also expressed in relative terms: as a percentage of a country\u2019s total trade, as a percentage of total EU-28 trade and as a percentage of total trade in cultural goods. The distinction must be made between EU and national figures. The EU figures exclude intra-EU trade. In other words, the EU is deemed to be a single entity and internal exchanges (between Member States) are not counted. However, national figures refer to both intra- and extra-EU trade. The impact of quasi-transit (the \u2018Rotterdam effect\u2019) Quasi-transit is known to impact mostly the Member States with big ports at the external EU border, in particular the Netherlands (hence its impact on figures is known as the \u2018Rotterdam effect\u2019). In line with Community rules and as the country where goods are released for free circulation, the Netherlands records goods arriving in Dutch ports and destined for other EU Member States as extra-EU imports. These same goods are dispatched as intra-EU exports by the Netherlands to those Member States, even though there is no impact on its economy. Quasi- transit is known to impact imports more, but exports are also affected. In exceptional cases, customs clearance occurs not in the Member State of actual export but in the Member State from which the goods leave EU customs territory. A concerned Member State\u2019s trade flows may be overvalued because of \u2018quasi-transit\u2019 trade. The country\u2019s trade balance is not impacted, as the quasi-transit should increase by the same amount as the intra- and extra-EU trade flows (extra-EU imports followed by dispatches to the Member State of actual destination or arrivals from the Member State of actual export followed by extra-EU exports to the country of actual destination).

        "5 Culture statistics 116 Cultural participation Cultural participation is an essential dimension of the European statistical framework for culture as it is a \u2018raison d\u2019\u00eatre\u2019 for the cultural sectors. It contributes to personal well-being and to the integration of individuals in society. Statistics presented in this chapter relate to the involvement of people in cultural activities. They are based on data currently available in Eurostat from the Adult Education Survey (AES) (module on cultural participation) carried out in 2007 and 2011. The population covered by the AES is that aged 25\u201364. In the 2011 AES which was run for the first time under EU legislation, the module on cultural participation was not mandatory and not all EU Member States introduced it in the survey. These statistics will be updated next year with the results of the EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) ad hoc module 2015 on social and cultural participation which was conducted in all Member States. This chapter covers the following cultural activities: \u2022 reading habits (books and newspapers); \u2022 going to the cinema; \u2022 attending live performances (plays, concerts, operas, ballet and dance); and \u2022 visiting cultural sites (historical monuments, museums, art galleries or archaeological sites). Among all breakdown variables used for the analysis of cultural participation \u2014 age, sex, educational attainment \u2014 the latter is the one for which discrepancies across categories are the most visible. For all the cultural activities covered under this analysis, people with tertiary education participate the most, while the participation is often very rare for people with low educational attainment. Reading books As one of the oldest communication tools, and as transmitter of knowledge and ideas, books continue to play an important role in the education and cultural enrichment of European citizens. In 2011, among countries with available data, Luxembourg (82 %) and Germany (75 %) had the highest shares of their population having read at least one book (as a leisure activity) within the previous 12 months (see Table 1). This percentage was also at least 70 % in Estonia, Finland and Austria. Romania, Portugal, Bulgaria and Greece recorded the lowest rates: in 2011 the majority of the population did not read a book in the last 12 months. ",

In six countries, it even exceeded 25 percentage points. If in general, the gap between male and female book readers tended to grow between 2007 and 2011, it was basically due to a bigger reduction in the share of male readers than for their female counterparts.

        "5 Culture statistics 120 Cultural participation Educational attainment (the highest educational level successfully completed) is another variable that strongly influences reading patterns (see Figure 3). In all countries, the percentage of people having read at least one book in the last 12 months increased with the level of educational attainment. The discrepancies between countries concerned the degree to which the percentages differed across the three broad categories (low, medium, high) of educational attainment. In 14 out of 20 Member States, the difference in the share of book readers between people with high and medium educational attainment was greater than between people with medium and low educational attainment. In other words, higher educational attainment had the biggest impact on reading habits. In Romania, this influence was the most significant, in Luxembourg the smallest.

The development of new ICT platforms for news dissemination (online press) was taken into account in the 2011 survey. In 2011, the most avid newspaper readers were in Finland, Luxembourg and Austria, where more than 75 % of the population read newspapers almost every day (see Figures 4 and 5). At the other end of the scale were Greece and Romania, having barely 30 % of daily readers of newspapers.

        "5 Culture statistics 124 Cultural participation Other cultural activities The Adult Education Survey also covers other types of cultural activities like going to the cinema, attending live cultural performances and visiting cultural sites. Participation in live cultural performances concerns only spectating. Live performances (plays, concerts, operas, ballet and dance) refer to any event performed by professionals, amateurs, or even by one\u2019s own children. Cultural sites include historical monuments, museums, art galleries or archaeological sites. Among three cultural activities analysed, attendance at live performances accounted for the highest levels in 12 of the 19 Member States for which data were available in 2011 (see Table 2). Going to the cinema was the leading activity in Italy and Poland, while visiting cultural sites was the most popular in the Czech Republic, Germany, Malta, Austria and Slovenia. When comparing these three types of cultural activity in 2007 and 2011, there was a general tendency towards increased cultural participation. However, this trend was not consistent across all Member States. The Czech Republic, Germany, Poland and Finland recorded increases in all three types of activity. Cyprus and Romania, on the other hand, reported decreases in all three activities over the same period. Going to the cinema, theatre and concerts were the activities for which people showed more and more interest between 2007 and 2011, while visitors to cultural sites became scarcer. Going to the cinema In 2011, Luxembourg (73 %) and the United Kingdom (65 %) were the two Member States that had the highest share of people aged 25\u201364 having been to the cinema at least once in the previous 12 months. In five other Member States \u2014 Finland, Austria, Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic \u2014 over half of the population went to the cinema at least once in the last 12 months. (Spain and Belgium can also be added to this list if we look at data from the 2007 AES.) In comparison, this rate was only 16 % in Romania and 26 % in Bulgaria (see Table 2). From 2007 to 2011, an increase in the share of the population who had gone to the cinema was recorded in 12 of the 17 Member States for which data are available. This increase was particularly noticeable in Lithuania and Estonia (both + 12 percentage points), while Greece reported the steepest drop, going from 49 % in 2007 to 42 % in 2011. Participation in all types of cultural activity was generally highest among the population aged 25\u201334 (see Table 3). This was definitively the case for cinema in all Member States for which data were available. Looking at the breakdown by sex and age, the younger age group\u2019s predominance in cinema attendance is confirmed, regardless of gender (see Table 4). ",

        "5 Culture statistics 132 Cultural participation Once again, the level of education (see Figure 10) was an important factor having an impact on attendance at live performances. As was the case with cinema, higher levels of educational attainment systematically resulted in higher attendance levels. The share of people with high educational attainment attending live performances varied from 61 % in Germany to 87 % in Slovakia. For the population with low education, the share ranged from 4 % in Romania to 71 % in Luxembourg. Indeed, in Luxembourg, the difference in participation rates of people with high and low educational attainment levels was also the smallest (14 percentage points). In other words, differences across countries were largely due to the attendance rate of people with low education. Countries with large differences in participation according to different educational attainment levels (Romania and Hungary with over 64 percentage points) also displayed high percentages of people not attending live performances at all (see Figure 9).

The Czech Republic and Austria followed with 60 %. For Slovenia, Estonia, Germany, Finland, Slovakia and Latvia, more than 50 % of adults visited a cultural site in the year preceding the survey. Romania and Greece were the two Member States with the least visits to cultural sites, with 18 % and 27 % respectively (see Table 2).

Lithuania and Latvia, on the other hand, presented the highest increase (+ 10 and + 9 percentage points respectively). In Luxembourg, Germany, the Czech Republic, Malta and Slovenia, more than one in every ten people visited a cultural site at least seven times in the last 12 months (see Figure 11).

        "5 Culture statistics 134 Cultural participation Table 6 shows the gender distinction among different age groups visiting cultural sites. Just as for cinema and live performances, women appeared to be the keenest visitors to cultural sites in most Member States. However, unlike the other activities, there was less concentration in the youngest age group. Compared with going to the cinema or attending a live performance, visiting cultural sites was the activity that least attracted men and women aged 25\u201334. In most Member States, the group that made the most visits was women aged 25\u201334 (in seven Member States) or 35\u201344 (in six Member States). Luxembourg and Austria were the only countries where the highest rates were recorded in the 55\u201364 age group \u2014 without any major difference between men and women (around 85 % in Luxembourg and 65 % in Austria).

With the exception of Greece, where 49 % of the population with high educational attainment visited cultural sites, the percentage in all other EU Member States was over 57 %, reaching almost 86 % in Luxembourg. Again, countries with large differences between the different educational levels also displayed the highest rates of people not having visited any cultural sites at all.

        "5 Culture statistics 136 Cultural participation Methodological notes Data on cultural participation (reading books and newspapers, attending cultural events and visiting cultural sites) come from a specific module on cultural participation of Adult Education Survey (AES). That survey was conducted in 2007 (on the basis of a gentlemen\u2019s agreement) and in 2011 under EU legislation. But as the specific module on cultural participation was optional in the 2011 AES, there are no 2011 AES data on this topic for Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, France, Croatia, the Netherlands and Sweden (nor for Norway and Switzerland). For the United Kingdom, data are available on \u2018reading newspapers\u2019 and \u2018going to the cinema\u2019. The AES covers adults aged 25\u201364. The data can be presented by age, sex and educational attainment level. Cultural participation was considered by the ESSnet-Culture final report (2012) using the conceptual model of cultural participation (ICET) that distinguishes four forms of participation: \u2022 Information \u2014 to seek, collect and spread information on culture; \u2022 Communication and community \u2014 to interact with others on cultural issues and to participate in cultural networks; \u2022 Enjoyment and expression \u2014 to enjoy exhibitions, art performances and other forms of cultural expression, to practise arts for leisure, and to create online content. \u2022 Transaction \u2014 to buy art and to buy or reserve tickets for shows. Thus, in the light of the ICET model, the following activities refer to cultural participation: reading books and newspapers, going to cinema, theatres and concerts, visiting museums and historical sites but also playing music, painting, dancing or doing other activities with artistic dimension. Practice of artistic activities was not investigated in the AES 2011 but was included as a variable in the EU-SILC 2015 module on social and cultural participation. Data from the latter survey will be available in 2017. \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 ",

        "6 Culture statistics 138 Use of ICT for cultural purposes Information and communication technology (ICT) is gaining importance in the EU as a means of cultural participation. Nowadays, the internet allows people to take part in cultural activities that were previously inconceivable, such as creating, downloading and sharing cultural content, watching films and videos online, streaming live concerts and more. Cultural institutions and other providers of cultural services are adapting their products and services to new technological tools. Eurostat\u2019s statistics on the use of ICT for cultural purposes are gathered from the annual Community survey on ICT usage in households and by individuals and its specific modules carried out at irregular basis. Households with internet access New forms of online cultural participation have been developed thanks in part to the increased number of households with internet access at home, regardless of the type of connection. Between 2010 and 2015, the percentage of EU households with internet access increased by 13 percentage points from 70 % to 83 % (see Figure 1). In 2015, Luxembourg had the highest percentage of households with internet access (97 %), while the lowest rate was recorded in Bulgaria (59 %). Nevertheless, Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Spain, Croatia and Romania all recorded an increase of 20 percentage points or more between 2010 and 2015 resulting in the reduction of the gap with the EU-28 average. The increases were less marked in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Germany and Finland where the percentage of households with internet access was already very high (more than 80 % in 2010). Internet use for cultural purposes Data on ICT usage by individuals cover the following online cultural activities: \u2022 reading online news sites (newspapers or news magazines); \u2022 playing or downloading games, images, films or music; \u2022 listening to web radio. Two activities can be added to this list in the context of culture: \u2022 creating websites or blogs; \u2022 consulting wikis (to obtain knowledge on any subject). According to the latest available data, in 2014: \u2022 67 % of individuals in the EU who used the internet in the last three months read news (newspapers and news magazines) online; \u2022 more than half (51 %) used the internet to play or download games, images, films or music; \u2022 31 % listened to web radio (see Table 1). In addition, 56 % of internet users consulted wiki-based knowledge tools and 11 % created websites or blogs. ",
        "6 Culture statistics 139 Use of ICT for cultural purposes The figures in this chapter only refer to the population using the internet. This eliminates any effect related to the internet penetration rate and focuses on the behaviour patterns and choices of internet users. Consultation of online news Reading online news sites was particularly popular among internet users in the Baltic countries (\u00b9), Sweden, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Greece, Luxembourg and Finland (at least 85 % of internet users). On the other hand, only 46 % of internet users in Ireland and France read news online. Playing and downloading games, images, films or music At least 65 % of internet users in Belgium, the Netherlands and Finland said they had played or downloaded games, images, films or music in the last three months. This contrasts with Croatia and Slovakia where the figure was less than 40 %. Listening to web radio In Greece, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Sweden at least 4 in 10 internet users listened to web radio (compared with 3 in 10 at EU level). In contrast, web radio was less popular in Ireland, Croatia and Slovakia with only 23 % of internet users. Creating websites or blogs In the majority of Member States internet is used rarely for creation of websites or blogs \u2014 by fewer than 10 % of internet users. However in Finland and in the United Kingdom such activities are more popular \u2014 they are reported by one third of internet users, and in Estonia and the Netherlands by around a fifth. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 E U - 2 8 L u x e m b o u r g N e t h e r l a n d s D e n m a r k S w e d e n U n i t e d K i n g d o m G e r m a n y F i n l a n d E s t o n i a I r e l a n d F r a n c e B e l g i u m M a l t a A u s t r i a C z e c h R e p u b l i c S p a i n S l o v a k i a S l o v e n i a C r o a t i a L a t v i a H u n g a r y P o l a n d I t a l y C y p r u s P o r t u g a l G r e e c e L i t h u a n i a R o m a n i a B u l g a r i a N o r w a y I c e l a n d ( 1 ) T u r k e y F Y R o f M a c e d o n i a 2010 2015 Figure 1: Households with access to the internet, 2010 and 2015 (% of all households) ( 1 ) 2015 data not available, 2014 used.

In the Czech Republic, Luxembourg and the Netherlands almost 90 % of internet users aged 16\u201324 played or downloaded games, films or music. In Finland this figure was as high as 95 %.

Among young people, these rates were highest in Greece and Slovenia (62 % and 57 % respectively) and among the oldest age group in Greece and Sweden (38 % in both countries). It should be noted that listening to web radio may include listening to news, music or other programmes. Internet use by sex Men more captivated than women by entertainment activities via internet There is little difference between the shares of men and women that use the internet for cultural purposes. There was a 6 percentage points gap in favour of men at EU level for all three types of internet activity in 2014 (see Figure 3). The situation was more nuanced at Member State level. The gender gap appeared to be quite significant for playing or downloading games, images, films or music, with several countries registering two-digit differences. The gender discrepancy was particularly high among internet users playing or downloading games, images, films or music in Greece and Lithuania (17 percentage points in both countries) (see Table 2). The figures on listening to web radio were less contrasted. However, in a few Member States the differences between the share of men and women listening to web radio reached two-digit numbers (Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Luxembourg, Malta, Austria and Sweden).

There is a strong correlation between educational attainment and cultural participation via the internet for reading newspapers and listening to the web radio. In particular, 79 % of European internet users with tertiary education used the internet to read newspapers and magazines (with many countries reporting levels above 90 %). This contrasts with just 54 % among people with low educational attainment at EU level. In Ireland, France and the United Kingdom this latter figure was even below 40 %. The trend was similar among web radio listeners. The share of internet users with tertiary education who listened to web radio was found to be higher than among users with lower educational attainment in all countries except Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia.

Some 44 % of people using a handheld device to access the internet used it to play or download games, images, video or music, and 13 % used it to read or download books or e-books. Luxembourg, Finland and Sweden had the highest shares of people using a handheld device to read newspapers or news magazines and to play or download games, images, video or music. Reading online books and e-books was particularly popular in Hungary and Romania, with percentages of at least 25 % of users of the internet via handheld devices.

        "6 Culture statistics 148 Use of ICT for cultural purposes Cloud storing or sharing cultural content Services based on cloud computing technology allow users to store files or use software on a server run over the internet. Cloud services are a relatively new phenomenon compared with other web applications for social networking, listening to music or watching films. The results of the ICT 2014 survey module on cloud computing provide information on the use of cloud services for storing and/or sharing cultural content. In 2014, more than a quarter (28 %) of internet users in the EU used cloud services to save or share different files, be it documents, pictures, music, video or other files (see Table 6). Photos were the most stored \u2014 by 82 % of users of cloud services. Music was the second most popular with 36 %, followed by videos (including films and TV programmes) with 26 % and e-books or e-magazines with 13 %. The use of cloud services was quite widespread in Denmark and the United Kingdom with 46 % and 42 % of internet users reporting such activities. The lowest usage of cloud services was in Romania, Poland and Lithuania (15 % or less of internet users). Use of the internet to purchase cultural goods and services Another way to monitor cultural participation is to analyse data on the use of the internet to purchase the following cultural goods and services: \u2022 films/music; \u2022 books/magazines/e-learning material; \u2022 tickets for cultural and sporting events. The data presented below show the proportion of e-shoppers of cultural goods and services among internet users. The reference period covers the twelve months prior to the survey, so takes into account seasonal fluctuations in e-commerce. Online shopping for cultural goods and services, except films and music, has gained a bit more popularity in recent years (see Table 7). At EU level, the number of people purchasing books online is stable (22 % of internet users in 2010 and 23 % in 2015). At country level, the number of e-shoppers buying books or magazines increased at a moderate pace also, with the highest increase found in Estonia (+ 16 percentage points). The largest decreases were observed in Denmark and Slovenia (\u2013 5 percentage points each). At EU level the share of people buying films and music decreased by 2 percentage points \u2014 from 18 % in 2010 to 16 % in 2015. This slight fall may be linked to the increase of other types of offer for this type of content, the emergence of streaming platforms and subscription music or film services. From a Member State perspective, the number of e-shoppers for films and music fell in 13 EU countries but rose slightly or remained stable in the other 15. ",

The increase was greatest in Estonia (+ 26 percentage points) and Sweden (+ 20 percentage points). Variations by country The percentage of e-shoppers for cultural goods and services varied considerably between EU Member States. In 2015, the number of e-shoppers for the three categories of cultural goods and services was consistently above the EU average in Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The lowest percentages of e-shoppers for the three cultural categories were found in Bulgaria, Greece, Cyprus and Romania. These differences may be due to a preference to shop in person or a lack of trust in the quality of goods or in the security of online payments. The availability of cultural goods online \u2014 the variety of the offer and attractive prices \u2014 also plays an important role in purchasing choices. Variations by sex and age From a gender and age perspective, both men and women internet users aged 25\u201354 are more likely to make online purchases in the three categories of cultural products and services than the youngest and oldest age groups. Table 8 shows that in 2015, EU internet users in the oldest age group (55\u201374) were less active in shopping for cultural items online.

Internet users in the 25\u201354 age bracket used e-commerce most frequently to purchase tickets for events and books, magazines and e-learning material. Some gender differences can be observed in online buying patterns. Male internet users bought more films and music in all age groups, while female internet users (except for the 55\u201374 age group) were more inclined to buy books. Young female internet users (16\u201324) bought more online tickets for events and books, magazines and e-learning material than men in the same age group. In the older age groups, higher rates of e-shoppers were observed among men for the three types of online products and services except books, magazines and e-learning material for the 25\u201354 age group. Variations by educational attainment level Internet users with tertiary educational attainment are more likely to shop online for cultural items (see Table 9). There was a 14 percentage points difference in the purchase of films and music in 2015 between internet users with low and tertiary educational attainment. For the other two categories (purchase of books and purchase of tickets for events) this difference was 26 percentage points.

        "6 Culture statistics 153 Use of ICT for cultural purposes Methodological notes Eurostat\u2019s statistics on the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for cultural purposes are gathered from the annual Community survey on ICT usage in households and by individuals and its specific modules carried out at irregular intervals. The data are collected by the national statistical institutes with the help of Eurostat\u2019s annual model questionnaires. The aim of the ICT survey is to provide the relevant statistics on the information society: access to and use of ICTs, purposes of use of internet, ICT security and trust, ICT competence and skills, etc. The population of surveyed households consists of all households having at least one member in the 16\u201374 age group. The population of individuals consists of all individuals aged 16\u201374. Different breakdowns by socio-demographic variables are available: sex, age, educational attainment level, working status etc. The figures on the ICT use presented here refer to the population using the internet. This eliminates any effect related to the internet penetration rate which enables to focus on the behaviour patterns and choices of internet users. The identification of cultural items in the variables of the ICT surveys was based on the methodology of cultural participation as exposed in the ESSnet-Culture final report (2012). Regarding the usage of ICT by individuals, the following online cultural activities have been identified for which the data are available on annual basis: \u2022 reading online news sites (newspapers or news magazines); \u2022 playing or downloading games, images, films or music; \u2022 listening to web radio; \u2022 creating websites or blogs; \u2022 consulting wikis (to obtain knowledge on any subject).

        "7 Private culture expenditure Culture statistics 156 Data on private expenditure are collected by the Household Budget Surveys (HBSs), with a sufficient level of detail to select cultural items. In addition, harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICPs) supply information on the evolution of prices of several cultural goods and services. These two types of data give an understanding of private consumption expenditure on culture and thus of cultural participation and \u2014 to some extent \u2014 access to culture. Household cultural expenditure 3.6 % of mean consumption expenditure by EU households in 2010 was devoted to cultural goods and services According to the latest available HBS data (data for 2015 are being processed and are not yet ready for publication), an estimated 3.6 % of EU private households\u2019 mean consumption expenditure in 2010 was on cultural goods and services (see Figure 1). The proportion varied considerably across Member States: Denmark ranked top with 5.6 % and the lowest proportion was observed in Bulgaria (1.7 %). For 11 Member States, the figure was above the EU average. In Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom, it exceeded 5 %, while in Greece and Bulgaria it did not reach 2 % of total household consumption expenditure. Several factors may lie behind this variability, income and price levels being among the most significant. Another important factor is what Figure 1: Mean household cultural expenditure as a share of total household expenditure, 2010 (\u00b9) (%) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 E U - 2 8 ( 2 ) D e n m a r k S w e d e n ( 3 ) U n i t e d K i n g d o m I r e l a n d A u s t r i a C z e c h R e p u b l i c P o l a n d F i n l a n d G e r m a n y ( 3 ) M a l t a B e l g i u m E s t o n i a F r a n c e S l o v e n i a H u n g a r y L a t v i a P o r t u g a l S l o v a k i a C r o a t i a S p a i n I t a l y ( 3 ) C y p r u s L u x e m b o u r g L i t h u a n i a R o m a n i a G r e e c e B u l g a r i a M o n t e n e g r o T u r k e y F Y R o f M a c e d o n i a (1) The Netherlands: data not available.

        "7 Private culture expenditure Culture statistics 157 culture is on offer; this depends on infrastructure (e.g. the number of cinemas or theatres) and is influenced by national specificities in terms of cultural habits (e.g. how often people go to the theatre). In terms of expenditure in PPS value, Denmark, Ireland and Austria ranked first in 2010, spending over 1 500 PPS per household on cultural goods and services. At the other end of the scale, with expenditure of 400 PPS or less, are Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. At the same time, these countries recorded the lowest levels of total household consumption, which was accompanied by higher than EU average price indices for several cultural goods and services in 2010 compared with 2005 (see Tables 1 and 2). Figure 2 shows mean household cultural expenditure analysed by income quintile. In all countries the impact of income on cultural expenditure is clear \u2014 higher income, more spending on culture. However, the dispersion of cultural expenditure according to income quintile presents different patterns among Member States. In several countries (Cyprus, Portugal, Estonia, Greece, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Poland), the cultural spending of households in the 5 th quintile of income was at least five times higher than that of households in the 1 st quintile group. In contrast, in Luxembourg and Sweden this ratio was around two to one. The widest discrepancy in cultural expenditure is observed between households in the 4 th and 5 th quintile income groups. This phenomenon is most visible in Greece and Portugal. Figure 2: Mean household cultural expenditure by income quintile, 2010 (\u00b9) (PPS) (1) The Netherlands: data not available.

        "7 Private culture expenditure Culture statistics 165 Figure 6 shows six cultural items for which HICPs are available at EU level from 2005 to 2015 (1). Two main trends can be observed over the decade: \u2022 on the one hand, prices fell for IT equipment, equipment for the reception, recording and reproduction of sound and vision (TV sets, radios, CD players, etc . ) and recording media (including CDs and DVDs) . The decrease in prices of these goods certainly resulted in better and better equipment in households; \u2022 on the other hand, a significant price increase was observed for newspapers and periodicals and a moderate increase for books and cultural services (2). The index for newspapers and periodicals reached in 2015 a level much above total inflation while for the two remaining categories the index appeared to be in line with the overall HICP growth pattern. In both cases, the increase or decrease was a steady trend, with few fluctuations from year to year. Prices for newspapers and periodicals showed the highest growth (+ 40 %) and those for equipment the largest decrease (\u2013 60 %). A more detailed analysis of 2005\u201315 HICPs by country and cultural item serves to highlight differences within the EU (see Table 2) and shows that the HICP for newspapers and periodicals rose in all Member States. In the case of Romania, the index for newspapers and periodicals more than doubled while the smallest rises (10 % and 17 % respectively) were recorded in Greece and Croatia. At EU level, price indices for cinema, museums, television fees and other services grew steadily and followed closely the trend of all consumption items (see Figure 6). The rise of prices for those items was also noted at the level of individual countries with the highest increases recorded in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (see Table 2). Only Malta registered the opposite trend. As regards books, the HICP changes varied from \u2013 7 % in the Netherlands (the only Member State registering a decrease) to + 68 % in Estonia. In a number of Member States (Bulgaria, Denmark, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and the United Kingdom) the increases were significantly higher than the EU average. In contrast, only small rises (up to 7 %) were recorded in Germany, Greece, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, Austria and Slovenia. Unlike newspapers, books and cultural services, the indices for equipment and also for recording media, like CDs or DVDs, fell in the majority of countries. The prices of these articles fell by nearly half in 2015 compared with 2005 in Ireland and Slovenia, but did not change in Estonia and Luxembourg. Regarding \u2018equipment for the reception, recording and reproduction of sound and picture\u2019, the drop in prices was substantial in all Member States. The HICPs in this category (which includes TV sets, for example) fell most steeply in Sweden (to a fifth of the 2005 level). Most other Member States saw drops of at least 30 %, however in Romania this index fell only slightly, by 5 %. The category that registered the sharpest HICP decrease was \u2018information processing equipment\u2019, for which the price indices decreased in all Member States, with the lowest values in 2015 compared to 2005 registered in Ireland (\u2013 86 %) and the highest in Slovenia and Romania (\u2013 22 % and \u2013 26 %).

        "7 Private culture expenditure Culture statistics 167 Methodological notes Mean household expenditure on cultural goods and services Household expenditure data on cultural goods are extracted and then compiled from the Household Budget Surveys (HBSs). The HBS statistics enable to measure households\u2019 expenditure on articles and services such as food, clothing, housing, transport, education, etc. It is also possible to distinguish expenditure items relating to culture. The classification designed for household expenditure purposes and used in the HBS is the Classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP). The culture-related goods in COICOP are goods such as books or newspapers. In addition, some articles enabling the artistic creation are counted, e.g. musical instruments, photo and video cameras, and drawing materials. Another group of cultural goods covered is equipment (such as IT equipment, TV sets, radios and CD players) which allows the reception of cultural content and facilitates access to it. Among cultural services the following items are considered: tickets for cinemas, theatres, concerts, museums or libraries or television and radio fees. Household final expenditure on cultural goods and services is measured in purchasing power standard (PPS) in order to eliminate differences in purchasing power across countries. Within the COICOP classification 14 items were identified in the ESSnet-Culture final report (2012) as relating to culture: Books Newspapers and periodicals Books and newspapers BROAD GROUPS CULTURAL GOODS AND SERVICES Articles for artistic expression and creation Equipment Going out and entertainment Fees and subscriptions \u2022 \u2022 Cinemas, theatres, concerts Museums, libraries, zoological gardens Services of photographers and performing artists \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Television and radio fees, hire of equipment and accessories for culture \u2022 Information processing equipment Reception, recording and reproduction of sound and vision Recording media Reception, recording and reproduction of sound Repair of audio-visual, photographic and information processing equipment \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Musical instruments Photographic and cinematographic equipment Stationery and drawing materials \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 ",

The version of NACE presently used in European statistical system is NACE Rev.2 implemented from 2008 in relevant statistical domains. The comparability at world level of statistics produced on the basis of NACE is due to the fact that NACE is part of an integrated system of statistical classifications, developed mainly under the auspices of the United Nations Statistical Division. NACE is derived from ISIC (the United Nations\u2019 International standard industrial classification of all economic activities), in the sense that it is more detailed than ISIC. ISIC and NACE have exactly the same items at the highest levels, where NACE is more detailed at lower levels. The International standard classification of occupations, abbreviated as ISCO, is an international classification under the responsibility of the International Labour Organization (ILO). ISCO is organising jobs into a clearly defined set of groups according to the tasks and duties undertaken in the job. The last version of ISCO is ISCO-08, adopted in 2007 and implemented in all EU sources starting from 2011. The International standard classification of education, abbreviated as ISCED, is the reference international classification for organising education programmes and related qualifications by levels and fields. The ISCED classification was developed by UNESCO in the mid-1970s and was first revised in 1997. ISCED 2011 revision (levels of education) takes into account the changes in education systems mainly relating to the Bologna process in tertiary education, but also to the expansion of education programmes for very young children. Additionally, for the first time, ISCED 2011 is clearly not only a classification of levels of education programmes (ISCED-P) but also a classification of educational attainment (ISCED-A) in terms of qualifications resulting from formal education programmes. With ISCED 2011 education programmes/qualifications can be coded up to 3-digit-level. ISCED-F 2013 \u2014 ISCED Fields of Education and Training 2013 \u2014 is a classification of fields of education, which accompanies ISCED 2011. The \u2018Harmonized commodity description and coding system\u2019 is a multi-purpose international product nomenclature developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO) for the purposes of international trade. It is often simply called Harmonized System and abbreviated as HS. The HS 2007 is made up of about 5 000 commodity groups defined at a six-digit level. The Combined nomenclature, abbreviated as CN, is a classification of goods at 8-digit level and provides the means of collecting, exchanging and publishing data on EU international trade statistics. First six digit codes of CN coincide with the Harmonized System (HS). The CN is made up of a total of more than 10 000 eight-digit headings. ",
        "Annexes Culture statistics 171 The Classification of individual consumption by purpose, abbreviated as COICOP, is a nomenclature developed by the United Nations Statistics Division to classify and analyse individual consumption expenditures incurred by households, non-profit institutions serving households and general government according to their purpose. It includes categories such as food, clothing, housing, water, electricity, etc. The European version of this classification \u2014 ECOICOP \u2014 is extended to 5-digit to better respond to the needs of the HBS and HICP that are using it. Definitions The educational attainment level (highest level of education successfully completed) of an individual is the highest ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education) level successfully completed, the successful completion of an education programme being validated by a recognised qualification, i.e. a qualification officially recognised by the relevant national education authorities. In cases where there is no certification, successful completion must be associated with full attendance. Three aggregated categories of educational attainment are usually used: \u2022 Low: completion of pre-primary, primary and lower secondary education (ISCED 2011 levels 0 to 2); \u2022 Medium: completion of upper secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary education (ISCED 2011 levels 3 and 4); \u2022 High: completion of tertiary education (ISCED 2011 levels 5 to 8). The annual average growth rate , abbreviated as AAGR and more accurately known as the compound annual growth rate, shows an average value for the annual rate of change over a period of time (typically several years) allowing for the compound effect of growth. This rate facilitates comparisons of rates of change for periods of different lengths, for example, comparing annual, five-yearly and ten-yearly rates of change. This rate is calculated by taking the n th root of the rate of change (as a percentage) between the value at the beginning and end of the period, where n is the number of years of the period considered. The AAGR is the constant growth rate needed to obtain the final value from the initial value in n periods. The formula for its calculation is shown in the equation: Purchasing power parities (PPPs) can be considered as currency conversion rates (similar to exchange rates) that convert expenditures expressed in national currencies into an artificial common currency, the purchasing power standard (PPS) . PPPs are indicators of price level differences across countries: they indicate how many currency units a given quantity of goods and services will cost in different countries; the conversion of expenditure using PPPs therefore eliminates price level differences across countries. The use of PPPs ensures that the indicator is valued at a uniform price level and thus reflects only volume differences in the economy, as opposed to price level differences. When PPPs are applied to economic expenditure aggregates, the resulting figures are expressed in PPS. AAGR = 1 n f inal value initial value ",
        "Annexes Culture statistics 172 Sources and methodology Chapter 1 \u2014 Context Economic and social data Gross domestic product , abbreviated as GDP , is a basic measure of a country\u2019s overall economic health. GDP is one of the key economic aggregates. GDP is a measure of the total economic activity taking place on an economic territory which leads to output meeting the final demands of the economy. GDP per capita removes the influence of the absolute size of the population, making comparisons between different countries easier. GDP per capita is a broad economic indicator of living standards. GDP data in national currencies can be converted into purchasing power standards (PPS) using purchasing power parities (PPPs) that reflect the purchasing power of each currency, rather than using market exchange rates; in this way differences in price levels between countries are eliminated. The at-risk-of-poverty rate is the share of people with an equivalised disposable income (after social transfer) below the at-risk-of- poverty threshold , which is set at 60 % of the national median equivalised disposable income after social transfers. This indicator does not measure wealth or poverty, but low income in comparison to other residents in that country, which does not necessarily imply a low standard of living. The equivalised disposable income is the total income of a household, after tax and other deductions that is available for spending or saving, divided by the number of household members. Degree of urbanisation : three types of areas are defined based on population density: \u2022 cities: at least 50 % of the population lives in urban centres; \u2022 towns and suburbs: at least 50 % of the population lives in urban clusters and less than 50 % of the population lives in urban centres; \u2022 rural areas: at least 50 % of the population lives in rural grid cells. The population figure, or total population or simply population, of a given area is the total number of people in that area at a given time. For the population figures compiled by Eurostat from the data provided by European Union (EU) Member States, that time is 1 January and the resulting figure is called population on 1 January. The recommended definition is the usual resident population, representing the number of inhabitants of a given area on 1 January of the year in question (or, in some cases, on 31 December of the previous year). Foreign population or foreigners refer to persons who are not citizens of the country in which they reside, including persons of unknown citizenship and stateless persons. The labour force or workforce or economically active population , also shortened to active population, includes both employed (employees and self-employed) and unemployed people, but not the economically inactive, such as students and pensioners. Inactive persons are those classified neither as employed nor as unemployed. ",
        "Annexes Culture statistics 173 Employed persons are persons aged 15 and over who performed work, even for just one hour per week, for pay, profit or family gain during the reference week or were not at work but had a job or business from which they were temporarily absent because of, for instance, illness, holidays, industrial dispute, and education or training. This definition is applicable to employees, self-employed persons and family workers. Employment/activity rates represent employed/active persons as a percentage of same age total population. Unemployed persons are persons aged 15\u201374 who were without work during the reference week, were currently available for work and were either actively seeking work in the past four weeks or had already found a job to start within the next three months. The unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labour force. Long-term unemployment consists of unemployed persons who are looking for a job for one year or more. Life satisfaction represents how a respondent evaluates or appraises his or her life taken as a whole. It is intended to cover a broad, reflective appraisal the person makes of his or her life. The term \u2018life\u2019 is intended here as all areas of a person\u2019s existence. The variable therefore refers to the respondent\u2019s opinion/feeling about the degree of satisfaction with his/her life. General life satisfaction refers to the individual\u2019s evaluation of all subjectively relevant life domains and is therefore considered as an overall measure for subjective well-being . In social statistics, income quintile groups are computed on the basis of the total equivalised disposable income attributed to each member of the household. The data (of each person) are ordered according to the value of the total equivalised disposable income. Four cut-point values of income are identified, dividing the survey population into five groups equally represented by 20 % of individuals each. The first quintile group represents 20 % of the population with the lowest income (an income smaller or equal to the first cut-off value), and the fifth quintile group represents the 20 % of population with the highest income (an income greater than the fourth cut-off value). A household includes either one person living alone or a group of people, not necessarily related, living at the same address with common housekeeping, i.e. sharing at least one meal per day or sharing a living or sitting room. Cultural heritage Heritage defines all the goods received or gathered and safeguarded by earlier generations that will be transmitted to their descendants; all objects or groups of objects, material or intangible, that are collectively recognised or appropriated for their value as evidence and historical memory and which merit being protected, preserved, and enhanced. The following are considered as material cultural heritage according to the UNESCO Convention on World Cultural Heritage: \u2022 monuments: architectural works, works of monumental sculpture and painting, elements or structures of an archaeological nature, inscriptions, cave dwellings and combinations of features; \u2022 groups of buildings: groups of separate or connected buildings; and \u2022 sites: works of man or the combined works of nature and man, and areas including archaeological sites. ",
        "Annexes Culture statistics 174 The intangible cultural heritage means the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills \u2014 as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith \u2014 that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. A museum according to International Council of Museum Statutes (ICOM) is a non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment. Education Foreign languages learnt in formal education: All modern languages that are taught as \u2018foreign languages\u2019. Ancient Greek, Latin, Esperanto and sign languages are not included. Only foreign languages studied as compulsory subjects or as compulsory curriculum options are included. The study of languages when the subject is offered in addition to the minimum curriculum is not included. Also data on non-nationals studying their native language in special classes or those studying the language of the host country are excluded. Learning mobility in tertiary education has been defined as the physical crossing of national borders between a country of origin and a country of destination and subsequent participation in activities relevant to tertiary education (in the country of destination). Degree mobile students are enrolled as regular students in any semester/term of a degree programme taught in the country of destination, which is different from their country of origin (defined, in principle, as the country of prior education, although for the time being most countries use alternative criteria such as country of residence or citizenship) with the intention of graduating from the programme in the country of destination. Erasmus (2007\u201313) is the world\u2019s most successful student mobility programme. Since it began in 1987\u201388, the Erasmus programme has provided over three million European students with the opportunity to go abroad and study at a higher education institution or train in a company. Erasmus Student Mobility for Studies, which was the most common action of the Erasmus 2007\u201313, enabled students to spend a study period of 3 to 12 months abroad. Besides creating for students the opportunity of studying in another country, it contributed to promote cooperation between institutions and helped to enrich their educational environment. Erasmus+ (2014\u201320) is the EU\u2019s programme to support education, training, youth and sport in Europe. Erasmus+ is built on the achievements and objectives of the previous Erasmus project but it offers much more opportunities for studies, training and youth work abroad through more developed system of funding and loans. Moreover, it embraces a new dimension which is sport by creating new funding opportunities for sport actions and activities. ",
        "Annexes Culture statistics 175 Chapter 2 \u2014 Cultural employment The EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS) is the largest European household sample survey, providing quarterly and annual data on labour participation of people aged 15 and over and on persons outside the labour force. It covers residents in private households (excluding conscripts) according to labour status: \u2022 employment \u2022 unemployment \u2022 inactivity EU-LFS is the main source of information about the situation and trends on the labour market in the European Union. The frequency of the data is monthly (only for unemployment), quarterly and annual. The EU-LFS currently covers 33 participating countries, providing Eurostat with data from national labour force surveys: the 28 Member States of the European Union, three EFTA countries (Iceland, Norway and Switzerland), and two EU candidate countries, i.e. the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey. An occupation is defined as a set of jobs whose main tasks and duties are characterised by a high degree of similarity. The LFS defines an employee as an individual who works for a public or private employer and who in return receives compensation in the form of wages, salaries, fees, gratuities, payment by results or payment in kind. Professional military staff is also included. Self-employed persons are the ones who work in their own business, farm or professional practice. A self-employed person is considered to be working if she/he meets one of the following criteria: works for the purpose of earning profit, spends time on the operation of a business or is in the process of setting up his/her business. Part-time workers (vs full-time workers) are employed persons not working full time. The distinction between full-time and part-time work is generally based on a spontaneous response by the respondent. The main exceptions are the Netherlands and Iceland where a 35 hours threshold is applied, Sweden where a threshold is applied to the self-employed, and Norway where persons working between 32 and 36 hours are asked whether this is a full- or part- time position. Temporary contracts (vs fixed-term contracts): Employees with a limited duration job/contract are employees whose main job will terminate either after a period fixed in advance, or after a period not known in advance, but nevertheless defined by objective criteria, such as the completion of an assignment or the period of absence of an employee temporarily replaced. The concept of fixed-term contract is only applicable to employees, not to self-employed. In most of the EU Member States, a majority of jobs are based on written labour contracts. In some countries, however, contracts of this type are settled only in specific cases e.g. for public- sector jobs, apprentices or other trainees within an enterprise. ",
        "Annexes Culture statistics 176 Chapter 3 \u2014 Cultural enterprises Structural business statistics (SBS) aim at describing the structure, conduct and performance of businesses across the EU in industry, construction, distributive trades and services. These statistics can be broken down to a very detailed sectoral level (several hundred economic activities). A subset of the SBS information is also available for European regions, as well as according to the size of enterprises. The main indicators within SBS are generally collected and presented as monetary values, or as counts (for example, numbers of enterprises or persons employed). Generally SBS does not collect information on products. SBS are based upon data for enterprises or parts of enterprises, such as local units which are often used for regional SBS data. Enterprises or other units are classified according to NACE. SBS covers the \u2018business economy\u2019 (NACE Rev. 2 Sections B to N and Division 95) which includes: industry, construction, distributive trades and services. Financial services (NACE Rev. 2 Section K) are generally kept separate because of their specific nature and the limited availability of most types of business statistics in this area. As such, the term \u2018non-financial business economy\u2019 is often used to refer to economic activities covered by NACE Rev. 2 Sections B to J and L to N and Division 95. SBS do not cover agriculture, forestry and fishing, nor public administration and (largely) non-market services such as education and health. SBS may be broken down by NUTS region or by enterprise size-class . The main groups that are often used for analytical purposes and presenting the data include: \u2022 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs): with 1 to 249 persons employed, further divided into: - micro enterprises: with less than 10 persons employed; - small enterprises: with 10 to 49 persons employed; - medium-sized enterprises: with 50 to 249 persons employed. \u2022 large enterprises: with 250 or more persons employed. An enterprise is an organisational unit producing goods or services which has a certain degree of autonomy in decision-making. An enterprise can carry out more than one economic activity and it can be situated at more than one location. A local unit is an enterprise or part thereof (e.g. a workshop, factory, warehouse, office, mine or depot) situated in a geographically identified place. Number of enterprises: a count of the number of enterprises active during at least a part of the reference period. ",
        "Annexes Culture statistics 177 Number of persons employed is defined as the total number of persons who work in the observation unit (inclusive of working proprietors, partners working regularly in the unit and unpaid family workers), as well as persons who work outside the unit who belong to it and are paid by it (e.g. sales representatives, delivery personnel, repair and maintenance teams). It excludes manpower supplied to the unit by other enterprises, persons carrying out repair and maintenance work in the enquiry unit on behalf of other enterprises, as well as those on compulsory military service. Turnover comprises the totals invoiced by the observation unit during the reference period, and this corresponds to market sales of goods or services supplied to third parties; it includes all duties and taxes on the goods or services invoiced by the unit with the exception of the VAT invoiced by the unit to its customer and other similar deductible taxes directly linked to turnover; it also includes all other charges (transport, packaging, etc.) passed on to the customer. Price reductions, rebates and discounts as well as the value of returned packing must be deducted. Value added at factor costs is the gross income from operating activities after adjusting for operating subsidies and indirect taxes. It can be calculated as the total sum of items to be added (+) or subtracted (\u2013): \u2022 turnover (+); \u2022 capitalized production (+); \u2022 other operating income (+); \u2022 increases (+) or decreases (\u2013) of stocks; \u2022 purchases of goods and services (\u2013); \u2022 other taxes on products which are linked to turnover but not deductible (\u2013); \u2022 duties and taxes linked to production (\u2013). The annual Business demography (BD) data collection covers variables which explain the characteristics and demography of the business population. The creation of new enterprises and the closure of unproductive businesses can be seen as an important contributor to business dynamism. The data are drawn from business registers, although some countries improve the availability of data on employment and turnover by integrating other sources. The economic activities covered with business demography indicators are NACE Rev 2 sections B to N, excluding group 64.2 (management activities of holding companies), and voluntarily sections P to S. Thus, activities relating to industry, construction, distributive trades and services are covered, but agriculture, public administration, non-market activities of households, and extra- territorial agencies are not. ",
        "Annexes Culture statistics 178 An active enterprise is an enterprise that had either turnover or employment at any time during the reference period. An enterprise birth occurs when an enterprise (for example a company) starts from scratch and begins operations, amounting to the creation of a combination of production factors with the restriction that no other enterprises are involved in the event. An enterprise birth occurs when new production factors, in particular new jobs, are created. Enterprise births do not include: \u2022 dormant enterprises being reactivated within two years; \u2022 new corporate entities being created from mergers, break-ups, spin-offs/split-offs or the restructuring of enterprises or a set of enterprises; \u2022 the entry into a sub-population resulting only from a change of activity. The enterprise birth rate of a given reference period (usually one calendar year) is the number of births as a percentage of the population of active enterprises. An enterprise death is the termination of an enterprise, amounting to the dissolution of a combination of production factors with this restriction that no other enterprises are involved in the event. Deaths do not include: \u2022 exits from the population of active enterprises due to mergers, take-overs, break-ups or restructuring of a set of enterprises; \u2022 exits from a sub-population resulting only from a change of activity. The enterprise death rate of a given reference period (usually one calendar year) is the number of enterprise deaths as a percentage of the population of active enterprises. Enterprise survival occurs when an enterprise is active and identifiable both before and after a specific (business) demographic event. The enterprise may be changed in some way, e.g. in terms of economic activity, size, ownership or location, but there should be continuity of the enterprise reference number in the statistical business register. Enterprise survival rate of newly-born enterprises in a given reference period is the number of enterprises that were born in year xx-n and survived to year xx as a percentage of all enterprises born in year xx\u2013n.

        "Annexes Culture statistics 179 Chapter 4 \u2014 International trade in cultural goods Comext is the database that contains statistics on international trade in goods for the EU Member States, EFTA countries and candidate countries. Data are collected by the competent national authorities of the Member States and compiled according to a harmonised methodology established by EU regulations before transmission to Eurostat. The periodicity of data provision is monthly. The internationally traded goods are classified according to several product classifications, what allows the comparisons at EU but also at wider international level. Among the most commonly used classifications are the Harmonized System (HS) and the Combined Nomenclature (CN). The Comext data are updated regularly and the CN classification undergoes a regular revision to ensure it is kept up to date in the light of changes in the technology and international trade patterns. Trade in goods of the EU and its Member States includes all goods which add or subtract from the stock of material resources of the reporting Member State by entering ( imports ) or leaving ( exports ) its economic territory including goods for processing. Information on the goods is provided by legal or natural person. Extra-EU trade refers to transactions with all countries outside of the EU : the rest of the world except for the European Union (EU) as it is now, consisting of 28 Member States. Extra-EU trade statistics are collected on the basis of Customs declaration. Intra-EU trade , on the other hand, refers to all transactions occurring within the EU . It can have a different coverage, depending on the perspective taken: the EU as a whole, a Member State, a region or a city, a port or an airport. EU trade statistics are based on the Intrastat system for the intra-EU trade. Imports are goods which enter the statistical territory of the EU from a third country and are placed under the customs procedure for free circulation within the EU (as a general rule goods intended for consumption), inward processing or processing under customs control (goods for working, processing or repair) immediately or after bonded warehousing. In the EU international trade statistics, the term \u2018goods\u2019 means all movable property, i.e. products having a physical and tangible dimension (but also gas and electricity). International trade in licenses and copyrights is therefore not included. The trade balance is the difference between the value of the goods that a country (or another geographic or economic area such as the EU or the euro area) exports and the value of the goods that it imports. If exports exceed imports then the country has a trade surplus and the trade balance is said to be positive. If imports exceed exports, the country or area has a trade deficit and its trade balance is said to be negative. However, the words \u2018positive\u2019 and \u2018negative\u2019 have only a numerical meaning and do not necessarily reflect whether the economy of a country or area is performing well or not. A trade deficit may for instance reflect an increase in domestic demand for goods destined for consumption and/or production. In external trade statistics, it refers to the trade balance of imports (negative, as they have to be paid for) and exports (positive, because they yield revenue), which may result in a trade deficit. Quasi-transit is an operation when goods are imported by non-residents into the reporting economy from outside the EU and subsequently dispatched to another Member State as well as when the goods exported from a Member State to a non-member country are cleared for exports in another Member State.

        "Annexes Culture statistics 180 Chapter 5 \u2014 Cultural participation The Adult Education Survey (AES) covers adults\u2019 participation in education and training (formal, non-formal and informal learning). Statistics based on AES support monitoring the participation in lifelong learning at EU level by providing detailed results on the participation (participation rates, reasons for participating, characteristics of the learning activities, outcomes, etc.) and the non-participation (obstacles to participation). The AES focuses on people aged 25\u201364 living in private households. The reference period for the participation in education and training is the twelve months prior to the interview. Two waves of the survey have been implemented so far (2007 AES and 2011 AES). Both waves of the AES included a specific module on social and cultural participation providing information about the reading patterns of books and newspapers, attending live sport and cultural events and visiting cultural sites. The module was carried out at voluntary basis and did not cover all EU Member States. The information collected in the core questionnaire and in specific module covers several breakdown variables like sex, age or educational attainment level. Chapter 6 \u2014 Use of ICT for cultural purposes Since 2002 the European Commission has established the annual Information Society surveys to benchmark the ICT (Information and Communications Technologies) -driven development in enterprises and by individuals. Eurostat coordinates two surveys to be carried out at national level, one on \u2018ICT usage and e-Commerce in enterprises\u2019 and one on \u2018ICT usage in households and by individuals\u2019. The Community survey on ICT usage in households and by individuals is an annual survey conducted since 2002, collecting data on the use of information and communication technologies (ICT), the internet, e-government and electronic skills in households and by individuals. The population of households consists of all private households having at least one member in the age group 16 to 74 years. The population of individuals consists of all individuals aged 16 to 74. The questions in the model questionnaire are adapted each year to measure the development of the use of ICT. Therefore not all variables have long time series. ",
        "Annexes Culture statistics 181 Chapter 7 \u2014 Private cultural expenditure Household Budget Surveys (HBSs) are national surveys mainly focusing on consumption expenditure. They are conducted in all EU Member States and their primary aim (especially at national level) is to calculate weights for the Consumer Price Index. Essentially, HBSs provide information about household consumption expenditures on goods and services; information on income, possession of consumer durable goods and cars; basic information on housing and many demographic and socio-economic characteristics. HBSs were launched in most EU Member States at the beginning of the 1960s and Eurostat has been collating and publishing these survey data every five years since 1988. The two last collection rounds were 2010 and 2015. The HBS project is voluntary and is run under a Gentlemen\u2019s agreement. The surveys vary between countries in terms of frequency, timing, content or structure. Currently data are collected for all 28 EU Member States as for Montenegro, the former Yugoslav of Republic of Macedonia, Turkey and Norway. The HBS collects information on Consumption Expenditure according to the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) (2003). COICOP\u2013HBS 2003 included the modifications proposed by the COICOP-HBS task force of 2002 and was adapted to the needs of HBS. It was used in the 2005 and 2010 rounds of survey. In 2015 round of HBS, the new, revised COICOP was used. Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices (HICP) give comparable measures of inflation for the countries and country groups for which they are produced. They are economic indicators that measure the change over time of the prices of consumer goods and services acquired by households. HICP are available for all EU Member States, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. The HICPs are currently classified according to the four-digit categories of the COICOP/HICP (Classification of individual consumption by purpose adapted to the needs of HICP). Starting with the release of January 2016 data, HICP data are produced and published using the common index reference period (2015 = 100). ",
