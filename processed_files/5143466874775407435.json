The following will be applied in the implementation of the Programme. Strategic Planning Strategic Planning The implementation of Horizon Europe's programme-level objectives in an integrated manner will be ensured by multiannual Strategic Planning. Such planning will provide the focus on impact for the Programme overall and coherence between its different pillars, as well as synergy with other EU programmes and support to and from other EU policies. The implementation of Horizon Europe shall be steered by an inclusive and transparent strategic planning process of the research and innovation activities funded by the Programme. The Strategic Planning process shall lead to the implementa- tion of Horizon Europe's programme objectives by defining the funding priorities. It will provide focus on impact for the Programme and coherence between its different pillars, as well as synergy with other EU programmes and support to other EU policies. The strategic planning process and the adoption of the strategic R&I plan by means of a delegated act will increase ownership and understanding for the purpose of the Programme by a wider public and will allow the co-legislators, stakeholders and Member States to be fully informed on the envisaged initiatives. The Strategic Planning process will help to develop and implement policy for the relevant areas covered, at Union level as well as complementing policies in the Member States while ensuring that main European policy targets are reflected and supported by Horizon Europe with adequate resources. It will allow simplification of the funding landscape, avoid duplication and overlaps between funding possibilities while leveraging additional private and public funding and promote faster dissemination and uptake of research and innovation results. A systemic, cross-disciplinary, cross-sectoral and cross-policy approach to research and innovation will ensure that societal and economic challenges can be tackled, knowledge is generated and where possible, give rise to new competitive and sustainable businesses and industries, social and techno- logical innovation, fostering competition, stimulating private investments and preserving the level playing field in the internal market. 13.11.2020 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 388/477 Wednesday 12 December 2018 ",
        "Text proposed by the Commission Amendment The Strategic Planning will promote strong engagement with citizens and civil society organisations at all stages of research and innovation, the co-creation of knowledge, effective promo- tion of gender equality, including the integration of the gender dimension in research and innovation content , and will ensure and promote the adherence to the highest ethics and integrity standards. The Strategic Planning process will promote strong engagement with citizens and civil society organisations in research and innovation, the co-creation of knowledge, effective promotion of gender equality, including the integration of the gender dimension in research and innovation, and will promote the adherence to the highest ethics and integrity standards. It will include extensive consultations and exchanges with Member States, the European Parliament as appropriate, and with various stakeholders about priorities, including missions, under the \u2018Global Challenges and Industrial Competitiveness\u2019 pillar, and the suitable types of action to use , in particular European partnerships. In order to respond to those objectives, the Commission will launch an open consultation phase with Member States, the European Parliament , and a variety of stakeholders , including the scientific community, research and technology organisa- tions, industry, civil society organisations, among others. The consultation will cover the Programme\u2019s strategic priorities including missions under the Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness pillar, and the suitable types of instruments , in particular the European partnerships. Results of the consultation will be published on a dedicated web page, which should also provide the details on the content and process defining the Strategic Planning. As regards European partnerships, the Strategic R&I Plan will outline and give the rationale for the creation, merge and phasing out of the European partnerships. The positively reviewed Joint Technology Initiatives and Contractual Public Private Partnerships, should be considered for continuation beyond 2020 due to their added-value in delivering social and economic impact as well as leveraging private investment and their contribution to synergies of funds. On-going and potential new KICs will be defined in the legislative proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and the Council on the EIT Strategic Innovation Agenda, in line with the Strategic R&I Plan. Nevertheless, the creation of any new KIC should be subject to adequate funding, allowing the existing KICs to develop the ecosystems, build partnerships and pursue and implement efficiently their ambitious objec- tives. \u2018FET Flagships\u2019 supported under Horizon 2020 will continue to be supported under the Programme. As they present substantial analogies with missions, other \u2018FET flagships\u2019, may be supported under this Framework Programme as missions geared towards future and emerging technologies. The missions should strengthen the collaborative aspects of the Programme and complement existing European partnerships, which could work as supporting implementation pillars of the missions. The missions will have technological and societal elements and will also be defined in close cooperation with all relevant DGs. The Strategic Planning process will define the missions according to Article 7 of the Regulation and Article 5 of this Decision. C 388/478 EN Official Journal of the European Union 13.11.2020 Wednesday 12 December 2018 ",
        "Text proposed by the Commission Amendment Based on such extensive consultations, the Strategic Planning will identify common objectives and common areas for activities such as partnership areas (the proposed legal basis sets out only the instruments and criteria that will guide their use) and mission areas. The Strategic Planning will help to develop and realise the implementation of policy for the relevant areas covered, at EU level as well as complementing policy and policy approaches in the Member States. EU policy priorities will be taken into consideration during the Strategic Planning process to increase the contribution of research and innovation to the realisation of policy. It will also take into account foresight activities, studies and other scientific evidence and take account of relevant existing initiatives at EU and national level. The Strategic Planning will promote synergies between Horizon Europe and other Union Programmes, including the Euratom programme, thus becoming a point of reference for research and innovation in all related programmes across the EU budget and non-funding instruments. This will also promote faster dissemination and uptake of research and innovation results and avoid duplication and overlaps between funding possibi- lities. It will provide the frame for linking the direct research actions of the Joint Research Centre and other actions supported under the Programme, including the use of results for support to policy. The Strategic Planning process will identify existing links between Horizon Europe and other Union Programmes, and offer possibilities for synergies between EU, regional and national funds. Horizon Europe will become a point of reference for research and innovation in all related programmes across the EU budget in order to help deliver the EU\u2019s political priorities and objectives. It will also provide the frame for linking the direct research actions of the Joint Research Centre and other actions supported under the Programme, including the use of results to support policy. A Strategic Plan will lay out a multiannual strategy for realising content in the work programme (as set out in Article 11), while retaining sufficient flexibility to respond rapidly to unexpected opportunities and crises. As Horizon Europe is a programme for 7 years, the economic, societal and policy context in which it will operate may change significantly during its life-time. Horizon Europe needs to be able to swiftly adapt to these changes. There will therefore be the possibility to include support for activities beyond the descriptions set out below, where this is duly justified, to address major develop- ments or unforeseen events, policy needs, or crisis situations, for example in response to serious threats to health arising for example from epidemics. 13.11.2020 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 388/479 Wednesday 12 December 2018 ",
        "Text proposed by the Commission Amendment In the implementation of Horizon Europe, particular attention will be paid to ensuring a balanced and broad approach to research and innovation, which is not only limited to the development of new products processes and services on the basis of scientific and technological knowledge and break- throughs, but also incorporates the use of existing technologies in novel applications and continuous improvement and non-technological and social innovation. A systemic, cross- disciplinary, cross-sectoral and cross-policy approach to research innovation will ensure that challenges can be tackled while also giving rise to new competitive businesses and industries, fostering competition, stimulating private invest- ments and preserving the level playing field in the internal market. In the \u2018Global Challenges and Industrial Competitiveness\u2019 and the \u2018Open Innovation\u2019 Pillars, research and innovation will be complemented with activities which operate close to the end-users and the market, such as demonstration, piloting or proof-of-concept, excluding however commercialisation activ- ities going beyond the research and innovation phase. This will also include support to demand-side activities that help accelerate the deployment and diffusion of a broad range of innovations. Emphasis will be put on non-prescriptive calls for proposals. Under the \u2018Global Challenges and Industrial Competitiveness\u2019 pillar, building on experience in Horizon 2020, the social sciences and the humanities will be fully integrated across all clusters, including specific and dedicated activities. Likewise, activities involving marine and maritime research and innovation will be implemented in a strategic and integrated manner in line with the EU Integrated Maritime Policy, the Common Fisheries Policy Policies and international commit- ments. \u2018FET Flagships\u2019 supported under Horizon 2020 will continue to be supported under this Programme. As they present substantial analogies with missions, other \u2018FET flagships\u2019, if any, will be supported under this Framework Programme as missions geared towards future and emerging technologies. Science and Technology Cooperation dialogues with the EU's international partners and policy dialogues with the main world regions will make important contributions to the systematic identification of opportunities for cooperation which, when combined with differentiation by country/region, will support priority setting.

        "Text proposed by the Commission Amendment Public investment in research, especially through universities and public research institutions (PRIs) and research facilities, often undertakes the longer-term, higher-risk research and comple- ments the activities of the private sector. Besides this it creates skills , knowhow and experience, new scientific instruments and methodologies, as well creating the networks which transmit the latest knowledge. Public investment in research, especially through universities and public research institutions (PRIs) and research facilities, often undertakes the longer-term, higher-risk research and comple- ments the activities of the private sector.

European science and researchers have been and continue to be at the forefront in many areas. But this is not a position we can take for granted. There is ample evidence to show that as the pace of research continues to grow, so the number of countries competing to be the best is increasing as well. The traditional challenge from countries such as the United States is now being joined by economic giants such as China and India, from the newly industrialising parts of the world in particular, and from all countries where governments recognise the manifold and abundant returns which derive from investing in research.

Rationale Although the EU remains the largest producer of scientific publications in the world , it is essentially a \u2018mass producer\u2019 of knowledge with, relative to its size, comparatively few centres of excellence that standout at the world level and with large areas of average and poor performance . Compared with the US and now China to some degree, the EU still tends to follow a \u2018distributed excellence model\u2019 in which resources are spread across a larger number of researchers and research institutions Another challenge is that in many EU countries the public sector still does not offer sufficiently attractive conditions for the best researchers. These factors compound Europe's relative unattrac- tiveness in the global competition for scientific talent. The EU remains the largest producer of scientific publications in the world. Compared with the US and now China to some degree, the EU follows a \u2018distributed excellence model\u2019 in which resources are spread across a larger number of researchers and research institutions. Another challenge is that in many EU countries the public sector investment in research is below any acceptable threshold and thus does not offer sufficiently attractive conditions for the best researchers. These factors compound Europe's relative unattractiveness in the global competition for scientific talent. The global research landscape is evolving dramatically and becoming increasingly multipolar as a result of a growing number of emerging countries, in particular China, expanding their scientific production. So whereas the EU and the United States accounted for nearly two-thirds of world expenditure on research and development in 2000, this share had fallen to less than half by 2013.

In addition, the European Innovation Scoreboard 2018 confirmed that public and private R&D expenditures across the EU remains below 2010 levels and falls short in meeting the long-standing objective to devote 3 % of GDP to R&D activities.

It operates autonomously led by an independent Scientific Council made up of scientists, engineers and scholars of the highest repute and appropriate expertise and diversity. The ERC is able to draw on a wider pool of talents and ideas than would be possible for any national scheme, reinforcing excellence through the way in which the best researchers and the best ideas compete against each other.

The ERC is able to draw on a wider pool of talents and ideas than would be possible for any national scheme, reinforcing excellent research in all fields of science through the way in which the best researchers and the best ideas compete against each other. Frontier research funded by the ERC has a substantial direct impact in the form of advances at the frontiers of knowledge, opening the way to new and often unexpected scientific and technological results and new areas for research. In turn, this generates radically new ideas which drive innovation and business inventiveness and tackle societal challenges. The ERC also has a significant structural impact, driving up the quality of the European research system over and above the researchers and actions it funds directly. ERC-funded actions and researchers set an inspirational target for frontier research in Europe, raising its profile and making it more attractive for the best researchers worldwide as a place to work, and work with. The prestige of hosting ERC grant- holders creates competition between Europe's universities and research organisations to offer the most attractive conditions for top researchers and can indirectly help them to assess their relative strengths and weaknesses and bring about reforms.

Europe needs highly-skilled and resilient human resources in research and innovation that can easily adapt to and find sustainable solutions for current and future challenges, such as major demographic changes in Europe. To ensure excellence, researchers need to be mobile , have access to top quality infrastructure in many fields , collaborate and diffuse knowledge across countries, sectors and disciplines, with the right combination of knowledge and skills to tackle societal challenges and support innovation. Europe is a scientific powerhouse with around 1,8 million researchers working in thousands of universities, research centres and world-leading companies. However, it is estimated that the EU will need to train and employ at least one million new researchers by 2027 in order to achieve the targets beings set for increased investment in research and innovation. This need is particularly acute in the non-academic sector. The EU must reinforce its efforts to entice more young women and men to a career in research, to attract researchers from third countries, retain its own researchers and reintegrate European researchers working elsewhere back to Europe. In addition, in order to more widely spread excellence, the conditions under which researchers perform must be further improved through- out the European Research Area (ERA). In this respect, stronger links are needed notably with the European Education Area (EEdA), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and European Social Fund (ESF+).

According to the OECD a 10 % improvement in life expectancy is also associated with a rise in economic growth of 0,3-0,4 % a year. Life expectancy in the EU increased by 12 years since its establishment as a result of tremendous improvements achieved in the quality of life, education, health and care of its people . In 2015, overall life expectancy at birth was 80,6 years in the EU compared to 71,4 years globally. In the past years, it increased in the EU on average by 3 months annually.

Rationale The EU stands for a unique way of combining economic growth with social policies, with high levels of social inclusion, shared values embracing democracy, human rights, gender equality and the richness of diversity. This model is constantly evolving and needs to deal with the challenges from amongst other things, globalisation and technological change . Europe also has to respond to the challenges arising from persistent security threats. Terrorist attacks and radicalisation, as well as cyber-attacks and hybrid threats, raise major security concerns and put particular strain on societies. The EU stands for a unique way of combining prosperity, economic growth and sustainability with social policies, with high levels of social inclusion, shared values embracing democracy, human rights, gender equality and the richness of diversity. This model is constantly evolving and needs to deal with the challenges from amongst other things, digitalisation, globalisation, and technological evolution . The EU must promote a model of inclusive and sustainable growth while reaping the benefits of technological advance- ments, enhancing trust in and promoting innovation of democratic governance, combatting inequalities, unemployment, marginalisation, discrimination and radicalisation, guaranteeing human rights, fostering cultural diversity and European cultural heritage and empowering citizens through social innovation. The management of migration and the integration of migrants will also continue to be priority issues. The role of research and innovation in the social sciences and the humanities in responding to these challenges and achieving the EU\u2019s goals is fundamental.

The management of migration and the integration of migrants will also continue to be priority issues. The role of research and innovation in the social sciences and the humanities and in the cultural and creative sector, in responding to these challenges and achieving the EU\u2019s goals is fundamental. Due to its broad spectrums, size, and impact in today\u2019s digital transformation, these sectors contribute sig- nificantly to our economy. As interrelations between social and technological innovation are complex, and rarely linear, further research, including cross-sectoral and multidisciplinary re- search, is needed into the development of all types of innovation and activities funded to encourage its effective development into the future.

        "Text proposed by the Commission Amendment European citizens, state institutions and the economy need to be protected from the continued threats of organised crime, including firearms trafficking, drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings. Strengthening protection and security through better border management is also key. Cybercrime is on the increase and related risks are diversifying as the economy and society digitalise. Europe needs to continue its effots to improve cybersecurity, digital privacy, personal data protection and combat the spread of false and harmful information in order to safeguard democratic and economic stability. Lastly, further efforts are required to limit the effects on lives and livelihoods of extreme weather events which are intensifying due to climate change, such as floods, storms or droughts leading to forest fires, land degradation and other natural disasters, e.g. earthquakes. Disasters, whether natural or man-made, can put at risk important societal functions, such as health, energy supply and government. The magnitude, complexity and trans-national character of the challenges call multi-layered EU action. Addressing such critical social, political, cultural and economic issues, as well as security challenges, only at national level would carry the danger of inefficient use of resources, fragmented approaches and dissimilar standards of knowledge and capacity. Security research is part of the wider comprehensive EU response to security threats. It contributes to the capability development process by enabling the future availability of technologies and applications to fill capability gaps identified by policy-makers and practitioners. Already, funding to research through the EU's framework programme has represented around 50 % of total public funding for security research in the EU. Full use will be made of available instruments, including the European space programme (Gali- leo and EGNOS, Copernicus, Space Situational Awareness and Governmental Satellite Communications). Synergies are sought with the activities supported by EU-funded defence research and duplication of funding is avoided. Cross-border collaboration contributes to developing a European single security market and improving industrial performance, under- pinning the EU's autonomy. 13.11.2020 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 388/511 Wednesday 12 December 2018 ",

CLUSTER \u2018SECURE SOCIETY\u2019 2a.1 Rationale In a context of transformations and growing global inter- dependencies and threats, research and innovation to ensure Europe\u2019s security is paramount. Despite the fact that Europe is free from large-scale military aggressions, there is now the need to respond to the challenges arising from new security threats. Terrorist attacks of various kind, violent radicalisation, as well as cyber-attacks and hybrid threats, raise major security concerns and put particular strain on societies. EU has to tackle these challenges and ensure public safety while preserving individual freedom and funda- mental rights. Security research is part of the wider EU efforts to meet this and other challenges. It contributes to the capability develop- ment process by enabling future availability of technologies, solutions and applications to fill gaps identified by policy- makers, and end-users, especially public authorities. Such research and innovation responds to the commitment of the Rome Agenda to work towards \u2018a safe and secure Europe\u2019, contributing to the Security Union. Synergies with the Justice Programme and with the Rights and Values Programme, which support activities in the area of access to justice, victims' rights, gender equality, non-discrimination, data protection and promotion of the European citizenship will be exploited.

This will be based on profound changes in technology and services, to the ways in which businesses and consumers behave, as well as involving new forms of governance. Limiting the increase of global average temperature to well below 2 o C, and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 o C, requires rapid progress in decarbonising the energy system and substantially reducing greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from the transport sector ( 17 ) . It will also need new impetus to accelerate the pace of developing next-genera- tion breakthroughs as well as demonstrating and deploying innovative technologies and solutions, using also the opportu- nities provided by digital and space technologies. This will be pursued through an integrated approach encompassing dec- arbonisation, resource efficiency, reduction of air pollution, access to raw materials and circular economy. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement the Union will need to unlock scenarios for the transition towards net-zero GHG emissions economy including low-carbon technologies and strategies for decarbonisation . This will entail profound changes in the technology and services, that underpin the ways in which industries produce, and businesses and consumers behave . The transformation of the energy market will take place through interaction of technology , infrastructure, the market as well as policy and regulatory frameworks including new forms of governance. Therefore, there is a need for systematic innovations in the energy, buildings, industry and transport sectors. Limiting the increase of global average temperature to well below 2 o C, and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 o C, requires reductions in greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions through decarbonization, energy savings, and the deployment of renewable energy sources and the electrification of industrial processes which encompass both the energy and the transport sectors ( 17 ) . Currently, the transport sector represents almost a quarter of the Union's GHG emissions. New impetus is needed to accelerate the pace of developing next-generation breakthroughs as well as demonstrating and deploying innovative technologies and solutions, using also the opportunities provided by key enabling technologies, digital technologies and space technologies. This will be pursued through an integrated approach encompassing decarbonisation, renewable energy resource and energy efficiency, reduction of air pollution, access to raw materials , including critical raw materials, and the circular economy. Particular attention should be paid to sector coupling (i.e. of electricity, heating and cooling, industry and transport sector) in all intervention areas, which is important for a successful energy and transport transition. To achieve this, the Union will also foster participatory approaches to research and innovation, including the multi- actor approach and develop knowledge and innovation systems at local, regional, national and European levels. Insights from social sciences and humanities, social innovation with citizens' engagement will be crucial to encourage new governance models, production and consumption patterns. 13.11.2020 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 388/543 Wednesday 12 December 2018 ",

Transport ensures the mobility of people and goods necessary for an integrated European single market, territorial cohesion and an open and inclusive society. At the same time, transport has significant negative effects on human health, congestion, land, air quality and noise, as well as safety resulting in numerous premature deaths and increased socio-economic costs. Therefore, sustainable mobility and transport networks need to become clean, safe, smart, secure, silent, reliable and affordable, offering a seamless integrated door-to-door service.

They have in common that they are taking shape at the intersection between different technologies, industry sectors and scientific disciplines, offering radically new combinations of products, processes, services and business models, and have the potential to open up new markets worldwide. Additional sectors such as manufacturing, financial services, transport or energy will also be impacted.
