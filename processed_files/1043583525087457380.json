B4Life is a conceptual framework to ensure better coherence and coordination of EU actions in the area of biodiversity and ecosystems. B4Life was defined in 2014 with the purpose of highlighting the strong linkages between ecosystems and livelihoods in view of contributing to poverty eradication. It aims to tackle the drastic biodiversity loss by promoting good governance of natural resources, securing healthy ecosystems for food security, and supporting innovative ways to manage natural capital in the framework of the green economy.

        "| 5 he European Union\u2019s first wildlife conservation intervention in Africa took place 30 years ago, helping to improve the management of Pendjari National Park in Benin. Since then the EU has supported dozens of conservation projects and programmes all over the continent, with a particular focus on Central Africa. Other donors are also committed to protecting Africa\u2019s biodiversity. Despite these efforts, protecting African flora and fauna remains a huge challenge: in recent years Africa has been losing wildlife at an alarming rate. Among many others, iconic species such as elephant and rhino have been decimated by poachers, who are often backed by international criminal networks trading illegal wildlife products in the same way arms, drugs or people are traded. Politicians and environmental groups across Africa and the world are searching for new ways to tackle the problem and limit its devastating effects. Wildlife conservation is a global issue as well as a local and national one. As the title of this document suggests, the problem is \u2018larger than elephants\u2019. Increasing pressure on land and natural resources, such as bushmeat and firewood, are leading to habitat loss and the irreversible degradation of entire ecosystems; many communities are exhausting the resources that guarantee their present and future livelihoods. Wildlife conservation is as much about people as it is about plants and animals. The EU\u2019s Biodiversity for Life (B4Life) initiative combines increased resources with a strategic approach based on coherence, coordination and cross-sector partnerships to tackle the twin problems of protecting biodiversity and building sustainable livelihoods. Larger than elephants is a prime example of B4Life\u2019s \u2018joined-up\u2019 and concerted approach: it documents a major initiative of the European Commission on African wildlife with contributions and validation from a wide range of specialised organisations and high-level specialists. The study confirms that wildlife traffickers are using global networks, but increasingly so too are those who intend to stop them. The document has received the support of all major actors in the conservation community and its findings will inform EU policy in Africa, including action against wildlife trafficking. It is with great pleasure that I present this publication, which showcases the importance that the European Commission attaches to African wildlife and African ecosystems. The wealth of Africa\u2019s population is largely dependent on its wildlife; safeguarding it must remain a central element in our united efforts to reduce poverty.

        "20 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Southern Africa T he strategy for this region of Africa is organised into five sections: 1) an introduction to the wildlife of Southern Africa; 2) an introduction to the main conservation threats and to the drivers of wildlife decline in the region; 3) a review of conservation approaches over the past half century in South- ern Africa with a subsection on the conservation of elephant and rhino; 4) lessons learned with regard to some key conser- vation issues of the region (protected area management, wildlife trade, community-based natural resource management and livestock disease management) and an introduction to five promising approaches to conservation (transfrontier conserva- tion, public-private partnerships for protected area manage- ment, conservancies, awareness-raising and councils of elders for the environment); 5) a plan of indicative conservation actions to achieve long-term wildlife conservation in the region. Section 1 describes the main natural habitats and ecosystems of Southern Africa and the status of elephant, rhino and other large mammals in the region \u2013 which is uneven but favourable overall by comparison to other regions. It describes the Miombo wood- lands and forests, rivers, flooded grasslands, floodplains and other wetlands of the region and their current status. Section 2 reviews long-term threats to the region\u2019s wildlife, including the rising demand for land (arising from the growth in human population), the fencing of grasslands, and the demand for ivory and rhino horn. The different threats bringing about wildlife decline are categorised as (a) proximate drivers \u2013 loss of habitat, illegal killing, failure of protected areas, (b) ultimate drivers \u2013 human population growth, international demand for resources, and climate change, and (c) social drivers \u2013 rural pov- erty, political indifference, agricultural subsidies, underfunding of protected areas. Proximate drivers are where much conservation work is currently focused; ultimate drivers are not amenable to change; social drivers are difficult to change but key to the long- term future of African wildlife. One of the main social drivers is the lack of a conservation policy that is embedded in African society. This section also introduces mammal migrations and the Afro-Palaearctic bird migrations that occur in the region and their special conservation requirements. Section 3 introduces seven strategic approaches to conservation that have been applied in Southern Africa over the past half century or more: 1) national parks, 2) biodiversity hotspots, 3) eco- regions, 4) water basins, 5) conservation for development, 6) bio- sphere reserves and 7) transfrontier conservation. It illustrates each of these approaches with maps. There is no single approach that is superior to the others; rather they complement one another and each makes a contribution to conserving wildlife. This section goes on to look at conservation issues regarding elephants and rhinos. Southern Africa has been relatively successful at conserv- ing these species compared to the rest of the continent but poaching is rising rapidly. The section concludes by discussing the pioneering role that Southern Africa has played in developing novel approaches to conservation, some of which have great importance in the global conservation movement. Section 4 looks at the lessons learned in five areas. 1) Protected areas \u2212 protected areas have withstood the test of time and remain the single most important wildlife conservation tool. Their conservation success, however, is closely dependent on the level of financial investment in park management, which is generally low. Two positive new influences on protected area conservation are the transfrontier approach and public-private partnerships in park management. 2) Trade in wildlife products \u2212 wildlife con- servation can be assisted by its sustainable use, especially in areas surrounding parks, but it requires close monitoring and tight management. There is a putative link between legal and illegal trade in ivory and rhino horn that is particularly problematic. 3) CBNRM and conservancies \u2212 private and communal conserv- ancies can bring substantial benefits to wildlife conservation and local economies if wildlife rights are devolved. 4) Wildlife migra- tion and livestock disease management \u2212 current agreements on trade in beef have proved damaging to wildlife migration. If the commodity-based trade approach to beef exports is sanc- tioned, it will enable many veterinary cordon fences in Botswana and elsewhere to be lowered. This will allow wildlife migrations to be reinstated. 5) Networks and conservation \u2212 a number of networked approaches to conservation in the region, including the Cape Action for People (CAPE) Partnership and the Namibian Association of CBNRM Support Organisations, have proved espe- cially successful. Other examples are found in wildlife law enforce- ment, which is assisted by the Southern African Wildlife Enforcement Network and, with regard to rhino, by the Southern Africa Devel- opment Community (SADC) Rhino Management Group. Section 4 also reviews five promising approaches to conservation in the region. The first of these is transfrontier conservation. A brief history of transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs) is given, including the important role of SADC. One of the key advan- tages of the transfrontier approach is the opportunity it provides to plan and undertake conservation and development at the scale of the entire ecosystem. Five tiers of management are recognised: (a) landscape management for migration (covering protected and non-protected parts of the landscape, and including issues such as livestock disease management) \u2212 this tier enables wildlife movement and dispersal across the ecosystem and creates the potential for old migratory routes to be re-established; (b) land- scape management for livelihoods which enables economic growth from wildlife-based tourism and hunting within TFCAs; >0 _ Executive Summary ",
        "| 21 #1 Executive Summary (c) water basin management which links TFCAs to River Basin Management Plans; (d) protected areas management which improves park management by ploughing back revenue from increased tourism; and (e) promotion of culture and peace which benefits from the new opportunities for cooperation and promo- tion of economic goods and services. The importance of govern- ance issues in successful TFCA development is emphasised and the exceptional importance of KAZA, the Kavango Zambezi TFCA, is highlighted. The central role of SADC in developing the TFCA network is described, together with the assistance afforded by its European development partners. The other four promising approaches mentioned are public-private partnerships for park management, wildlife conservancies, awareness raising and the formation of councils of elders for the environment. Section 5 outlines a plan for achieving long-term wildlife conser- vation in Southern Africa. The strategic plan is based on a small number of Key Landscapes for Conservation (KLCs). These areas will have the capacity to sustain viable populations of large African wildlife species within functioning ecosystems under the greatly increasing external pressure on land that is anticipated this century. At the same time, they will act as foci in developing the rural economy through the sustainable use of natural resources. A suitable network of KLCs will protect the well-known wildlife species of the region and stimulate economic growth. TFCAs are a central part of this strategic approach. Those TFCAs selected as KLCs will be developed at site level with an emphasis on strengthening governance, management and awareness rais- ing. They will be supported at the country level with an emphasis on policy reform, institutional strengthening and awareness raising. This will include expansion of the current national and regional facilities for mid-level and senior-level training in wildlife management. The selected TFCAs will be further supported at the regional level with an emphasis on key reforms in national laws to give landholders and rural communities the right to manage wildlife and woodlands for their own benefit. A number of inde- pendent conservation areas (ICAs) that protect intact wildlife ecosystems entirely within one country will also be selected as KLCs by an expert regional panel. In support of this process, an indicative list of 20 KLCs is presented in this section. In addition to the KLC approach to conservation and the dismantling of wild- life trafficking networks, awareness raising is prioritised. As part of the recommended awareness-raising programme, a commu- nication strategy will furnish materials and information on wildlife conservation to a range of targeted audiences. \u2303 Elephant, gemsbok, springbok and zebra at a waterhole in Chobe National Park, Botswana.

They are Angola , Botswana , Lesotho , Malawi , Mozambique , Namibia , South Africa , Swaziland , Zambia and Zimbabwe . The Southern African strategic approach provides appropriate responses to counter immediate threats to wildlife. It also pre- sents a guide to the long-term conservation of wildlife in the region, which is founded on two overarching principles \u2013 ecosys- tem conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources. \u2018Ecosystem conservation\u2019 recognises the need for conservation at the landscape or ecosystem scale in order to conserve viable populations of the larger wildlife species over the long term. This has particular cogency because of the regional trend towards increasing isolation of the remaining areas of natural habitat. Ecosystem-scale conservation is also needed to protect the eco- logical processes, such as migration and ecological succession, which underscore dynamic African wildlife areas. Regarding nat- ural resources, the natural capital inherent within functioning ecosystems is crucial to the economic growth of surrounding communities. This strategy seeks to integrate the \u2018sustainable use of natural resources\u2019 with ecosystem conservation to provide synergy between wildlife conservation and rural development. The strategic approach outlines a process for delivering effective land-use planning to meet these objectives through partnerships between communities, the private sector and government. 1.1 Conservation features of Southern Africa Southern Africa has great regional diversity in climate, geo- morphology and biodiversity (Figure 1). For the most part, its con- servation issues transcend national boundaries; however, the region does have some notable endemic species with restricted ranges (Box 1). Fynbos shrubland forms a major element of the Cape Floristic Region, which is one of the six recognised floral kingdoms of the world with some 9 000 vascular plant species of which 69 % are endemic to South Africa. Another centre of endemism is the Namib Desert, which has been arid for 55 million years, and is considered to be the oldest desert in the world. It extends along the coast of Namibia merging with the Kaokoveld Desert in Angola and the Karoo Desert in South Africa; the Karoo has the world\u2019s richest flora of succulent plants. The eastern coast of Southern Africa below the Great Escarpment is another important centre of plant endemism. Lake Malawi is a further site well known for its high endemism of fish and molluscs. Southern Africa has enormous areas of dry Miombo woodland lying north of the Limpopo River which have outstanding importance for conservation. The woodlands are occupied by some of the larger mammals of Africa such as elephant, black rhinoceros, hippo, giraffe, buffalo and zebra, which can utilise the fibrous plant mate- rial found on the nutrient-poor soils. Due to the vast size of the ecoregion, its overall importance for such species is very high, even though animal densities are usually low. Consequently about half of the elephants and half of the rhinos left in Africa are found there. Seasonal movements of these animals take advantage of temporal and spatial variability in surface water and plant nutrients. Conse- quently, migration and seasonal dispersal of large mammals are characteristic features of the Miombo. >1 _ Special features of the Southern African region ( 1 ) References located within boxes can be found in the Appendix.

This has not been adequately studied but reflects a combination of encroachment, illegal hunting and the reduction in availability of suitable habitat surrounding protected areas (PAs) as a result of human settle- ment and development. The latter may be especially significant where former dry season refuges or wet season dispersal zones are entirely removed. Nevertheless, the assembly of large mammal species in Southern Africa is spectacular. For example, the region supports between 200 000 and 250 000 elephants whilst leopard, buffalo, kudu, zebra and other antelopes also occur in large numbers. Although cheetah and rhino are present in relatively small numbers, the region still has a high proportion of the world\u2019s population of both species. A comparison of trends in three regions shows the rela- tive success of conservation in Southern Africa (Figure 2). As can be seen, the only region of Africa showing population increases of wildlife is in the south. This is partly due to the expansion of protection to new areas, such as in southeast Angola where elephant numbers increased rapidly in the early 2000s and expanded their range into reserves lying on the north- ern boundary of the Caprivi Strip 2 . Also, protected areas have tended to be relatively well funded in Southern Africa and are often managed specifically for their large mammals, and pri- marily for tourism. It is apparent that PAs in Africa are successful in maintaining large mammal populations if the management is appropriate and has sufficient resources. Conversely, Western African PAs, which show the greatest population declines in this study, have less financial and personnel resources available and their large mammals are threatened by hunting for bushmeat. A number of charismatic wild animals are threatened or endan- gered in the southern region. The proportion of threatened wild mammal species ranges from 2.6 % in Zimbabwe to 13 % in South Africa. However, the figures are on the increase in the region as a whole. In terms of species extinction, the blue ante- lope and the quagga are the only mammalian species known to have become extinct in Southern Africa in recent times. On the other hand, species such as the white and black rhino, black wildebeest, crowned crane, velvet gecko and the Cape mountain zebra have come critically close to disappearing altogether. Deci- sive conservation action has allowed their populations to recover, but increasing poaching of rhino places both species at risk once again. Figure 3 shows the trend in estimated numbers of both rhino species in the wild since 1992 and Table 1 gives the final continental rhino number estimates by country and subspecies for Africa (as of 31 December 2012). African wild dogs are also endangered in the region, surviving only in large protected areas. Similarly, the bearded vulture has undergone serious population declines and is now restricted to the Drakensberg range of South Africa and Lesotho. Figure 2.

        "28 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Southern Africa Most extant antelope species in Southern and South-central Africa still occur in substantial populations, at least locally. How- ever certain subspecies, including giant sable ( Hippotragus niger ssp. variani ), are in danger of extinction in the region 4 . The long- term persistence of these species within the region will require effective conservation of the ecosystems in which they occur. The conservation areas within Southern Africa of outstanding inter- national importance for the conservation of antelope communi- ties are listed by East 5 . The most appropriate and feasible strategy for antelope conservation will depend on local circum- stances but in general it will combine strict protection of core conservation areas with consumptive and non-consumptive uti- lisation of antelopes by rural populations as both play important roles in the development of successful long-term conservation strategies in Southern Africa. 1.2.2 Forests and woodlands 1.2.2.1 Overview The forests and woodlands of Southern Africa cover some 39 % of the total land area. This ranges from 0.5 % in Lesotho to 56 % in Angola. Much of the rest of the region contains savannah, arid or semi-arid scrub (Figure 4). The forest and woodland types in the region can be summarised as follows. i) Tropical forests. These are found in parts of Angola and the Congo basin. They harbour a diverse assemblage of plants and animals, with about 400 mammal species, more than 1 000 bird species and over 10 000 plant species of which some 3 000 are endemic to the region. ii) Afromontane forests. They are found in the high altitude and high rainfall areas of Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. The tree species, that include Podocarpus, are similar to those found in tropical rainforests. However, one of the few differences with the lat- ter is the occurrence of tree ferns and conifers. iii) Mangrove forests. These are found along the coastline of Mozambique and Angola and the north-east coast of South Africa. Tanzania, Namibia and Mauritius also have some man- grove forests. These forests play a very important protective function to the coastline and are also key breeding sites for marine fisheries. iv) Zambezi teak forests. They are sometimes called the \u2018Kalahari forests\u2019. They occur in parts of Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Namibia and Angola. The dominant tree species is Baikeaea plurijuga . This forest type has a long history of management for commercial timber exploitation, wildlife uti- lisation, cattle grazing and as a water catchment. v) Miombo woodlands. They are the most extensive woody vegetation type in areas north of the Limpopo River. Dominant tree species are Brachystegia, Julbenardia and Isoberlinia. Thickets of miombo hold little merchantable timber using current technologies and market preferences. Miombo covers an estimated 3.8 million square kilometres in Central and Southern Africa. These \u2018miombo\u2019 savannah woodlands are found in parts of 11 countries (Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 DRC, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe). Some of the woodlands, especially in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Tanzania, have been converted into intensive agricultural areas. vi) Mopane woodlands. They are found in the drier and lower lying parts of Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia, Angola, Botswana, South Africa, Mozambique and Malawi. Where Colophosper- mum mopane is dominant, the woodland assumes economic importance, especially as a source of browse for both domes- tic and wild animals. In addition, the tree\u2019s coppicing abilities render the woodlands economically important for subsistence wood fuel, construction poles and mopane worms. ( 4 ) East R. (1989a).

        "30 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Southern Africa 1.2.2.2 Miombo Miombo woodlands are the most extensive woody vegetation type of Southern Africa, covering over 3.8 million km\u00b2 in 11 coun- tries \u2013 Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The ecoregion is divided into various miombo woodland types as shown in Figure 5; Angolan miombo wood- lands, Central Zambezian miombo woodlands, Eastern miombo woodlands and Southern miombo woodlands. These formations, dominated by Brachystegia and Julbernardia , coexist with drier vegetation types, such as Baikiaea woodlands or mopane wood- lands. In general, there is a shift towards wet miombo types as one goes northwards. The human population density over much of the ecoregion is still low and patchy in comparison with other savannah regions of Africa under similar climatic conditions, although the situation is changing. The density of livestock is also relatively low, particu- larly in wetter areas where tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis remain prevalent. The ecoregion is important for the abundance of wood- land products: wood for building, fuel wood, fibre and forest foods such as bushmeat, fungi, honey and edible insects. The Miombo Ecoregion is of outstanding importance to conser- vation. It incorporates the catchment basins for the main rivers of Southern Africa, which include the Zambezi, Kavango and Congo, and also for two of the African Great Lakes (Lake Malawi/ Niassa and Lake Tanganyika), and for the Okavango Delta. Miombo woodlands are occupied by some of the most charismatic larger mammals of Africa such as elephant, black rhinoceros, hippo, giraffe, buffalo and zebra, which can utilise the fibrous plant material found on the nutrient-poor soils. Due to the vast size of the ecoregion, its overall importance for such species is very high, even though animal densities are usually low. Conse- quently about 50 % of the elephants and 50 % of the rhinos left in Africa are found there. The vast size of the region brings its own conservation challenges as it crosses the national boundaries of 11 countries, each with their own peculiarities of policy and legislation. The birdlife in the ecoregion is particularly rich in spe- cies, although the rates of endemism are low. On the other hand, the isolation of Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika has given rise to great diversification of freshwater fish and mollusc with many endemics. Between 1990 and 2000, the region\u2019s indigenous forests were being lost at an average rate of 0.6 % per annum. The figure ranged from 0.1 % in South Africa to 2.2 % in Malawi (Table 2). Three features of the miombo should be borne in mind when considering conservation strategy. Firstly, a key challenge of the ecoregion is to conserve the large-mammal populations with their distinctive seasonal movements and migrations. Conserv- ing elephants with their requirement for space, potential for human-wildlife conflict, capacity for causing woodland-habitat change and attraction for ivory poachers is perhaps the greatest challenge of all. Secondly, miombo is a \u2018high-carbon\u2019 landscape with an abun- dance of woody biomass. This applies even more to the wet miombo, which has a higher density of woody biomass and a correspondingly greater capacity to store carbon than dry miombo. This presents opportunities for conserving areas of wet miombo for carbon storage. Thirdly, the miombo woodlands cover most of the headwaters in the ecoregion where deep deposits of Kalahari sand play a stor- age role by slowly releasing water. Flooded grasslands, swamps and dambos within the miombo woodlands have a similar hydro- logical role. These water retention features create long-distance linkages by feeding water to downstream areas long into the dry season. Conservation of wet miombo areas can serve the dual ecological functions of watershed protection and carbon storage, with significant regional and global benefits. It also protects the albedo effects of extensive woodland canopy cover, which main- tains the regional climate. \u2303 Lake Malawi, the second deepest lake in Africa after Lake Tanganyika, is home to more species of fish than any other lake, including about 1 000 species of cichlids, most of which are endemic to the lake.

        "| 33 #1 Special features of the Southern African region 1.2.3 Wetlands and rivers 1.2.3.1 Flooded grasslands The flooded grasslands are a uniquely important habitat for con- servation in Southern Africa, providing food and water for wildlife throughout the year. Embedded mostly within the miombo and mopane woodlands of the Central African Plateau, Zambezian flooded grasslands are recognised as an ecoregion with a dis- continuous distribution between northern Botswana and northern Tanzania (Figure 6). Large populations of waterbirds gather at these wetlands during the rainy season, whilst numerous herds of grazing ungulates utilise the habitat in dry months when it can form a focus for species undergoing long-distance migrations. The population of red lechwe exceeds 20 000 in Moremi Game Reserve, Botswana and that of Kafue lechwe exceeds 35 000 in Lochinvar National Park, Zambia. The largest remaining popula- tion of puku is found in the Kilombero Valley in Tanzania and more than 20 000 Cape buffalo occur in the Moyowosi delta of north-western Tanzania. Many of the ungulates that inhabit this ecoregion move seasonally through the floodplain in response to the fluctuating water levels. Tsessebe, which are mostly restricted to seasonally flooded grasslands, are known to follow the reced- ing waters in the dry season and to retreat to higher ground when the waters rise. Wildebeest and oribi also frequent extensive floodplains and grasslands, although the latter favour less water- logged areas such as termitaries, where herbs and woody growth provide food and cover. Waterbuck, puku, southern reedbuck and sitatunga are also common inhabitants of the floodplains, although these species tend to prefer the reed beds or more wooded vegetation on the margins of the floodplains. Greater kudu, hartebeest, steenbok, sable and roan antelope are found in fewer numbers, generally preferring the woodland margins of inundated grasslands. Other herbivores attracted to these pas- tures include elephant, Burchell\u2019s zebra and eland. Hippopotamus is found in almost all of the prominent floodplains. The more extensive floodplains have historically provided impor- tant habitat for humans. For example, the Lozi people have tra- ditionally occupied the Barotse floodplains and their livelihoods have been closely linked to the seasonal flooding of the area. The Kafue Flats have been used by the Tonga people for cattle rearing and limited cultivation. However, much of the area comprising this ecoregion falls into areas affected by tsetse flies, vectors of sleeping sickness or trypanosomiasis, which affects both livestock and humans. This factor, in combination with the fact that many of the wetlands are at least afforded partial protection, may explain the relatively low overall human populations in these floodplain regions during the recent past. In recent years this picture has been changing. Several areas that only used to be seasonally grazed are now permanently occupied and cultivated. Increased wealth and government/aid inputs, as well as extensive tsetse fly control, have contributed to a large rise in cattle numbers over the past few decades; as many as 250 000 head of cattle are said to graze only in the Kafue Flats. Other threats arise from repetitive fires, pollution and illegal hunt- ing. Although many of these floodplains are officially protected, ineffective management and lack of funds has resulted in uncon- trolled poaching of animals such as hippo, elephant and rhino. In addition, overfishing is becoming an issue of increasing concern. \u2303 Black lechwe in the flooded grasslands of Bangweulu wetlands, Zambia. ",

By far the greatest river system in Southern Africa is the Zambezi, which rises in north-western Zambia on the Central African Plateau, flows south initially and then eastwards for 1 600 km across half of the continent before draining into the Indian Ocean, north of Beira in Mozambique. The basin, 1.33 mil- lion km 2 in extent, incorporates four distinct biomes and drains parts of eight countries (Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe). The basin has abun- dant water, fertile land and soils for agriculture and diverse hab- itats that are home to large populations of wildlife. There are four globally significant areas of biodiversity interest situated within the Zambezi Basin 7 . These are (a) Lake Malawi with its radiation of fish groups and freshwater molluscs; (b) the swamps, floodplains and woodlands of the Upper Zambezi in Zambia and northern Botswana with their radiation of reduncine antelope (black lechwe, Kafue lechwe, red lechwe, extinct Robert\u2019s lechwe and puku); (c) the Middle Zambezi Valley with its world- renowned assemblage of large African mammals including ele- phant, buffalo, giraffe, lion and until recently rhino; and (d) the area incorporating Gorongosa, Cheringoma and the Zambezi Delta in central Mozambique with its diverse habitats. In terms of threats, the construction of dams has had probably the greatest effect on biodiversity of wetland and aquatic species and on wetland ecological processes. These include large dams, such as Kariba, Cabora Bassa, Itezhi-Tezhi and Kafue Gorge, and the myriad of small dams on almost all tributaries of the Zambezi in Zimbabwe. The hydrology has changed and flooding regimes have been greatly modified, affecting habitat and species com- position. Two new major habitats have been created \u2013 a pelagic (open water) environment and a littoral (shoreline) environment. Creation of these new environments has led to previously rare species (e.g. freshwater molluscs) becoming abundant, and to the invasion or introduction of species new to the basin.

The population in the southern region is projected to treble or quadruple over the course of this century, which will place great demands on natural resources. A particular issue will be the amount of land turned over to arable production. The growth of arable land in Sub-Saharan Africa from 2000-2030 is projected to increase by 26 % 8 . The question arises as to whether protected areas can be sustained under greatly increasing pressure for arable land. In 2011, protected areas in Sub-Saharan Africa comprised 11.8 % of surface area 9 . Much of this area is suitable for agriculture and livestock. Figure 7 illustrates how rapidly protected areas can become iso- lated by human settlements. In this case the main change pre- cipitating immigration was clearance of tsetse fly. Up to 1993, the protected areas had remained free of settlement. However, protected areas in Africa do succumb to population pressure like this, experiencing extensive cattle grazing, farmed agriculture and settlement, unless they are given central importance in socio- economic development plans for the region. 2.1.2 Commercial farming Plantations and commercial farms have significant direct and indirect effects on biodiversity. Oil palm is one of the most rapidly expanding plantation crops that is having high impacts on moist forest habitat in Central Africa (see Chapter 3). Commercial farm- ing of sugarcane can reduce downstream water supplies and displace wildlife directly. It has completely transformed large tracts of land, especially in the coastal regions north and south of Durban. Other export crops, including vegetables and flowers, have similar impacts. Pressure from commercial agriculture will work in tandem with that from subsistence agriculture to place increasing pressure on wildlife over the course of this century. 2.2 Alienation of the majority population In Southern Africa, a sense of the intrinsic values of biodiversity is poorly developed at the level of decision-making on land use, and there is almost no consideration given to ecosystem services and biodiversity (D.H.M. Cumming, pers. comm.). Consequently many protected areas are underfunded. This situation has been aptly summarised by the African Parks organisation 10 : State conservation agencies have become seriously under- funded, management expertise has been lost and proper governance eroded. Coupled with this is the increasing pres- sure from growing populations in surrounding communities. With little or no legitimate benefit from a park\u2019s existence, local communities face a set of economic incentives that can only lead to its destruction over time. The scale of underinvestment in the protected areas of Southern Africa is highlighted in Section 3.2.2.3 (Investment in protected areas). The situation at the local level is no better as the parks are often disliked. In the words of Hulme and Murphree 11 : For generations, conservation policy in Africa has been socially illegitimate in the eyes of the continent\u2019s rural people \u2026 the task of creating a conservation policy that is embedded in Africa society, rather than imposed from above, will be the work of generations. If pressure on land is the ultimate driver of wildlife decline then alienation of the majority population from its wildlife heritage is the ultimate social driver (Table 5, Section 2.6). The birth of com- munity management of natural resources is creating opportuni- ties for a new conservation policy that is embedded in African society. It is a central pillar of this wildlife strategy (Section 5). ( 8 ) FAO (2003). World Agriculture: Towards 2015/2030. Earthscan. ( 9 ) IUCN and UNEP-WCMC (2011).

Other factors contributing to this isolation are lon- gitudinal barriers, principally fences and roads, and the elimina- tion of wildlife in surrounding territory through overhunting and disease. Isolation of protected areas poses a serious threat to the long-term viability of many wildlife populations and migrations in Africa 12, 13 . A major proximate cause of wildlife decline has been the fragmentation of habitat caused by the erection of game fences across large parts of Southern Africa, as illustrated for central Namibia in Figure 8. Such \u2018fencescapes\u2019 are increasingly found elsewhere, including South Africa and Botswana. This sit- uation has been seriously aggravated by the beef subsidies offered under Lom\u00e9 Conventions and the Cotonou Agreement, which have led to extensive fencing, habitat fragmentation and the collapse of migratory wildlife populations (Box 2).

Fences, migration and livestock diseases Historically many ungulate migrations in Southern Africa occurred in Botswana. The largest existed around the Kalahari Desert, with water-dependent species spending the dry season close to rivers and lakes before moving to seasonal desert grasslands once rain had filled temporary waterholes and initiated the growth of annual grasses (Williamson et al., 1988). Millions of wildebeest, hartebeest and springbok moved from the central Kalahari Desert to the schwelle grassland in south-west Botswana (Williamson et al., 1988) and hundreds of thousands of wildebeest and zebra moved from the Boteti River to the Kalahari and Makgadikgadi grasslands. Further north, buffalo, elephant, wildebeest and zebra moved from the permanent waters of the Okavango and Linyanti river systems to the seasonal grasslands of the Savuti marsh (Vandewalle, 2000). The control of foot-and-mouth disease in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe led to the erection of fences across vast areas to control movements of game and cattle, which markedly reduced the sustainable densities of wildlife (Booth & Cumming, 2009). Between the 1950s and 1980s, Botswana erected veterinary cordon fences across much of the country, especially to protect cattle destined for European export (EIA, 2008). Many migratory movements were disrupted. The \u2018mass die-offs\u2019 and resultant population declines of wildebeest, zebra and other large mammals are well known (Williamson & Williamson, 1981, 1988; Williamson, et al., 1988). Disruptions of migratory routes, habitat fragmentation and mortalities on fences continue to be a source of concern and controversy (Gibson 2010). However, recent studies reveal that historical migrations can be reinstated once barriers to movement are removed (Bartlam Brooks et al 2011). Despite these control measures and their environmental costs, access to European markets for livestock and livestock products in the region continues to be constrained by foot and mouth disease (Thomson et al 2013a). As a consequence, Southern Africa faces ongoing losses of biodiversity, as well as limited access to high-value markets for animal products. There is a new willingness in the conservation and livestock sectors of Southern Africa to look again at the issue of veterinary cordon fencing and to seek environmentally sensitive alternatives for controlling disease (Section 4.1.4).

Increased poaching is also recorded in Angola, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe but not, so far, at the levels reported in Central Africa. Data on the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) indicates that Caprivi, Namibia may also be experiencing problems. Zambia is facing serious challenges from an illicit trade in ivory. Despite the rise of poaching in the region, a major elephant- related concern in Southern Africa is the growing population of elephants in KAZA TFCA and its impact on woodlands. The central issue there, and across the region, is the extent to which local communities can realise the full value of wildlife on their land, and whether those benefits will outweigh the costs of having wildlife on their land. This in turn highlights the importance of successfully integrated development planning in the context of TFCAs. 2.5 Demand for rhino horn South Africa conserves 82 % of Africa\u2019s rhinos and it also has experienced the most poaching in absolute terms since 2009. In 2012, South Africa lost 3.19 % of its national herd from poach- ing, putting it on a par with Kenya (2.83 %) and Zimbabwe (4.11 %). While poaching in South Africa and Kenya is currently still at sustainable levels (i.e. not currently leading to population decline), both are approaching the tipping point where poaching ceases to be sustainable and deaths will start to exceed births. Encouragingly, Table 4 shows that, at a continental level, poaching in the first half of 2014 has levelled off and remains at an aver- age of 2013 levels (three rhinos poached/day). By the end of December 2013, the number of rhino killed in South Africa had risen to 1 004 (4.78 %) (Figure 9). However the rising trend has stabilised (Figure 10). It remains to be seen whether this apparent levelling off in poaching in South Africa (and indeed also continental levelling off) will continue, or whether poaching will once again continue to trend upwards, as happened after a period of about a year of relative stability in South Africa, 2010/11. Poaching spiked in Kenya in 2013 reaching 5.76 % of the population at the start of the year (Table 4). Poaching of rhino continued to decline in Zimbabwe accounting for 2.54 % in 2013 (Table 4). Kruger National Park continues to bear the brunt of rhino poach- ing in South Africa with 425 rhino lost in 2012 and 606 in 2013. It has proved necessary to replace the eastern border fence in an attempt to reduce losses of rhino moving into Mozambique. Of the total number of South African rhinos poached in 2013, 114 rhinos have been killed in Limpopo province, 92 in Mpuma- langa, 85 in KwaZulu-Natal and 87 in North West province (data from AfRSG). High prices paid for rhino horn on the international market have stimulated a sophisticated poaching operation involving criminal syndicates that employ well-equipped ex-military and profes- sional hunters. This is presenting a serious challenge to prevailing conservation efforts. The twin goals of conservation are breaking or disrupting the transnational organised criminal networks and providing alternative economic opportunities in adjacent poor communities to discourage poaching. \u2303 Rangers perform a post mortem on the carcass of a poached rhino in Kruger National Park, August 2014. South Africa hosts over 80 % of Africa\u2019s remaining rhinos but lost 1 004 in 2013. ",

If the latter is not done, there will be no escape from the cycle of crisis management. Table 5 arranges the main threats to wildlife under three categories of threat, or \u2018drivers of wildlife decline\u2019. Proximate drivers are threats to wildlife that account immediately for its decline; they can be addressed effec- tively by a combination of national investment, conservation- development projects, and international agreements and action. Ultimate drivers derive from the wider changes in society that ultimately bring about the proximate threats; there is little one can do about these, other than to introduce systems that assist adaptation to the inevitable change. There is a third category of threat that we identify as social drivers of wildlife decline. These are socio-economic, political and institutional weaknesses within society that accelerate wildlife decline and undermine conservation efforts. They include, for instance, the lack of leadership from politicians on wildlife con- servation, lack of awareness or appreciation of wildlife values in educated classes, and the lack of knowledge about wildlife man- agement in rural communities. Such problems may be deep- seated but they can, in principle, be effectively addressed with the support of conservation and development programmes. A related problem as previously mentioned is the underfunding of many parks in the region 14 . In summary, proximate drivers are where much of today\u2019s con- servation work is focused; ultimate drivers are not amenable to change; social drivers are difficult to change but key to the long- term future of African wildlife. It is also worth noting that threats are often interlinked, such that one may work in concert with another. In the case of rhino, the impact of increased poaching has raised the cost of protection and escalated the risks to staff and families from well-armed and aggressive poaching gangs. This when coupled with declining economic incentives has resulted in increasing numbers of owners considering or getting rid of their rhino. If this trend continues it threatens to decrease range and ultimately numbers of rhino, as well as revenue for conservation agencies. ( 14 ) Cumming D.H.M. (2007).

One of the principal threats is restricted access to food or water. Migrations of scimitar-horned oryx and hartebeest have disappeared from the Sahara of Niger and Chad, and the Ogaden of Somalia and Ethiopia respectively. Wildebeest migrations in the Athi-Kapiti Plains in southeast Kenya are extinct. Wildebeest once migrated northeast of Etosha National Park in Namibia during dry seasons, but cordon fencing in 1973 closed all movements. Fencing in the Kruger National Park in South Africa blocked wildebeest migration, and populations declined from 6 000 to 750. Historical (1850s) migrations of tens of thousands of trekbokke (springbok, black wildebeest, blesbok, eland and quagga) no longer occur in the Karoo and Highveld of South Africa, and quagga are extinct as a species. Reports of extant mass migrations of springbok in Botswana are unconfirmed. We know even less about the migrations of bats. However the ubiquitous straw-coloured fruit bat travels large distances in massive colonies. Using satellite-tracking collars, individuals have been recorded moving from the colony of several million in Kasanka national park (NP) in Zambia over neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, covering 1 000 km in just a month. Conserving mass mammal migrations means preserving the ani- mals\u2019 freedom of movement in response to the temporal aspects of food and water across seasonal extremes. This requires under- standing basic parameters of the migration (e.g. location, num- bers, routes, distances travelled), ecological drivers, habitat needs and threats. When ungulates are excluded from forage and water resources, their numbers plummet and migrations disappear. Recent evidence from zebra studies in Botswana reveals that a remnant of the former migratory population may persist at low density in smaller ranges that have enough resources to maintain them. When barriers are removed the migration pattern has been recovered 16 (also see Box 2). ( 15 ) Review in: Harris G., S. Thirgood, J.G.C. Hopcraft, J.P.G.M. Cromsight and J. Berger (2009).

Population trend estimates for this region have remained poor or even become worse. The causes of decline are hard to pin down. A recent review of Afro-Palaearctic migrant bird populations indicates that the interacting factors of anthropogenic habitat degradation and climatic conditions, particularly drought in the Sahel zone, are the most important causes of decline 17 . It calls for a flyway approach to conservation that is combined with an understanding of land management practices that integrate the needs of birds and people in these areas (Figure 11). Many waterbirds congregate in key estuaries where site-based con- servation can help protect the migrations. The Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) works internationally to conserve migrations across taxa 18 . They focus on species threatened with extinction, but include other species whose migrations would significantly benefit from international coop- eration, including strictly migratory and nomadic species. Developed under the framework of the CMS, the African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement 19 (AEWA) is an intergovernmental treaty dedicated to the conservation of migratory waterbirds and their habitats across Africa and Europe, parts of Asia, Canada and the Middle East. The Ramsar Convention 20 is an intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. \u2303 The European Roller, Coracias garrulus.

How- ever nature conservation as a major form of land-use and a significant contributor to the national economy is a much more recent development. In Africa, the first parks were established less than a century ago by colonial administrations wishing to preserve the world\u2019s remaining wildernesses from the inroads of industrial modernity (Table 7). Beginning with those early national parks, it is possible to distinguish a series of strategic approaches to the conservation of wildlife (Table 6). Each one can be associ- ated with an emerging conservation paradigm with global application. 3.1.1 National parks The earliest conservation paradigm in modern times was the establishment of national parks, primarily as sanctuaries for plants and animals where human intervention should be kept to a minimum. The first parks in Africa were established in the 1920s (Table 7). Since then the concept of protection has been widened to incorporate a range of human uses. The area pro- tected has increased steadily up to the present time (Figure 12) 21 . Almost unquestionably this paradigm remains the most important approach to conservation today but it faces considerable chal- lenges: underfunding, isolation from similar areas of natural hab- itat, hard edges between parks and agricultural land or settlements, alienation of the local population which may precipitate encroach- ment within the parks, and unsustainable (illegal) use of wildlife, timber and other natural resources. Whereas the national parks in some countries and locations in Southern Africa effectively con- serve large mammal populations and rare species, in other coun- tries the picture is less favourable. The situation of the Kissama, Cangandala, Iona, Bikuar and Cameia National Parks in Angola is one of almost total abandon with neither equipment nor staff on site. Parts of these areas are today occupied by people that practice hunting and bush-burning at levels that have caused the disap- pearance of both large and small mammals. In some cases, large numbers of people live or farm in the protected areas. Useful developments in protected area management over the past half century have included the following: buffer zones, community conservation, world heritage sites, public-private partnerships, Global Positioning System (GPS) management information systems, remote sensing technologies and transfrontier conservation. >3 _ Ongoing conservation efforts Table 6.

        "54 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Southern Africa 3.1.2 Biodiversity hotspots An early attempt at the systematic conservation of biodiversity was Norman Myer\u2019s hotspot concept, which identified regions of the world with high species diversity and high endemism. Today Conservation International (CI) recognises eight hotspots in Africa, of which five occur wholly or partly in Southern Africa: Cape Floristic Region, Succulent Karoo, Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany (for which the Critical Ecosystems Partnership Fund has devel- oped an ecosystem profile 22 ), Eastern Afromontane, and Madagascar and the Indian Ocean Islands. A related approach is the Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) Programme of Birdlife International, which identifies areas with bird species that are vulnerable to global extinction and amenable to conservation action. More than 1 230 IBAs have been identified in Africa. Groups of species are sometimes used to identify gaps in pro- tected area coverage, for instance with birds 23 and mammals 24 . In a recent example, the world\u2019s 173 461 designated protected areas were prioritised according to their \u2018irreplaceability\u2019 for ensuring the conservation of 21 419 vertebrate species encom- passing all birds, mammals and amphibians, but not freshwater fish or reptiles 25 . 3.1.3 Ecoregions and the biogeographic approach The representation of biomes, ecoregions or other biogeographic areas can be used for detecting gaps in a region\u2019s PA network. MacKinnon and MacKinnon (1986) 26 reported the extent to which major vegetation types of the Afrotropical realm occur within protected areas at national levels. They used White\u2019s (1983) veg- etation map of Africa 27 as the basis for their habitat classification. MacKinnon and MacKinnon\u2019s findings for the Southern African region were reworked using a simplified version of White\u2019s veg- etation map in which 19 as opposed to 47 vegetation types were used 28 . The analysis revealed that habitats with the greatest plant species richness and endemism (lowland fynbos, Afro-montane grassland and forests, lowland forest and the Karoo) were the least protected. A systematic analysis of gaps in global habitat protection (based on ecofloristic zones) revealed that montane dry habitat in South Africa was inadequately protected 29 . The most widely utilised biogeographic classification today is that of biomes and ecoregions developed by the WWF. Ecoregions are now used extensively in conservation planning. Nevertheless the approach has its own limitations. Although the criteria for map- ping ecoregions distinguish areas with distinctive fauna, they are based on vegetation landscapes. Small technical differences in classification criteria have large effects on ecoregion areas and therefore on their protection status (Figure 13).

        "| 57 #1 Ongoing conservation efforts 3.1.4 Water basins It is possible to divide Southern Africa more or less into river basins and to implement a conservation strategy based around the need to protect the basin and its water for wildlife and human welfare (Figure 14) 31 . The river basin perspective is useful as a planning tool for sus- tainable development; its utility for conservation is not so clear- cut. In the case of small-to-medium-sized ecosystems, the river-basin perspective is clearly vital. For example, the Okavango Delta depends critically on the flow of water from the Okavango River, which is potentially affected by offtake along the Panhandle (for settlements) or further upstream (to augment water supplies in the central area of Namibia); similarly the Serengeti-Mara eco- system depends critically on the dry-season flow of water in the Mara River which is now threatened by upstream offtake for irrigation schemes. Securing the water flow into these wildlife ecosystems is fundamental to their long-term conservation. The correspondence between wildlife conservation and the imme- diate river-based threat is high. In the case of large river basins however, the correspondence between upstream developments and downstream conservation areas can be weak. It could be argued, for instance, that attempts to conserve the truly vast catchment of the Zambezi River in Angola and Zambia risks dilution of the slender resource base available for wildlife conservation. Continuing with that logic, it could then be argued that efficient use of funds dictates that conservationists look within the Zambezi Basin to identify specific threats which link closely to specific wildlife areas. In the case of the Zambezi system, an example would be the Kafue Flats flood- plain, which depends critically on the hydrological regime of the lower Kafue River and how it is affected by the operation of two dams 32 . Regulating the \u2018environmental flow\u2019 passing through the dams enables improved conservation of Kafue lechwe. Integrated river basin management and integrated water resource management are vital development goals; however choices need to be made between interventions at different scales. One of the criteria in the wildlife sector is an efficient use of scarce funds for wildlife conservation at the ecosystem scale. Whole water governance and basin-planning system development may not always pass that criterion for use of wildlife funds. Understanding the nature of the connection between upstream catchment and downstream livelihoods and wildlife is the key step in making rational decisions of this kind. 3.1.5 Conservation for development In 1980, the publication of the World Conservation Strategy by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and WWF signalled the beginning of a new conservation policy that harnessed the economic potential of sustainable development. The need for this approach was appreciated early on in Zimbabwe which, in common with most other African coun- tries, had in place a system of state ownership of wildlife, result- ing in a decline of wildlife outside protected areas 33, 34 . The Parks and Wildlife Act of 1975 gave landholders in Zimbabwe the right to manage wildlife for their own benefit and heralded an imme- diate reversal in wildlife declines on private land. During the 1980s the legal provisions of this Act were extended to Rural District Councils (RDCs), and thus partially to rural com- munities in communal lands. It enabled them to manage and benefit from wildlife resources through the emerging Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMP- FIRE). The programme ran into difficulties through the concentra- tion of power in RDCs 35 but the essential model of decentralisation and devolution of administrative powers and responsibilities for communal resources was adopted elsewhere in Southern Africa. Following the pioneering CAMPFIRE programme in Zimbabwe, community-based natural resources management (CBNRM) strat- egies were formulated and implemented in Zambia in 1988 under the Administrative Management Design (ADMADE) for game man- agement areas (GMAs). Despite a promising start, ADMADE failed to establish itself. A major reason for this failure according to one expert was inappropriate understanding of the specific context of \u2018wildlife\u2019 and its uses by rural residents 36 . Namibia\u2019s Nature Conservation Act of 1996 provided a basis for communal area conservancies and granted conservancy mem- bers the right to consumptive uses of wildlife. Namibia\u2019s 1998 land policy acknowledged the rights of local communities to woodland resources. The development of \u2018conservancies\u2019 within communal lands has been particularly successful in conservation terms, with populations of many large mammal species making spectacular recoveries 37 . The WWF LIFE Programme has been instrumental in developing and supporting the operational frame- work for community-based natural resources management (CBNRM) in Namibia. The LIFE Programme assisted the Ministry of Environment & Tourism to develop the legislative framework for communal area conservancies and significantly bolstered ( 31 ) WWF (2012).

In particular, the LIFE Pro- gramme gave birth to the Namibia Association of CBNRM Support Organisations (NACSO), which is an umbrella body for nine non-governmental organisations and the University of Namibia. Since the first four communal conservancies were registered in 1998, the conservancy movement has ballooned to 83 conserv- ancies covering more than 160 000 km 2 or almost 20 % of the country and involving close to 10 % of Namibia\u2019s total population in a national conservation movement. The pioneering work of NACSO, which includes the Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation (IRDNC) as a mem- ber, and the WWF LIFE programme, has led to one of the most progressive policy environments for community-based natural resource management in Southern Africa, with local communities getting significant benefits from the use of wildlife resources. The government only confers wildlife user-rights to communities in conservancies; they have no land rights. This is a much-over- looked weakness that is beginning to be addressed. 3.1.6 Biosphere reserves One of the early conservation initiatives to advocate the idea of sustainable development was the biosphere reserve, in which areas are proposed by residents, ratified by national committees and designated by UNESCO\u2019s Man and Biosphere (MAB) pro- gramme. The main characteristic of biosphere reserves is that they embrace conservation and development by using zoning schemes with core protected areas surrounded by development zones. Conceptually, this model is attractive, with 610 sites cur- rently designated globally. Yet the practical reality of implement- ing dual \u2018conservation\u2019 and \u2018development\u2019 goals has proved to be challenging, with few examples successfully conforming to the model\u2019s full criteria 38 . This may partly explain the new emphasis under the Madrid Action Plan 39 to recognise the potential of bio- sphere reserves to function as \u2018learning sites for sustainable development\u2019.

It shares the concept of joint conservation and development with biosphere reserves but, in addition, has the role of promoting culture and peace. It also differs in that it frequently encompasses a much larger area than the biosphere reserves and usually includes well-recognised national parks. Its central importance to the conservation of wildlife lies in its policy of addressing multiple issues. Section 4.2.1 outlines the role of TFCAs in more detail. 3.2 Conservation of elephants and rhinos Our proposed strategic approach to elephant poaching, rhino poaching and wildlife trade is given separately (Sections 1-3 in Chapter 5). This section summarises information on the distribu- tion and status of elephant and rhino in Southern Africa, the threats and risks, conservation planning, action being taken and recommended actions for the future. A key part of the strategy for controlling trade in ivory and rhino horn is the establishment of inter-agency Wildlife Enforcement Networks (WENs), one for each sub-region, and in all countries individually. The Southern African Wildlife Enforcement Network (WEN-SA) is under devel- opment in the southern region. Some regional features to con- servation of elephant and rhino are outlined below. 3.2.1 Elephant 40 Examination of poaching levels based on PIKE, a statistic deter- mined from data gathered by the programme for monitoring the illegal killing of elephants (MIKE), reveals consistent differences in poaching levels between the different African regions, with Central Africa showing the highest overall poaching levels, in contrast with Southern Africa, which shows the lowest overall levels (Figure 15). Pockets of poaching at higher levels in Southern Africa occur in northern Mozambique, northern Zimbabwe and in the Caprivi Strip 41 . Figure 15.

        "60 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Southern Africa The MIKE programme has statistically evaluated relationships between PIKE levels and a wide range of ecological, biophysical and socio-economic factors at site, national and global levels. Three factors consistently emerge as very strong predictors of poaching levels and trends: (a) poverty at the site level, (b) gov- ernance at the national level and (c) demand for illegal ivory at the global level. Regarding poverty, sites suffering from higher levels of poverty (as indicated by infant mortality) experience higher levels of elephant poaching. This suggests that there may be a greater incentive to facilitate or participate in the illegal killing of elephants in areas where human livelihoods are inse- cure. Furthermore, this relationship highlights a close linkage between the wellbeing of people and that of the elephant popu- lations with which they coexist. In the context of Southern Africa as a whole, there is no imme- diate threat to the elephant population. However the picture could change, depending on market conditions and investment in wild- life law enforcement. Significant numbers of elephants were killed in 2012 in Mozambique (Niassa national reserve, Quirimbas NP and Limpopo NP), Zimbabwe and Angola. Some of the poaching of elephants in Zimbabwe has utilised cyanide procured from a local gold mine. Despite an increase in poaching recorded in many parts of Southern Africa, the main elephant-related problem out- side Mozambique is the growing population of elephants in KAZA TFCA and the need for mitigation of human-elephant conflicts. 3.2.2 Rhino 42 3.2.2.1 Criminal investigation An ability to trace confiscated horn back to its natural point of origin through forensic analysis has long been recognised as a potentially powerful tool for understanding and dismantling the trade networks involved. The same methods can be also used to register legal stocks and aid their identification in the event of theft. The Veterinary Genetics Laboratory (VGL) at the University of Pretoria has emerged as Africa\u2019s leading forensics lab with regard to rhinos specifically. The rhino DNA database developed and run from VGL (known as RhoDIS \u2013 Rhino DNA Index System) continues to expand, and DNA analyses are increasingly being used in criminal investigations and prosecutions. DNA profiling would also be an essential component in monitoring legal trade in horn, if this were agreed. Many other approaches to criminal investigation are being tested, including DNA profiling as a traceability tool, drones, tracking devices, spatial monitoring and reporting tools, protected sanc- tuaries, community involvement and awareness programmes, dehorning of wild populations, an integrated national electronic database, raising penalties for those convicted of rhino crimes and farming rhinos for their horns in Asia. These efforts are pay- ing off as indicated by the possible levelling off of poaching in South Africa (Section 2.5, Figure 10). Figures released by the South African Department of Environmental Affairs show an increasing number of rhino-related arrests over the past few years (Figure 16). In 2013, some 127 alleged poachers were arrested in the Kruger National Park alone. The penalties for rhino poaching are becoming increasingly severe and frequent.

The Department of Environmental Affairs, in consultation with the National Treasury, is to establish a National Rhino Fund to coordinate the financing of anti-poach- ing initiatives in South Africa. 3.2.2.2 Consumptive use Currently, South Africa and Namibia have a quota of five black rhino bulls per year. White rhino hunting is less closely regulated, as the overall population is bigger and hunting primarily takes place on private land. In South Africa, the live-sale of white rhinos at auction, limited sport hunting of surplus males, and ecotourism have provided incentives for private sector conservation and gen- erated much needed funds which can help pay the high cost of successfully monitoring, protecting and managing rhino. An influential cadre of conservationists supports consumptive utilisation, particularly safari hunting, because it brings in large revenues for conservation from a small number of trophy animals legally shot by wealthy clients. They point out that sustainable use, including through trophy hunting, is a fundamental pillar of, for example, Namibia\u2019s conservation approach, and has been instrumental in its success. IUCN\u2019s own policy has long recognised Figure 16.

Elephant and rhino are viewed no differently. Carefully managed hunting of these and other wildlife species has proven to be an effective means of encouraging and enabling rural communities, private landholders and indeed governments in a number of countries to protect and invest in wildlife 43 . Viewed from a continental perspective, the benefits of sustaina- ble hunting in parts of Southern Africa do not extend to the rest of the continent. As noted in Chapter 5, Section 2, it is unlikely that consumptive utilisation of rhino will reduce the illegal killing of wild rhinos and/or the demand for their horns. Sustainable hunting and horn farming do not threaten rhino species directly but they can and do open the door to illegal trade. The view is taken that the institutional and market arrangements needed to manage a legal trade would \u2013 irrespective of their sophistication \u2013 not only be extremely costly but also, in view of the intractable and price-inelastic nature of the demand, be quite unable to close the black market for illegal horn any more effectively than has the current total ban. Consequently, the basic strategy for rhinos going forward must be to have at least one or two viable popu- lations of each subspecies survive the current onslaught. If that can be done, a recovery from the brink, as proved once before, always remains possible. Nonetheless, alternative options, inclu- sive of a legal trade in horn along with demand reduction, should be investigated thoroughly. 3.2.2.3 Investment in protected areas One of the weakest elements in the conservation of rhino in Southern Africa can be attributed to inadequate investment in the management of protected areas. Surveys of rhino numbers in nine African countries (1=Central African Republic, 2=Tanzania, 3=Somalia, 4=Mozambique, 5=Zambia, 6=Kenya, 7=South Africa, 8=Namibia, 9=Zimbabwe) from 1980-84 were compared with the spending by central governments on their conservation areas (Figure 17). Stable populations of rhino (0 % change in numbers) had an intercept of USD 230 per square kilometre. This was the minimum expenditure for adequate conservation of rhino in pro- tected areas 44 . In today\u2019s currency, the equivalent expenditure would be USD 450 per square kilometre. A survey from ten years ago reveals that the actual expenditure is well below this critical level (Figure 18). It explained the inability of nations to stem the tide of rhino poaching at that time, except in South Africa. It would be useful to repeat this analysis today in the context of high levels of rhino poaching in South Africa. Martin (2003) has modified this rule by linking the expenditure to the size of the area being protected, with larger areas requiring less per unit area than smaller areas 45 . Even with this modifica- tion, it is clear that most of the countries in Southern Africa are spending far less on their protected areas than is required for the conservation of elephant and rhino.

Some of these approaches, such as community-based natural resource man- agement and the wilderness movement, have influenced the global conservation movement. Can the region pioneer a successful model of long-term conserva- tion for Africa? Its biggest challenge will be to enable the majority population to develop its own policy for governing wildlife conser- vation and use \u2013 a policy it can identify with and believe in \u2013 and then manage its incorporation into mainstream conservation.

Increasingly, wildlife pop- ulations and fragile habitats have become confined to pro- tected areas within the wider landscape. \u2022 PAs conserve habitats. PAs have proved to be more suc- cessful at protecting wildlife habitats than conserving large mammal populations. This is because it is easier to apprehend and punish a farmer expanding his agriculture into a park than a hunter who may be operating illegally at night. Con- versely, once farmers or herders have established their pres- ence in a park, it may be harder to evict them because squatters can quickly establish political rights to protection. \u2022 PAs have mixed success at conserving species. The level of protection that PAs afford wildlife species depends on the quality of management, which in turn is closely linked to the level of financial investment in parks. Most countries in South- ern Africa need to raise their annual investment in PAs if they wish to conserve wildlife and create opportunities for eco- tourism and sustainable resource use. \u2022 Public-private partnerships for failing parks. Failed parks with little investment and weak wildlife institutions suffer from agricultural settlement and wildlife collapse. The most successful management option in such cases comes from public-private partnerships in park management with the pri- vate involvement of experienced companies and NGOs. \u2022 Transfrontier approach. The transfrontier approach to con- servation has been accompanied by a conceptual shift away from strictly protected national parks towards greater empha- sis on multiple resource use by local communities. Although the approach suffers from bureaucratic delays and problems on the ground, it has been embraced by African leaders. \u2022 Research and monitoring services. Park ecosystems respond to both internal changes, such as disease outbreaks, fire and vegetation succession, and to external changes, including species introductions, climate change and surrounding land- use change. As the pace of change quickens, there is an even greater need for high quality research and monitoring services to devise and manage effective conservation responses. \u2022 Management information systems. Ranger-based manage- ment information systems make use of GPS and Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping software to give spatial information on poaching, wildlife signs and ranger efforts. Two examples are MIST 48 and SMART 49 . 4.1.2 Trade and wildlife products \u2022 Conservation can be assisted by sustainable use and legal trade. Classic examples are the trade in crocodile skins and vicu\u00f1a wool. Use tends to be sustainable when the landholder has the full rights to the species; it tends not to be sustainable when products are harvested by bodies that do not have a direct stake in the resource. This approach to conservation requires close monitoring and tight management but can be highly successful. \u2022 Markets for ivory and rhino horn. Increased prices of prod- ucts in existing markets for ivory and rhino horn in China and Southeast Asia have overwhelmed trade restrictions and law enforcement measures to fuel a new wave of ele- phant and rhino poaching. It is not possible at present to provide close monitoring and tight management of elephant and rhino populations, or their products, in most of Africa. This means that benefits from the legal trade in ivory and rhino horn are restricted to a small handful of countries in Southern Africa. Legal trade from countries in Southern Africa will almost certainly have adverse effects on the black markets for ivory and rhino horn (procured from wild ani- mals in other parts of Africa) as it opens the door to endless scams. Nevertheless, the possibility of sharing benefits from legal trade with other rhino-range states with different national policies should be investigated. \u2022 EU beef subsidies. Subsidies granted by the European Union for beef imports have proved destructive of migratory wildlife ecosystems. >4 _ Lessons learned and promising approaches ( 48 ) Management Information System.

        "| 67 #1 Lessons learned and promising approaches 4.1.3 Community-based natural resource management and conservancies \u2022 Private conservancies. Devolution of wildlife rights from government ownership has benefited wildlife populations on private land through the establishment of wildlife conservan- cies that exploit trophy-hunting and tourism opportunities. \u2022 Communal conservancies. Lessons from Namibia\u2019s conserv- ancy programme include the following: decentralisation can bring benefits to wildlife and local economies; targeting the poor to achieve greater equity takes work; land tenure for conservancies remains a challenge; local conservancy com- mittees need to be fully accountable; and building mature institutions takes time. \u2022 Some limitations. In general, CBNRM works less well in regions where population pressure on land is high and gov- ernance is weak. Even with favourable conditions, there have been multiple cases of mismanagement, fraud and relatively dysfunctional collective governance at the local level, all of which emphasises the difficulty in establishing transparent collective local government institutions 50 . Nevertheless, there are few alternatives to sustainable resource use in these set- tings and CBNRM will play a vital role in the long-term con- servation of African wildlife. One particular problematic area of conservation in the region that requires successful CBNRM governance is the decline in miombo forests in rural areas and the unsustainable production of charcoal. 4.1.4 Wildlife migration and disease management \u2022 Veterinary cordon fencing. It is widely acknowledged that veterinary cordon fencing has been environmentally damag- ing, especially in relation to wildlife migration. Two interna- tional organisations are mandated by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to provide the standards for food safety and trade in animal commodities and products: the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in Paris, which employs the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (TAHC), and the Codex Alimentarius Commission, which operates under the United Nations\u2019 World Health Organisation and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Many countries have adopted the former TAHC standards, which require strict separation of uninfected cloven-hoofed animals from potentially affected populations, usually through fencing. \u2022 Commodity-based trade. There is a new willingness in both the conservation and livestock sectors of Southern Africa to look again at the issue of fencing and to seek environmentally sensitive alternatives for controlling disease. The alternative Codex Alimentarius standards are non-geographic and founded exclusively on management of the risk posed by specific products destined for human consumption. It is referred to as a commodity-based trade approach. The FAO has recently contributed to this approach by providing guide- lines for the risk management of animal diseases along value chains (from \u2018farm to fork\u2019). Part of the methodology relies on abattoir-based prevention. For instance, deboning and the removal of lymph nodes from beef renders it a \u2018very safe\u2019 ( 50 ) Abensperg-Traun M., D.

There is an opportunity to jointly develop environmentally sensitive disease control measures that include a number of control measures: (a) commodity-based trade; (b) use of geograph- ical barriers, such as mountains, lakes and unsuitable habitats to achieve natural separation of livestock from potential wild- life carriers of disease; (c) vaccines; and (d) certain kinds of control of livestock movements 52 . 4.1.5 Networks and sharing skills \u2022 Networked approaches aid conservation. A number of dis- parate networked approaches to wildlife conservation in Southern Africa have potential. A small sample includes the CAPE partnership for conservation of the Cape Floristic Region, the Namibian Association of CBNRM Support Organ- isations (NASCO) and WEN-SA. With regard to rhino, the SADC Rhino Management Group encourages the direct sharing of knowledge on rhino issues. There is a need for sharing intel- ligence information to assist in breaking transnational crim- inal networks. 4.2 Promising approaches 4.2.1 Transfrontier conservation areas 4.2.1.1 Background The transfrontier conservation area is a relatively new conserva- tion paradigm making its debut in Africa with the first Peace Park in 1990. It is defined by the Southern African Development Community\u2019s (SADC) Protocol on Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement as: \u2026 the area, or component of a large ecological region, that straddles the boundaries of two or more countries, encom- passing one or more protected areas as well as multiple resources use areas \u2026 The TFCA is a significant new conservation initiative that com- bines policies on wildlife conservation, community development and the promotion of culture and peace under one roof. It brings together a complex and diverse mosaic of land uses under one shared or joint management structure. It was given an early endorsement by the late Nelson Mandela, former President of South Africa and patron of the Peace Parks Foundation: \u2018I know of no political movement, no philosophy, no ideology, which does not agree with the peace parks concept as we see it going into fruition today. It is a concept that can be embraced by all.\u2019 ( 51 ) Thomson G.R., M-L. Penrith, M.W. Atkinson, S. Thalwitzer, A. Mancuso, S.J. Atkinson and S.A. Osofsky (2013b).

Seretse Khama Ian Khama (Botswana), His Majesty King Letsie III (Lesotho), His Majesty King Mswati III (Swaziland), President Robert Mugabe (Zimbabwe), President Hifikepunye Pohamba (Namibia) and President Jacob Zuma (South Africa). The 15 member countries of SADC have now taken the lead in the formal designation, establishment and political recognition of TFCAs in Africa. With strong political support, TFCAs are increasingly being embraced at all levels of society \u2013 local com- munities, governments, conservation and tourism organisations, bilateral and multilateral aid agencies, the private sector and NGOs 53 . As of 31 May 2013, SADC had 18 existing and potential TFCAs in various stages of development (Figure 19). The TFCAs range in size from the Chimanimani TFCA of 2 056 km 2 (number 10 on the map) to the Kavango-Zambezi (KAZA) TFCA of c. 520 000 km 2 (number 3 on the map). As of May 2013, all 18 TFCAs covered an area of 1 006 170 km 2 . Information on the sizes and other key features, such as the number of protected areas, number of corridors, human population density, and pres- ence of private and/or communal-land conservancies, of 14 of these TFCAs is presented in Table 8. The potential for expansion of the TFCA conceptual approach is pan-African, as illustrated by the map of transfrontier areas in Africa (Figure 20). Not all sites illustrated have formal joint-man- agement arrangements. Many NGOs are assisting with TFCA development. The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), together with its partner, the Conservation Ecology Research Unit at the University of Pretoria, South Africa (CERU), uses an eco- logical network approach, which essentially bridges the gap between a traditional national parks approach and a very broad transfrontier conservation approach. Ecological networks may come together to form TFCAs. Figure 19. Location of 18 TFCAs in SADC, July 2015 ( 53 ) Hanks, J. and W. Myburgh (2014). Chapter 9.

This enables more effective con- servation, more efficient use of natural resources, and greater social and economic involvement of communities. Five levels of TFCA management can be recognised. \u2022 Landscape management for migration Conservation at the landscape scale owes much to the appli- cation of island biogeography theory. Wildlife corridors are widely advocated as the best way to link fragmented ecosys- tems or isolated habitats in order to re-establish ecosystem connectivity. However, the success of these schemes relies heavily on animals moving either permanently or seasonally between the connected areas. Until recently it was assumed that restoring migrations that had collapsed following the con- struction of fences would prove difficult. Recent evidence indi- cates that old migratory routes can be re-established by medium-sized herbivores relatively quickly once physical bar- riers have been removed 56 . The use of environmentally sensi- tive measures for controlling livestock diseases will enable fences to be removed within TFCAs, allowing wildlife migrations to be reinstated. \u2022 Landscape management for the development of livelihoods Conservation management at the scale of the landscape aims to take a holistic approach, looking not just at biodiversity issues but also at the local economy, agriculture, eco-tourism, and the social and health benefits of the environment. Much of this economic growth can be associated with nature-based or wildlife-based tourism, including photo-safari operations and safari hunting. Travel and tourism is the fastest growing industry in the world. It is the foremost job creator of all industries within the SADC region where it is well placed to maximise foreign exchange earnings and provide new jobs in areas where there is high unemployment, a relatively unskilled labour force and few alternative sources of employment. Creating easier access for tourists to the various constituent areas making up the TFCA will facilitate regional job crea- tion 57 . Emphasis will be given to land-use planning to mini- mise conflicts and maximise synergy for development. \u2022 Water basin management for conservation and development Wildlife ecosystems are often part of even larger hydro- ecological systems. The TFCA approach has an important role in contributing to River Basin Management Plans and can play a vital part in protecting water-dependent natural ecosystems. \u2022 Protected areas management In much of Africa, conservation is undermined by poor quality park management that comes about because of inadequate budgets and a lack of suitably qualified and motivated staff. A TFCA has the potential to earn considerably greater revenue from increased tourism than if each of the protected areas continue to operate in isolation. If this increased revenue is ploughed back into the areas concerned, then park budgets should be adequate for improved management 57 . \u2022 Promotion of culture and peace Civil unrest, which has characterised the life of millions of people in many parts of Africa, has a better chance of being reduced when \u2018peace parks\u2019 are fully operational. The sur- rounding communities from a diverse range of nations and cultures are given a new opportunity to cooperate and pro- mote a wide range of economic benefits from within the TFCAs. An active commitment to promote a culture of peace and demilitarisation in these sensitive areas has obvious benefits for all partner countries 57 . In the marginal drier areas of Southern Africa, TFCA development is one of the very few options that offers improved standards of living in the rural community. Perhaps the greatest achievement of TFCAs is the potential it provides for raising the intrinsic value of biodiversity in African society. In the past, conservation policy has had little legitimacy in the eyes of the leaders of African states or in those of rural people. TFCAs present wildlife in an exciting new light that is integral to the economics of land-use and vital to the livelihoods of rural people. The transfrontier approach is the one conservation policy in Africa that tries to address multiple issues. It is for these reasons that TFCAs have the potential to spearhead the introduction of a new national commitment to wildlife conservation across Africa. ( 56 ) Bartlam-Brooks H.L.A., M.C.

        "| 73 #1 Lessons learned and promising approaches #1 4.2.1.3 Governance and TFCAs SADC Member States and the SADC Secretariat have gone to great lengths over the past decade to prepare the political basis for cross-border cooperation with regard to natural resources management. A number of regional strategies and programmes, including the Regional TFCA Programme have been developed with the help of German development cooperation to implement SADC Protocols on Forestry, Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement. In these strategies and programmes, Member States have identified the priority areas for cross-border cooper- ation that provide the basis for donor support to SADC. SADC is well positioned to assist Member States in agreeing on transfrontier conservation area boundaries and their operations and maintenance. Some of the key issues addressed by SADC regarding transfrontier conservation areas include: \u2022 harmonisation of resource mobilisation, policies and enforcement; \u2022 promotion of partnerships between public and private sectors; \u2022 assessment of capacity building needs. A criticism frequently voiced over TFCAs is that they suffer from an overly bureaucratic top-down management model which is preventing progress. In fact, TFCA governance cannot be the same for every TFCA as the ecological circumstances, government sit- uations and goals of establishment are quite distinct. The most suitable cross-border governance structure will depend on the nature of disturbances. Within a country as well, some actions will work best from the national level and others at a provincial level, some at a policy level and others at a bureaucratic level, some from within the parks and others from outside 58 . Designing and implementing institutional arrangements such as these is difficult and will take knowledge, experience and time. It will also require an adaptive governance approach which can facilitate adjustment to institutions and refinement of policies. Fortunately, considerable experience in TFCA development and in training wildlife managers has been gained by SADC through the implementation of its regional strategies and programmes in cross-border cooperation over the past ten years, again with the assistance of German development cooperation. This expe- rience will play a vital role in designing regional programmes for wildlife conservation (Box 4). In designing a support programme for TFCAs (Section 5.1), gov- ernance needs to be programmed at three levels: (a) site-level governance is concerned with institutions representing the pro- tected areas and surrounding communities and landholders; (b) country-level support will provide assistance for government institutions to enable reforms and capacity-strengthening at national level; and (c) regional-level support will assist SADC and NEPAD in offering legal and policy expertise to Member States.

It covers an area of c. 520 000 km 2 \u2013 an area larger than that of Zimbabwe and four times the size of Malawi. The Victoria Falls forms a well-known central point in the TFCA and is near the meeting point of four of the five participating countries (Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe). Two major river basins, the Zambezi and the Okavango, contribute major wet- lands, including the Okavango Swamps, to the generally flat-to- gently undulating landscapes. KAZA also encompasses large areas of the Miombo-Mopane and the Kalahari-Namib Wilderness Areas (Figure 21). There are more than 70 protected areas within the KAZA TFCA that range in size from 19 km 2 (Victoria Falls National Park) to 22 000 km 2 (Kafue National Park). These protected areas cover a range of types and purposes: from strict national parks under state control (of which there are 17) to multiple-use areas under community management 59 . The Mosi-oa-Tunya/ Victoria Falls is a World Heritage Site and the Okavango Delta has also been recently been listed as one. KAZA provides one of the last true wilderness regions in Africa where migratory wildlife populations can move across interna- tional borders between their wet and dry season ranges. The northern conservation area (NCA) of Botswana is a vast wilder- ness made up of national parks and wildlife management areas totalling an area of > 80 000 km 2 , which supports the largest elephant population on earth of around 150 000 - 200 000 indi- viduals. In addition, the NCA supports four distinct zebra migra- tions 60 ; (RWS Fynn pers. comm.). Many buffalo herds forage in the woodlands on the Botswana side during the wet season but move across the border into the Namibian side of the Linyanti Swamps during the dry season 61 . Similarly, most of the Chobe River front\u2019s zebra population relies upon floodplains on the Namibian side. Additionally, collared ele- phant herds move from Botswana, through Namibia and well into Angola (Mike Chase, unpublished data). The region carries two globally threatened large mammals (black rhinoceros and wild dog), several endemic species of plants, reptiles and amphibians, one endemic mammal and one endemic bird species. The TFCA includes a human population in the region 1.5 million people but large areas carry population densities of less than five people per km 2 . \u2303 Elephants drinking in the Chobe River, Botswana.

And the primary objectives are to: a. \u2018Foster trans-national collaboration and co-operation in imple- menting ecosystems and cultural resource management; b. Promote alliances in the management of biological and cul- tural resources and encourage social, economic and other partnerships among their Governments and stakeholders; c. Enhance ecosystem integrity and natural ecological processes by harmonizing natural resources management approaches and tourism development across international boundaries; d. Develop mechanisms and strategies for local communities to participate meaningfully in, and tangibly benefit from, the TFCA; and e. Promote cross-border tourism as a means of fostering regional socio-economic development.\u2019 The following four \u2018large-scale\u2019 priorities require reform, support and investment: 1. Water flows and wetlands The centrepiece of the KAZA TFCA is its wetlands. These are focal areas for a large proportion of the human population residing in the TFCA. The areas support a wide range of important wet- land-dependent species and play a key role in the region\u2019s tourism development. But the wetlands within KAZA are vulnerable, not only because of impending climate change but also because they depend on water derived from distant highlands. These are large- scale, multi-faceted and complex issues that will require invest- ment and long-term commitment by governments, donors, NGOs and civil society 62 . 2. Natural resource governance The dominant form of land use in the KAZA TFCA is subsistence agriculture under communal tenure in nutrient-poor, mostly semi- arid systems. The potentially rich biodiversity of the area and its wetlands are undervalued, mostly because those living on the land are unable to realise the full value and benefits of this rich heritage. This is very largely a result of inappropriate institutions governing resource access rights and benefit streams, and asso- ciated mismatches between social and ecological scales. The success of the KAZA TFCA as a conservation and development initiative rests squarely on the extent to which rural communities will benefit from wildlife-based land uses. Reforms in tenure and resource access rights will be crucial to the sustainability of the KAZA TFCA 62 . 3. Biodiversity linkages and conservation planning The broad-scale southwest-northeast rainfall and biodiversity gradients in the KAZA region indicate how habitats may change along these gradients under climate change. Associated with these projected changes will be the need to maintain \u2018adaptive response corridors\u2019 along these biodiversity gradients. Investment and support is required for development of conservation assess- ment and planning in KAZA 62 . 4. Information and participatory science Little information that is sound and up to date is available and accessible on a wide range of topics for the KAZA TFCA. Major gaps that need to be filled include the current distribution and status of plant and vertebrate taxa throughout the TFCA, but particularly in Angola and Zambia. The status of the few endem- ics, particularly the herpetofauna, urgently needs to be assessed. Information on protected areas (check lists, numbers or status, distribution, habitats, budgets, staff levels, etc.) is not generally available. The setting-up of an open, web-based but quality con- trolled \u2018Wiki\u2019 directory on the protected areas in the KAZA region may assist in filling many of the gaps. Similar gaps exist in the information base on forest areas and on ecosystem services throughout the KAZA region. The development of a more partici- patory culture between governments, NGOs, the private sector, universities and research departments, and the range of stake- holders living within the TFCA is urgently needed 62 . The signing of a MoU by five participating countries to establish KAZA TFCA provides a unique window of opportunity through which to explore and develop innovative approaches to conser- vation in large landscapes in the region. This is an opportunity that should be seized by all involved and supported by the inter- national community. 4.2.1.6 Constraints on development of TFCAs The potential of TFCAs as a driving force behind conservation and natural resource-based livelihoods is easily appreciated; bringing this vision to fruition is a much harder task. Most TFCAs in South- ern Africa are situated in marginal land in terms of productivity and services. Were it not so, these areas would long ago have been settled and used for agriculture. Without change, the future may be one of increased conflict and marginalisation of the inhabitants. On the other hand, these areas might give rise to diverse natural resource-based enterprises that enrich the lives of residents. It has been shown that the most profitable form of land-use in the TFCAs is a combination of wildlife-based tourism and full diversification of natural resource-based enterprises.

        "| 79 #1 Lessons learned and promising approaches #1 The various enterprises include non-consumptive tourism, safari hunting, the sustainable harvesting of meat, crafts and non-tim- ber forest products, and the provision of ecosystem services such as water and carbon sequestration. The bottom line is that unless those living in marginal areas benefit from conserving wild natural resources, TFCAs are unlikely to work as sustainable multiple-use zones. Not only that, but the long-term future of the core protected areas and their large mammal populations is likely to be compromised 63 . A recent assessment of conservation and development in TFCAs found that many of the core protected areas were inadequately funded and faced ongoing declines in several large mammals; at the same time, the integration of agriculture and natural resource management was problematic 64 . A number of constraints were holding back progress significantly. They operated at three scales: the first scale, or level, was that of international laws and conventions, and national management capacities; the second level was at the TFCA-scale and included those constraints that confronted resource managers; the third scale was at the local level, within TFCAs, at the wildlife-live- stock-human interface. 4.2.2 Public-private partnerships for park management Through partnerships with wildlife authorities, African Parks Net- work and other non-state actors take on the primary responsi- bility for managing protected areas. In the southern region, African Parks is currently managing Bangweulu Wetlands and Liuwa Plain National Park in Zambia and Majete Wildlife Reserve in Malawi. Frankfurt Zoological Society is operational manager of the North Luangwa National Park and surrounding GMAs where they are developing resource protection, institutional mechanisms, gov- ernance arrangements and a revenue-sharing policy for wildlife management in the community areas. They assist with law enforcement and park management in Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe. In Mozambique, the civil society has entered into partnership with the government for co-managing PAs, either NGOs or private companies: three notable NGOs co-manage PAs with the govern- ment authorities, in historical order: Peace Park Foundation in Limpopo National Park; Carr Foundation in Gorongoza National Park; IGF Foundation in Gil\u00e9 National Reserve. Also, a much greater number of private companies (usually Mozambican com- panies in partnership with foreign companies) co-manage the government authorities\u2019 different categories of officially gazetted PAs for tourism hunting: so-called coutadas or hunting areas gazetted for hunting since colonial time before NPs; hunting blocks, which are newly created PAs for hunting either within or outside national reserves; so-called Fazendas de Bravio or game ( 63 ) Cumming D.H.M., V.

The Wildlife Conservation Society co-manages Niassa Reserve in northern Mozambique with the Ministry of Tourism. 4.2.3 Conservancies In many parts of Southern Africa, a large fraction of the human inhabitants are poor, rural, semi-subsistence agriculturalists who depend heavily on natural resources for their livelihoods, includ- ing wildlife, wood products such as firewood and charcoal, non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and water. These conditions have led to the development of institutions and programmes supporting community-based natural resource management and sustainable uses of natural resources, such as CAMPFIRE in Zimbabwe, ADMADE in Zambia, NRMP-Botswana, and Namibia\u2019s communal conservancies, including the Living in a Finite Environ- ment (LIFE) project 65 (Section 3.1.5). Their aim has been to provide a regulatory framework to enable communities and investment partners to commit to wildlife busi- ness and enterprises that are based on sustainable management of natural resources. In the case of Namibia\u2019s conservancies, lessons were learned from CAMPFIRE and ADMADE, and a delib- erate effort was made to avoid predetermined administrative boundaries. This helped to reinforce the devolution of wild- life-user rights and benefits to the community level. The first four communal conservancies were registered in 1998; a little over a decade later, 64 registered conservancies serve one in four rural Namibians. The total income from CBNRM to rural Namibians had grown to well over NAD 42 million in 2009. As mentioned in Section 4.1.3, there have been many cases of mismanagement of CBNRMs and dysfunctional governance. The work can be difficult and results may not be achieved overnight but ultimately CBNRM is about increased democracy, improved governance and increased local rights. 4.2.4 Awareness raising One of the goals of wildlife conservation in Southern Africa is to develop a land ethic in society that is centred on the sustainable use of natural resources, and an appreciation of cultural and aesthetic values of biodiversity. Awareness-raising programmes inform the public about wildlife values and issues by tailoring information, interpretative materials and media communications at specific sectors of society. The key to this approach is to under- stand the needs of each sector. 4.2.4.1 Access to protected areas The great majority of African children know almost nothing about the national parks or wildlife of their country. Even if they live near to a national park, few can afford the entry fees. For children who are citizens and aged between 5 and 16, the price of entry to South African parks is ZAR 15-35 (EUR 1.10-2.70). It is similar in Eastern Africa where entry to Kenyan parks is KES 200 (EUR 1.70). Yet a typical rural child might not even have KES 10 to spend. This entry fee obviously excludes the cost of transport and accommodation costs. This barrier contributes to a lack of aware- ness of wildlife values. In combination with rural poverty, it is an effective training for generation after generation of poachers. Information on wildlife that is on offer in African schools (if indeed there is any on offer) does not address this problem and it tends to be disconnected from people\u2019s real lives. This is particularly apparent in rural locations as the school curriculum often promotes suburban and materialistic values which have most relevance to children of the emerging middle classes. A boy from the rural community aged eight today will be 20 by the time this wildlife strategy has been fully implemented. By that time he will probably be a hunter and may well be tempted to poach wildlife. 4.2.4.2 Wildlife education Lack of awareness about wildlife heritage extends to the educated and political classes. Only a minority, mainly wildlife professionals and bird enthusiasts, are well informed about wildlife issues and express strong interest in wild animals. Unfortunately this indiffer- ence to wildlife heritage has extended in the past to political lead- ers who, with a few notable exceptions, seldom express much interest in wildlife heritage or consider the environment in their development plans 66 . Without political leadership on wildlife con- servation, corruption has become a major force across the conti- nent; it undermines environmental equity and destroys ecosystems. Conservation projects keep failing because of this dual issue (indif- ference and corruption). Many factors contribute but inadequate education, understanding and positive role models at an early age are surely key factors. Nevertheless, there are indications of a new vision of wildlife and biodiversity emerging in Southern Africa and other regions that recognise the value of wildlife and wild ecosystems to African society (Box 5). There are also signs that governments wish to integrate wildlife into their national and regional devel- opment plans. ( 65 ) http://www.nacso.org.na/what_is_cbnrm.php ( 66 ) UNEP (2003).

        "| 83 #1 Lessons learned and promising approaches An effective education in conservation imparts knowledge and know-how on wildlife and its management. It can teach children about the place wildlife has in nature and the role of nature in providing services \u2013 including ecosystems, food chains and the web of life. It can also teach about practical and economic uses of wildlife in rural communities, sustainable and unsustainable forms of use, methods to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts, aesthetics, and the part that wild animals play in cultural traditions and the tourism industry. Conservation education can continue from pri- mary level to high school. Education in wildlife can also be rein- forced by wildlife clubs and sponsored visits to protected areas. 4.2.4.3 Wildlife clubs The creative enterprise shown by wildlife education programmes is extraordinary: travelling theatres from South Africa, singers from Mali, art competitions, story-telling, school visits from Europe or elsewhere, meet-the-ranger days, and so forth. The wildlife clubs around a TFCA or national park can be linked through joint park visits, competitions and get-togethers. There can be national club days and other events. The underlying prin- ciple is simple: if greed, ignorance and carelessness are the underlying drivers of biodiversity decline, then an education pro- gramme that fosters awareness, understanding and care has to be one of the main tools in preventing biodiversity declining over the long term. 4.2.5 Council of Elders for the Environment (CEE) Africa has its own powerful social mechanism for countering antisocial behaviour that is based on meetings of elders. This cultural tradition could be organised in the service of a land ethic to provide a sustainable use of natural resources and the con- servation of wildlife heritage. The CEE brings elders and leaders together in a circle, as in a traditional village meeting, where anyone can speak and be heard. Its purpose will be to increase transparency of land- and resource-based decisions, and allow a greater opportunity for communities (at grassroots level) to air their issues and listen to the environmental case. Councils will convene at multiple levels from district to national and regional levels but with a focus on TFCAs and protected areas. Adopting a traditional open and inclusive style of discussion, the main purpose of the Council of Elders will be to come up with a genuine land and wildlife ethic that matches the expectations and needs of people in rural communities, and which reflects a broader perspective than that of the market economy alone. The strategy envisages a programme of awareness-raising that casts light on the main social drivers underlying the wildlife crisis: poverty combined with lack of opportunity in rural communities and indifference in educated and political classes arising from their historic exclusion from parks and loss of cultural traditions (Section 5.5). \u2303 Young members of a conservation club visiting Liuwa Plain National Park, Zambia.

        "86 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Southern Africa In parts of Southern Africa, the rural population is beginning to view national parks and wildlife with a sense of pride, thanks to enlightened land-use policies that provide com- munities with certain resource rights. Many wildlife professionals in the region view the \u2018conservation of wildlife\u2019 and \u2018rural eco- nomic development\u2019 as synergistic and co-dependent on sustain- able management of natural resources. In developing this strategic approach to long-term wildlife con- servation, arguments have been presented that justify the need to focus support on world-class management services for a small number of Key Conservation Areas (KCAs). A Key Landscape for Conservation (KLC) should have the capacity to sustain viable populations of large African wildlife species within a functioning ecosystem. At the same time, it should act as a focus for devel- oping the rural economy through the sustainable use of natural resources. A suitable network of KLCs has the potential to protect the well-known wildlife species of the region within natural eco- systems and to stimulate rural economic growth. The TFCA approach explored in Section 4 encompasses this dual concept for KLCs. It recognises that conservation-related indus- tries within TFCAs are likely to have higher economic returns than agricultural activities in many parts of the region. Furthermore, by cultivating a context for socio-economic engagement with wildlife, it offers the prospect of a resurgence of a culturally creative, wildlife heritage that is uniquely African. The outline of a plan to develop TFCAs for integrated socio- economic and wildlife conservation benefits is presented in Sec- tion 5.1. Other components of the strategic approach are then given: conserving independent conservation areas of outstanding value (Section 5.2); reforming wildlife institutions (Section 5.3); countering poaching and dismantling wildlife networks (Section 5.4); and reforming education and raising awareness (Section 5.5). 5.1 Key Landscapes for Conservation: (i) TFCAs Many transfrontier conservation areas are ideal candidates for selection as KLCs. Support for TFCAs that are selected will take place at three levels: \u2022 site-level support will target the protected areas and sur- rounding communities; \u2022 country-level support will provide assistance for government institutions to enable reforms and capacity-strengthening; \u2022 regional-level support will assist SADC and NEPAD in offering legal and policy expertise to Member States wishing to con- serve wildlife and develop natural resources within the TFCA framework. The following conservation actions for developing TFCAs as Key Landscapes for Conservation are recommended. 5.1.1 Site level This support is aimed at the conservation areas and their sur- rounding communities. 5.1.1.1 Selection of Key Landscapes for Conservation TFCAs have been adopted as a model for the development of conservation areas in the Southern African region in recognition of the opportunity they offer for ecosystem-scale conservation, integrated CBNRM and cultural engagement with wildlife. Selec- tion amongst TFCAs for inclusion in the list of KLCs in Southern Africa will depend on the match with ecological, socio-economic and conservation criteria (Box 6). A suitable procedure will bring together independent experts and country representatives in SADC to prioritise KLCs from a list of candidate areas. Sugges- tions for TFCAs that could be included in this KLC list are given in Table 9 and their locations are indicated in Figure 22. >5 _ Indicative conservation actions ",

Criteria for identifying Key Landscapes for Conservation KLCs \u2013 Key Landscapes for Conservation are areas recognised to be of global wildlife importance with intact ecosystems that are capable of sustaining wildlife populations in the face of increasing isolation from other similar areas. The following criteria are a guide to identifying potential new KLCs. It is not necessary for all criteria to apply to any one candidate KLC; also possession of one or more criteria does not automatically qualify an area as a KLC. \u2022 Established as a transfrontier conservation area or in the process of formal development as a TFCA. \u2022 Recognised as a World Heritage Site for its global (scientific) importance. \u2022 Protects a functioning ecosystem with viable wildlife populations in the face of increasing isolation caused by an expanding rural population. \u2022 Protects a globally important dry-season concentration area for wildlife populations together with their wet-season dispersal zones. \u2022 Protects a long-distance terrestrial wildlife migration, or the range occupied historically by such a migration where there is opportunity to recover that migration though barrier removals. \u2022 Protects an important populations of free-ranging elephants in Southern Africa. \u2022 Protects an important population of African black rhino or Southern white rhino. \u2022 Protects a key population (as rated by the appropriate IUCN SSC specialist group) of one or more of the other large African wildlife species, including predators, primates and ungulates, which are categorised as endangered or vulnerable according to IUCN Red List Criteria. Particular attention should be given to species that typically occur at low density and/or occupy large home ranges, and which consequently require large and intact ecosystems for sustaining their free-ranging populations. \u2022 Protects an important wintering ground for Palearctic bird migrants (e.g. wetlands recognised as Important Bird Areas. \u2022 Protects a regionally important hotspot of endemism and diversity that requires ecosystem-scale (versus microhabitat-scale) protection. \u2022 Contains wildlife landscapes of exceptional scenic interest. \u2022 Protects a watershed or aquifer that has direct conservation benefit through tight linkages with downstream water-dependent ecosystems that are themselves of global importance. \u2022 Plays a vital role in sustaining a key natural resource, such as a fishery or source of freshwater, that has critical national importance through public, commercial, recreational, artisanal or subsistence use. \u2303 High peaks of the Drakensberg mountains, Royal Natal National Park, South Africa.

        "92 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Southern Africa 5.1.1.2 Elements of support for KLCs There are five elements of support that will be provided at each site 67 . i. Protected area management This element will raise the capacity of park management to (a) conserve wildlife and wildlife habitats, (b) undertake sur- veillance and intelligence work, (c) enforce the law, (d) liaise with communities and assist them with their wildlife man- agement issues, including human-wildlife conflicts, (e) liaise with private, community and state-owned tour operators, assisting them with information about wildlife and park reg- ulations, and (f) monitor species, wildlife habitats, conserva- tion threats and internal staff performance, and manage information systems. ii. Landscape management for conservation This element will raise the capacity of park management to assist in planning and implementing wildlife management at the landscape level (including areas surrounding protected areas), by the establishment of wildlife corridors, restoration of animal migration, decommissioning of fenced barriers, and liaison with community representatives over the manage- ment of livestock grazing and watering, wildlife disease trans- mission and other human-wildlife conflicts. iii. Landscape management for livelihoods This element will assist with establishing and overseeing conservancies on private and communal lands. Private: One of the most important aspects of conservancies on private land is the removal of internal fences between properties accompanied by joint management of land and wildlife resources. The amalgamation of ex-livestock farms and other properties into conservancies potentially generates greater landscape heterogeneity and connectivity. Landown- ers will be assisted with information and advice on conser- vation, wildlife ecology, eco-tourism and legal issues. Communal: Communities will be provided with long-term training in many aspects of CBNRM, including natural resource governance, wildlife conservation, human-wildlife conflict and land-use conflicts, such as the overlapping with mining per- mits, livestock disease, ecotourism, safari hunting, business start-up, business management, administration of commu- nity institutions and legal issues. Start-up support will be given to a number of approved CBNRM programmes. iv. KLC/TFCA governance Institutional development in some parks and TFCAs has strug- gled operationally because of the top-down imposition of park management on local-level communities and officials. From a more favourable angle, the same top-down park man- agement has enabled the bridging of international boundaries and greater policy-level cooperation. This fourth element of ( 67 ) In planning for site development, allowance should be made for there being fewer resources available within lower capacity countries (such as Lesotho, Mozambique and Zambia) to establish and maintain TFCAs and other KLCs. \u2303 A young woman of the San or Bushman people, indigenous hunter-gatherers of the Kalahari desert.

        "| 93 #1 Indicative conservation actions support will provide managers with a wider context in which to understand the needs of the different parties and determine the optimum structure of KLC/TFCA institutions. It will also be of assistance to the overall institutional reform process in the country (Section 5.1.2) and contribute to greater operational cooperation in the governance of TFCAs and other PAs. Support will be provided for the establishment of a Council of Elders for the Environment at each site. v. Awareness raising This element will establish wildlife clubs in the schools of the surrounding communities and assist with awareness-raising through training, information, materials, publications, com- munications, visits to the protected areas, activities, events, competitions and meetings. This is the site-based element of the Awareness Raising and Communication Programme, which is outlined in Section 5.5. 5.1.1.3 KAZA TFCA The Kavango-Zambezi transfrontier conservation area is so exceptional in terms of its size, natural resources and wildlife that it warrants an exceptional programme of support over the long term. The high-level objective of this programme is to develop governance and adaptive management systems for KAZA TFCA that facilitate international cooperation and ensure fully operational transfrontier conservation, transboundary natural resource management, ecosystem conservation and sustainable rural development 68 . More details of the programme of support for KAZA are given in Section 4.2.1.5. It will comprise the following components 69 : i. maintain and manage the shared natural and cultural herit- age resources and biodiversity of the KAZA TFCA; ii. promote and facilitate the development of a complementary network of protected areas linked through corridors to safe- guard migratory wildlife species; iii. provide opportunities, facilities and infrastructure to transform the KAZA TFCA into a premier tourist destination in Africa; iv. facilitate tourism across international borders in the KAZA TFCA; v. enhance sustainable use of natural and cultural heritage resources to improve the livelihoods of local communities and reduce poverty; vi. facilitate public-private-community partnerships, private investment and regional economic integration; ( 68 ) KfW Development Bank currently supports KAZA on behalf of Germany\u2019s Federal Government. ( 69 ) These components are identified in the KAZA TFCA Treaty. \u2303 Traditional spear fishing in Liuwa Plain National Park, Zambia.

Policy and legal reforms Reforms to policy and law are required in most countries of Southern Africa to support rural development through the man- agement of natural resources by rural communities and private landowners. The reform process in each country will receive support and guidance from the regional level (Section 5.1.3). ii. Institutional strengthening of key government wildlife departments Traditional wildlife departments require new structures, staff- ing and training in support of a new dual role in wildlife conservation and community management of natural resources. Training will be given in the regulation of wildlife businesses established by community and business-sector partners. Institutional strengthening will incorporate specific training in KLC/TFCA governance (including land-use conflicts and environmental governance), and in international relations. iii. Awareness raising and communication Raising awareness of KLCs, natural resource management, wildlife conservation and ecotourism will be supported through national-level programmes. A support unit will be established within wildlife departments to launch pro- grammes in the following: \u2022 wildlife clubs (initially in the vicinity of TFCAs); \u2022 KLC/TFCA information using multiple media; \u2022 establishing an Environmental Council of Elders at each TFCA; \u2022 developing and testing an environmental module for teach- ing on wildlife conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources at primary and secondary school levels in participation with environmental education partners. \u2303 African wild dog with neonate impala, southern carmine bee-eaters and leopard in South Luangwa National Park, Zambia.

        "| 95 #1 Indicative conservation actions 5.1.3 Regional level The KLC/TFCA approach requires key reforms in national laws to give landholders and rural communities the right to manage wild- life and woodlands for their own benefit. Individual country reforms can take many years or decades to achieve. The most effective approach will be to offer the relevant expertise at regional and pan-African levels. i. SADC TFCA Joint Programme to enable legal frameworks This programme will be established with SADC for the pur- pose of communicating to Member States the need for reforms in resource rights and land tenure. It will provide advice and practical assistance in harmonising relevant leg- islation, policies and approaches in natural and cultural resource management across international borders within the KLC/TFCA context. ii. NEPAD TFCA Joint Programme to enable legal frameworks A sister programme will be established within NEPAD so that individual African states are encouraged to adopt TFCAs and the linked land-reforms as a way of implementing NEPAD. 5.2 Key Landscapes for Conservation: (ii) Independent Conservation Areas Many areas of outstanding importance and value for wildlife do not lie on the boundaries but entirely within the central confines of African states. Examples in Southern Africa include the Central Kalahari Game Reserve of Botswana, Etosha Pan National Park in Namibia, North and South Luangwa National Parks in Zambia and Mountain Zebra National Park in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Amongst those that do lie at the frontiers, not all have the possibility of being twinned with a PA across their international boundary. Such independent conservation areas (ICAs) have unique attributes that require long-term conservation within the same expanded framework (i.e. incorporating commu- nity conservation and natural resource use in areas surrounding the protected area). They may therefore qualify as KLCs. 5.2.1 Selection of Independent Conservation Areas as KLCs In supporting the long-term conservation of distinctive African ecosystems, this strategy features the same distinctive elements as are found in TFCAs. It is based on an ecosystem approach where the ecosystem is defined essentially by emblematic, large African mammals and their habitat requirements. It is cognizant of each area\u2019s resilience to fundamental change in land-use in the sur- rounding landscape, such as that accompanying rural population expansion. It foresees the need for sustainable natural resource management by surrounding landholders and communities. ",
        "96 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Southern Africa Independent conservation areas will need to present globally important conservation attributes of their own in order to qualify as KLCs. It is possible that clusters of protected areas in the central region of an African state might become linked within a larger conservation area and developed as a unit in an analo- gous way to TFCAs. The new protected land unit could then be re-evaluated for qualification as a KLC. ICAs should be evaluated as potential KLCs according to the criteria in Box 6. 5.2.2 ICAs \u2013 country- and site-level support Conservation actions for developing ICAs will follow the same format as those outlined for TFCAs at the country-level and site- level (Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2). Every opportunity will be taken to link effective park management with the community manage- ment of natural resources. 5.3 Training Improved training is required at all levels of seniority in wildlife management and related issues in land-use and environmental governance, but in most countries of the region there is a par- ticular gap in the training of mid-level officers (wardens and senior site officers) which extends across Africa. A rising demand for mid-level training of managers of communal lands and man- agers of nature-based tourism operations is also anticipated. There is a need for specific anti-poaching training to assist man- agement in tackling organised criminal poaching of elephant and rhino. There is also a need to improve access to training in Africa at the senior level (for regional wardens, senior government officers and other wildlife professionals working in the conservation, edu- cation, tourism and environmental sectors). The Masters in Tropical Resource Ecology (MTRE) offered by the University of Zimbabwe has provided advanced wildlife training for conserva- tion professionals from across Africa since its inception in 1972. During the 1990s it received senior-level training advancement through its partnership with the University of Edinburgh (UK) under EU-SADC support. The MTRE has now been extended to a two-year course with some additional modules. Currently the course is only receiving Zimbabwean students. Without a suitable training centre, many graduate students in Africa are going else- where in the world for advanced-level training. \u2303 Park rangers on patrol in Liuwa Plain National Park, Zambia.

        "| 97 #1 Indicative conservation actions It will be important to ensure that training covers the needs of management within a broader environmental management sys- tem. Mining and oil prospecting, for example, have considerable direct impact on wildlife and biodiversity, and many secondary impacts. Many of the theses from the MTRE course over the last few years have covered topics on wider environmental perspec- tives, including issues of water pollution in rivers and underground water supplies, recovery of mine dumps, land use and disease 70 . 5.3.1 Wildlife training Mid-level training of protected area managers can be increased by expanding facilities at existing training colleges and/or estab- lishing new ones. Currently most training in the region is under- taken at the Southern African Wildlife College on the western edge of the Kruger National Park in South Africa or at the College of African Wildlife Management, Mweka on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. i. Needs assessment A \u2018needs assessment\u2019 will be undertaken to determine gaps in current training and the scale of training expansion required over the next ten years in the region. The advantage of a single regional centre is that it gives students the opportunity to meet with others from neighbouring countries taking the same courses, thus exposing them to a greater variety of wildlife issues and contexts. It also brings the advantage of scale \u2013 in terms of the equipment and facilities available, and exposure to visiting experts and specialists. On the other hand, an in-country training centre enables students to focus on the unique wildlife issues, systems of governance and languages that they will be facing in their own country on graduation. It will also be less expensive to train students in their own country. Furthermore, a level of competition between neigh- bouring research centres may act to raise standards. The needs assessment will examine these issues, identify different options for expansion and make recommendations. ii. Establishment of training colleges A number of mid-level colleges will be established according to the needs assessment. The activities for each college will fall within four components: a. design of training college, accommodation block and staff housing; b. construction and establishment of the college; c. supply of furnishings and equipment; d. support for three years of running costs. iii. MSc in Tropical Resource Ecology Many wildlife professionals at a senior level in Africa have ben- efited from training received on the masters course on Tropical Resource Ecology at the University of Zimbabwe, which forms part of the Tropical Resource Ecology Programme. As mentioned, the programme has attracted only Zimbabweans since about 2003. There is a need for senior-level training of wildlife profes- sionals in Africa at the highest international standard, within a research centre that is closely linked to wildlife centres through- out the world, which keeps abreast of rapid ongoing advances in conservation science and management. Whether such training is based at the University of Zimbabwe or elsewhere, it must overcome two main problems. The first is the quality of graduates coming for postgraduate education. Pres- ently the brightest of these are being attracted by more remu- nerative careers and/or are going abroad for their training. There would therefore need to be provision for competitive bursaries to attract students from the region and beyond. The second prob- lem is to raise the level of teaching and supervision on offer to the students. The solution to this would be to link support to a partnership with a British (or other English-speaking) university. As mentioned, the EU supported the SADC Wildlife Management Training Project (1997-2001), which partnered with the University of Edinburgh to provide direct training support to the Tropical Resource Ecology Programme at the University of Zimbabwe. It succeeded in raising standards to the highest level. A longer- term relationship is required, which should develop a robust strat- egy for ensuring that the quality of training is sustained long after the support programme has ended. 5.3.2 Research and monitoring at conservation sites An effective way to lift the standards of mid-level management in the field is through long-term collaborations between parks and high-quality research institutions. Research programmes can assist with monitoring conservation threats, identifying species and in devising improved management methods that have direct benefits for the parks.

Our proposed strategic approach to elephant poaching, rhino poaching and wildlife trade is given separately in Sections 1-3 of Chapter 5, which include recommendations for investigating and dismantling wildlife trafficking networks and disrupting their organisations by closing down the flow of money. 5.4.1 Additional proposed action It is proposed to follow up the study of national conservation spending and rates of decline of rhino 71 with a study of site-specific conservation spending and current rhino poaching in South Africa or Southern Africa. The aim of the study is to investigate the overall effectiveness of conservation spending. 5.5 Awareness raising and communication There is an over-riding need to create a conservation policy for Africa that is embedded in society, rather than imposed from above (Section 4.2.5). This will require a \u2018blue-ribbon\u2019 education and awareness-raising programme which not only informs all sectors about the benefits that can be derived from wildlife con- servation but also helps to uphold and champion the cultural values of the wildlife heritage. An important part of this pro- gramme is to provide up-to-date and accurate information on conservation issues, including natural resource management, biodiversity, African cultural traditions, eco-tourism, protected areas and the TFCA/KLC approach. The information has to be attractively presented and targeted at specific audiences. The communication strategy will furnish materials and informa- tion on the following topics: \u2022 essential ecological facts about nature; \u2022 nature conservation values and conflicts; \u2022 nature conservation threats (all kinds); \u2022 illegal killing, harvesting and trade in wildlife; \u2022 natural resource management and the sustainable use of wildlife; \u2022 protected areas and the TFCA/KLC approach to conservation; \u2022 the environment (air, water and soil) and its importance to health. The strategy will target specific sectors individually, particularly the following: \u2022 the news media with a library of briefings, sound recordings, video and news releases; \u2022 diplomatic missions and senior government officials requiring succinct information for effective political dialogue; \u2022 governmental officers and NGOs involved with wildlife con- servation (who require the fullest briefings); \u2022 schools requiring improved curricula and educational materials on environmental issues, including natural resource management; wildlife clubs requiring interpretative materials and equip- ment to support fun-filled educational activities; \u2022 Environmental Councils for Elders, which require location- specific information to support political dialogue. A Communications and Interpretation Support Unit will be based in each country to develop and disseminate information with the participation of environmental education organisations. Mobile information centres will visit rural locations to work with wildlife clubs and communities. ( 71 ) Leader-Williams N. and S.D. Albon (1988). Allocation of resources for conservation.

        "116 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Eastern Africa T his chapter develops a strategic approach for wildlife con- servation in Eastern Africa. It is organised into five sec- tions composed as follows: 1) an introduction to Eastern Africa\u2019s key ecosystems, their unique features and their values; 2) an outline of the nature and extent of the threats to them and of the drivers behind those threats; 3) a review of ongoing approaches and efforts to reduce the impact of threats and drivers; 4) a discussion of lessons learned, and 5) a set of indic- ative actions recommended as ways in which an EU intervention could contribute effectively to the long-term conservation of Eastern Africa\u2019s extraordinarily diverse natural heritage. Section 1 opens with the definition of Eastern Africa as used in this study. It goes on to describe the main natural habitats and ecosystems of the region, and the special features of the flora and fauna in each. It pays particular attention to the glaciated high mountains unique to this part of Africa, and the grassy woodlands and open savannahs that characterise its most exten- sive and productive wildlife habitats. There are also descriptions of forests (montane, highland, mid-elevation, lowland and coastal); of arid and semi-arid lands; of lakes, rivers and wetlands; and of seashore habitats. Section 2 reviews long-term threats to the wildlife of Eastern Africa and the factors that drive them. Although the current poaching onslaught affecting elephants and rhinos is a matter of huge concern, the greatest long-term threat to the region\u2019s wildlife overall is the continuous fragmentation and unsustainable use of natural habitat, and the human-wildlife conflict that fol- lows. Another consequence is that increasingly isolated PAs lose ecological resilience. These threats are driven ultimately by an inexorable and accelerating increase in the number of poor peo- ple, which is driving the emergence of an increasingly serious bushmeat problem that is still under-recognised in the region. Other threats and drivers discussed include climate change, mar- ket forces, the under-valuation of ecosystem services and biodi- versity, and weak governance and corruption. Section 3 reviews ongoing conservation efforts to overcome the threats and drivers described in the previous section. Context is provided by an initial review of the global to local planning frame- works that influence the approach to wildlife conservation in the region. Given the strength of contemporary concern about all types of wildlife and forest crime in Eastern Africa, the strategic approaches being used to combat this, based on stopping the killing, the trafficking and the demand, are described. Other efforts described and discussed are minimising human-wildlife conflict; improving the PA system connectivity and effectiveness; valuing ecosystem services properly; adapting to climate change; and alleviating poverty, particularly in communities living with wildlife in and around PAs through Community-based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM). Section 4 reviews some lessons learned. Probably the key lesson is that while PAs contain the most intact assemblages of wildlife and are where biodiversity is being most effectively protected, the responsible management authorities remain under-resourced and without the capacity to deal effectively with the scale and sophistication of poaching and trafficking networks. This situation relates to governments still not fully understanding the value of ecosystem services and, linked to that, poor governance stand- ards. Another key lesson is that in the face of uncontrolled pop- ulation growth, the sustainability of CBNRM schemes is compromised. Much depends on whether and how the last, best wildlife areas \u2013 many of which are transboundary in nature \u2013 can be secured in perpetuity. To this end, Eastern Africa needs to learn from the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), and greatly strengthen its political and financial commitment to the development and formal co-management of transfrontier con- servation areas (TFCAs). Acting on any of these lessons will ben- efit greatly from donor support, but this must be sustained over much longer, more realistic time frames than hitherto, and with tighter performance monitoring and accountability features. Section 5 proposes a selection of indicative actions that would contribute greatly to achieving long-term wildlife conservation in Eastern Africa. These are organised around four approaches. The first addresses law enforcement and trade control issues by proposing support for the development of Wildlife Enforcement Networks (WENs) at the national level in all countries, and for a forensic laboratory to provide analytical services at the regional level. The second approach centres on elephants and rhinos, and defers to the specific actions proposed in Chapter 5 of this study (Sections 1 and 2). At the same time, however, it argues that the most important populations of these and other iconic species must feature as criteria in the selection of the priority areas around which the next approach is centred, making support for those areas a very powerful, if indirect, way to assist in their conservation. >0 _ Executive Summary ",
        "#2 | 117 #2 Executive Summary The third approach proposes long-term support for selected Key Landscapes for Conservation (KLCs) containing Eastern Africa\u2019s most important PAs and the areas linking them (including TFCAs). Of all the strategic approaches recommended, this is the central pillar since the KLCs are selected so as to capture not only the diversity of the region\u2019s ecosystems and important species, but also those areas that have the greatest chance of surviving the many pressures on wildlife and natural resources in the coming years. Thus priority is given to sites harbouring the most intact assemblages of Eastern Africa\u2019s wildlife; to World Heritage Sites (WHSs) already recognised for their outstanding universal value; and to sites which protect specific globally important features not found elsewhere. More than 80 PAs are included in the 17 KLCs identified. Several of the most important ones are also TFCAs, notably the Maasai Mara-Serengeti-Ngorongoro complex between Kenya and Tanzania, encompassing 7 PAs including 3 WHSs; the Greater Kilimanjaro complex between the same countries with 8 PAs including 1 WHS; and the Greater Virunga complex (over- lapping with the Central African region), which encompasses 11 PAs including 3 WHSs. Between them, these and the other KLCs almost certainly protect the majority of Eastern Africa\u2019s floral and faunal diversity. They also include most of the priority areas identified in the Action Plans for elephants, rhinos, big cats, great apes and numerous other endangered and endemic species. It is strongly recommended that the EU gives priority to support- ing these KLCs, and the wide range of actions that could be financed to protect and manage them \u2013 in both their constituent PAs and the community areas in between \u2013 is described. The fourth and last intervention approach concerns the strength- ening of wildlife management-related institutions. Here it is rec- ommended that support should be given to the East African Community Secretariat to promote and professionalise the formal co-management of TFCAs in the region through the elaboration of appropriate policies, procedures and plans. A programme to strengthen the field skills and overall competence of the region\u2019s PA wardens through the development of a new course and schol- arships at the College of African Wildlife Management is also advocated. Finally, it is recommended as a strategic priority that the EU sets aside resources to enable it to support national-level sectoral, institutional and/or PA system reforms on an ad hoc, if-and-when requested basis, and advertises its willingness and ability to act in this way. \u2303 A Maasai warrior in Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania.

        "120 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Eastern Africa T he Eastern African region as defined for purposes of this report comprises 11 countries \u2013 Burundi , Djibouti , Eritrea , Ethiopia , Kenya , Rwanda , Somalia , South Sudan , Sudan , Tanzania and Uganda . Altogether it has an area of about 6.4 million km 2 , and a population of some 305.6 million people. It also has some of the most diverse and awesome ecosystems on earth, let alone in Africa. This diversity owes much to a still evolving geomorphology that has bequeathed to the region some unique features, including both the highest/coldest 1 and lowest/hottest 2 points on the continent, as well as rift valleys at a scale visible from space, which contain spectacular lakes and active volcanoes. Not surprisingly therefore, there is an astonishing variety of habitats ranging from the equa- torial snow peaks and glaciers of Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya and the Ruwenzori to the coral reefs and mangroves of the Indian Ocean coasts; and from the rainforests of Rwanda and Uganda to the deserts of Sudan, Eritrea and Somalia (see Figure 1). In between these extremes are the extensive grasslands and savannah woodlands that still harbour the biggest concentrations of large mammals on the planet. These include the iconic phe- nomena and species that best epitomise Africa in the popular mind: herds of antelope and flocks of flamingos migrating liter- ally in millions, huge herds of elephants, lions in prides of dozens, rhinos, gorillas and so on. Living with these flagship species is a huge, and still under-researched, diversity of smaller vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, a high proportion of which are endemic. All of this astonishing manifestation of biodiversity is threatened to a greater or lesser extent throughout Eastern Africa. The gen- eral descriptions given below are regional in character and nec- essarily concise. Similarly, only a few specific examples out of very many are given. For a summary of \u2018biodiversity facts\u2019 at a national level, the reader is referred to the country profiles available on the website of the Convention on Biological Diver- sity 3 , to which all countries in the region are party 4 . Rainfall, temperature and soils all interact to determine the eco- logical character of an area, but the most important of these is rainfall, not just the total amount but also how it is distributed throughout the year. Total amounts are strongly influenced by elevation: generally speaking the higher the land, the more rain it will receive, although this relationship breaks down at the coast where the proximity of the ocean provides high rainfall at sea level. In terms of distribution, most of Eastern Africa enjoys a bimodal rainfall regime, with two rainy seasons, unlike the single rainy season that prevails over most countries to the south. As a result, ecosystem productivity is \u2013 all else being equal \u2013 greater in Eastern than Southern Africa. 1.1 High mountains Eastern Africa boasts not just the highest mountain in Africa, Kilimanjaro, but also all 20 or so of the highest peaks. The five highest are distributed amongst five countries, Kilimanjaro (5 893 m) in Tanzania, Mount Kenya (5 199 m) in Kenya, Margherita (5 110 m) in Uganda, Ras Dejen (4 550 m) in Ethiopia, and Karisimbi (4 519 m) in Rwanda. Mt Kenya is described as an example in Box 1. >1 _ Special features of the Eastern African region ( 1 ) Mount Kilimanjaro (5 893 m) in Tanzania is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest free-standing mountain in the world. Its summit is presumed to reach the coldest temperatures in Sub-Saharan Africa but in continental terms, lower temperatures probably occur in the Atlas Mountains. ( 2 ) 5 Lake Asal (-125 m) in the Afar Depression, Djibouti is the second lowest point on earth and the world\u2019s most saline lake. The area is also the hottest on earth in terms of average annual temperature: daily temperatures range between 25 \u00b0C and 48 \u00b0C depending on the season. ( 3 ) 5 www.cbd.int/reports/search ( 4 ) 5 Except Southern Sudan which has yet to join in its own right. Box 1. Mount Kenya At 5 199 m, Mount Kenya is the highest second peak in Africa. It is an ancient extinct volcano, which during its period of activity (3.1-2.6 million years ago) is thought to have risen to 6 500 m. The summit is made up of rock, snow and ice. Above about 3 300 m, the mountain slopes and most of the national park are above the tree line; below it the rich volcanic soils are clothed in forests which are part of the largest continuous block of indigenous closed canopy forest in Kenya. The entire mountain is a vital water catchment for some 7 million people and is the source of the great Tana and Ewaso Nyiro rivers. Plant and animal biodiversity is high, with numerous rare and endemic species. ",

Box 2. Afro-alpine flora Above the tree line, a unique Afro-alpine ecosystem is found whose fauna and flora contain dozens of endemic species, the evolution and ecology of which provide an outstanding example of ecological processes. At its lower elevations (3 300 m-3 800 m) is an alpine moorland zone characterised by high rainfall and a thick humus layer. Waist-high tussock grasses and sedges predominate. The higher elevations (3 800 m-4 500 m) contain a more varied flora, including several species of iconic \u2018giant rosette plants\u2019 in the genera Lobelia , Senecio (giant groundsels) and Carduus (giant thistle). The evolution in these plants of adaptations to extreme cold is of particular scientific interest, the rosettes being composed of a great number of adult leaves surrounding a central cone of developing leaves. Upon the onset of a night frost, the adult leaves bend inwards to insulate the central leaf bud, which slows cooling long enough to protect it from freezing until re-warming by the following day\u2019s sunshine. \u2303 Giant groundsel in the alpine zone of Mt. Kenya National Park, Kenya. The fauna and flora of East Africa\u2019s unique Afro-alpine ecosystem contain dozens of endemic species. At their very highest elevations, these mountains host Africa\u2019s only permanent snowfields and glaciers. Below these but above the tree line (at approximately 3 300 m) is found an alpine eco- system with flora and fauna unique to Africa (Box 2). It is found most extensively in the Ruwenzori Mountains on the border of Uganda with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); on Mount Kenya and the Aberdares in Kenya; and in the Simien and Bale Mountains of Ethiopia. Although sharing the same fundamental physiognomy, each locality has many endemic species found nowhere else, making them all incredibly important biodiversity \u2018hotspots\u2019. It is thus hardly a coincidence that mountains high enough to exhibit this ecotype account for four of the ten natural World Heritage Sites in Eastern Africa 5 . ",

        "| 123 #2 | 123 Special features of the Eastern African region Although not necessarily linked closely to the afro-alpine eco- system per se, all the highest massifs harbour a wide array of rare and endangered species, many of them endemic. The Bale Moun- tains provide a good general example of this (Box 3), while certain specific animals emphasise the point, including the iconic mountain gorilla 6 , ranging exclusively in the high volcanoes of Rwanda and Uganda; the mountain bongo 7 , found in a few mountain forests of Kenya; and the walia ibex 8 and gelada baboon 9 , restricted to the Simien Mountains of Ethiopia. Mountains, irrespective of height, are very also important for the closed and evergreen forests they support as described below. ( 6 ) The mountain gorilla ( Gorilla beringei beringei ) is found in two isolated sub-populations: Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda and the Virunga Volcanoes region of Rwanda, Uganda and DRC. It is chiefly because of its gorillas that Bwindi is a World Heritage Site. ( 7 ) 5 Eastern bongo, Tragelaphus euryceros isaaci .

The Bale Mountains Ethiopia is known as a global centre of biodiversity. The Bale Mountains represent an essential area for the conservation of endemic species and is regarded as the largest Afro-alpine habitat in the whole of Africa. The Bale Mountains, with their vast moorlands, extensive heathlands, woodlands, pristine mountain streams and alpine climate, represent an area of exceptional natural value. With an altitudinal range of 1 600-4 377 m on Tulu Dimtu (the second highest mountain in Ethiopia), the Bale Mountains encompass a range of habitats and contain a great diversity of fauna, including 77 species of mammals (17 endemic) and over 220 species of birds (16 endemic) which have been recorded in the Bale Mountains National Park. The mountain nyala, Ethiopian wolf (the world\u2019s most endangered canid), Bale monkey and giant molerat are just some of these many species endemic to the highlands of Ethiopia, and the Bale Mountains hold the largest remaining populations. They also give rise to several rivers that are of major importance for agriculture in the lowland areas of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. ",
        "124 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Eastern Africa 1.2 Forests Continental data on the extent of forests and their rates of depletion are provided in the summary document \u2013 Synthesis, Section 2.3. A much-simplified description of the main types of forest found in Eastern Africa is given below: montane and highland, mid- elevation and lowland, and coastal. All are important reservoirs of biodiversity, and all provide important goods and ecological services. Furthermore, all forests (and woodlands too) serve as carbon sinks, thus playing a role in mitigating global warming. 1.2.1 Montane and highland forests Due to the relationship between elevation and rainfall, extensive tracts of forest in Eastern Africa are usually associated with mountains and hills, irrespective of their height. Some of these areas are relicts of forests dating back to a time when the region as a whole was wetter and forests far more expansive. These so-called \u2018Pleistocene refugia\u2019 are analogous to islands, separated by savannah seas, and like islands very often contain unique endemic species. The Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania and Kenya provide a good example (Box 4). \u2303 The forests of the Eastern Arc Mountains, stretching from Zambia, through Tanzania to Kenya, are over 30 million years old and constitute one of Africa\u2019s most important biodiversity hotspots. At least 25 % of Tanzanians also depend on the forest covered mountains for their water supply. Box 4. The Eastern Arc Forests \u2018Eastern Arc\u2019 is the name applied to an archipelago of a dozen mountains scattered in a chain stretching across Tanzania between the Kenyan and Zambian borders. Included are the Taita Hills (Kenya) and the Pare, Usambara and Udzungwe Mountains of Tanzania. Scientists believe that the forests on the Eastern Arc Mountains have survived for over 30 million years, and were once connected to the forests of the Congo Basin and West Africa. Neighbouring mountains are much younger, for example Kilimanjaro is estimated to be about 1-2 million years old. Many thousands of species of plants and animals are found in these forests and nowhere else on earth. This includes at least 100 species of birds, mammals, amphi- bians and reptiles, at least 800 plants and huge numbers of smaller creatures, including butterflies and millipedes. Many of these species are threatened with extinction. The Eastern Arc is recognised internationally as an area with an exceptional concentration of endemic species. In addition, at least 25 % of Tanzanians depend on the Eastern Arc Mountains for their water supply. ",

( 13 ) This includes the following PAs: Ruaha NP, Rungwa Game Reserve (GR), Kitulo NP, Mpanga-Kipengere GR and Mount Rungwe Forest Nature Reserve. The Southern Highlands of Tanzania also boast important high- land forest with high levels of endemism, and provide a strong- hold for Abbott\u2019s duiker, the kipunji monkey discovered in 2003 on Mount Rungwe (Africa\u2019s rarest primate species and genus 10 ) and more than a dozen new vertebrates discovered in the last few years. They also harbour the region\u2019s most extensive montane grasslands (Eastern Africa\u2019s rarest habitat type), and an impres- sive orchid flora (Kitulo National Park in particular). Altogether, Tanzania\u2019s mountains contribute to the country having the highest primate diversity of any in the region. Tanzania boasts 27 species including the chimpanzee (e.g. in the Mahale Mountains). The Imatong Mountains of South Sudan provide another example of rich and unique highland biodiversity. The vegetation is rela- tively intact and the mountain range still has some of the best-conserved Podocarpus forests in Eastern Africa. In addition to Afro-montane floral associations, the Imatongs also have veg- etation types associated with the lowland forests of the Congo Basin and the drier woodlands and savannahs of northern Sudan and Somaliland. There are no other mountains in Eastern Africa that have so many floral assemblages converging on them, resulting in at least 21 endemic plant taxa. There are very many other forested highlands across the region that could be mentioned, almost all of them characterised by high biodiversity and endemicity. Without exception however, they all provide a range of ecological goods and services to the often-substantial human populations living around them. Goods include fuel, timber and non-timber forest products (fruits, wild crop relatives 11 , medicines, etc.) as for any forest, but the most important service of an upland forest is as a water catchment area. As highlands they receive higher rainfall than the surround- ing lowlands, and their forest cover regulates the recharge of rivers rising in them. Without the forest to retard run-off, the relatively high precipitation received would flood torrentially down steep slopes, to the detriment of soils and habitats below. As a result of this service, key upland catchment forests are often referred to as \u2018water towers\u2019. Kenya, for example, officially recognises five water towers of critical economic importance: namely the Mau Forest Complex, Mount Kenya, the Aberdares Range, Mount Elgon and the Cheran- gani Hills 12 . In Tanzania, the Southern Highlands contribute water via the Usangu Flats and Ihefu Swamp to the Great Ruaha River, thus providing important ecosystem services to both people living downstream and the important wildlife populations of the Greater Ruaha-Rungwa-Kitulo-Kipengere landscape, which now hosts the largest population of elephants in Eastern Africa 13 . Similarly the Imatongs form the most important watershed in southern South Sudan, with numerous towns and villages dependent on the main- tenance of this catchment area. 1.2.2 Mid-elevation and lowland forests Compared to West and Central Africa, inland Eastern Africa has little true lowland forest on relatively flat terrain. Coastal forests are described separately below, and the more open woodland formations in Section 1.3. The most extensive closed and ever- green lowland forests in the region are found in western Uganda (e.g. Semuliki National Park, Kibale National Park and Budongo Forest Reserve), with patches elsewhere (e.g. south-western South Sudan). Also notable are the transfrontier forests of Nyungwe National Park in Rwanda and Kibira National Park in Burundi. This landscape represents one of the few substantially intact mid-altitude rainforests in Eastern Africa. All these areas host a variety of forest animals, including ele- phant, buffalo and giant forest hog. The primate fauna, including important chimpanzee populations, is especially diverse with 13 species recorded in Kibale for example. Semuliki is dominated by the easternmost extension of the great Ituri Forest of the Congo Basin, one of Africa\u2019s most ancient and bio-diverse forests. Birdlife is especially spectacular in Semuliki with 441 recorded species, representing 40 % of Uganda\u2019s total bird species and 66 % (216) of the country\u2019s forest bird species. There are numer- ous rarities: 46 Guinea-Congo biome species are found nowhere else in Eastern Africa. Similarly, Nyungwe-Kibira is an important centre for primates (including chimpanzee), and contains many Albertine Rift endemics. Whilst not quite so critically important as highland forests in terms of water catchment services, mid-elevation and lowland forests do of course offer a similar range of goods. ",

Those of Kenya and Tanzania are part of the Northern Zanzibar- Inhambane coastal forest mosaic, which extends from the Kenya- Somali border to the Tanzania-Mozambique border along the coast. The ecoregion includes forest patches found on the islands of Zanzibar, Pemba and Mafia. These forests are characterised by a mosaic of vegetation types including closed canopy evergreen forest, Brachystegia woodland, scrub forest and dry forest. They are typically found in small fragmented patches. Mangrove forests are not considered to be coastal forest under this definition. The coastal forests of Eastern Africa are a globally recognised area of great biological importance, due to the high levels of biodiversity and endemism found within the small, fragmented and highly threatened patches of forest (Box 5). The highest levels of biodiversity are found in the closed canopy forest, but this only makes up 2 % of the total area of the coastal forest mosaic. The two largest protected areas in Kenya are Arabuko-Sokoke (417 km 2 ) and Shimba Hills (63 km 2 ). Arabuko- Sokoke alone hosts an abundance of mammal, bird, reptile and amphibian species limited to that one forest 14 . The rare antelope known as the hirola 15 is restricted to the northernmost coastal zones of Kenya (although it might also survive in Somalia). In addition to their high biodiversity values, coastal forests pro- vide the same goods and services as any forest. More than others however, many have an important cultural value to local people. For instance, the kaya forests in Kwale and Kilifi districts of Kenya are sacred to local communities, with graves of important elders found within the forest. Sacred forests are also common in Tanzania where extractive use is closely regulated by communities. \u2303 Tana River mangabey, one of the five primate species endemic to the coastal forests, Kenya. Box 5. Coastal forests Many species are endemic to these forests, for example 44 % of plants are endemic to the coastal forests and 40 % of plant genera are confined to a single forest patch. Forests only 100 km apart may have an 80 % difference in their plant species. The coastal forests are home to five endemic primates: Tana River red colobus ( Procolobus rufomitratus , critically endangered), Tana River mangabey ( Cercocebus galeritus ), Zanzibar red colobus (P rocolobus kirkii , endangered), Rondo galago ( Galagoides rondoensis , endangered) and the Kenya coastal galago ( Galagoides cocos ). The coastal forests support populations of threatened (Red List) flagship mammal species: black rhino ( Diceros bicornis , critically endangered if not locally extinct), elephant ( Loxodonta africana , threatened) and wild dog ( Lycaon pictus , endangered). Musical instruments, such as the clarinet, oboe and highland backpipe, are made from one highly valued hardwood species, African blackwood ( Dalbergia melanoxylon ) which is found in coastal forests and is threatened by unsustainable harvesting. Coastal forests together with the Eastern Arc Mountains, are home to the African violet ( Saintpaulia spp ) from which 40 000 varieties have been cultivated commercially from three species, with a retail trade of USD 100 million per annum *.

Cheetahs have disappeared from 76% of their historic range in Africa. They are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and killing and capture for protection of livestock and for the wildlife trade. Box 6. The Serengeti The vast plains of the Serengeti National Park, comprising 1.5 million hectares of savannah, support the largest remaining unaltered animal migration in the world. Over 1 million wilde - beest plus hundreds of thousands of gazelle and zebra \u2013 followed by their predators \u2013 engage in a 1 000 km-long annual circular trek in search of pasture and water, spanning the two adjacent countries of Kenya and Tanzania. This spectacular phenomenon takes place in a unique scenic setting of \u2018endless plains\u2019: 25 000 km 2 of treeless expanses of spectacularly flat short grasslands dotted with rocky outcrops (kopjes) and interspersed with rivers and woodlands. This is one of the most productive ecosystems on earth, sustaining the largest number of ungulates and the highest concentration of large predators in the world. The ecosystem supports roughly 1.3 million wildebeest, 300 000 Thomson\u2019s gazelle and 200 000 zebra that dominate the migratory herd. Other herbivores include 90 000 impala, 50 000 Grant\u2019s gazelle, 40 000 buffalo, 40 000 topi, 15 000 eland, 8 000 hartebeest, 10 000 giraffe and 3 000 elephant, but fewer than 40 black rhino. The park has the highest ostrich population in Tanzania and probably in Africa. This abundance of prey animals supports very important populations of lion, leopard, cheetah, spotted hyaena and wild dog. 1.3 Woodland and grassland The wooded and grassy habitats of Eastern Africa come in many varieties, ranging from vast open grass plains and highland grass- lands, to the acacia 16 -dominated savannah woodlands found over much of the region, to the sometimes dense miombo 17 woodlands so typical of western and southern Tanzania and beyond. The important common feature of them all, however, is the availability of grass. It is in these grassy ecosystems that one finds the amazing, inter- dependent communities of large mammals for which Africa is so famous, made up especially of large numbers of grazers, but also specialist browsers, all of them supporting an impressive cast of large and small predators as well as an array of scavengers. Examples include, for grazers: many species of antelope, zebra, buffalo and hippo; for browsers: rhino and giraffe; for both: ele- phant; for predators: lion, leopard, cheetah, wild dog and crocodile; for scavengers: hyaena, jackal and vulture. It is in the vast and productive grassy habitats in Eastern Africa that one still finds the last two great mammalian migrations in Africa. The most famous of these is undoubtedly that of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, in which massive herds dominated by wildebeest circulate between Tanzania and Kenya (Box 6). ( 16 ) In 2011, the Latin name Acacia was transferred from the African-type genus to one in Australia. All of the African species have new generic names. However, the name remains so quintessentially African that its use as a common name is continued here. ( 17 ) \u2018Miombo\u2019 is a vernacular word that has been adopted by ecologists to describe woodland ecosystems dominated by trees in the genera Brachystegia, Julbernardia and Isoberlinia. ",

During the late 1960s, the year-round average biomass of large mammals in the grasslands of the Queen Elizabeth NP was recorded as 29 490 kg/km 2 , compared to 6 300 kg/km 2 for the Serengeti. ( 20 ) Serengeti NP, Selous GR and Ngorongoro Conservation Area (all in Tanzania). Much less well-known, but as impressive in scale, is that of the Sudd-Badingilu-Boma-Gambella ecosystem, in which herds dom- inated by white-eared kob circulate between South Sudan and Ethiopia. The most recent estimates obtained in 2009 for the migratory species are 1.67 million white-eared kob ( Kobus kob leucotis ), 340 000 Mongolla gazelle ( Gazella rufifrons albono- tata ) and 125 000 tiang, the Sudanese form of topi ( Damaliscus lunatus tiang ) 18 . These species range mostly within South Sudan: 90 % in the case of the kob, and 100 % for tiang. The best known of Eastern Africa\u2019s parks and reserves are mostly those that strive to conserve intact, functioning examples of grassy and open woodland ecosystems. In addition to the Serengeti NP (Tanzania) and Mara Game Reserve (Kenya) men- tioned above, these include Omo-Mago NP in Ethiopia; Samburu National Reserve, Amboseli and the two Tsavo NPs in Kenya; Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Selous Game Reserve and Ruaha NP in Tanzania; and Queen Elizabeth 19 , Murchison Falls and Kidepo Valley National Parks in Uganda. Unsurprisingly perhaps, several of these protected areas are inscribed on the list of World Heritage Sites 20 . Together, they represent the backbone of Eastern Africa\u2019s economically very important tourism industry. Some of those mentioned, notably the Selous GR (see Box 7) and Ruaha NP, are representative of the miombo ecotype in which the dominant trees are deciduous. Due partly to the relatively dense canopy prevailing during the time of year when the trees are in leaf and partly to much poorer soils, the abundance and quality of grazing is not as high in miombo as it is in acacia savannah. This translates into a significantly lower carrying capacity of large herbivores. Nonetheless, the sheer extent of the habitat means it also supports very important populations of herbivores, espe- cially elephants, and predators. Miombo woodlands are central to the livelihood systems of mil- lions of rural and urban dwellers in Tanzania. Goods provided to support the livelihoods of local communities include products such as medicines, fuel, food, fibres, and construction and craft materials. The services include cultural and spiritual values, cli- mate regulation, erosion and hydrological control. Box 7. The Selous The Selous Game Reserve, covering 50 000 km 2 , is one of the largest protected areas in Africa. It lies between the Somalia- Maasai and Zambezian centres of endemism, mostly within the latter. Together with the adjacent Mikumi National Park and Kilombero Game Controlled Area to the west, and the nearby Udzungwa Mountains National Park to the northwest, the Selous and its surrounding areas constitute one of the largest continuous protected and undeveloped wildlife areas in the world, in which ecological and biological processes are relatively undisturbed, including a diverse range of wildlife with significant predator/prey relationships. Despite a long winter drought and poor soils, the reserve has a higher density and diversity of species than any other miombo woodland area, thanks to its size, the diversity of its habitats, the availability of food and water, and the lack of settlements. More than 2 100 plants have been recorded and more are thought to exist in the remote forests in the south. Similarly, the reserve protects an impressive large mammal fauna and contains globally significant populations of elephant, black rhinoceros, buffalo, hippo and wild hunting dog. There are also important populations of ungulates that favour miombo, such as sable antelope, Lichtenstein\u2019s hartebeest, greater kudu and Niassa wildebeest. In addition, there is also a large number of Nile crocodile. \u2303 Lake Nzerakera in Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania. Selous is one of the largest protected areas in Africa. ",

Except on mountains or near the coast, proper woodland is confined to drainage lines of rivers and streams, many of which are seasonal and flow only intermittently. Due to low rainfall and productivity, these arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs) have never supported wildlife in abundance, and nowa- days the best areas are anyway heavily utilised by pastoralists. Overstocking and overgrazing in relation to carrying capacity is common, leading to range degradation and desertification. Consequently, wildlife species adapted to ASAL conditions are rare and endangered 21 . Surprisingly, small relict elephant popu- lations survive in a couple of favourable areas: one in the Babile Sanctuary of north-eastern Ethiopia and another in the Gash-Setit Wildlife Reserve of Eritrea on its southern border with Ethiopia. 1.5 Lakes, rivers and wetlands The most notable components of Eastern Africa\u2019s nominally freshwater ecosystems are strongly associated with two very major geographical phenomena: the Great Rift Valley and the River Nile. The East African Rift came into being approximately 40 million years ago as the African tectonic plate began to split. It comprises two distinct arms: the Eastern or Gregorian Rift and the Western or Albertine Rift. The Eastern Rift holds a string of lakes on the rift floor running south from Ethiopia through Kenya to Tanzania: with few excep- tions these lakes are all saline and alkaline. The Ethiopian lakes from north to south are Zeway, Shala, Abyata, Langano, Awassa, Chamo, Abaya and Chew Bahir. The Kenyan section is home to eight lakes, of which two are freshwater and the rest alkaline. From north to south these are Lakes Turkana (largest of the Kenyan lakes and only slightly saline 22 ), Logipi, Baringo (freshwater), Bogoria (a national reserve), Nakuru (a national park), Elmenteita, Naivasha (freshwater) and Magadi 23 . The chain of alkaline lakes continues into Tanzania with Lakes Natron and Manyara. \u2303 Lake Nzerakera in Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania. Selous is one of the largest protected areas in Africa. ",

The shallow soda lakes support millions of lesser and greater flamingos and are an integral part of the most important route of the African-Eurasian flyway system for birds travelling from the northern breeding grounds to African wintering places. Box 8. Rift Valley Lakes in Kenya The Kenya Lake System is the single, most important foraging site for lesser flamingo in the world, with about 1.5 million individuals moving from one lake to the other. It also provides the main nesting and breeding grounds for great white pelican in the Great Rift Valley. The lakes\u2019 terrestrial zones also contain important populations of many mammal and bird species that are globally or regionally threatened (e.g. black rhino and Rothschild\u2019s giraffe). They are home to over 100 species of migratory birds and support globally important populations of black-necked grebe, African spoonbill, pied avocet, little grebe, yellow-billed stork, black-winged stilt, grey-headed gull and gull-billed tern. The area makes a critical contribution to the conservation of the natural values within the Great Rift Valley, and is an integral part of the most important route of the African-Eurasian flyway system, along which billions of birds travel from northern breeding grounds to African wintering places. The shallow soda lakes of the Eastern Rift represent a unique ecosystem based on alkaline-tolerant blue-green algae and zoo- plankton, whose high productivity in the warm, strongly insolated water supports huge populations of lesser and greater flamingos respectively, these birds being highly adapted to exploit these resources. Three of these lakes in Kenya, namely Bogoria, Nakuru and Elmenteita form a \u2018serial\u2019 World Heritage Site called the Lake System in the Great Rift Valley (Box 8). Together these areas present an exceptional range of geological and biological pro- cesses of exceptional natural beauty, including falls, geysers, hot springs, open waters and marshes, forests and open grasslands, all concentrated in a relatively small area. The massed congre- gations of birds on the shores of the lakes, including up to 1.4 mil- lion lesser flamingos that move between the lakes against the backdrop of the Great Rift Valley, constitute an exceptional nat- ural phenomenon of global significance. Lake Natron to the south in Tanzania is the lesser flamingo\u2019s major nesting site and the aim in due course, as reflected in the official Action Plan for the species, is to include this lake into the World Heritage Site as well. The Western or Albertine Rift contains another chain of lakes running south from Uganda, through the DRC to Tanzania and beyond. With one exception, these are fresh and include the larg- est, deepest and oldest of all the Rift Valley Lakes. From north to south these are Lakes Albert, Edward, Kivu and Tanganyika (at 32 000 km\u00b2 and more than 1 400 m deep, this is the largest and deepest of the Rift Valley Lakes, and the second deepest fresh- water lake on the planet). Rukwa is the alkaline exception. The lakes continue south out of Eastern Africa with Lakes Malawi, Malombe and Chilwa. ",
        "| 131 #2 | 131 Special features of the Eastern African region Lake Victoria with an area of 68 800 km\u00b2 is the largest lake in Africa. It is not in the Rift Valley however, occupying a depression formed between the two arms by the uplift of the rifts to either side. Its catchment is of huge economic importance (see Box 9). The freshwater lakes of the Albertine Rift Valley are home to an extraordinary number of endemic fish species, including most notably some 1 500 cichlid species. The species radiations of cichlids in these lakes rival radiations of terrestrial fauna in the Galapagos, and serve as a classic example of evolutionary adap- tation (Box 10). In addition to their biodiversity and tourism values, all the lakes support commercially important fisheries that sustain the liveli- hoods of the millions of people living on their shores. The river systems of Eastern Africa are dominated by the Nile, the longest river in the world, which runs for more than 75 % of its length through the region before entering Egypt. The White Nile rises in the catchments of Lakes Victoria, Albert and Edward and flows north through Uganda and the Sudans to Khartoum, where it is joined by the Blue Nile, whose source, Lake Tana, lies in the Ethiopian highlands north of the Rift Valley and is thus not a Rift Valley Lake 24 . The region\u2019s other major river systems include the Omo in Ethiopia, the Tana, Mara and Ewaso Ngiro in Kenya, and the Rufiji and Pangani in Tanzania. Eastern Africa contains many wetlands associated with its lakes and rivers. Uganda has the most, including 12 Ramsar sites. The largest and perhaps the most important is the massive swamp on the Nile in South Sudan known as the Sudd (see Box 11). The deltas of the following rivers form important wetlands: the Omo (Ethiopia/Kenya) draining into Lake Turkana; the Ruvuma and Rufiji 25 (Tanzania) and the Kagera (Rwanda) draining into Lake Victoria; and the Tana (Kenya). The Ewaso Ngiro (Kenya) drains into an inland delta known as the Lorian Swamp. Other wetlands of note include the Kilombero, Ihefu and Malagarasi (Tanzania) and the Kyoga (Uganda). All contain exceptional biodiversity, of which hippos, crocodiles, shoebill storks and sitatunga antelope are symbolic. Some famous wetlands are created by upwellings of groundwater draining off mountains, such as the Amboseli swamps linked to Kilimanjaro, and the Mzima Springs linked to the Chyulu Hills, whose waters supply the cities of Mombasa and Nairobi. The fact that all the wetlands and mountains just mentioned are in national parks underlines their importance 26 . Box 9. The Lake Victoria basin The Lake Victoria basin is located in the centre of Eastern Africa and covers an area of 194 000 km 2 , of which 7 % is in Burundi, 22 % in Kenya, 11 % in Rwanda, 44 % in Tanzania and 16 % in Uganda. The lake basin contains Lake Victoria, the second largest lake in the world with an area of 68 800 km 2 , and a number of satellite lakes and rivers (including the threatened Yala Swamp complex IBA), which are fringed in many places by extensive wetlands. About 35 million people (about 30 % of the entire population of Eastern Africa) are estimated to live and derive their livelihood directly or indirectly from the basin. Lake Victoria supports one of the largest freshwater fisheries in the world, which by 2007 was producing about 1 million tons of fish annually, valued at between USD 300-400 million. Until the Nile Perch was introduced, the lake had high fish diversity of over 500 species, most of which were endemic to the lake and of economic and scientific value. The Lake Victoria Basin Commission maintains an \u2018aquatic biodiversity meta-database\u2019. The lake provides water for irrigation, hydropower generation, industrial and domestic use, and modulates local climate. Box 10. Albertine Rift Valley Lakess The Albertine Rift Valley Lakes are well known for the extensive radiations of fish species in the family Cichlidae . Large numbers of cichlid species live adjacent to one another along the edges of the lakes, having evolved specialisations to take advantage of their environment and to limit competition for resources. For example, one unusual group of fish, the scale-eaters, feed exclusively on the scales of other fish. Most cichlids are mouth-brooders in which the young swim into their parent\u2019s mouth for protection in the face of imminent danger. Cichlids are not the only fish unique to these lakes; copepods, ostracods, shrimps, crabs, and molluscs are also represented by high numbers of endemic species. ( 24 ) Like them, however, it supports a unique fish fauna, comprising a group of cyprinid fish that are all descended from a common ancestor (called a \u2018species flock\u2019). This cyprinid species flock is one of only two known in the world, and the only one that is still intact. ( 25 ) The Rufiji delta is part of the Rufiji-Mafia-Kilwa Marine Ramsar Site.

Mangrove forests constitute a unique inter-tidal ecosystem that not only provides habitat and breeding areas for many species, some of them economically important (e.g. crabs and prawns), but also the wood is used for building poles much valued for their strength and durability. They also inhibit coastal erosion, a free service that offsets the huge cost of any engineered solution. Sea grass beds support turtles and the dugong, a large grazing sea mammal. The dugong was once relatively plentiful off the Red Sea coasts of Sudan and Eritrea but its present status there and in Somali waters is uncertain. Further south, sea grass beds are discontinuous and dugongs rare. Coral reefs are well known as spectacular hotspots of biodiversity, and those of Eastern Africa are no exception. The best-known reefs are those protected in marine national parks such as Kiunga, Malindi and Watamu in Kenya, and Mafia Island in Tanzania (Box 12). These and many other reefs are important tourist attractions, being enjoyed by scuba divers, snorkelers and people in glass-bottomed boats. The overall diversity of East African coastal waters is astounding, estimated at some 11 000 species of marine life. This includes many species of marine mammal, including humpback whales, dolphins and dugongs. All five species of sea turtle living in the Indian Ocean are found along the East African coast, and nest on its undisturbed beaches. Big game fish, such as marlin and sail- fish, are plentiful and attract large numbers of sport fishermen. Whale sharks, the biggest fish in the world, are common and a tourist attraction in their own right. Box 11. The Sudd wetland The Sudd is one of the largest tropical wetlands in the world, located in South Sudan in the lower reaches of Bahr el Jebel, a section of the White Nile. It is composed of various eco- systems, from open water and submerged vegetation to floating fringe vegetation, seasonally inundated woodland, rain-fed and river-fed grasslands, and floodplain scrubland. Seasonally it hosts the great migratory populations of white-eared kob and tiang. Notable resident wildlife includes South Sudan\u2019s largest remaining elephant population, Nile lechwe and shoebill storks. In addition it is an important wintering ground for migratory birds, and contains a number of endemic fish, bird, mammal and plant species. The wetland serves as a filter that controls water quality and as a sponge that stabilises water flow. It is a major source of water for domestic livestock and wildlife, and an important source of fish. The socio-economic and cultural activities of local people are dependent on its annual floods to regenerate floodplain grasses to feed their cattle as they move from permanent settlements on the highlands to dry-season grazing around the swamp. \u2303 Fishermen in the vast wetland area known as the Sudd situated in the lower reaches of the Bahr el Jebel, a section of the White Nile in South Sudan.

They belong to the oldest known living lineage of sarcopterygii (lobe- finned fish and tetrapods), which means they are more closely related to lungfish, reptiles and mammals than to the common ray-finned fishes. The West Indian Ocean coelacanth is a critically endangered species, and a marine park to help protect it has been proposed along 100 km stretch of coastline between the Pangani River and Tanga. Since there are only two species of coelacanth and both are threatened, it is the most endangered order of animals in the world. Amidst this tremendous biodiversity, the coastal zone is also home to millions of mostly poor people, many of who rely almost entirely on marine resources. Threats to these resources thus also threaten their livelihoods. The important indigenous tuna fishing industry of Zanzibar is threatened by commercial operations, to give just one of many similar examples. 1.7 Transformed ecosystems The descriptions above all relate to the different types of eco- system in an undisturbed state. The greater proportion of each, however, has already been disturbed and the process continues inexorably. Such \u2018transformed\u2019 ecosystems are generally over- looked by conservationists. In an African context, ecosystems that have lost their charismatic megafauna are often dismissed as having little residual biodiversity or other value. This of course is a mistake, because many disturbed ecosystems continue to host an important variety of plants, birds, small mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects and invertebrates, some of significant eco- nomic importance (e.g. as pollinators). This does not mean that such areas are a priority, but as the process of habitat fragmen- tation and transformation continues to erode fully intact eco- systems, depleted habitats will take on an increasing importance, just as they have historically in the developed nations of Europe in particular. In many of those countries, the conservation of essentially man-made ecosystems, such as wildflower meadows and hedgerows, are now a priority. Over time, the management of biodiversity in transformed ecosystems, including mosaics of undisturbed patches with agricultural land, will become more important and require greater attention in Africa as well. The Kinangop Highland Grasslands in Kenya is a good example in this category. The entire habitat is in the hands of private landowners, whose sensitisation by local conservation organisations, particu- larly Nature Kenya (BirdLife in Kenya), catalysed the formation of the Friends of the Kinangop Plateau. Nature Kenya has used 195 acres of the grassland to set up breeding reserves for the globally threatened and endemic Sharpe\u2019s longclaw and other endemic fauna. Box 12. The Mafia Island seascape The Mafia Island seascape arguably contains the finest representative complex of characteristic tropical marine habitats and species in Eastern Africa. It includes Rufiji Delta, which has the largest intact block of relatively well-protected mangrove forest in the region (540 km 2 ). There are extensive and diverse coral reefs around Mafia and the Songosongo Archipelago that are relatively resilient to coral bleaching. There are also extensive sea grasses, algal beds and intertidal flats; the area contains habitats important to sharks, rays and turtles; coelacanths have been caught there; and the number of seabird species is very high. This variety of habitat gives rise to some of the highest marine species diversity in the region. \u2303 Overall diversity of East African coastal waters is astounding, estimated at some 11 000 species of marine life.

Probably the biggest threat to biodiversity conservation in any region of Africa is the fact that the consumptive utilisation of natural resources is invariably both destructive and unsustainable. It is also, with extremely few exceptions, either illegal or very poorly regulated. This is a huge topic that can only be summarised here, as it concerns both domestic and international demand, involves both plants and animals, occurs in all types of ecosystem, and operates at both generalised and species-specific levels. Of the three forms of generalised utilisation that have the most serious negative impacts, two involve animals and one involves plants. The hunting of terrestrial wildlife for food, or \u2018bushmeat\u2019 as it is more generally known, has long been recognised as a severe threat to the food resources of indigenous peoples and to wildlife populations in the forests of West and Central Africa, but far less attention has been focused on the issue in savannah areas, in part due to the misconception that illegal hunting for bushmeat in savannahs is a small-scale phenomenon practised for subsist- ence living. Recent reports confirm that widespread illegal hunting and bushmeat trading occurs on a much greater scale in the savannahs of Eastern and Southern Africa than previously thought 27, 28, 29 , and should be viewed with the same levels of concern as it is in other parts of Africa. The analysis of bushmeat trading and related recommendations given in this report\u2019s chap- ter on Central Africa therefore are also very relevant to the East- ern region (see Chapter 3, Sections 2.1.1, 4.10 and 5.4). The hunting of aquatic wildlife for food, or fishing , is another massive issue that could merit a separate chapter but can only be touched on here. All Eastern Africa\u2019s fisheries, whether fresh- water or marine, are threatened by unsustainable offtake. The most important and threatening form of generalised plant- based utilisation is deforestation . The direct consumption of forest resources occurs to satisfy two principal needs: timber and fuel 30 . The resulting degradation and loss of forest cover and diversity then of course impacts all forest-dependent animal spe- cies as well, not to mention the adverse impacts on the ecosystem services of forests (e.g. as water catchments). Not only is there a strong domestic demand for timber and poles for building and furniture, but an international one too, principally from India. The scale of the international timber trade in some countries, such as Tanzania, is massive and contributes to widespread forest degradation and clearance 31 . As is the case elsewhere, wood fuels play a major role in supplying the energy needs of the people in Eastern Africa. The need for wood fuels arises from the low electrification rate in these developing countries, as well as unreliability and expense where electricity is available. In Tanzania, energy from wood fuels account for 90 % of the country\u2019s energy consumption. Of these wood fuels, charcoal is a prevalent choice, especially in urban settings where ease of transport and low storage space are of high importance. The domestic demand for charcoal is huge and increasing as pop- ulation growth leads to an even greater need for energy sources. ( 27 ) Jambiya G., S.A.H. Milledge and N.

The Environmental Crime Crisis: Threats to Sustainable Development from Illegal Exploitation and Trade in Wildlife and Forest Resources, UNEP and Interpol. In Somalia, however, supply exceeds local demand, and huge quantities are being exported illegally through the southern ports of Kismayu and Barawe. A report by the UN\u2019s Somalia-Eritrea Monitoring Group released in October 2014 provides strong evi- dence that this trade constitutes a major source of finance for the activities of the notorious rebel militia, Al Shabaab. The report alleges that attempts to regulate this trade have been ineffective, partly due to the complicity of elements of the occupying Kenyan forces. Trading in charcoal and taxing the ports have generated an estimated annual total of USD 38-56 million for this organi- sation. The overall value of the illicit charcoal exported from Somalia has been estimated at USD 360-384 million per year 32 ; harvesting at this rate must be unsustainable in the long term. The ever-growing demand for charcoal all over Africa creates many sustainability challenges. Without intervention, the busi- ness-as-usual model for charcoal will not only rob future gener- ations of their ability to meet their energy needs, but will rob Africa of its native forests, their biodiversity and their services. Whether for timber or fuel, deforestation and forest degradation have long been a problem throughout Eastern Africa. Charcoal production and the use of wood fuels in general are certainly contributors, but it is the illegal harvesting of the trees without reforestation and the lack of good forest and trade management oversight that are the fundamental causes of forest loss. Some natural-resource value chains are species specific, and the illegal poaching and trafficking activities needed to meet demand are among the commonest contributory factors to a species becoming endangered. The issue of the trade in wildlife generally, and endangered species in particular, is of such great and over- riding importance to conservation throughout Africa, not just in the East, that it is described and analysed in a separate, dedicated section of this report (see Chapter 5, Section 3). Some observa- tions specific to Eastern Africa are given in Box 13. The trade in some items is driven by the extraordinarily high prices consumers are prepared to pay. Elephant ivory can fetch more than USD 3 000 per kilo, unworked billets of African blackwood sell at USD 20 000 per cubic meter, and rhino horn over USD 60 000 per kilo. Due to the fact that they are so gravely threatened by the trade in their parts, and because of their great economic and ecological importance, the conservation of elephants and rhinos is also covered in separate, dedicated sections (see Chapter 5, Sections 1 and 2). It can be noted here that the consumptive utilisation of wildlife is not limited to dead materials. The trade in live specimens for zoos, laboratories and the pet trade generally has a serious impact on some species. Examples from Eastern Africa include many primate species, including gorillas and chimpanzees, birds and reptiles, and the supply of cichlid fish for aquaria. State-sanctioned hunting based on official quotas is supposedly sustainable and so it not discussed here. The licensed hunting of certain \u2018big game\u2019 species is available in Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia but not Kenya, where it was banned in 1977; only certain game birds may still be shot. \u2303 A Somalian soldier walks past a consignment of charcoal destined for the export market in the port town of Barawe, soon after it was recaptured from Al Shebaab terrorists who were heavily involved in the charcoal trade.

As habitat conversion increases, so does HWC and its impacts on crops, livestock and humans themselves. Many lives, principally animal but also human, are lost in the process. Crop damage in Eastern Africa is caused by many species includ- ing insects (locusts and army worms), birds (quelea) and mam- mals (rodents, monkeys, pigs). By far the most serious problems, however, are caused by the largest of all, the elephant. Not only does it either consume or damage on a grand scale, it is also a direct danger to humans, many of whom lose their lives to crop- raiding elephants. The main impact on livestock comes from large predators, which are the first to be affected by a shortage of natural prey, namely lion, leopard and hyaena, and occasionally cheetah and wild dog. Control measures \u2013 frequently done illegally \u2013 include shooting, trapping, poisoning, repelling, scaring and fencing. Predators, especially lions, are baited with poisoned meat, and their car- casses are then consumed by vultures and other scavengers, all of which perish in turn. The concept of HWC can also be extended to issues such as pollution (both industrial and agricultural), and the indiscriminate use of pesticides and herbicides, both of which can have devas- tating impacts on biodiversity. Introduced and invasive species too are a form of HWC because, in the final analysis, their introduction is invariably anthropogenic. The most potent invasive species threaten biodiversity on an ecosystem scale. A few notable examples of great contemporary concern in Eastern Africa include Parthenium , which threatens grassland productivity (thus threatening livestock as well as wild- life) 33 , mesquite ( Prosopis juliflora ) and prickly-pear ( Opuntia spp), both capable of transforming bushlands, and the water hyacinth ( Eichornia crassipes ), which has affected both fish and fishermen in the lakes, with huge economic consequences. Of historical note is the fact that the introduction of the predatory Nile perch ( Lates niloticus ) into Lake Victoria in 1956 contributed to the extinction of that lake\u2019s own unique cichlid fish fauna. Box 13. Wildlife trafficking in Eastern Africa Due to its strategic location, the Horn of Africa has been identified as both a source and transit route for illegal wildlife trade in ivory, rhino horn, live animals, shark fins, corals and other wildlife products between Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The April 2013 issue of Africa Geographic states that Kenya is a principal exit point for ivory leaving Africa, and this is acknowledged by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and Interpol *. The majority of recent large seizures of illicit ivory made anywhere in the world were exported from either Kenya or Tanzania, largely through the massive container ports of Mombasa and Dar es Salaam. Since ivory comes from many places and is distributed to buyers across Asia, these ports represent a vital checkpoint in the trafficking network. Addis Ababa in Ethiopia and Khartoum in Sudan contain two active ivory markets and have also been identified as key source and transit smuggling routes.

        "#2 | 139 #2 Conservation issues and challenges \u2303 Human elephant conflict is increasingly frequent in Africa as human populations increase and elephant habitat shrinks. 2.1.3 Inadequate PA systems The traditional state-led approach to wildlife conservation com- mon to all countries in Eastern Africa has been through the estab- lishment and management of protected areas (PAs), such as national parks, forest reserves, etc. In many countries, PA systems date back to colonial times, when the criteria used for selection were not as well developed as they are today. Ideally a PA system should include examples of all significant ecosystems in the coun- try, and provide protection to all of its endemic and rare species. Looked in this way, most PA systems have gaps which govern- ments are slow to fill. Apart from gaps, it is increasingly being realised that many PAs are poorly sited, and less than ideal in terms of size and shape. Thus, especially in cases where a PA protects only part of an ecosystem, insufficient thought was given to possible future scenarios in which it might become an isolated island. Consequently, opportunities to create optimal ecological connectivity were and still are being ignored, rendering PAs far less resilient than they might otherwise be. Apart from such shortcomings in design, many PAs exist only on paper with few if any staff assigned to manage them. This is certainly true of the countries most affected by chronic civil strife, like Somalia and South Sudan, but is also true, to differing extents, of countries that have been slow to invest in PAs for lack of economic and/or political incentive, which means all of them other than Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Even the latter, whose PA systems underpin extremely important tourism industries, finds it difficult to keep its management authorities well enough resourced to enforce wildlife policies and laws to their full effect (see also Section 2.2.5). 2.1.4 Fragmentation, transformation and loss of natural ecosystems No ecosystem is immune to fragmentation and transformation: it follows that such processes constitute the most important threat to ecosystem-level services. One of the most obvious and impor- tant examples is provided by forest where degradation results in soil erosion, ecological instability due to loss of biodiversity, and ultimately loss of functionality as a water catchment. The degradation and loss of forest cover caused by the demand and supply of timber and fuel was discussed above (Section 2.1.1), but it is also caused by outright clearance at different scales. Forest encroachment by peasant farmers clearing small subsist- ence farms is an insidious and near universal phenomenon strongly correlated with human population growth: as such it is cumulatively massive. Overstocking and overgrazing in relation to carrying capacity is common, and has led to range degradation, desertification and biodiversity loss over vast areas of arid, semi-arid and savannah land (see Section 1.4). Invasive species too can transform eco- systems, and their susceptibility to invasion can be increased by overgrazing and climate change (see Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.6). Large-scale clearances and land-use conversions occur as part of the formal development agenda, and can affect any type of ecosystem, not just forest. In addition to immediate local extinc- tions, they threaten to create many problems relating to isolation and lack of connectivity between existing PAs. For example, the Galana/Kalalu food security project in Kenya will bring a million acres under irrigation in an area adjacent to Tsavo East NP, for- merly noted for the development of game ranching; the impacts of abstraction on the Tana river and its nearby delta, a wetland ",

Such \u2018hard edge\u2019 parks are typical of the fertile highlands along the Albertine Rift where human population densities are among the highest of Africa. of national and international importance, will be significant. There are dozens of other examples of big schemes from all over East- ern Africa that could be quoted, involving crops as varied as sugar cane, rice, maize, soya, oil palm and even controversial biofuels like Jatropha . The intensification and commercialisation of exist- ing smallholder agriculture through investment in so-called Agri- cultural Growth Corridors is also gaining momentum throughout Africa 34 . These schemes too can contribute to the further isolation and lack of connectivity between existing PAs. An example from Eastern Africa is the massive SAGCOT programme in southern Tanzania, some of whose priority areas fall in or near KLCs (see Section 5.3), where plans to expand irrigation are a particular concern. Fortunately SAGCOT has established a multi-stakeholder Green Reference Group to guide the identification and mitigation of environmental risks and damage, and to the same end has formed partnerships with a number of international conservation non-governmental organisations (NGOs) through projects such as SUSTAIN (Sustainability and Inclusion Strategy for Growth Corridors in Africa, an International Union for the Conservation of Nature/African Wildlife Foundation \u2013 IUCN/AWF initiative funded by the Netherlands), and Vital Signs (a Conservation Inter- national-led programme funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foun- dation). Hopefully this collaborative model will be followed in other corridors. Large-scale habitat impacts are not limited to agricultural schemes. Extraction and infrastructure projects also invariably incur negative impacts on ecosystems and their inherent bio- diversity 35 . Among controversial examples from Eastern Africa is the excision of nearly 20 000 ha from the Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania to mine uranium \u2013 despite it being a World Heritage Site. Also in Tanzania, and also in a World Heritage Site, a proposal to build a major highway right across the path of the Serengeti migration threatens the viability of that amazing phenomenon, one also shared by Kenya. Measures to develop a large oil field in the middle of Murchison Falls National Park and adjacent con- servation areas in Uganda are far advanced, and a similar threat hangs over the Sudd, in South Sudan, the biggest wetland in Eastern Africa. Proposals to develop a soda ash plant on Lake Natron, Tanzania recur frequently, despite the threat this poses to the one and only flamingo breeding ground on which the entire Rift Valley population depends. Many more examples of similar non-agricultural development threats could be cited, including major dams in Ethiopia especially. Habitat fragmentation is a particularly serious threat to wide- ranging species that need very extensive home ranges, such as elephant, wild dog and cheetah. The same applies to the migra- tory populations of certain species (e.g. wildebeest). 2.1.5 Infrastructure, oil, gas and mining development The boom in East African oil and gas development is well under way, with Uganda, Tanzania and Mozambique being the front-runners. In addition to exploration and extraction, land-locked countries such as Uganda face challenges with exporting the oil \u2013 indeed with all oil and gas, and other hard rock mineral extraction, comes the need for substantial infrastructure development: pipelines, roads, rail- ways and ports. Depending on remoteness this can often result in far-reaching environmental damage and biodiversity loss, in addi- tion to the oil and gas infrastructure in itself. ( 34 ) Weng L., A.K.

Over a quarter of leased oil and gas concessions in Africa overlap with protected areas, including World Heritage Sites. The effects of oil and gas development range from immigration and increased bushmeat hunting to permanent settlement, land- use changes and biodiversity impacts. For example, in the case of Uganda, South Sudan, Kenya (Turkana oil fields) and Ethiopia, the development of the LAPPSET transport corridor and deep-sea port in Lamu (Kenya) is driven by the need to export oil, but has many other developments associated with it (airports, roads, set- tlements, deep sea port). 2.1.6 Climate change Global warming will induce climate change in Eastern Africa as elsewhere, but its impact over so large an area will vary from place to place. A general prediction, however, is that while mean annual temperature will increase, rainfall will remain much the same quantitatively, although its temporal distribution will change. Rainy seasons will alter (\u2018short\u2019 rains getting longer, \u2018long\u2019 rains shorter) and become more intense. An increase is expected in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, primarily droughts and floods, and these will occur in new locations. To date in Eastern Africa, adverse climate change impacts have been observed through a rise in sea level, which has already led to infrastructure destruction along the coast and the submer- gence of some small islands in the Indian ocean (e.g. Maziwe and Fungu la Nyani), intrusion of seawater into freshwater wells along the Tanzanian coast, beach erosion in Kenya, and inland, rampant floods and droughts across the region. Various studies indicate that the deep-water temperatures of lakes Edward, Albert, Kivu, Victoria, Tanganyika and Nyasa, which reflect long-term trends, have risen by 0.2 \u00b0 to 0.7 \u00b0C since the early 1900s. Since 1912, the area of Mt Kilimanjaro\u2019s ice fields has decreased so far by between 50 % and 80 %. It has been estimated that if current trends persist, the remaining ice fields are likely to disappear between 2015 and 2020. Moreover, the Ruwenzori ice-cap field has decreased from 563 ha to being currently less than 50 ha. As noted, the glaciers of Africa are already all in retreat and as general warming proceeds, the band in which climatic conditions remain compatible with the Afro-alpine ecosystem will get smaller and smaller as it moves upwards over an ever-diminish- ing surface area. Thus these uniquely biodiverse and important ecosystems are highly endangered by climate change, as are the many rare and endemic species found only in them. With a more intense rainfall pattern, dry intervals may become longer, rains may also fail more often, and bush fires become more common. This will have a variety of consequences, but one likely scenario is that the already great extent of over-grazed rangeland in Eastern Africa will become even greater, essentially driving desertification and pushing pastoralists more and more into woodlands and forests. Climate change-related phenomena also threaten marine eco- systems, notably coral reef death due to \u2018bleaching\u2019, which is associated with rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification. This phenomenon has been noted in East African waters. #2 ",

These are the often interrelated forces or circumstances that create the threats in the first place. It follows that if the fundamental drivers can be identified, and work done to reduce or remove them, bio- diversity and species loss will be slowed and in some cases halted. 2.2.1 Market forces The increasingly high value being put on natural resources as they become scarcer generates powerful market forces, as exemplified by ivory and rhino horn. As is fully discussed in Chapter 5 (Sections 1, 2 and 3), counteracting these forces requires action along the entire value chain, but as long as there is demand, protective action at the supply end will remain an essential pre-requisite. The high demands and prices generated by end-consumers have encouraged certain rebel militias and terrorist groups to enter the value chain 36 . Such groups often hide out in wilderness areas, and are always in need of funds to support their operations. For out- lawed organisations such as these, the risk-return ratio for poach- ing wildlife is irresistible. This is a notable problem in Eastern Africa where there is evidence that the Somali faction Al Shabaab trades opportunistically in and runs protection rackets involving charcoal (definitely), ivory (probably) and rhino horn (possibly). The Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) of Uganda has been for many years hiding in and around the Garamba NP in the eastern DRC, and is heavily implicated in not just a crash in elephant numbers, but also the total extinction of the world\u2019s biggest, and almost certainly last, population of wild northern white rhino. Sudan also provides examples of this type of operation. The horse- mounted Arab militia known as the Janjaweed, which operates out of Darfur, is known to have mounted elephant poaching raids far to the west, including into Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR) and even Cameroon, where they massacred 450 elephants in the Bouba N\u2019Djida NP. Ivory is particularly attractive to Suda- nese groups, as there is still a domestic ivory market in Khartoum that proves the existence of established trade routes. The coasts of Sudan, Eritrea and Somalia offer innumerable means of export in dhows to middle-eastern entrep\u00f4ts. 2.2.2 Population growth Whether directly or indirectly, inexorable human population growth underlies not only all the threats outlined in the section above, but the other fundamental drivers described in this section as well. Population trends for the continent as a whole are given in the summary document \u2013 Synthesis, Sections 1.4 and 2.4.1. More people need more food, more water, more energy and more space. All these can only be found at the expense of natural ecosystems, a fact emphasised in all chapters of this study. Chap- ter 1, Section 2.1.1 provides a good example from Southern Africa of how population can, and ever increasingly will, build up around protected areas 37 . \u2303 Confiscated carved ivory objects are placed out to be crushed in New York\u2019s Times Square in June 2015. Over a ton of confiscated ivory was destroyed. ( 36 ) The involvement of militias and rebel groups in ivory poaching and smuggling is nothing new. During the late 1970s and 1980s, both the National Union for the Total Independence in Angola (UNITA) and the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) were heavily involved in the killing of elephants and the export of illegal ivory. ( 37 ) The map presented as Figure 7 in Chapter 1 (Southern Africa) shows settlement trends around Lake Kariba and the Matusadona NP in Zimbabwe. ",
        "#2 | 143 #2 Conservation issues and challenges 2.2.3 Poverty Poverty is a fundamental driver of forest encroachment and poaching. It is also a function of population growth: the larger the number of people sharing a finite resource, the poorer they become. It is this reality that drives the big governmental food, water and energy development programmes which reinforce the impact of population growth on natural resource depletion. It also represents a long-term threat to the success of community-based natural resource management approaches (see Section 3.7). 2.2.4 Under-valuation of ecosystem services and biodiversity An appreciation of natural ecosystem service values has gained much ground over the past decade, thanks especially to aware- ness of climate change issues. Consequently the value of forests in particular, which, in Eastern Africa especially, provide such an important water catchment function, is increasingly well under- stood. Despite this, such services continue to be under-valued when it comes to a confrontation with a development project. In other words, the real costs of degrading and destroying natural ecosystems are still not properly or accurately reflected in the economic analyses on which development decisions are based. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedures are anyway often flawed and corruptible. Thus cases for considering alterna- tive, less costly, more sustainable solutions are continually avoided, meaning the attrition of natural ecosystems remains biased towards being far greater than it need be. Other less tangible, non-economic values, such as existence val- ues attributable to particular species, have no real impact on the development agendas of most East African countries. An exist- ence value remains an essentially western concept that has very little momentum beyond some elements of the emerging middle class in countries like Kenya. 2.2.5 Weak governance and corruption All the threats to ecosystems and biodiversity outlined earlier could be prevented, mitigated or rectified but for weak govern- ance. The term \u2018governance\u2019 as used here embraces all of the policies, laws, areas and institutions established for the purpose of biodiversity conservation and management. Inevitably, the importance of these various weaknesses varies between countries. Generally speaking, within Eastern Africa at least, wildlife and forest authorities are consistently underfunded and understaffed. This is true even of countries like Kenya and Tanzania where tourism provides a strong economic incentive to value wildlife, to the extent that some authorities generate much more for Treasuries than is ever re-invested in them. This means there tends to be a constant shortage of transport, equipment and recurrent operating budgets. Obtaining significant investment capital for new buildings, for example, is always a struggle. Similarly the manpower available is always less than is needed to do the job properly, and in terms of training, skill levels are gener- ally better aligned to responsibilities among lower ranks, and much less so at middle (e.g. PA manager) and director levels. This is partly due to flawed human resource management procedures (e.g. for recruitment, in-service training and performance-based promotion), and partly due to the prevalence of political appointees in top jobs. Last but not least, the salaries paid to field staff in particular are seldom commensurate with the hardship and dangers involved, let alone the simple cost of living. These weaknesses are not limited to wildlife and forest authori- ties; they also apply to those other agencies that are becoming increasingly involved in the enforcement of wildlife policies and laws, including customs, police, the military and the judiciary. Many officers find themselves in roles they are not competent to fulfil, and dissatisfaction with conditions of service and personal benefits leads to corruption, which is common within all the ser- vices mentioned and can occur at all levels. Whether by deliberate neglect, or active participation, corruption is a fundamental driver of the illegal consumption of, and trade in, wildlife. Key officials at different levels are easily bribed to facilitate crime, and wildlife rangers are often found to be com- plicit in poaching and even engage in it themselves. EIA officials can suppress negative impacts, but even military units engaged in anti-terrorism will succumb to the same temptations as their quarry: units of the Ugandan army searching for the LRA in Garamba NP allegedly killed elephants and rhinos there, and removed the trophies by helicopter. Similarly, the Kenyan military in Somalia is now said to be benefiting from the export of charcoal from Kismayu, a trade formerly controlled by Al Shabaab. Wars, rebellions and insecurity are strong indicators of poor gov- ernance, and will often take a direct as well as an indirect toll on wildlife. In sustained conflict this can be huge, as in Uganda throughout the 1970s when the entire national park system was vandalised and elephants, rhinos and all other species were dec- imated by the warring factions. As recent events in South Sudan and CAR remind us, the spectre of civil war is never too far away in Africa. ",

        "146 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Eastern Africa T his section considers the conservation approaches and actions that have been, are being and could be taken to counter the threats to ecosystem and biodiversity conser- vation in Eastern Africa, and to lessen the prevalence and power of their underlying drivers. Research carried out for this report revealed that not only is the amount of relevant action already initiated in all countries of the region immense, but that the number of actors is also, ranging from regional bodies, national governments, intergovernmental organisations (IGOs) and multi-lateral donors, bilateral donors, NGOs and civil society organisations (CSOs). For example, as of November 2013, the database maintained by the Development Partners Group on Environment (DPG-E) in Tanzania held 125 records of active programmes and projects in five categories 38 , with a total value of EUR 561.6 million. As a direct consequence therefore, this section provides a succinct overview of what is going on in the region, using a selection of examples relevant to the different approaches being applied. 3.1 Planning frameworks The overall response of countries in Eastern Africa to environ- mental management issues relevant to biodiversity conservation is influenced and guided by a number of international, pan-African, regional and national agendas. 3.1.1 International Most countries in the region are party to a number of multi-lateral environmental agreements. Some of the most relevant and influ- ential of these conventions are (short titles only): \u2022 Ramsar Wetlands 1971 \u2022 World Heritage Convention 1972 \u2022 CITES 1975 \u2022 Bonn Migratory Species 1979 \u2022 Marine and Coastal Environment of the Western Indian Ocean 1985 \u2022 Biological Diversity 1992 \u2022 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 1992 \u2022 International Tropical Timber Agreement 1994 \u2022 UN Convention to Combat Desertification 1994. The countries of Eastern Africa are also members of the Interna- tional Union for the Conservation of Nature (the IUCN, previously known as The World Conservation Union), which through its var- ious commissions sets the international management criteria and standards for different categories of PA, and coordinates efforts to conserve a wide range of plant and animal taxa of importance and concern. Virtually all these treaties and bodies require their Member States to produce some sort of national action plan: a few examples include National Biodiversity Strategy Action Plans (NBSAPs) under the Con- vention on Biological Diversity (CBD); Ivory Action Plans under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES); and a huge range of species-specific action plans at regional and/or national levels driven by the Specialist Groups of IUCN\u2019s Species Survival Commission. Thus many East African countries have action plans relating to these and many other taxa: elephant, rhino, lion, hyaena, giraffe, great ape, lesser flamingo and so on. Whilst external assistance in the preparation of all these multiple types of plan is generally forthcoming, this is not necessarily the case when it comes to their implementation. 3.1.2 Pan-African The East African countries\u2019 overall response is also influenced by the pan-African and regional political bodies to which they belong. The African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) for example has developed an action plan for the Environment Initiative of the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD), and commissions the United Nations Environment Pro- gramme\u2019s (UNEP) Africa Environment Outlook , a comprehensive regional report on the state of Africa\u2019s environment. >3 _ Ongoing conservation efforts ( 38 ) Natural resources sector support, biodiversity, environment, climate change and NGO support. ",
        "#2 | 147 #2 Ongoing conservation efforts 3.1.3 Regional The principal regional groupings to which the East African coun- tries recognised in this report belong are the East African Com- munity (EAC) 39 , the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA) 40 , Central African Forest Commission (COMIFAC) 41 , Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) 42 and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) 43 . The most relevant in a conservation context are the EAC and the IGAD. The EAC recognises an environment and natural resource man- agement sector 44 , for which it has instituted both a sectoral coun- cil and a committee, and for which it hosts regular meetings at both Ministerial and Permanent Secretary levels. The focal topics are climate change, biosafety, water resource management, and mines and mining. The dominant statutory EAC institutions in the sector are the Lake Victoria Basin Authority and Lake Victoria Fisheries Organisation. In 2005, the EAC promulgated an East African Protocol on Natural Resource Management, which has still not been ratified by all parties 45 . In 2012, the East African Legislative Assembly passed the East African Community Trans- boundary Ecosystems Bill, and in August 2013 it passed a Reso- lution urging partner states to take concerted action to end the massacre of elephants and the trafficking of ivory. Within the EAC Secretariat, wildlife management issues are grouped with tourism, and the implementation of all related decisions is guided by the Sectoral Council on Tourism and Wildlife Manage- ment. In 2009, a decision was made to develop a legal and reg- ulatory framework for collaboration in the tourism and wildlife sectors. To this end, two main activities are in the process of being implemented: \u2022 the development of a Protocol for Tourism and Wildlife Management; \u2022 harmonisation of policies and laws in tourism and wildlife management. The EAC Secretariat considers the Protocol to have reached an advanced stage, but the current draft is very heavily biased towards tourism and remains extremely weak with respect to wildlife man- agement, not least because it fails to seize the opportunity to establish clear policies and procedures for the co-management of TFCAs. Regarding the harmonisation of policies and laws, the EAC had by mid-2014 just finalised a study to analyse and compare the relevant policies and laws in each partner state to inform the process of drafting harmonised legal instruments. Eventually, the establishment of an East African Tourism and Wildlife Coordinating Agency is envisaged to act as a regulatory body for the EAC. ( 39 ) Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.

        "148 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Eastern Africa IGAD evolved from a drought-focused body and now has an Agri- culture and Environment Division which has a natural resources management programme with three components: rational utili- sation of transboundary natural resources; promoting the devel- opment and use of renewable energy resources; and promoting rational management of fresh water resources. The division also coordinates the programme activities of the IGAD Climate Pre- diction and Application Centre (ICPAC) based in Nairobi, Kenya. The main objective of ICPAC as a specialised centre is to provide climate information, prediction products and services for early warning, and related applications to reduce climate-related risks for disaster management, environment management and poverty reduction in support of sustainable development efforts of the member countries. 3.1.4 National National Plans generated by international agendas are discussed in Section 3.1.1 above. All countries in Eastern Africa have a range of ministries and departments responsible for the environment and different nat- ural resources, some of which generate their own development strategies and action plans, which may involve policy and legal reform and institutional restructuring. All forest and wildlife man- agement agencies produce site-specific management plans. These matters are discussed further in Section 3.4.3 below. 3.2 Controlling illegal trade in wildlife Gaining control over the illegal consumption of, and trade in, natural resources rests very much on tackling the fundamental weaknesses of governance driving these issues. It also requires, for each commodity involved, action along the entire relevant value chain. This approach is elaborated in Section 3 of Chapter 5, which is devoted to Africa\u2019s wildlife trade in general 46 . It is built around three sets of actions at the supply, transit and consumer points in the chain, their respective objectives being to \u2018stop the killing\u2019, \u2018stop the trafficking\u2019 and \u2018stop the demand\u2019. Much of the response noted below has been catalysed by the trade-related crises surrounding elephant and rhino (for further detail see the sections devoted to these two species in Chapter 5), but which stands to benefit all species. Of relevance here are the National Ivory Action Plans produced for CITES by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, with a similar plan under preparation by Ethiopia. Actions in relation to the trade in bushmeat generally are elabo- rated in Chapter 3, Section 5.4 of this report, which is devoted to that topic. The promotion of legal and sustainable utilisation schemes is covered in Section 3.7 below. ( 46 ) It includes many examples from Eastern Africa that are not repeated here. \u2303 Trained dogs are used by African Parks Network for anti-poaching in Akagera National Park, Rwanda. \u2303 Rangers from the environmental company Wildlife Works stand near a decomposing carcass of an elephant in one of the ranches within the Tsavo West wildlife ecosystem, Kenya. ",
        "| 149 #2 Ongoing conservation efforts 3.2.1 Stopping the killing The cutting and killing of trees, and the poaching of animals, is primarily an issue of in situ protection. It follows that controlling these activities depends on the capacities of the responsible enforcement personnel. All countries in Eastern Africa have forest and wildlife ranger forces, but all of them need strengthening. Actions taken to reinforce law-enforcement capacity at the field level vary. Actions by governments include increasing the number of rangers and creating special highly mobile anti-poaching \u2018strike forces\u2019, who are able to move in to supplement staff resident in the area of an incident. Some members of these units are being trained as wildlife-specific crime scene investigation officers. For example, in 2013 the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) recruited an additional 750 rangers and formed a special 120-man inter- agency body known as the Elite Inter-Agency Anti-Poaching Unit, comprising security officers from the KWS, the Administration Police and the General Service Unit. This is now deployed in three strategic poaching hotspot areas in different parts of the country (Narok, Tsavo and Isiolo), and has been facilitated with equipment and aerial surveillance support. The unit is supported by the gov- ernments of Kenya, the United States of America, China and the United Kingdom. As a further measure, the security forces of KWS and the Kenya Forest Service (KFS) have both been placed under the overall command of the Inspector General of Police. In times of crisis, Tanzania\u2019s wildlife agencies favour mounting country-wide operations jointly with the country\u2019s Defence Forces: the latest such exercise in 2013, Operation Tokomeza Jangili, eventually proved most successful (see Section 1.4.4.1 of the ele- phant chapter in Chapter 5). From 9 to 10 May 2014, the Govern- ment hosted a Tanzanian Wildlife Summit to Stop Wildlife Crime and Advance Wildlife Conservation: A Call for Action at the con- clusion of which a Partnership Framework to Support Combating Poaching and Illegal Wildlife Trade was signed between the Gov- ernment and nine development partners (including the EU). The Government announced at the summit that it would be recruiting 900 additional rangers in 2014, with approximately 1 000 more each year until the need for 5 000 is met by 2018. At the same time as boosting field-level protection, Uganda and Tanzania are moving to revise their respective Wildlife Acts, with a view to greatly enhancing statutory penalties for wildlife crime as a deterrent and, in the case of Tanzania, to allow the adoption of a paramilitary system among the employees of the wildlife sector, including those of a new Tanzania Wildlife Authority (see Section 3.4.3). Kenya recently completed this process: its new Wildlife Conser- vation and Management Act (2013) enacted on 10 January 2014 includes provision for penalties of life imprisonment or a mini- mum fine of KES 20 million, equivalent to about EUR 180 000 (c. USD 230 000) for poaching rhinoceros or elephant or trafficking their parts or derivatives. Unfortunately, some consider the clause in the section that contains these new sentences to be ambiguous. What this means is that the new Wildlife Act, though far better than the old one, is unlikely in practice to provide any deterrent to the big dealers. Currently there are deliberate efforts between some NGOs, Kenya Wildlife Service, the Directorate of Public Prosecutions, judicial officers and legal experts to amend the Act by operational- ising the clause containing these new sentences (Section 92) through a motion in parliament to strengthen it even further. Action by NGOs takes many forms. The Frankfurt Zoological Soci- ety (FZS) for example has prepared specific Security Plans for the PAs it supports: in Eastern Africa these include the Serengeti NP and Selous Game Reserve. Support for implementation of the plans is included. The AWF has set up a Species Protection Grant Fund to implement a number of action plans including one for law enforcement. In South Sudan, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) is working closely with the Government to re-constitute, re-train and re-de- ploy an effective ranger force to the country\u2019s premier protected areas (see Section 3.4.1). \u2303 Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) officials measure the size of an adult male elephant during a collaring exercise in a remote area of South Sudan.

        "150 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Eastern Africa 3.2.2 Stopping the trafficking The principal government-led approach being recommended here is the formation of inter-agency Wildlife Enforcement Networks (WENs) at the national level. A key feature of these is the incor- poration of a more deliberate intelligence gathering effort, pro- active as well as reactive. The Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) has already set up an Intelligence Enforcement Unit that can serve as a founding component of a national WEN. In countries where the relevant government machinery is particu- larly weak or compromised, an NGO-dominated approach known as EAGLE (Eco Activists for Governance and Law Enforcement) has proved effective. This has been pioneered in Central and West Africa by NGOs like LAGA and projects like PALF 47 (see also Chap- ter 3, Section 4.9). In Eastern Africa, the country most suited to this approach is South Sudan where WCS has been working with the Ministry of Wildlife and LAGA to develop a WCS-implemented LAGA model for South Sudan. WCS Uganda is developing an anti-trafficking programme with the Uganda Wildlife Authority, which includes intelligence-led enforcement and LAGA-type com- ponents. For further details of the WEN and EAGLE approaches to stopping the trafficking of wildlife and their applicability, see Section 3.5 in Chapter 5. Much could be done to identify and then dismantle both internal and external trade routes if the true identity of bushmeat for example, or the provenance of ivory seizures, could be determined scientifically. This can be done through DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and isotopic analysis, but the capacity for this within Eastern Africa is very low. Although Tanzania and Uganda are said to be considering the establishment of wildlife forensic laboratories, Kenya already has one. The lab referred to is run by the Kenya Wildlife Service, and was developed originally to address bushmeat seizure and public health issues 48 . As such, the need to produce evidence in court introduced security elements into its design that preadapt it to handling high value products like rhino horn and ivory. In fact it is already being prepared to provide a regional service with respect to rhino horn analysis. With funding from WWF, its tech- nicians are receiving training in the relevant techniques from the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory (VGL) in Pretoria (see Box 14). The potential for the KWS lab to provide DNA-analytical services to the East African region is discussed further in Section 5.1.2. Other agencies involved in counter-trafficking operations include customs: officers are being trained to detect wildlife contraband and are being given sniffer dogs and scanners to assist in this. Help with such measures is coming from the USA and a number of NGOs. ( 47 ) LAGA: The Last Great Ape Organisation. PALF: Project for the Application of Law for Fauna operates in the Republic of Congo where it runs investigations, assists in operations, does legal follow-up and has a communication department to publicise convictions and other successes. ( 48 ) Particularly as regards screening of samples for zoonotic pathogens, especially from areas where there is considerable mixing of wildlife and livestock on the landscape. In this connection KWS is partnering with the Barcode of Wildlife Project based at the Smithsonian Institution, which aims at providing DNA-based species identification of things like powders and bushmeat. Box 14. Interregional collaboration in rhino horn forensics Three Kenyan scientists visited the VGL in Pretoria during 2012, two from KWS and one from Jomo Kenyatta University, together with the person in charge of technical work in the KWS forensic laboratory. The aim of their visit was to establish a collaboration between the Pretoria and KWS labs, and train the personnel on the Rhino DNA Identification System (RhODIS) methodologies to ensure standard and credible tests. This standardisation means that the Kenyan rhinoceros DNA profiles can be uploaded to the RhODIS database and all recovered horns can be compared to both Kenya and South Africa\u2019s poached animals. Thus the RhODIS tool is utilised as a powerful and cross-continental anti-poaching investigation tool. This training is to continue under a formal Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between KWS and the University of Pretoria, which was signed in 2013. The lead KWS technician revisited the VGL to analyse poaching cases from Kenya and returned with a mirror of their data, as well as updated methodologies to apply in his own laboratory. In future it is envisaged that visits and sample transfers will no longer be necessary but that the KWS laboratory will be able to produce DNA profiles from rhino samples using the standard methodology, and upload and compare these directly to the RhODIS database. ",
        "#2 | 151 #2 Ongoing conservation efforts 3.2.3 Stopping the demand The need for anti-poaching and anti-trafficking measures would be greatly curtailed if the principal market force driving the trade, namely consumer demand, could be reduced or even eliminated. As detailed in the elephant, rhino and trade sections of Chapter 5, considerable effort is going into this approach in relation to com- modities of special concern, like rhino horn and ivory. The approach involves conducting scientific surveys of consumer behaviour and attitudes; raising awareness among consumers of the cruelty of the trade and its role in endangering species; and \u2013 for some commodities \u2013 debunking their alleged medicinal properties. Since consumers in the international trade will be far removed from suppliers, these efforts are implemented mostly by NGOs, usually ones of global repute working with local counterparts. At the same time, some NGOs within Eastern Africa have mounted campaigns to raise awareness of the international crises their country is caught up in, and so generate extra pressure on home governments to take appropriate action. A good example is Kenya\u2019s Hands Off Our Elephants campaign led by an indigenous NGO called WildLife Direct. The campaign has published strong-impact advertisements in the national press, and has benefited from the direct involvement and support of the country\u2019s First Lady. 3.3 Minimising human-wildlife conflict The fundamental drivers of HWC are population growth leading to habitat fragmentation and loss. As noted earlier, control meas- ures include shooting, trapping, poisoning, repelling, scaring and fencing. Official government efforts to prevent or compensate for HWC are generally inadequate, and often corrupted: game control officers are responsible for huge areas but have no transport, and they often have to be bribed just to verify and forward claims, thus negating the whole purpose of compensation. Kenya\u2019s new Wildlife Act 2013 has improved procedures however, and compen- sation of up to KES 5 million will now be paid against fatalities. None of the non-destructive remedial measures are completely effective. Many animals soon learn to ignore scare tactics based on noise or fire. NGOs in several countries are working in pastoral communities to provide them with movable and re-usable lion- proof bomas 49 (made of metal rather than thorn bushes), and/or subsidise and manage local compensation schemes. Due to an elephant\u2019s strength and intelligence, the application of any measure to control human-elephant conflict (HEC) is particu- larly difficult and expensive, notably fencing. Rhino Ark is a Kenyan NGO whose sole agenda is building hugely expensive elephant- proof electric fences to protect wildlife and people from each other in mountain forest areas 50 . To date they have put a fence around the entire perimeter of the Aberdares NP (400 km), and \u2303 An innovative solution for reducing human-elephant conflict developed by Save the Elephants, Oxford University and Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom.

        "152 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Eastern Africa are now doing the same for Mt Kenya NP (450 km) and Eburu (50 km), a component of the Mau forest complex; all of these areas are important water towers. Chemical repellents based on Capsicum (chilli) have had mixed results, but the discovery made in Kenya that elephants actively avoid bees holds promise. Trials based on the use of beehives along farm boundaries are under- way in several countries, but have yet to be scaled up. For rural people, the costs of living with wildlife are obviously a major disincentive for them to conserve it. Measures to maximise the benefits of living with wildlife can therefore be seen partly as another, important way of compensating for HWC (see Section 3.7). The securing of strategically aligned wildlife corridors is another way of preventing or mitigating HWC (see Section 3.4.1). 3.4 Improving PA system effectiveness Measures and actions designed to improve PA systems revolve around two issues: their overall design, and the effectiveness with which the system\u2019s component PAs are managed. The latter can- not be separated from the capacity of the management authority responsible. 3.4.1 Scope and design of national PA systems In most countries in Eastern Africa, the array of formal PAs such as national parks and game reserves has been established for decades. Details regarding the PAs in each are available from the World Database of Protected Areas, which is maintained by UNEP\u2019s World Conservation Monitoring Centre and accessible through their website 51 . Figure 7 in the summary document \u2013 Synthesis \u2013 provides a continental overview of PA coverage. It is very likely that in every country of Eastern Africa examples could be found of gaps where some hitherto unprotected ecotype or endemic species would benefit from the creation of a new PA, but each of these would generate additional overheads for the management authority, so unless they can pay their way, internal motivation for their addition to the PA system will remain elusive. Of more interest and priority are the situations in which whole PA systems are more or less paper systems, such as is the case in South Sudan and Somalia. In these countries, the re-develop- ment of their PA systems offers opportunities to re-design them significantly by retaining old PAs but redefining their boundaries perhaps, and by adding entirely new areas that would fill gaps in the old system and provide the connectivity essential to protecting whole eco-processes rather than just a part. Such work has been underway in South Sudan since 2007 through a major United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and UNDP/ GEF-funded programme implemented by WCS 52 . This and a smaller- scale PA support programme managed by Fauna and Flora Inter- national (FFI) continue despite the very recent outbreak of civil conflict. Somalia as a whole is not yet ready for any serious PA development work. In the stable countries of Eastern Africa, there have been some very important additions to the PA systems inherited from colonial times. These include the various types of area in which respon- sibility for the utilisation and management of natural resources has been devolved to communities, such as wildlife management areas, and village forest reserves. These are discussed further in Section 3.7. Other important additions to PA systems include conservancies, in which the owners of land \u2013 be they communal or private \u2013 elect to dedicate that land to conservation. There are several hundred community and private wildlife conservancies in Kenya that engage in the non-consumptive utilisation of wildlife (i.e. tourism). Since ownership and ultimate responsibility for all wildlife is vested in the state, regardless of whether it is inside or outside the formal PA estate, the conservancy movement is of great assistance to the Kenya Wildlife Service, which seeks only to register conservancies and assist in the development of their management effectiveness. Another Kenyan example of an effective addition to a PA system in terms of the diversity of constituent parts is the designation of five areas as official water towers (see Section 1.2.1 above). This designation has been given power through the establishment of a Water Tower Authority (WTA) to oversee and coordinate the actions of the various pre-existing management agencies and stakeholders in these areas, including the Forest and Wildlife Services. The European Commission has approved an intervention for launch in 2014/15 to support the WTA and its forests entitled the Kenya Water Tower Protection and Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Programme . There is currently most interest in the addition of a \u2018corridor\u2019 to established PA systems, in other words a PA created to prevent the isolation, and improve the resilience, of existing PAs (see Box 15). In Tanzania, concern over the likely impact of widespread agricultural development on PA connectivity and viability resulted in a specific study on the status of key corridors in the country and the increasingly urgent need to secure their function (see also Section 2.1.4) 53 . ( 51 ) www.protectedplanet.net ( 52 ) The WCS has had an overall estimated annual budget of USD 5 million per year for this initiative in South Sudan over the past six years and it will be continued into future with long-term commitments.

        "#2 | 153 #2 Ongoing conservation efforts Box 15. Wildlife corridors Some protected areas, designed decades ago for varying reasons, do not encompass the range of ecosystem requirements needed by certain flora and fauna. Migrating species, for example, especially large mammalian herbivores and associated carnivores, move outside and/or between protected areas. They may also use corridors as dispersal areas. Wisely set-aside and well-managed corridors can reduce human-wildlife conflict, including crop raiding, and thus increase agricultural yield over the long term. If an animal or plant population declines to low levels or becomes extinct in one area or habitat patch, individuals from another patch can emigrate and rescue that population from local extinction. If a small population is isolated, it will lose genetic variation over the long term and suffer from inbreeding. A corridor allows immigrants to import new genetic variation into isolated populations. If the habitat of one area becomes unsuitable (e.g. because of climate change), organisms (both plants and animals) can move along corridors to reach more suitable habitat, and thus be \u2018rescued\u2019. \u2303 Migrating wildebeest crossing the Mara River in Kenya.

Based on current rates of habitat change, they are estimated to have less than three years remain- ing before they disappear. Five corridors are in extreme condition and could either disappear within one year unless immediate action is taken or they have already been closed. Kenya too is alert to the need for corridor linkages between PAs. A much-lauded example is the one whose recent creation enlarged the Mt Kenya World Heritage Site by linking it to the privately owned Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, which then became part of the WHS. A critically important feature of this corridor is a tunnel under a main road, big enough for elephants, which are indeed using it. The move greatly enhances species and habitat diversity and resilience in the WHS, the new whole being greater than the sum of its parts. The northern Mount Kenya corridor is successful, largely because it follows an ancient elephant travel route that had been well researched. Care needs to be taken that potential corridors are not just drawn on maps without taking wildlife\u2019s natural move- ment and habits into account. It follows that money on research to identify real travel routes would be well spent before millions are invested in corridor developments that may fail. 3.4.2 Sites of international importance Some national PAs gain additional recognition and status under internationally coordinated schemes with their own accreditation criteria. These include World Heritage Sites, Ramsar Sites, Man and Biosphere Reserves, the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund global biodiversity hotspots, Key Biodiversity Areas and Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, of which there are many distributed among all the countries of Eastern Africa. This recognition carries additional responsibilities, for which the scheme usually offers technical and sometimes financial assistance. All these categories are relevant, but probably the most important for present purposes is the World Heritage Site (WHS) , a desig- nation based on strict criteria that establish \u2018outstanding univer- sal value\u2019. The World Heritage Convention, administered by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), sets out the duties of state parties in identifying poten- tial sites and their role in protecting and preserving them. The parties are encouraged to integrate the protection of the cultural and natural heritage into regional planning programmes, set up staff and services at their sites, undertake scientific and technical conservation research, and adopt measures which give this her- itage a function in the day-to-day life of the community. To this end they are required to produce National Heritage Action Plans, the latest being for 2012-2017.

        "#2 | 155 #2 Ongoing conservation efforts At present there are ten natural WHSs in Eastern Africa: Ethiopia Simien Mountains National Park 55 Kenya Lake Turkana National Parks Mount Kenya National Park/ National Forest Lake System in the Great Rift Valley Tanzania Kilimanjaro National Park Ngorongoro Conservation Area 56 Selous Game Reserve Serengeti National Park Uganda Bwindi Impenetrable National Park Ruwenzori Mountains National Park In addition, the following countries have submitted \u2018tentative lists\u2019 of sites to be considered for future inclusion: Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda 57 . The Rift Valley Lakes site in Kenya is known as a \u2018serial site\u2019 because its components are separated from one another. The intention if possible to add Lake Natron, which is in Tanzania, would create only the second transboundary WHS in Africa 58 . Lake Naivasha and Hell\u2019s Gate NP could perhaps also be added; they are already on Kenya\u2019s \u2018tentative list\u2019. The latter list also includes the Maasai Mara Reserve, which would create another trans boundary WHS with the contiguous Serengeti NP in Tanzania. Taking a cue from the above to go beyond national PA systems, there is considerable interest in promoting the concept of trans- frontier conservation areas (TFCAs) , where contiguous PAs that straddle an international border are developed and managed in a highly integrated, well-coordinated manner. The Southern African region is by far the most advanced in terms of TFCA devel- opment, as detailed in Chapter 1, Section 4.2.1 of this report. There is much potential for the concept in Eastern Africa, and although interest is growing, real progress is hampered by two constraints. The first is the mistrust between potential partners, based on unfamiliarity with each other\u2019s policies and procedures. This could more easily be dispelled but for the second, which is a lack of really energetic political support at the level of the EAC. Compared to SADC, which has come powerfully behind the concept by actively facilitating the conclusion of formal treaties to establish specific TFCAs, and creating permanent bodies to coordinate their development and management, the EAC has done little more than pay lip service to the concept, although all countries in the region do have some guiding mechanism that would allow its advance- ment (e.g. policies, treaties, strategies and MoUs). \u2303 The Gelada, a primate species endemic to the Simien Mountains World Heritage Site.

        "156 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Eastern Africa For historical reasons relating to the personal interests of indi- viduals who helped establish the EAC and its organs, its orienta- tion with regard to intra-Eastern African cooperation in natural resource management has always been heavily biased towards the Great Lakes. In 2012, the EAC did host, with USAID funding, the EAC Regional Workshop on Transboundary Ecosystems Man- agement and Conservation in East Africa , but seemingly this was driven more by the organisers (WCS and the US Forest Service) rather than any internal sense of importance or priority on the part of the EAC itself. Thus neither the workshop nor its conclu- sions and recommendations were mentioned to a late-2013 mission that visited the EAC to develop the natural resource man- agement pillar of the European Commission\u2019s next Regional Investment Programme. Both the EA Protocol on Natural Resource Management and the East African Community Transboundary Ecosystems Bill provide a policy and legal platform on which TFCAs could be developed, but the clear intent of the Bill is to harmonise law and practice as concerns national environment management agencies, including EIAs, and is not explicitly geared towards wildlife or transboundary PA management. Again the Bill stems from fundamental concerns about pollution and other negative impacts on the shared resources of the Great Lakes. As noted earlier, the draft East Africa Tourism and Wildlife Protocol fails to establish policies and procedures for the co-management of TFCAs (see Section 3.1.3). Probably the closest Eastern Africa has got to a truly SADC-like TFCA is in the Greater Virunga Landscape that is shared by the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda, and which thus falls partly within the jurisdiction of the East African Community (EAC) and partly in the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). For fur- ther details see Box 16 beside, and Section 5.1.1 in Chapter 3 which includes a map. Another TFCA involving the DRC exists between Lantoto NP in South Sudan, and the contiguous Garamba NP and nearby Bili Uele Reserve in DRC. Good transboundary technical collaboration between Garamba and Lantoto already exists, driven by the WCS- South Sudan programme and the APN project in Garamba, resulting in several major arrests in 2012, 2013 and 2014. In addition, formal transboundary meetings between ICCN and South Sudan were initiated in 2008 with support from APN and WCS. This com- plex is part of a formerly very important elephant and rhino 59 range which, it has been proposed, should be also linked with the South- ern NP in South Sudan and the Zemongo WR and Chinko hunting zones in CAR to form a mega-TFCA. The merits and feasibility of this idea are discussed more fully in Chapter 3, Section 5.1.1. Another important TFCA initiative concerns the 1 500 km\u00b2 Nyungwe- Kibira landscape that includes the transfrontier forests of Nyungwe National Park in Rwanda and Kibira National Park in Burundi. Apart from its important biodiversity (see Section 1.2.2), this forest is also key to providing watershed services to a large population in both the Nile and Congo basins. The site is pioneering efforts to develop payment for ecosystem service schemes, as well as having made great strides in transboundary cooperation and eco- tourism development. It is a primary focus for external support by the governments of both Rwanda and Burundi, which have developed transboundary agreements and are implementing a transboundary action plan. There are two other TFCA-related programmes of note ongoing within Eastern Africa. The first is the EU/IGAD Biodiversity Man- agement Programme aimed at building overall regional capacity for biodiversity and ecosystem management with a strong empha- sis on transboundary management through the strengthening of regional, national and community-level institutions. The validity of this approach is to be showcased through four-year grant contracts with three specialised implementation partners 60 , each working in one of the following three pilot cross-border ecosystems: \u2022 The Boma-Gambella Landscape (southeast South Sudan and southwest Ethiopia); \u2022 The Tana-Kipini-Laga Badana Bushbush Land and Seascape (northeast Kenya and southeast Somalia); \u2022 The Lower Awash-Lake Abb\u00e9 Landscape (northeast Ethiopia and southwest Djibouti). The second is the USAID-funded Boma-Jonglei-Equatoria Land- scape Programme implemented by WCS whose inputs to the South Sudanese side of the Boma-Gambella Landscape comple- ment those of the EU programme, which is limited to the Ethiopian side where the Horn of Africa Regional Environment Centre and Network (HoA-REC&N) is working with the Ethiopian Wildlife Con- servation Authority (EWCA). Even prior to this involvement, the WCS initiated the ongoing discussions for a formal cooperation agreement between the two countries. ( 59 ) Notably for the now nearly extinct northern white rhino.

        "| 161 #2 Ongoing conservation efforts 3.4.3 PA management capacity and effectiveness Nowadays all PA management agencies produce, or intend to produce, a General Management Plan (GMP) for each of their areas. Since the effectiveness of entire PA systems rests on the effectiveness with which these individual plans are implemented, it is instructive to consider the constraints to effective manage- ment in a bottom-up sequence. At the PA level, management effectiveness is dependent on ade- quate funding and manpower, and typically both are in short supply. Funds must cover operational and recurrent expenditure (salaries, fuel, maintenance) as well as any capital investments needed (vehicles, buildings, roads). Whilst most rangers receive adequate training, the same is not true of the senior staff in charge of PAs. Even in relatively advanced countries, persons are recruited as wardens on academic grounds (e.g. a degree in a relevant subject) and then simply posted to the field without further training for the task. Analyses have shown that the range of skills needed is greatest for wardens-in-charge than at any other level. In years gone by the preparation of recruits for this role involved a formal probationary period in the field working alongside an experienced warden, followed by a course at the Col- lege of African Wildlife Management (CAWM) in Mweka, Tanzania, attended by personnel from all countries of Eastern Africa and beyond. Nowadays, career progression is only weakly linked to performance (if at all), and courses tailor-made for trainee wardens have died out, because they necessarily take years not months if they are to convey the full set of skills required and are there- fore expensive. Consequently, courses now offered at CAWM and national colleges tend to be short, and more scientific than practical. As a result of all this, poor leadership is common at the PA level. At the headquarters level, management agencies inevitably suffer similar problems of funding and manpower, but since they have greater power to look after themselves they are often bloated. Again the lack of rigorous performance-based career progression procedures is a problem, and again a lack of appropriate skills is evident at the senior-most level. This is due to the common prac- tice of assigning political appointees \u2013 often academics \u2013 to head agencies, rather than experienced sector professionals. Since direct responsibility for a surprisingly large proportion of required actions identified in the GMPs of individual PAs is vested in the Director, many important decisions and dependent actions get delayed or blocked as a result. \u2303 Topi in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda. This protected area is contiguous with DR Congo\u2019s Virunga National Park and has played a vital role in ensuring a safe haven for wildlife during the decades of conflict in DRC that have decimated wildlife in the savannah section of Virunga National Park.

        "162 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Eastern Africa Donor partners, very often working through NGOs, have always favoured working at the PA and PA management agency level to overcome the constraints outlined above. At the PA level, assis- tance is often given with the production of GMPs, with the equip- ment and the operations needed to implement them, and with calculating the effectiveness of these and other measures 62 . Quite often ranger salaries are augmented with allowances designed to incentivise maximum patrol effort. A good example of this type of approach is FZS\u2019s decades-long programme in support of Tanzania National Parks. An elaboration of the passive support approach is the Co-Man- agement Agreement in which some actual management respon- sibility is vested in the NGO partner with respect to one or several named PAs. An example for Eastern Africa is that concluded between WCS and the Government of South Sudan in 2007 with respect to Zeraf GR in the Sudd, Badingilu NP and Boma NP. In its most extreme version, total management responsibility for a PA will be contracted out to an organisation like African Parks. These approaches present sustainability problems, but are a nec- essary last resort if official capacity is totally inadequate; no intervention at all would result in a complete breakdown in law and order, followed by the loss of the PA and all it is supposed to protect. The latter, total management-contract approach has been more prevalent in other regions, although there is one example in East- ern Africa where the Rwanda Development Board has a contract with African Parks to manage the Akagera NP. This is an interest- ing and rare example of a relatively well-resourced Government being willing to contract out park management. Less surprisingly perhaps, a similar agreement between the Government of Ethiopia and African Parks to manage the problematic Gambella NP on the western border with South Sudan is under discussion. Simi- larly, WCS is talking to the Government of South Sudan about moving from co-management contracts to full private-public partnership agreements for the above-mentioned PAs, as well as the central and eastern parts of Southern NP. Another fairly typical approach taken by donors and NGOs in Eastern Africa is the provision of resident park management advi- sors, of which there are many examples. Also at a national, head- quarter-level, the deployment of senior technical assistants as advisors is quite common and usually effective. Contemporary examples include the individual advisors provided by the German Government to the Wildlife Division in Tanzania, by the Frankfurt Zoological Society to the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Author- ity, and by the African Wildlife Foundation to the emerging South Sudan Wildlife Service 63 . Projects, or rather programmes, in which a whole team of tech- nical assistants (TAs) based at headquarters help build manage- ment capacity throughout the organisation (or even the sector as a whole), can be very effective in situations where a complete overhaul and restructuring is necessary and appropriate. The ini- tial merger between the former Kenya National Parks and the Game Department to form the Kenya Wildlife Service faltered until a major investment programme was drawn up and imple- mented with US and European Commission support. In the late 1970s, after a long period of devastating civil war, the European Commission funded the Uganda National Parks Pro- gramme, which helped overhaul the PA system by rehabilitating key old parks, and catalysing the upgrading of several PAs to national park status. Also in Uganda, the World Bank\u2019s Protected Areas Management for Sustainable Use (PAMSU) programme helped draw up and implement a massive investment programme for both the forestry and wildlife sectors, including technical sup- port to the newly formed Uganda Wildlife Authority. Since 2007, USAID and UNDP/GEF have been funding very similar PA and sector rehabilitation programmes in South Sudan implemented by WCS. Approaches of this sort continue to be highly relevant throughout Eastern Africa. The Tanzanian Government has decided to trans- form the Wildlife Division from a rather inefficient, allegedly cor- rupt, government organ in charge of game reserves, into the Tanzania Wildlife Authority (TAWA), a parastatal entitled to retain revenue (mostly from hunting) and manage its own finances. TAWA is to be based in Morogoro, with a start to the organisa- tional changes involved scheduled for June 2014. The TAWA Director General is to be selected via an international tender subject to presidential approval. This transformation is to be effected with bilateral technical and financial assistance from the German Government. A similar transformation is on the cards in Kenya, where the Government is seriously considering a merger between the Wildlife and Forest Services. If implemented, external technical and financial assistance will be needed and welcomed. All other national wildlife management authorities in Eastern Africa, with the possible exception of Uganda, would benefit from the sort of game-changing capacity building that only a major donor support programme could deliver. A leading candidate is Ethiopia, a country of incredibly important but still poorly pro- tected biodiversity, whose huge tourism potential remains virtu- ally untapped. The reasons for this are complex, but a major investment programme is needed to turn things around before it is too late for some areas and species. ( 62 ) Stolton S., M. Hockings, N. Dudley, K.

        "| 163 #2 Ongoing conservation efforts 3.5 Valuing ecosystems properly Even in countries in which the link between parks and tourism is economically important and well recognised, the environmental sector remains under-resourced. The under-valuation of ecosys- tem services and biodiversity by governments is a fundamental driver of ill-considered ecosystem conversions, and of the insti- tutional weaknesses that generate inefficient, ineffective and corrupt management practices. Clearly a better understanding of ecosystem values should result in governments investing more heavily, firstly in the agencies responsible for land-use planning, strategic environmental assessments (SEAs) and EIAs, and sec- ondly in those responsible for protecting natural resources and/ or managing their utilisation. The greater \u2018investment\u2019 required has several forms, ranging from policy, legal and structural reforms, to greater capital investments and operational budgets. Impor- tantly, the latter should cover enhanced manpower, improved salaries, allowances and working conditions (especially in the field), and more and better training. Making such investments in the key environmental and natural resource management agencies would have massive knock-on benefits by addressing the common root causes, which underlie unsustainable resource utilisation and the relentless degradation \u2013 both legal and illegal \u2013 of natural ecosystems, whether pro- tected or not. The root causes arise from ill-qualified, poorly motivated and often corrupt officials, who are approving devel- opment actions whose environmental impacts are not being minimised to the greatest possible extent. Clearly before governments in particular, and consumers in general, will attach proper and higher value to ecosystems, they must be presented with robust supporting economic analyses that convinc- ingly demonstrate that value. As conservationists increasingly realise that environmental economics must therefore be main- streamed into the work of ministries of finance and planning, so more and more initiatives are being taken by both IGOs and NGOs to show how this can and should be done. These include UNEP\u2019s T he Economics of Ecosystems and Biodi- versity (TEEB) programme (with funding from the EU and some Member States); the Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Eco- system Services (WAVES) partnership led by the World Bank (also involving the EU); and the UNEP-GEF Project for Ecosystems Ser- vices (ProEcoServ). All these are designed to help countries incor- porate the value of natural capital in national accounts. They work to develop scientifically credible methods for ecosystem account- ing and promote their use in decision-making among a wide range of stakeholders. Although only WAVES is active in Eastern Africa (Rwanda), other activities using a Natural Capital Accounting approach have revealed facts that are compelling the region\u2019s governments to move in the right direction, particularly in the closely linked for- estry and water sectors (see Box 17). A number of other IGOs and NGOs are taking similar action to promote the conservation of ecosystems on the grounds of the value of the services they provide. REDD+ 64 projects in particular hold great promise as a means of conserving forest biodiversity and services and enhancing live- lihoods locally, while mitigating CO 2 emissions and climate change globally. Unfortunately the procedures involved are com- plex and costly so fully certified schemes are still few and far between, but one of the first in the world was in Kenya 65 . None- theless assistance in preparing REDD schemes features in more and more programmes (see also Section 3.6). \u2303 Tourists in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania.

        "164 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Eastern Africa Similarly Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) schemes are gaining a great deal of interest and attention. This approach revolves around the principle that remote beneficiaries of an eco- system service should pay the people living in the ecosystem to keep it in its naturally functional state, rather than putting it to some other use. A large-scale example is a project of The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to establish an Upper Tana-Nairobi Water Fund (see Box 18), while at a smaller scale there is the Conservation International-led initiative to enhance water for people and wildlife through a PES scheme for part of the Chyulu Hills catchment that feeds the Mzima-Mombasa pipeline and serves as a corridor linking Chyulu NP with Tsavo West and Amboseli NPs. Box 17. Economic importance of forests Forestry in Tanzania officially contributes about 2.3 % of gross domestic product (GDP), but research indicates that if the wider benefits of ecosystem services are factored in, the real contribution is over 4 % of GDP. A similar percentage has been calculated for Uganda, at a value of USD 136 million per annum. In Kenya too, similar economic valuations of its forests have catalysed a response to conserve and rehabilitate that resource. A recent UNEP-Kenya Forest Service report (2012) shows that deforestation deprived Kenya\u2019s economy of an estimated USD 69 million in 2010, far outstripping the revenue earned from forestry and logging. It concludes that the \u2018official\u2019 contribution of forests is undervalued by some 2.5 %, putting its real annual contribution at 3.6 % of GDP. Between 2000 and 2010, deforestation of the country\u2019s main water towers amounted to c. 50 000 ha, leading to a reduced water availability of approximately 62 million m 3 per year. This has affected Kenya\u2019s macro-economy, which is vulnerable to inflation spikes during periods of drought. In response to this data, the Government is now working to rehabilitate key water towers; between 2011 and 2012 more than 21 000 ha were repossessed and some 10 000 ha were rehabilitated. A number of programmes and activities were also launched to improve the livelihoods of people living in and around the forests (see also Section 3.7). Rwanda has committed all of its GEF funds to forest landscape restoration throughout the country. Box 18. Economic importance of the Tana River The 1 000 km-long Tana River gets most of its water from the forested catchments of the Mt Kenya and Aberdares \u2018water towers\u2019. Tana water supports most of Kenya\u2019s important power and urban water needs, including over 90 % of Nairobi city\u2019s requirements. Water funds engage large public and private urban water consumers \u2013 utilities, downstream industries, agricultural producers, and/or private donors and aid agencies \u2013 to invest in a fund that pays for the protection of water quality and quantity upstream, and protects the supply to millions of people living in towns and cities downstream. \u2303 The Aberdare National Park, Kenya, a World Heritage Site.

        "| 165 #2 Ongoing conservation efforts Many conservation NGOs are extending the principles of Natural Capital Accounting and PES by developing different ways of mak- ing the private sector more cognisant of, and responsive to, eco- system values. This is considered a good strategy because businesses are much easier to make headway with than the other actors: governments tend to be short-sighted and corrupt, and civil society is generally weak. This is because, for extractive and agricultural industries especially, incorporating environmental concerns into their Corporate Social Responsibility programmes are now considered vital to both the production and marketing aspects of any sustainable business model 66 , if only to avoid litigation for negative impacts (e.g. pollution). WWF has appointed an Adviser on Green Economy for the whole of Africa, and in this connection is engaging with the foreign, especially Chinese, banks that provide loans to finance huge development schemes in Africa in order to make sure they insist, as a precondition to any loan, on state-of-the-art, independent EIAs that take full account of the true economic value of any negative impact on ecosystem services. Conservation International has finalised a programme entitled VITAL SIGNS AFRICA: Integrated Monitoring System for Ecosys- tem Services in African Agricultural Landscapes , which is to be funded through a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Founda- tion. This programme, launched in 2014 in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Ghana initially, will provide data and diagnostic tools to guide agricultural development decisions and monitor their outcomes (see Box 19). Another notable approach to educating political decision-makers and business leaders as to the value of ecosystems in both an economic and security context is that of the Conservation Caucus. This is an informal discussion group that provides a framework to link parliamentarians from all political parties, industrialists and NGOs, so that public and private actors can engage in mean- ingful dialogue about why conservation matters, share informa- tion and better leverage one another\u2019s efforts to address conser- vation challenges. The US-based International Conservation Caucus Foundation (ICCF) is facilitating the formation of these forums around the world, including two in Eastern Africa to date (Kenya and Tanzania) 67 . Given the relatively obvious relevance and importance of the services that ecosystems provide in terms of helping to sustain water supplies and mitigate climate change, it is easy to forget that the biological diversity making up an ecosystem has immense economic value in its own right: \u2022 many individual species are exploited for their utilitarian or trade values: individually these can be huge, and when added together the overall value of biodiversity nationally and glob- ally is staggering; \u2022 the biodiversity of ecosystems underpins their power as a tourism attraction; \u2022 the greater the heterogeneity of an ecosystem, the more effec- tive and resilient are its service functions (and vice versa); \u2022 numerous wild species have known and unknown medicinal properties; \u2022 loss of species results in loss of important ecological services, such as pollination of crops (birds, bats, insects), seed disper- sal (birds, primates, bats, elephants) and natural control of agricultural pests. These losses can affect fruit and vegetable productivity, as well as the regeneration of natural vegetation and forests; \u2022 important aspects of global food security depend on the exist- ence of wild relatives of staple and commercially valuable food plants. Throughout Eastern Africa, there are many international and national NGOs engaged in education and awareness campaigns designed to ensure greater public knowledge and appreciation of ecosystem and biodiversity values, including among children and rural communities. The incorporation of environmental studies into national school curricula is also needed. Without public under- standing and support, it will always be much harder for conser- vation to succeed.

Four partner states, namely Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania, have developed National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs), which are in various stages of implementation. The NAPAs identify immediate, urgent and priority project activities that are necessary to enhance adaptation capacities to the adverse impacts of climate change. Kenya, not being a least developed country, has prepared instead a Climate Change Strategy, which spells out priority adaptation and mitigation activities. Developing countries do not have binding targets under the Kyoto Protocol, but are still committed under the treaty to reduce their emissions. Actions taken by developed and developing countries to reduce emissions include support for renewable energy, improving energy efficiency and reducing deforestation. Under the Protocol, emissions of developing countries are allowed to grow in accordance with their development needs. These strategies and action plans have identified energy-related mitigation options, which can be used to foster economic devel- opment in the region while contributing to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The potentials in various parts of the region range from geothermal along the Rift Valley, wind, cogen- eration, hydropower, solar, carbon sequestration, use of natural gases and methane recovery from waste management. So far three partner states, namely Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, have registered clean development projects. Appropriate natural resource management constitutes another very important response to climate change in the region. As already recounted above, this includes widespread forest res- toration and rehabilitation measures, and the development of REDD+ projects, where the carbon absorption value of a con- served forest is rewarded, through carbon credits, for offsetting emissions elsewhere in the world. In terms of wildlife conservation, it is important that PA managers now participate in predictive climate change adaptation exercises, in order to identify and be ready to deal with anticipated likely impacts. The best approach is to incorporate responses to the threats posed by climate change into the established process used to develop site-specific General Management Plans. UNESCO has already taken steps in this direction for natural World Herit- age Sites. In 2013 it piloted the use of guidance materials for the preparation of Climate Change Adaptation Plans (CCAPs) at two sites in India, and two sites in Kenya. Thus it is that Mt Kenya and the component PAs of the Great Rift Valley Lakes Site are among the first to have site-specific CCAPs. Once the plans are refined on the basis of these pilots (and possibly one more in Latin Amer- ica), UNESCO will roll out the guidelines globally. \u2303 Hot springs at Lake Bogoria in Kenya.

        "| 167 #2 Ongoing conservation efforts 3.7 Alleviating poverty The relevance of poverty as a fundamental driver of ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss is universally recognised and accepted today. However, it was only about 15 years ago that conservation-linked approaches to poverty alleviation were initi- ated; since then they have evolved into the variety of approaches collectively termed Community-based Natural Resource Manage- ment (CBNRM). The basic premise underlying all CBNRM is that illegal and unsus- tainable natural resource use by the rural poor can be halted by giving them ownership of and management responsibility for the resource, so that they may directly benefit from its use, improving their livelihoods accordingly. Consequently they will automatically acquire a vested interest in protecting it from unsus- tainable exploitation. Apart from generating benefits directly linked to the utilisation of wildlife, CBNRM also addresses other ways of improving live- lihoods while minimising environmental damage. These can include measures to reduce the costs of living with wildlife (self- help against HWC), as well as to promote alternative crops, or improve agronomy and livestock breeds. It also involves the intro- duction of new \u2018holistic\u2019 grazing strategies for the improved exploitation of rangelands, as well new techniques of soil and carbon friendly \u2018conservation agriculture\u2019. As a result of their relevance to poverty alleviation, all of these approaches have received massive support from the donor com- munity, to the extent that a huge body of experience exists that is far too great to review more than superficially here. A few key examples and points pertaining to measures directly linked to wildlife \u2013 both plant and animal \u2013 are given below. CBNRM in the forestry sector revolves around participatory forest management (PFM) where defined and organised communities either manage a forest with the state forestry authority to their mutual benefit, or the state devolves full management respon- sibility for \u2018village forests\u2019 to the community. In some cases the user rights granted include timber; in some cases it is only non- timber forest products. There is a large number and variety of projects of this type throughout Africa, several of them supported by the European Commission, and Eastern Africa is no exception. Three particular community forestry approaches are notable. This first involves PFM and REDD+ so that the proceeds from carbon credits are distributed amongst the community on, theoretically at least, a significant scale (see Box 20). The second works on the same principle, but with the benefits to be shared being generated by formalised Payments for Ecosystem Services. The third uses a globally recognised certification of sustainability to add value to specific forest products in trade. The community managing the resource thus gains a double benefit: an enhanced revenue stream to share, without compromising a sustained sup- ply to the market. The best example of this is provided by the village forests in Tanzania that are participating in an NGO-facil- itated and Forest Stewardship Council-certified trade in African blackwood. This wood, used for musical instruments, commands huge prices; by cutting out the middlemen, the returns now reach- ing the community are truly transformative. CBNRM in the wildlife sector relates to the granting of user rights to communities in agreed, legally defined \u2018wildlife management areas\u2019. The utilisation allowed may be consumptive (hunting), non- consumptive (tourism) or a combination of the two. Different approaches predominate in different countries, with consumptive utilisation not even an option in those countries in which hunting of all types is banned. Within Eastern Africa, Tanzania has taken the lead in developing a legal framework for the establishment of community-managed wildlife management areas (WMAs), to which species-specific consumptive user rights are devolved on the basis of govern- ment-imposed, sustainable offtake quotas. In Kenya on the other hand, community (and private) landowners have taken the initi- ative to declare all or part of their land as conservancies devoted to the conservation and non-consumptive utilisation of wildlife, often in associations like the Northern Rangelands Trust. In either model, hunting and tourism revenues are shared amongst the entitled community members. Box 20. Linkages between PFM and REDD+ The idea of linking PFM and REDD+ makes a great deal of sense at first sight, and indeed the obvious complementarities between the two have spawned a number of new standards against which a forest can be certified, in addition to a fundamental greenhouse gas- (GHG) reduction standard such as the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), thus adding value to the carbon credits generated. These include the Climate, Community and Biodiversity (CCB) Standards, which identify projects that are designed to deliver robust and credible GHG reductions while also delivering net positive benefits to local communities and biodiversity, and the REDD+ Social & Environmental Standards initiative, which aims to build support for government-led REDD+ programmes that make a significant contribution to human rights, poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.

        "168 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Eastern Africa CBNRM is now increasingly being also applied in the fisheries sector, on both coasts and lakes, with the devolution of resource user and management rights and responsibilities being organised around Beach Management Units. The EUR 15 million programme for the Coastal, Marine and Island Specific Biodiversity Manage- ment in the Eastern and Southern Africa and Indian Ocean Region (ESA-IO), signed in January 2013, aims at developing and strengthening, over five years, national and sub-regional capac- ities for the sustainable participatory management of coastal, marine and island-specific biodiversity in the island states and coastal states of the ESA-IO region, namely Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles, Kenya and Tanzania. Whilst CBNRM has indeed helped communities to develop a vested interest in protecting natural resources from unsustainable exploitation, it has not been, nor is it likely ever to be, an unqual- ified success everywhere. In all cases where government approval is involved, whether for PFM (as in Ethiopia) or WMAs (as in Tan- zania), the procedural steps involved are complex and time-con- suming and mostly beyond the capacity of communities to follow without help from a donor-funded NGO partner. Once approved, management of the user rights so granted is often hijacked by \u2018elites\u2019, but even without that the benefits generated are very modest once shared out amongst all entitled households. Situations also arise in which extreme scarcity can generate an unsustainable resource use that is NOT driven by poverty, and therefore relatively immune to mitigation through PFM. An excerpt from the evaluation of an European Commission-funded PFM project in Malawi provides an example of such a situation 68 (see Box 21). Box 21. Charcoal and deforestation The situation in Malawi today is such that forests are being degraded and destroyed because the demand for biomass fuel (wood and charcoal) far exceeds supply. This process, however, is not being driven by the poverty of forest-dependent communi- ties. It is being driven partly by a simple lack of alternatives, meaning that even if you improve a person\u2019s livelihood or income through PFM, they still will have no choice but to go on cooking using wood or charcoal, irrespective of whether that improvement is forest-dependent and irrespective of whether they have come to value the forest more than previously as a result. An even more important driver is the charcoal industry, which is linked to markets and communities in mostly urban centres, a far distance from the source forests. In other words, the destructive process is largely independent of the livelihoods or wealth of communities living close to and/or partially dependent upon forests. \u2303 Charcoal for sale in a market in Ethiopia. Excessive charcoal use causes forest degradation in many countries. Lack of alternative sources of domestic fuel is as important as poverty as a driver for charcoal use. Urban markets, often far from source forests, have the greatest influence on forest degradation. ( 68 ) TRANSTEC Project Management (2012).

        "| 169 #2 Ongoing conservation efforts Despite its promise, CBNRM is not a panacea that alone will neu- tralise the unsustainable utilisation of natural resources that is driven by poverty. As already alluded to, CBNRM schemes may seem viable when first devised, the harvest having been correctly calculated for the number of wild animals (or trees) that live in the area and the income shared out fairly. In due course however, the number of people increases and there is a demand to increase offtake, but the wildlife in an area does not increase, its numbers remain steady, and so must the harvest if it is to be sustainable. A steady harvest means that each person now receives a declining income. Furthermore, each person is not content to receive even a steady income their whole lives, let alone a declining one; they expect an increasing income so that the demand for an in creased harvest is exacerbated. For these and other reasons, there is an inevitable trend over time for CBNRM to become unsustainable. The ultimate solution must depend on a combination of two things. The first is greater gov- ernment efforts to overcome poverty through large-scale devel- opment initiatives, including greater provision of services to these communities and better employment opportunities, that are not directly linked to natural resources, but which must be respectful of them nonetheless. The other is to reduce the population growth rate to the greatest extent possible, thereby minimising the scale of the poverty alleviation challenge. Some countries, notably China, have grasped this nettle with albeit unpopular measures but at least they are not in denial of this fundamental problem, as are most countries in Africa. Family planning within CBNRM areas is essential if they are to be sustainable in the long term. \u2303 A group of pastoralists with their livestock in the Omo valley, Ethiopia.

        "172 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Eastern Africa L isted below are the main lessons to be learned with regard to the conservation and management of natural resources in Eastern Africa. Most of the lessons learned noted in the reviews of other regions are also applicable to Eastern Africa (see the equivalent sections of Chapters 1, 3 and 4). 4.1 Value of ecosystem services still not sufficiently well understood The root causes underlying unsustainable resource utilisation and the relentless degradation of natural ecosystems are ill-qualified, poorly motivated and often corrupt officials, and the approval of development actions whose environmental impacts are not being minimised to the greatest possible extent. These problems relate back to ignorance in Ministries of Finance and Planning as to the economic value of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Agricultural, extractive and financial services industries are also ignorant. 4.2 NRM agencies remain under-resourced The under-valuation of ecosystem services and biodiversity by governments is a fundamental driver of the institutional weak- nesses that generate inefficient, ineffective and corrupt manage- ment practices. These weaknesses centre on human resources that are too few in number, poorly paid and equipped, ill trained and inadequately supervised. Whether for routine operations or capital development, the level of funding made available to Natural Resource Management (NRM) agencies is invariably inadequate. Badly paid and unsupervised field staff in particular will always be corruptible. 4.3 Poaching cannot be contained by in situ protection alone Recent failures to protect elephants and especially rhinos in areas considered extremely safe prove that in situ protection measures can never be impenetrable. The lesson to be learned is that much more must be done at other points along the value chain. For \u2018supply\u2019 countries, the biggest constraint to combating the illegal trade in wildlife products is insufficient coordination between different law-enforcement agencies, and in particular a lack of skills in intelligence-based methods at the national level. 4.4 CBNRM is not a panacea against all threats Communities will value their local wildlife if it can provide liveli- hood benefits that outweigh alternatives. Despite this sound theoretical foundation, CBNRM has its limits in terms of alleviat- ing the poverty that drives most of the region\u2019s environmental problems. Community success in obtaining and maintaining user rights is very heavily dependent on the assistance of donor- funded NGOs due to complex and demanding government pro- cedures. Schemes fail when technical support is withdrawn prematurely; it must be maintained for decades rather than years. Even then, prospects for sustaining meaningful benefits in the long term are poor in the face of high population growth rates and slow economic development. 4.5 PA designs need improving Recent and developing trends are exposing weaknesses in the designs of PA systems inherited from colonial administrations. These include the failure to include representative examples of all major ecotypes, and the erosion of connectivity through the accelerating transformation of hitherto undeveloped areas between PAs. Elephants in particular seldom if ever spend a full year within a PA, and so is the species most affected by the ongoing appropriation of unprotected habitat, and the one causing the most serious conflict with man as a result. In response, new PAs and corridors between PAs must be created wherever possible in order to improve PA resilience and long-term system viability. Such needs have inspired many stakeholders to adopt a \u2018land- scape\u2019 approach to area-based conservation, in which complexes of PAs are conserved hand-in-hand with the eco-sensitive and wildlife-friendly development of intervening and surrounding areas. These complexes may be within or straddling national bor- ders, the latter being known as transfrontier conservation areas. Experience and logic indicate that priority should be given to the integrated conservation and development of complexes that sup- port key elephant populations. >4 _ Lessons learned and promising approaches ",
        "| 173 #2 Lessons learned and promising approaches 4.6 EAC has yet to fully embrace a regional approach to wildlife conservation Compared to some other regions, the East African Community has yet to take seriously a coordinated, transfrontier approach to conservation. To date, the regional NRM interests of the EAC have been heavily biased towards shared lake and freshwater fishery resources. Momentum towards the development of prop- erly mandated TFCAs is still tentative, and the regional function for which the College of African Wildlife Management was created has been greatly weakened, thus partly explaining deficiencies in adequately trained manpower at the PA-manager level in particular. However, a recent request from the EAC\u2019s Deputy Secretary General, Jesca Eriyo, for member countries to work together in order to effectively manage and protect their ecosystems as an integral part of development, and her statement that \u2018regional and continental park authorities need to share information and carry out enforcement jointly\u2019, are encouraging and suggest that the necessary political will is emerging 69 . 4.7 Donor-funded programmes to support the wildlife sector can be effective but must be sustained longer Projects and programmes which provide technical and material support to build management capacity in an NRM organisation, or even throughout the sector as a whole, can be very effective, especially in situations where a complete overhaul and restruc- turing is necessary and appropriate. Experience has shown that PA-support projects should not focus entirely on the selected PAs: they work best when complementary support can also be given at headquarters (HQ) level. While the need to ensure that TA to CBNRM is maintained long enough has already been noted above, there is a tendency for all forms of TA provided to the wildlife sector to be too short lived. No doubt high costs are one reason for this, but it can take a very long time for the new policies, laws, procedures or skills that TA might impart to be formulated, implemented and embedded. At the same time, European Development Fund (EDF) procedures tend to inhibit the speedy implementation of activities (especially those for procurement). With the benefit of hindsight, there are many examples of the efforts of advisors \u2013 whether deployed at PA or HQ level \u2013 collapsing after they were removed too soon. Project designs must make more realistic appraisals of sustain- ability prospects within alternate timeframes. Another project design problem frequently encountered, irrespec- tive of donor and common to all regions, is that disbursements are not linked tightly enough to the achievement of targets and results. This compromises the motivation and efficiency of project execu- tants, opens a door to the misapplication of funds, and ultimately reduces effectiveness and impact to well below what should be attainable. If projects and programmes are to become longer and bigger, this must go hand-in-hand with the introduction of more rigorous performance monitoring and accountability measures.

        "176 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Eastern Africa O n the basis of the above reviews it is very evident that the East African region contains a spectacular variety of ecosystems and natural resources of great economic value, all of which are under an inexorably mounting threat of degradation or loss, and therefore urgently in need of improved protection and/or sustainable management. Therefore the grounds for the EU to greatly magnify its support for their con- servation are extremely robust and compelling. At the same time, as the reviews have clearly attempted to indicate, there are numerous programmes, projects and actions already underway or planned by governments, IGOs and NGOs, covering a wide spectrum of issues and approaches. It follows that the EU needs to identify a niche within this spectrum within which it can implement a suite of interventions designed to deliver an optimal ratio between cost and impact, whilst simulta- neously satisfying its pre-declared interests and priorities. The Terms of Reference for this study indicated clearly that the contemporary crisis issues of international wildlife trade, and related to that issues of elephant and rhinoceros conservation, are areas to which the European Commission would like to afford priority, while at the same time taking advantage of the interest and concern generated by these issues to make a significant, long-lasting contribution to conserving other key elements of Africa\u2019s wildlife. The choice of \u2018other key elements\u2019 is critical because the scope is huge, yet even magnified resources will be finite. A narrow, selec- tive focus is thus inescapable, but it is also acceptable given the fact that nothing of genuine importance will escape the attention of one actor or another. It is recommended that selectivity in the present case be based on two fundamental premises. Firstly, selected interventions should have multiple benefits, thus optimis- ing the ratio between cost and impact. Secondly, in order to facil- itate acceptance of higher spending, it is more important to select interventions that align well with the relatively unsophisticated perceptions and interests of the average European taxpayer, the ultimate financier of any pan-African conservation programme, rather than take an overly technical or scientific approach. Based on the above-mentioned priorities (trade, elephants, rhi- nos) and premises (multiple benefits, popular appeal), a variety of interventions suitable for EU support in Eastern Africa can be identified. These can be differentiated according to whether they address an issue, a species, an area or an institution. Some can be further distinguished according to whether they are relevant to the entire region, or only at a national level. Inevitably, any deliberately selective approach can create debate and dispute amongst different stakeholders with different vested interests about what to include or exclude. However, it must be borne in mind that since the approach proposed is for a EU pro- gramme then the EU\u2019s vested interests are entitled to prevail. 5.1 Issues: Law enforcement and trade control The illegal wildlife trade is a cross-cutting issue relevant to all regions. As such the topic has a stand-alone section in Chapter 5 of this report in which a full set of relevant actions recommended for EU support is presented. While those particularly important for Eastern Africa are briefly outlined below, please refer to the overall trade section for further detail. 5.1.1 National Support for national-level, multi-agency Wildlife Enforcement Networks (WENs) in all countries is recommended, irrespective of whether a WEN or an equivalent already exists. The main components of that support would be application of ICCWC\u2019s Wildlife and Forest Crime Analytic Toolkit , and the secondment through ICCWC of Wildlife Security Advisers to boost the intelli- gence aspects of WEN work in particular (see also Chapter 5, Section 3.9.3.3). The urgency and relevance of such support has been highlighted by the trade in ivory and rhino horn, but the investigative actions nec- essary to control that trade along the entire value chain are basically the same as those required to control the trade in any and all other wildlife commodities. Thus action in this area has multiple benefits: all species of plant or animal being traded will benefit. >5 _ Indicative conservation actions ",
        "| 177 #2 Indicative conservation actions 5.1.2 Regional A WEN for the Horn of Africa (HAWEN) is under development, but its utility is questionable if functional WENs exist at national level. The situation thus requires further debate and analysis before unequivocal EU support can be recommended (see Chapter 5, Section 3.9.3.2). There is a strong case for the development of a forensic labora- tory that is able to provide regional services for DNA and isotopic analyses of ivory, rhino horn and other specimens, including bush- meat. Given its pre-existing inter-regional orientation, the KWS forensic lab in Nairobi is the obvious place in which to develop such a service (see Section 3.2.2 above), not least because the same equipment can be used irrespective of the type of sample, be it rhino horn, ivory or something else. The development of forensic services for Eastern Africa at the KWS lab is recommended for EU support, as elaborated further in section 3.9.3.4 of Chapter 5. Support to law-enforcement training for PA managers features under institutional strengthening for Eastern Africa\u2019s regional College of African Wildlife Management (see Section 5.4.1 below). 5.2 Species: Protecting threatened flagship species 5.2.1 Elephant Elephant conservation is a crosscutting issue relevant to all regions of Africa. As such the topic has a stand-alone section in Chapter 5 of this report in which a set of relevant actions recom- mended for European Commission support is presented. Those applicable to Eastern Africa are briefly outlined here. Please refer to the section on elephants in Chapter 5 for further detail. All East African nations are elephant range states with the excep- tion of Burundi and Djibouti, and the possible exception of Sudan and Somalia. As such they all stand to benefit from the recom- mendations made. These include further support to the following: the MIKES (Minimising the Illegal Killing of Elephants) and ETIS (Elephant Trade Information System) projects; the African Ele- phant Specialist Group; the African Elephant Fund and other sim- ilar funds; and carrying out censuses of forest populations. Given the economic and ecological importance of elephants, and the fact that they have such large demands in terms of living space, there is a strong logic that by conserving elephants successfully, you will automatically help conserve the multitude of other species sharing their range, as well as a considerable degree of \u2303 Elephants near a fishing village in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda.

        "178 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Eastern Africa ecosystem-level functionality. Recognising the \u2018multiplier effect\u2019 of conserving key flagship species is not new, but that in no way negates its validity or importance. Indeed, at least two leading conservation NGOs explicitly target key elephant ranges in their current programmes for that reason (AWF and International Fund for Animal Welfare or IFAW). It is recommended that the European Commission also adopts this approach, but targets the very biggest populations in each region as an initial priority. Many selection criteria could be used but the simpler one\u2019s approach is the better, provided it remains meaningful. The argument here is that the bigger the population, the easier it will be to keep the rate of mortality (heavily influ- enced by poaching) below the birth rate. Put another way, the biggest populations represent the species\u2019 best hope looking far into the future. Some might argue that the biggest populations need the least attention, but this assumes an unwarranted complacency as to their resilience because even these can crash with alarming speed, as recent events in Tanzania have shown (see Section 1.2.1 in Chapter 5), and recent history provides several examples of formerly huge populations disappearing. The need to distinguish and include the biggest populations from each region is necessitated both by the genetic variation across the range (there may in fact be two or even three species), and a desire to use the elephant to help conserve examples of the very different types of ecosystem it lives in, which range from forests to semi-deserts. Table 1 gives a summary of East Africa\u2019s elephant numbers, from which it is predictable that the biggest populations will be in Tanzania and Kenya. The data given is for 2012/13 as posted on the website 70 , from which full details at the individual population level may be obtained. The five biggest elephant populations in Eastern Africa, whose ranges might be termed Very Important Elephant Areas (VIEAs), are those shown in Table 2. As in any selection process, the deci- sion on where to place a cut-off threshold is to an extent arbitrary. In this case, choosing the top five represents a subjectively sat- isfactory reconciliation between a necessary and realistic limit (big populations by definition will be expensive to protect), and the populations that really do stand out head and shoulders above the others. Working from the combined number of Eastern Africa\u2019s Definite and Probable elephants (143 825), the five pop- ulations listed are the only ones that exceed 7 200 \u2013 or 5 % of the regional total \u2013 in number 71 . While it is suggested that other regions should also keep their selection of VIEAs to a maximum of five, the cut-off point in percentage terms will differ from one to another. All of the five populations listed above use an ecosystem made up of a mosaic of protected and unprotected areas, as shown in Figure 5 for Ruaha-Rungwa. All of them are sufficiently important to be assured of being included among those considered a priority for area-based interventions (see Section 5.3.1). Table 1.

As such, the topic has a stand-alone chapter in Chapter 5 of this report in which a set of relevant actions recommended for European Commission support are presented and from which all the rhino range states of Eastern Africa stand to benefit. The recommendation to develop a forensic lab for Eastern Africa in Kenya was prompted by a KWS lab\u2019s pre-existing efforts to acquire a capacity to undertake DNA analysis of rhino horn (see Section 3.2.2 above). Compared to elephants, rhinos have considerably less ecological impact, and nowhere near as extensive range requirements. Con- sequently it is not possible to generate an equivalent \u2018multiplier effect\u2019 argument for giving their needs matching priority. However, they are considerably more endangered and as such do have very significant \u2018existence value\u2019, in western perception especially. They also have economic value deriving from their status as a tourism attraction and as a potential, if controversial, source of revenue (through sport hunting and horn trade). As such, rhinos must be included among a set of globally iconic species of similar concern, all of which should benefit from the EU pro- gramme if possible; others with equivalent existence and eco- nomic values are the great apes, the big cats and wild dogs. Consequently the presence of these species is deemed particu- larly relevant to the selection of areas most deserving of support (see Section 5.3 below). Action on behalf of locally iconic and other endangered species is discussed in Section 5.3.3 below. 5.3 Areas: Key Landscapes for Conservation If one applies a consideration of multiple benefits and popular appeal to a selection of areas in Eastern Africa (protected or otherwise) most deserving of support, one concludes that the selection should start with any area that satisfies at least one of these criteria: \u2022 qualifies (subjectively) as representative of a \u2018last great intact ecosystem/wilderness area\u2019; \u2022 represents the most viable, fully functioning remnant of a particular ecotype; \u2022 contains an abundant and diverse assemblage of animals on a \u2018pleistocene scale\u2019; \u2022 features a unique migratory phenomenon; \u2022 supports one of Eastern Africa\u2019s five biggest elephant populations; \u2022 has \u2018outstanding universal value\u2019 according to its status as a World Heritage Site. Obviously the more of these criteria an area can satisfy, the more important and deserving of support it becomes. Few individual PAs are able to satisfy even one of these criteria, but certain complexes of PAs that are contiguous, or are in close proximity to each other, can. PA complexes, therefore, are a dominant fea- ture of the landscapes most deserving of support identified in the next section. An analysis to demonstrate that a selection based on such simple criteria can indeed deliver multiple benefits follows in Section 5.3.3. As such, they represent spectacular, still viable examples of Africa\u2019s wildlife and wild places that are of such outstanding importance and value that they should be conserved at all costs and in principle forever. They are referred to both here and in all other chapters as Key Landscapes for Conservation or KLCs . Section 5.3.4 concludes with a description of the various ways in which KLCs could actually be supported. \u2303 Kenya Wildlife Service staff release a female white rhino from a cage at Nairobi National Park during the translocation of 10 rare white rhinos from the drought stricken Lake Nakuru National Park in the Rift valley.

        "| 181 #2 Indicative conservation actions 5.3.1 East African Key Landscapes for Conservation (inland) Table 3 and Figure 6 show the inland areas of Eastern Africa qualifying as KLCs against one or more of the basic criteria posed above, and identified as priorities under the current review. Some of those listed are TFCAs (see Section 3.4.2), while others lie entirely within a single country. Further detail with regard to the nature and importance of each KLC may be found elsewhere in this report as indicated in Table 4. In addition, the Appendix lists all the PAs to be found in each KLC, with supplementary informa- tion also given in Table 5 of the summary document \u2013 Synthesis. Considering the rigorous criteria involved in attaining WHS status, its inclusion as a qualifying criterion for KLCs is important. Com- bining this with the other KLC criteria, one can be very confident that, between them, the KLCs selected not only host a very high percentage of the region\u2019s biodiversity, but also do so where it has the best chance of survival in perpetuity. As generally large areas, they also preserve ecosystem service functions to the greatest possible extent. Even so, purists will reasonably object that very many important areas are excluded, including certain TFCAs, national parks and other PAs, Ramsar sites, Important Bird Areas and so on. While further analysis would show that several of these are also cap- tured by the proposed KLCs, the fact remains that a limit must be set somehow. Bearing in mind that the other three regions have generated lists of similar magnitude, delivering meaningful support to approximately 70 KLCs incorporating some 300 PAs in total is already a massive challenge. Nevertheless, there is no reason why other areas \u2013 new WHSs in particular \u2013 may not in future be recognised as KLCs and be equally eligible for priority EU support (see also Section 5.3.3). It is strongly recommended that the EU gives initial pri- ority to supporting the KLCs listed both here and in other chapters (see summary Table 5 in the summary document \u2013 Synthesis). The various ways in which this could be done are outlined in Section 5.3.4 below. Table 3.

Tana water supports most of Kenya\u2019s important power and urban water needs, including over 90 % of Nairobi city\u2019s requirements. The Tana River delta features on Kenya\u2019s List of Tentative World Heritage sites. 5.3.2 East African Key Landscapes for Conservation (coastal/marine) Although most coastal PAs in Eastern Africa have been estab- lished in relation to a specific biophysical feature, such as a coral reef, there is no reason why a more holistic, KLC-type approach cannot also be used to identify coastal-marine areas or com- plexes of outstanding biodiversity and value. Although relevant work has been undertaken in Eastern Africa, few of the areas of apparently greatest importance have obtained either formal rec- ognition or direct support to date. The marine World Heritage Sites closest to Eastern Africa are the Aldabra Atoll (Seychelles) and iSimangaliso Wetland Park (South Africa). Only one coastal area features in the Lists of Tentative WHSs submitted by East African countries and that is the small Jozani Forest-Chwaka Bay area on Zanzibar (Tanzania). However, some coastal wetlands have been recognised under the Ramsar Conven- tion, notably the Rufiji Delta (Tanzania) and the Tana Delta (Kenya). The most recent work to identify coastal complexes of outstand- ing importance has been undertaken by IUCN\u2019s Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Programme Office in the course of developing a programme entitled Resilient Coasts, which also covers the \u2018southern\u2018 country of Mozambique 73 . Five areas have been proposed for support under this programme. These include the three locations within the region of Eastern Africa that had been put forward previously as sites of outstanding universal value to be considered for listing by UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage Centre 74 , namely: \u2022 the Quirimbas-Mnazi Bay complex, northern Mozambique coast/southern Tanzania coast; \u2022 Bazaruto-Tofo in Inhambane Province, southern Mozambique coast; \u2022 the Lamu Archipelago-Tana Delta complex 75 , northern Kenya coast. In addition, the IUCN study recommends a further two sites that provide valuable ecosystem services, namely: \u2022 Rufiji Delta-Mafia Island complex, Tanzania (see also Box 12); \u2022 Kenya south coast complex (Msambweni, Funzi Bay-Ramisi River Estuary, Vanga). In terms of the present chapter\u2019s scope, consideration must also be given to outstanding areas in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. A major EU-funded study of the coast of Sudan conducted in 2007 developed a proposal for the Tentative Listing of a serial WHS called the Sudanese Red Sea Marine PA Network, a complex that includes both the Sanganeb Atoll Marine NP and the Dungonab Bay-Mukkawar Island Marine NP 76 . Eritrea hosts another impor- tant area, the Dahlak Archipelago, part of which is designated a marine NP but not as yet proposed for WHS status. EU-funded studies of the Somali environment carried out some years ago identified several coastal areas of conservation potential, but circumstances in that country continue to preclude any meaning- ful development effort 77 .

        "| 185 #2 Indicative conservation actions Table 5 summarises the East African areas with identified poten- tial to be coastal KLCs in accordance with the concept promoted in this report. In the short term, the most appropriate strategy for the European Commission would be to offer support to IUCN\u2019s Resilient Coasts Programme, since much of the groundwork has been laid. In the longer term, support can be developed for areas in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden whose littoral states are inher- ently harder to work in. 5.3.3 Multiple benefits Tables 6 and 7 show how the conservation of the large, diverse and intact ecosystems identified here as KLCs automatically satisfies other important considerations, thus confirming the \u2018multiple bene- fits\u2019 premise. Table 6, for example, shows how all the important iconic species of global concern will benefit from the selection. Legitimate concern might be raised that the rather simplistic emphasis given in KLC selection to the most obviously charismatic megafauna means that locally iconic and/or other rare and endangered species are excluded. It has not been possible as part of the present study to develop full species lists for each of the proposed KLCs, but the text sections within this report cited in Table 4 indicate just how many species of great local concern and importance are in fact catered for in the selection. Other examples include Grevy\u2019s zebra ( Equus grevyi ), the core of whose very restricted distribution falls within KLC8; Rothschild\u2019s giraffe is a rare sub-species restricted to KLC3; KLC9 incorporates the most important area for the locally iconic Nile lechwe ( Kobus megaceros ); and so on. Nonetheless, there are inevitably some important species which range outside the initial selection of KLCs presented here. Perhaps the most notable exclusions are some from truly arid areas and coastal forest species, such as the primates detailed in Box 5 and the hirola antelope 78 , which is also mentioned in Section 1.2.3. As indicated earlier however, the list of KLCs should be seen as flexible not fixed, and open to the addition of new WHSs in par- ticular. It is notable in this context that a \u2018Tana delta and forest complex\u2019 features on Kenya\u2019s List of Tentative WHSs, so the chances are very high that this area will \u2018automatically\u2019 qualify as a KLC in due course.

( 78 ) In fact the hirola is effectively covered under the Greater Mount Kenya KLC because the NRT-managed conservancy it ranges in, although physically separated from the others, could still benefit from any support programme to the Greater Mount Kenya KLC. \u2303 ",
        "186 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Eastern Africa As such, the Tana delta and several other \u2018high value\u2019 areas could already have been selected as KLCs, and are only omitted from the present list as a matter of initial prioritisation. It is hoped that locally perceived shortcomings in the KLC selection will help moti- vate the concerned stakeholders to get their areas\u2019 profile raised (by upgrading to NP or WHS status, for example) and to raise dedicated funds for their proper management and protection. Indeed, in view of their potential as KLCs, the EU should support the preparation of application dossiers for ten- tative WHSs as part of its strategic approach. Table 7 shows how the initial selection captures at least one representative example of every major ecotype found in the region, as well as areas providing critically important watershed protection services. 5.3.4 Scope of possible actions in KLCs The level of investment required will vary greatly according to a KLC\u2019s present condition, and any pre-existing level of investment from government and/or other external sources. Depending on this, assistance would centre on helping to prepare (or update), and then implement, General Management Plans. Where several PAs make up a KLC, these GMPs could either be at the level of an individual PA, or at an integrated level for the whole KLC. In the latter case especially, the plans will look beyond the borders of formal PAs and plan for the eco-friendly development of the (mostly) communal areas in the interstices between them. Con- sequently, any of the following activities would be eligible for support in KLCs: \u2022 supporting the establishment and functioning of a high-level Steering Committee; \u2022 provision of technical assistance (resident advisors, and/or consultants); \u2022 co-management contracts; \u2022 outright management contracts (e.g. with African Parks); \u2022 general management planning; Table 6.

Whether or not they feature in the final RIP, these interventions remain worthy of EU support. Consequently the first two are discussed in the paragraphs below, while the forensic laboratory is presented in Chapter 5, Section 3.9.3.4. TFCA policy and procedures It is evident from the selection of KLCs proposed for support that the successful development and application of the concept of TFCAs is very important to the conservation of key ecosystems in Eastern Africa. Unfortunately the level of political commitment and support for TFCAs is still weak in the region, but the EAC, its Secretariat and its NRM Protocol provide a sound platform on which this could be developed (see Section 3.4.2). \u2303 A British army paratrooper instructs Kenya Wildlife Service rangers in anti-poaching techniques. ",
        "| 189 #2 Indicative conservation actions Accordingly it was proposed under the RIP process that Eastern Africa should develop a Protocol on Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement , modelled closely on that adopted by the SADC. This met resistance from the EAC Secretariat on the grounds that the draft Eastern Africa Tourism and Wildlife Protocol was already too far advanced to be significantly altered. This is unfor- tunate because as it stands the draft Protocol is deficient in terms of provisions for TFCAs (see Section 3.1.3). Having been in the pipeline since 2009, a reluctance to admit to serious flaws now is understandable. The compromise suggested by the EAC Sec- retariat was to allow the Protocol to go ahead as is and, in a parallel move, augment it with an Agreement, MoU or some other similar instrument whose formal adoption \u2013 unlike a Protocol proper \u2013 could be fast-tracked. Whilst not carrying the weight of a Protocol, an Eastern Africa Agreement on Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcemen t is far better than nothing in terms of providing a strong platform for TFCA co-management in the region. Accordingly, EU support is anticipated for all that this would entail, including consultation, adoption and supervision of implementation. The latter would centre on widening the remit and capacity of the units and staff responsible for wildlife affairs to provide a permanent focal point within the EAC Secretariat to catalyse, coordinate and sustain the TFCA initiative. Irrespective of whether or when a much stronger policy environ- ment and support apparatus for TFCAs in the EAC might emerge, it is recommended that the EU assists the EAC in prepar- ing a regional TFCA Development Plan as soon as possi- ble, followed by support for its implementation in one or more priority TFCAs that are also KLCs . The range of inputs that could be involved is as listed in Section 5.3.4 above. Warden training at the College of African Wildlife Management, Moshi, Tanzania A need has been identified to re-constitute the availability of a comprehensive training course in Eastern Africa at the College of African Wildlife Management (CAWM), which is tailored to the needs of wardens-in-charge of PAs and geared to contemporary law-enforcement challenges in particular (see Section 3.4.3) 79 . A draft curriculum has already been prepared by the college, and EU support for its refinement and delivery has been requested under the RIP. Since it is unlikely that everything needed to initiate and run the programme could be met from that source, supple- mentary EU support is recommended, especially with regard to scholarships to enable selected officers to attend . It can be noted here that the European Commission has provided very similar support to CAWM in the past 80 . 5.4.2 National Programmes supporting sectoral reform (including policy and legal), institutional restructuring and strengthening of manage- ment authorities (including the design or re-design of PA systems) are very cost-effective conservation investments at the national level because all PAs, and all wildlife (whether in PAs or not), stand to benefit. It is recommended therefore that the European Commis- sion sets aside resources to enable it to support nation- al-level sectoral, institutional and/or PA system reforms on an ad hoc, if-and-when requested basis, and adver- tises its willingness and ability to act in this way. Countries identified in this report as being in need of such support are, in order of priority (based on the degree of perceived mis- match between biodiversity richness and overall management capacity): Ethiopia, Tanzania (transformation of the Wildlife Divi- sion into the Tanzania Wildlife Authority), Kenya (possible merger of Wildlife and Forest Services), Sudan and \u2013 if conditions ever permit \u2013 Somalia. Finally, the importance of supporting and strengthening civil soci- ety organisations (local communities, community-based organi- sations) should not be overlooked as they are often vital in cat- alysing public engagement in biodiversity conservation. In Eastern Africa, civil society plays a pivotal role in conservation, especially capacity building of both government and local communities and the development of models, and catalysing appropriate actions by mandated government agencies.

        "204 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Central Africa T his Chapter 3 is organised into five sections: 1) an intro- duction to the wildlife and habitats of Central Africa; 2) a review of the challenges, threats and drivers of threats; 3) a review of ongoing conservation efforts; 4) lessons learned and promising approaches, particularly with respect to the land- scape approach to protected area management, partnerships with the private sector, engagement with local communities, and law enforcement; 5) indicative conservation actions to achieve long-term wildlife conservation in Central Africa. Section 1 describes the main natural habitats and ecosystems of Central Africa and the status of wildlife in the region. It describes the moist tropical forests that dominate Central Africa (including the volcanic islands in the Gulf of Guinea), the biodiversity-rich, moist forest-savannah transition zones, the Sahelian savannahs and woodlands to the north of the moist forest block, and the miombo woodlands to the south. The moist forest block is by far the most extensive area of continuous forest in Africa and con- tains the planet\u2019s largest area of swamp forest. The Central African forests are characterised by high levels of endemism, including several iconic species, such as four subspecies of goril- las, bonobos and okapi. They also represent a gigantic carbon sink and strongly influence local weather patterns. The generally intact nature of vast areas of habitat outside protected areas in Central Africa, particularly in the moist forest zone, together with the generally low human densities, means that it is not too late to do something for conservation. Section 2 reviews the long-term threats to Central African wildlife. The commercial bushmeat trade is probably the single most per- vasive threat and is leading to defaunation of large tracts of oth- erwise undisturbed forest (\u2018empty forest\u2019 syndrome). The commerce is greatly aided by the industrial logging and mining activities, which provide easy and rapid access for hunters deep into the most remote forest blocks. Habitat loss through deforestation, principally from shifting agriculture and fuelwood and charcoal collection, is a threat, although deforestation rates are lower than anywhere else in Africa. Land grabbing for agro-industrial plantations, par- ticularly oil palm, is a growing threat. The most important drivers of these threats are population growth, poverty and poor govern- ance. Insecurity of land tenure and resource user rights and armed conflict are also important drivers. Finally, insecurity and conflict have plagued the region for decades and have had a devastating effect on capacities to manage PAs and protect wildlife. Section 3 reviews ongoing conservation efforts. The Central African Commission for Forests (COMIFAC) and the Congo Basin Forest Partnership (CBFP) provide the strategic framework for regional cooperation and donor collaboration in Central Africa. The section reviews the key bi- and multi-lateral donors and conservation non-governmental organisations (NGOs) operating in Central Africa. Section 4 reviews lessons learned and promising approaches. The key lesson is that PAs contain the most intact assemblages of wildlife and biodiversity; also, the PAs where biodiversity is being most effectively protected are those that are receiving long-term support from donor agencies and their technical part- ners. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) for the management of PAs offer good opportunities for strengthening PA management in Central African countries where PA management capacities are very weak. The landscape approach, targeting groups of PAs and the areas linking them (including transfrontier conservation areas), significantly enhances conservation outcomes because habitats, particularly in the moist forest block, remain relatively intact. Promising opportunities exist for partnerships with private sector logging and mining operators, whose concessions cover the majority of the forests linking PAs and which are required to integrate conservation measures in their legally binding manage- ment plans. Building constituencies for conservation among local communities has proved challenging because forest peoples are highly individualistic in their approach to natural resource use. Insecurity of land tenure further complicates the situation and contributes to situations of \u2018open access\u2019 to resources, resulting in overexploitation. There are few examples of successful liveli- hood programmes that contribute to more sustainable natural resource use in Central Africa. Furthermore the \u2018conservation- linked-to-development\u2019 paradigm that dominates modern biodi- versity conservation thinking has resulted too often in conservation projects having to address all the socio-economic ills of popula- tions living around protected areas, despite rarely having either the financial resources or the expertise to do this. Finally no last- ing progress in wildlife conservation can be achieved if there is no political will at the very highest level. >0 _ Executive Summary ",
        "| 205 #3 | 205 Executive Summary Section 5 outlines a plan for achieving long-term wildlife conser- vation in Central Africa. Long-term support for Key Landscapes for Conservation (KLCs) containing Central Africa\u2019s most impor- tant PAs is the central pillar of the plan since these are the areas that have the greatest chance of surviving the many pressures on wildlife and natural resources in the coming years. Priority is given to sites harbouring the most intact assemblages of Central African wildlife. World Heritage Sites (WHSs) are also a priority by virtue of their WHS status, which recognises their global impor- tance for nature conservation, as are sites which are on the coun- tries\u2019 tentative lists for WHS status or which protect specific globally important features not found elsewhere. In total, some 60 PAs are included in the KLCs identified. Three particularly important KLCs, all of which are also transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs) are (i) Greater Virunga KLC (overlapping with East- ern African region) along the Albertine Rift, which encompasses 11 PAs including three WHSs, (ii) the Greater TRIDOM-TNS KLC encompassing 14 PAs including three WHSs, and (iii) Gamba- Mayumba-Conkouati KLC encompassing four PAs. Between them these three KLCs protect a substantial proportion of Central Africa\u2019s floral and faunal diversity. They also include most of the priority areas identified in the action plans for gorillas and chim- panzees and encompass the majority of Africa\u2019s remaining forest elephants, of which Gabon alone probably holds 50 %. These large KLCs also offer good opportunities for reinforcing existing, and developing new, public-private partnerships (PPPs) for PA man- agement, as well as for developing PPPs with the mining and logging sector for wildlife conservation and sustainable livelihood activities in the intervening buffer zones. While on-the-job training will always be an important component of support to PAs, the major constraint to effective PA manage- ment is the weakness of the PA management authorities and the absence of career opportunities in order to encourage competent conservation practitioners (at all levels) to join the authority and stay with it to make their career. Support for institutional strength- ening and/or reform of national PA authorities should therefore be a strategic priority of this plan. Actions to dismantle wildlife crime networks are also key com- ponents of the plan and should focus on three themes: (i) building collaboration between organisations and agencies; (ii) strength- ening law enforcement; (iii) properly penalising wildlife crime. COMIFAC\u2019s regional law enforcement action plan should be sup- ported, as should the important efforts of NGO wildlife enforce- ment networks. Lastly, the issue of the unsustainable bushmeat trade must be addressed. Although there are no neat solutions to this intractable problem, it cannot be ignored either. Most bushmeat is consumed in urban areas where it is more of a \u2018luxury\u2019 item than for rural populations where it is more of a food security issue. The plan identifies three areas where action must be taken: (i) reducing the demand for bushmeat, including developing alternative sources of protein at a cost similar to bushmeat; (ii) improving the sustain- ability of the supply by better management of the resource; (iii) creating a conducive, enabling, institutional and policy environ- ment so that local resource users have a secure stake in the resource and an incentive to manage it sustainably. \u2303 Adult male mandrill in Lop\u00e9 National Park, Gabon, a Natural and Cultural Heritage Site where groups of many hundred individuals can occasionally be seen.

        "208 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Central Africa T he Central African region as defined for the purposes of this report comprises eight countries: Cameroon , Central African Republic , Chad , Republic of Congo , Democratic Republic of Congo , Equatorial Guinea , Gabon and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 & Pr\u00edncipe . The moist tropical forest block of what is loosely referred to as the Congo Basin is the dominant feature of the Central African region in terms of surface area, species richness and diversity, carbon sequestration and influence on climate. The Gulf of Guinea islands of Equatorial Guinea and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 & Pr\u00edncipe also contain small but biologically important areas of moist tropical rainforest. To the north and south of the moist forest block the ecological transitions to woodland and savannah produce a number of bio- logically important ecosystems. 1.1 Moist tropical forests These forests constitute a vast block of tropical rainforests cov- ering an estimated 1.79 million km\u00b2 of Central Africa 1 and span- ning six of the Central African states (Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo and Democratic Republic of Congo) and extending also into small areas of Nigeria and Angola. The forests include a vast expanse of different types of lowland Congolian rainforests, and much more restricted, and threatened, areas of high biodiversity Afro- montane forests in the Mount Cameroon area in the west and the Albertine Rift in the east. This vast expanse of forests is often loosely referred to as the Congo Basin, although it in fact covers several watersheds: Congo, Sanaga, Ntem, Ogoou\u00e9, Nyanga, Niari and Kouilou, and in the east the Nile watershed. However, roughly two-thirds of these forests are drained by the Congo River and 60 % of them fall within the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The moist tropical forests of Central Africa form an essentially uninterrupted forest block, with roughly 80 % falling between 300 and 1 000 m above sea level 2 . Average annual rainfall is between 1 600 and 2 000 mm, although along the coasts between Cameroon and Gabon annual rainfall is much higher (3 000 to 11 000 mm). The cycle of climate changes over the past 2 million years has had a profound influence on the forests of the Congo Basin. In response to expansions and contractions of the polar icecaps, cool dry periods have alternated with warmer, humid periods, causing the forests to shrink and expand. During drier periods, the forests were reduced to a series of scattered refuges situated along the Atlantic coastal mountain ranges, the high- lands of eastern DRC, and along the gallery forests and swamps associated with the Congo River. These so-called forest refuges acted as reservoirs of forest species in periods of forest contrac- tion and as the forest fragmented and expanded, forest and non-forest species were repeatedly intermixed in a kind of \u2018evo- lutionary whirlpool\u2019 3 . The Okapi, the DRC\u2019s endemic forest giraffe, is a spectacular example of a forest species clearly displaying its savannah origins. Overall diversity, particularly floral diversity, of the Central African forests is high, though not as high as the Southern African region. However, what makes these forests particularly interesting is that much of the fauna and flora is found nowhere else in the world and this is true, not only at the species level but also at the genus and even family levels. The lowland forests contain around 10 000 higher plants, of which 30 % are endemic (including nine endemic families), while the Afro-montane forests contain around 4 000 species, of which 70 % are endemic (including two endemic families) 4 . Several endemic and charismatic mammals occur in the Central African forests, including the okapi, bongo, aquatic genet, gorilla (four subspecies) and bonobo; many of the small primates and forest duikers are also unique to these forests. In addition to the endemic Congo peacock, the forests contain at least five bird families endemic to Africa. Amphibian, reptile and fish diversity are also high, although all three groups are relatively poorly known and new species are regularly discovered. In the DRC alone over 1 000 species of freshwater fish are known. Several of the more charismatic regional endemics are confined to the DRC including the okapi, bonobo, Grauer\u2019s gorilla, aquatic genet and Congo peacock, and new mammal species are still being discovered in remote areas. >1 _ Special features of the Central African region ( 1 ) Mayaux P., J-F.

        "#3 | 209 | 209 #3 Special features of the Central African region \u2303 The bonobo is an endangered great ape that is found only in the DRC in the forests to the south of the Congo River. They are threatened by poaching for the bush meat and pet trades throughout their range and are classified as Endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In addition to its importance in terms of species diversity and endemism, the Congo Basin is one of the last regions in the world where vast areas of interconnected rainforest allow biological processes to continue undisturbed. Rainforests cover only 13 % of Africa\u2019s landmass but they account for more than 90 % of the carbon stored in the continent\u2019s terrestrial ecosystems 5 . The Congo Basin is therefore a gigantic carbon sink and as such plays a vital role in regulating the planet\u2019s greenhouse gases. Lastly it has a dominating influence on local weather patterns since over 50 % of the rain that falls on the central Congo Basin comes from evaporation and evapo-transpiration from the forest itself 6 . It is important to underline that the average rainfall over the Congo Basin is relatively low (approximately 2 000 mm) compared with Amazonia and south-east Asia, placing it close to the threshold of dry forests. This means that most, if not all, of the moist forest tree species would likely be lost if rainfall were to decrease slightly through climate change or extensive forest clearance. With a shift to drier forests fire would start having a devastating impact on the remaining forests, hydrological regimes would be profoundly affected and the impact on human livelihoods in the region would be catastrophic 7 . The vastness and apparent intactness of the moist tropical forests of the Congo Basin forests therefore belies the extreme precariousness of its existence. Specific features of the Central African moist forests to be high- lighted include: The Congolian Atlantic coastal forests have exceptionally high levels of species richness and endemism in all taxonomic groups, particularly birds, amphibians and reptiles. These forests contain a number of Pleistocene refuges \u2013 areas which remained forest-covered during the periodic expansions and retractions of the forest block over geological times and where forest species probably survived the dry periods to colonise the new forests in succeeding wet periods. The Monts de Cristal-Monte Al\u00e9n range, spanning eastern Equatorial Guinea and western Gabon, and Mont Doudou in southern Gabon, rise to altitudes in excess of 1 000 m and are of particular importance for plant diversity and endemism. The Monts de Cristal has over 3 000 species of vascular plant, of which over 100 are strict endemics. Species richness of forest mammals is also exceptional. The highly restricted range of the sun-tailed monkey, a species endemic to Gabon and only dis- covered in 1984, covers this ecoregion. Globally important popu- lations of gorillas, chimpanzee and forest elephant are also found within these forests. Other important larger mammals include the mandrill, black colobus, bongo and several forest duikers. A vast area of inland and coastal wetlands, and pockets of Central African mangroves, is also located within this ecoregion. The delta of the Ogoou\u00e9 River in Gabon is Africa\u2019s second largest delta after the Niger 8 . Covering over 5 000 km\u00b2 of flooded forests, swamps, lagoons, lakes and mangroves, this is one of nine Ramsar sites in Gabon and of huge importance for wildlife, particularly fish (both freshwater and marine), birds and other aquatic vertebrates such as manatee, hippo and Africa\u2019s three species of crocodile. The area contains pockets of Central African mangroves. Another unique feature of this area is the fact that elephants, gorillas, chimpanzees, hippo, forest buffalo and Nile crocodile can often be observed on the beaches on the Gabon coast. These beaches are also among the world\u2019s most important for nesting marine turtles, particularly leatherbacks. ( 5 ) Mayaux P., J-F. Pekel, B. Descl\u00e9e, F. Donnay, A. Lupi, F. Achard, M.

Uninterrupted moist forest formations from sea level to over 3 000m are found on the Gulf of Guinea islands. Levels of endemism are high on these islands due to their long separation from mainland continental Africa. The central portion of these forests, particularly the part in Gabon, has one of the lowest human population densities in Africa. Nevertheless, human activities in the form of industrial logging are widespread. Essentially all forests outside the protected areas have been attributed as logging concessions. Commercial hunting for the bushmeat trade is also widespread and protected species are often openly on sale in urban markets. Onshore oil exploita- tion in the coastal area is also a threat to biodiversity. There are nine International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) category I to IV PAs in these forests (two in Equatorial Guinea, six in Gabon and one in Congo) covering more than 27 000 km\u00b2 (18 % of the ecoregion). Moist forests of the Gulf of Guinea islands: The Gulf of Guinea islands comprising Bioko, Pr\u00edncipe, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Annobon form an arc of volcanic islands reaching out 750 km into the Atlan- tic Ocean. Uninterrupted moist forest formations from sea level to over 3 000 m are found on the islands. Due to their long separation from mainland continental Africa (Pr\u00edncipe emerged from the ocean some 17 million years ago 9 ), species have evolved that are unique to these islands. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe have 28 endemic bird species and Bioko has two Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) (Luba crater and Basil\u00e9 peak). Bioko also has five endemic subspecies of primate; the volcanic origin of these mountains pro- vides them with rich soils. The rugged landscapes of these volcanic islands are also particularly spectacular. The beaches of the islands are important nesting areas for marine turtles, the remote southern shore of Bioko being particularly important for leatherback, green and olive Ridley turtles. There are five IUCN category I to IV PAs on the four islands (two on Bioko, one on Pr\u00edncipe, one on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and one on Annobon), covering approximately 1 260 km\u00b2. Montane forests of west Cameroon and the Albertine Rift: The montane forests and Afro-alpine formations on Mount Cameroon and the Cameroon highlands in the west and the Albertine Rift in the east are areas of particularly high biodiversity and levels of endemism. For example, 42 plant species and three genera are strictly endemic to Mt Cameroon (where annual rain- fall attains >10 000 mm locally). Exceptionally large numbers of endemic animal species occur in all taxonomic groups. For exam- ple, along the Albertine Rift, 30 bird and 25 mammal endemics are known. The Virunga National Park in eastern DRC encapsu- lates the unique biodiversity of the Albertine Rift with an unin- terrupted gradient of biotopes from 700 m above sea level to Afro-alpine meadows and glaciers on the summit of the Ruwenzori range at just over 5 000 m over a horizontal distance of little more than 25 km. With the exception of Mt Cameroon, no other area in Africa has such a wide altitudinal span of natural habitats. In an area representing only 0.3 % of the total surface area of the DRC, the Virunga national park (NP) is home to over half of the DRC\u2019s mammal species and two-thirds of its bird species. ",

(See footnote 12 for reference.) ( 14 ) Searching for Bonobo in Congo, see http://www.bonoboincongo.com/maps/ However, throughout Central Africa, montane forests have been reduced to relicts by intense human activity since these areas are coveted for agriculture and livestock. The highest human densities of the Central African region are found in these regions (>400 inhabitants/km\u00b2 locally along the Albertine Rift). In the Cameroon highlands there are a large number of very small forest reserves, which are not well protected. Korup NP (1 295 km\u00b2) is the only category I-IV protected area in the Cameroon highlands. Along the Albertine Rift only parts of Virunga NP and Kahuzi-Biega NP (both World Heritage Sites in Danger) protect these important forests. Congolian swamp forests: This is one of the largest areas of swamp forest on the planet 10 covering some 200 375 km\u00b2. The Congolian swamp forests are located in the heart of the Congo Basin along the middle reaches of the Congo River and along its northern tributaries (Likouala, Sangha, Likouala-aux-herbes, Oubangui) and southern tributaries (Lomami, Tschuapa, Loile). While displaying relatively low species richness and diversity they are nevertheless of high importance in terms of endemism. They are very important for fish diversity and are vital breeding areas for many species. They also play a central role in the regulation of water flows across the Congo Basin. Surveys in northern Congo 11 in the early 1990s showed that the presence of Raphia palms in the Likouala-aux-Herbes swamps support high popula- tions of gorillas year round, and attract forest elephant in the dry season. The swamp forests of Lac Tumba-Lediima Reserve also support populations of bonobo 12 . Contrary to what might be expected, the swamp forests are not inaccessible to poachers. In some areas of the swamps in northern Congo, a dense network of dugout canoe channels is maintained by local hunters, which enable them to penetrate far into the forest and silently approach the non-inundated patches of forest where mammals tend to concentrate. Furthermore, the fact that they are in dugout canoes means that they can transport larger loads of bushmeat than if they were on foot. With the exception of a very small area along the Loile River in Salonga NP, none of these important forests lie within IUCN category I to IV PAs. However, the Lac T\u00e9l\u00e9\u2013Likouala aux Herbes Community Reserve in Congo (4 525 km\u00b2) lies wholly within this forest type, as does approximately half (3 500 km\u00b2) of the Lac Tumba-Lediima Reserve in DRC. Central Congolian lowland forests cover a vast area (c. 430 000 km\u00b2) to the south of the great arc of the Congo River and are entirely restricted to the DRC. They cover almost the entire range of the bonobo 13 , a species of great ape that is endemic to the DRC. A network of large rivers functions as dis- tribution barriers to many species, thereby isolating this lowland basin along its northern, eastern and western limits. Because of the relatively flat topography of the area, most of these rivers are slow-flowing with heavy sediment loads and have numerous alluvial islands. Many of the soils are nutrient-poor oxisols devel- oped over ancient \u2018dune fields\u2019. The central Congolian lowland forests, dominated by species from the leguminous Caesalpiniaceae family, are less floristically diverse than other areas of the Congo Basin but 10 % of the species are thought to be endemic. Vertebrate species richness and endemism is also lower than in other parts of the Congo Basin, perhaps because the river barriers have prevented the interchange of spe- cies from other ecoregions. On the other hand, these barriers have meant that several mammal species, including several small pri- mates, are endemic to the areas of forest to which they are con- fined by the river network. Selected examples are the recently described lesula monkey (between the Tschuapa and Lomami Rivers), the Salonga guenon (between the Lua and Lopori rivers) and Thollon\u2019s red colobus (between the Lomami and Congo rivers). In 2014, a probable new species of monkey, the inoka, was discov- ered between the Lomami and Congo Rivers 14 . Only one category I-IV PA is located in these forests (Salonga NP, 36 000 km\u00b2 \u2013 a World Heritage Site in Danger) but several other protected areas (Tumba-Lediima, Lomako-Lokolala, Sankuru) are also located in this ecoregion, as is the future Lomami NP. North-western and north-eastern Congolian lowland forests have high levels of species richness and endemism and cover the core area of the lowland gorilla and western chimpan- zee distribution. Mammalian richness is among the highest of any forest region in Africa and primate species richness is the highest in Africa. Cameroon has 29 species of primate and Gabon 19. The Okapi Wildlife Reserve (DRC) alone has 17 primate species. These forests contain the last strongholds of forest ele- phant, particularly in the transfrontier area of Gabon, Cameroon, Congo and Central African Republic (CAR). A particularly important feature of these forests, especially the north-western forests, is the presence of hundreds of forest clearings or \u2018bais\u2019 as they are known locally. These bais usually have mineral licks, which attract great numbers of large mammals, including forest elephant, buf- falo, sitatunga, bongo, bush pig, giant forest hog, gorillas and chimpanzees. They often have water sources, and the sedges and other aquatic vegetation provide an important food source for gorillas and ungulates. ",

The park is part of the recently nominated Tri-national Sangha transborder World Heritage Site. The forest clearings are also important sites for social interactions for many of the species that visit them, particularly the forest ele- phant. In areas relatively undisturbed by human activities, the bais are linked by a dense network of heavily used trails, known as ele- phant boulevards, which may cover many hundreds of kilometres. These forests have, until recently, been relatively inaccessible and have therefore remained largely free of human activities. How- ever the situation has changed very rapidly over the past 20 years. Almost all of the north-western forests are covered by active, or soon-to-be-active, industrial logging concessions. The dense net- work of logging roads has opened up the forest for immigrants in search of employment and forest resources, particularly bush- meat. Several very large industrial mining concessions (iron, cobalt, nickel) are also starting up and these will also attract thousands of people into these hitherto low populated areas. Gold deposits, some of which are of exceptionally high quality, are also found all over these forests. Most of the gold mining is artisanal and unregulated but attracts very large numbers of people. The majority of Central Africa\u2019s forest elephants are found in the north- western forests but they are being heavily targeted by gangs of poachers with links to criminal networks operating from both within and outside the Central African region. There are 15 category I-IV protected areas in these forests, covering a total of 74 100 km\u00b2, approximately 11 % of the north- eastern and north-western Congolian forests. The northern part of Virunga NP also covers some of this forest type. Three of Central Africa\u2019s six moist forest World Heritage Sites occur within these forests (Dja Reserve, Tri-national Sangha \u2013 TNS, Okapi Wild- life Reserve), although Dja and Okapi are on the World Heritage Site in Danger list. 1.2 Moist forest-savannah transition zones These transition zones are almost as extensive as the moist trop- ical forests. To the north of the rainforest block the forests give way to the northern Congolian forest savannah mosaic, a biolog- ically interesting transition zone where plant and animal species characteristic of both the rainforest and savannah occur (chim- panzee, bongo, giant forest hog, hyena, lion, etc.). With their char- acteristically diverse habitat types, forest savannah mosaics support a high proportion of eco-tonal habitats, which have high species richness and have probably been important centres for differentiation and speciation. Gallery forests are the dominant forest type in this zone and this is where the typical rainforest species are mainly found. Further north, the forest savannah mosaic gives way to relatively moist wooded grasslands with typically woodland/savannah species, such as giant eland, north- ern white rhino (now extinct), black rhino (only a few individuals remain), giraffe, roan, hartebeest and lion. In Garamba NP, the elephants show morphological characteristics of both the forest and savannah species. ",

A similar transition to forest savannah mosaic occurs all along the southern flank of the Congo Basin rainforest block. The Bat\u00e9k\u00e9 plateaus, comprising grasslands and lightly wooded savannahs overlaying deep Kalahari sands, extend northwards into the south- eastern part of the moist forest block (Figure 1). Due to their relative accessibility, the main threats to the for- est-savannah transition zones come from subsistence agriculture, hunting and competition for grazing and water-point access by large domestic herds of livestock. Artisanal gold panning is wide- spread in these areas and causes high levels of habitat distur- bance locally, especially in the biodiversity-rich gallery forests along watercourses. Category I-IV PAs in the northern forest savannah transition zone include Mbam and Djerem NP, Benou\u00e9 NP and Faro NP ( Cameroon), Garamba NP (DRC) and Zemongo Wildlife Reserve (WR) (CAR). However the vast complex of the Bili-Uere hunting domains (category VI, 33 000 km\u00b2) in northern DRC also covers this tran- sition zone. Three category I-IV PAs occur in the transition zone to the south of the moist forest block: the southern tip of the future Lomami NP (DRC), and in the Plateaux Bat\u00e9k\u00e9 NP (Gabon) and Lefini WR (Congo). 1.3 East Sudanian savannahs and Sahelian acacia savannahs In the Central African region, these habitat types are found in CAR, Cameroon and Chad. The climate is very hot and dry and during the dry season most of the trees lose their leaves and the grasslands dry up and burn extensively. There is low faunal ende- mism because the area is so vast and continuous but is quite important in terms of plant endemism. Roughly one-third of the 2 700 plant species in the east Sudanian savannahs are endemic. Animal species typical of the Sudanian savannahs are elephant, lion, cheetah, wild dog, roan antelope and giant eland. Further north, in the drier Sahelian acacia savannahs, many mammal species have been hunted to extinction or near extinction. Species typical of this region include the scimitar-horned oryx (extinct in the wild 15 ), dama gazelle, dorcas gazelle and red-fronted gazelle. Endangered predators, such as wild dog, cheetah and lion, were all also present and common but have now been extirpated over most of the ecoregion. The elimination of wildlife over such a large area was facilitated by modern hunting methods \u2013 rifles and four-wheel-drive vehicles \u2013 and exacerbated by civil distur- bance, poor law enforcement and competition for grazing and water-point access with large herds of domestic livestock. The original wooded savannah and acacia bushland habitats have been greatly altered over thousands of years, through long-term climatic changes and, more recently, through anthropogenic effects (herding, subsistence agriculture, fuel wood and fire). Climatic desiccation is a further threat, exacerbating the impacts of human activities, as the ability of the ecosystem to recover from overuse is reduced when there is little rainfall. In the past there were substantial populations of large mammalian herbi- vores, which would have grazed and browsed the vegetation. The remaining blocks of intact habitat are found mainly in the pro- tected areas. In other areas the habitat is often degraded, but is extensive and relatively continuous in sparsely populated areas.

( 16 ) The flood plains of the Gounda River in the Manovo-Gounda-St Floris World Heritage Site offer particularly rich grazing for pastoralists from Sudan and Chad who now occupy the zone year round. The cattle raised here are used to supply meat markets as far afield as Nigeria. ( 17 ) It is important to underline that over 25 years of conservation investment in this park by the European Commission from the late 1980s resulted in a spectacular recovery of all wildlife in this park, and with the exception of the elephants, wildlife populations remain very healthy in Zakouma. This illustrates the fact that elephant poaching is a special issue requiring a series of highly specialised and targeted actions. ( 18 ) http://www.ifaw.org/united-states/news/elephant-population-halved-cameroon-killing-spree-graphic-images ( 19 ) http://www.chinkoproject.com/ In the 1960s and 1970s, the area of northern CAR was sometimes referred to as the \u2018Serengeti of Central Africa\u2019 because of the vast numbers of large mammals that the habitat supported. However decades of poaching, and incursions by large herds of domestic livestock (in many cases owned by influential and wealthy individ- uals) from Sudan and Chad 16 , have reduced wildlife numbers to very low levels. Long-term conflict in southern Sudan, CAR and Chad has also prevented effective conservation in this area. Elephants have been particularly targeted in southern Sudan, northern CAR, northern Cameroon and southern Chad by Sudanese poachers and armed militia. For example, the slaughter of ele- phants in Chad\u2019s Zakouma NP between 2006 and 2008 resulted in a catastrophic population decline from 4 500 to 450 individu- als 17 . Similarly over a six-week period in 2012 in Bouba-Ndjida NP in northern Cameroon, at least half of the park\u2019s elephants were slaughtered by a highly organised band of Sudanese poachers 18 . Chad has several large category I-IV PAs totalling 120 000 km\u00b2, although the only one that is managed adequately is Zakouma NP. In CAR, the complex of wildlife reserves, hunting domains and national parks centred around the Manovo-Gounda-St Floris and Bamingui-Bangoran national parks cover 80 000 km\u00b2 but most are not effectively managed because of recurring conflict in the region (Manovo-Gounda-St Floris is a World Heritage Site in Danger). In fact, until the recent conflict overwhelmed the country, the best populations of wildlife remained in the savannah areas of CAR that were managed for sport hunting. The Chinko-Mbari watershed adjacent to the Zemongo wildlife reserve, covering over 80 000 km\u00b2 in the east of CAR, still contains a surprisingly complete representa- tion of the wildlife characteristic of this ecosystem, thanks to pro- tection provided by professional safari hunters 19 . 1.4 Southern miombo woodlands Spread throughout Central and Southern Africa, the southern miombo woodlands extend over a vast area. In the Central African region they extend across the south of the DRC from the Zambian border to Angola. These woodlands are floristically rich, domi- nated by slow-growing leguminous tree species with a canopy height of up to 15 m. Grasses cover the ground under the trees and they burn in the dry season. Miombo is thus a fire-adapted habitat. Soils are generally poor which means that miombo wood- land plants tend to be difficult to digest for mammals, thus favouring low densities of bulk-feeding mega-herbivores such as elephant and black rhino (now extinct in Central Africa). Miombo woodlands are also typically rich in termite species and mush- rooms, both of which provide important sources of food for local populations. Although vast in extent, the Central African miombo woodlands are in fact threatened by agriculture and fuelwood collection, particularly as they are so slow to regenerate. The high plateaus of the Katanga region of southern DRC, covered by miombo woodland and grasslands, give rise to several large rivers that feed into the Congo River. They therefore play a vital role in the provision of a regulated supply of clean water. The Katanga plateaus also provide spectacular landscapes with high tourist potential. The 380 m high Kaloba Falls on the Lofoi River in Kundelungu NP are the highest in Africa. Only two national parks, Kundelungu and Upemba (DRC), totalling 21 400 km\u00b2, protect the Central African miombo woodlands in Central Africa. ",

Estimates of the scale of the Central African bushmeat trade indicate that up to 4.5 million tons of bushmeat are extracted annually from the Central African forests with an estimated value of up to USD 205 million annually. A very wide variety of taxa are hunted (mammals, birds, reptiles). Mammals make up the bulk of the catches in terms of number and biomass, with ungulates and rodents representing two-thirds of the carcasses sold in urban markets. Large-bodied species are hunted where they are present (i.e. in recently exploited forest) but these soon disappear, after which catches are dominated by smaller species such as brush-tailed porcupines, pouched rat and blue duiker. Monkeys are hunted in large numbers in many areas but as shotguns are required to kill them, the cost of the cartridges often outweighs the financial return for the hunter. However cartridges and fire- arms are often supplied by corrupt officials; where this happens the financial returns make monkey hunting worthwhile. For ter- restrial species, the overwhelming method of hunting is with steel-wire snares, a commodity that is widely and cheaply avail- able in the form of brake cables for bicycles. This method is extremely wasteful since it is unselective in what it catches and also many carcasses decay before hunters return to check their traps. Typically hunters will lay up to several hundred traps on a hunting trip. Hunters do not distinguish between protected and non-protected species \u2013 they will take whatever they find in their traps. In heavily hunted areas, protected species, which are often larger-bodied ones, disappear first. Larger-bodied, longer-lived species with low intrinsic rates of population increase, such as elephants, apes, other large primates, carnivores and large antelopes, are less resistant to intensive hunting than species with high intrinsic rates of population increase, such as rodents and small to medium-sized ungulates. Primates and carnivores are extremely vulnerable. However some species, such as the blue duiker, are particularly resistant to hunting pressure and can maintain their population levels, even under quite high hunting- intensity levels. There is increasing evidence of overfishing in many of the inland waters of Central Africa. This is particularly evident in Lake Edouard (Virunga NP) 21 where \u2018open access\u2019 to the resource, and the involvement of powerful middlemen in the trade, is depriving local fishing communities of their livelihoods. Forest people in Central Africa often naturally alternate between bushmeat and fish as a function of seasons and availability, but as bushmeat supplies diminish there will be a tendency to increase consump- tion of fish, leading to overfishing. Evidence of this is already occurring in the town of Mambasa in DRC (in the moist forest region near the Okapi Wildlife Reserve) where increasing quanti- ties of fish from the Great Lakes region to the east, (including Lake Edouard) are being consumed. The loss of wildlife from forest ecosystems disrupts ecological processes and reduces biodiversity. Plant diversity and regener- ation is often dependent on the presence of specific animal spe- cies or groups of species for pollination and seed dispersal. The disappearance of \u2018keystone species\u2019 at the top of the food chain and/or important seed dispersers (elephants, apes, large carni- vores, crocodiles, raptors, etc.) is likely to have a disproportionate impact on the ecosystem. Central African hunting systems are biased towards heavy offtakes of seed-dispersing frugivorous mammals \u2013 over 70 % of animals in an average village hunting offtake have a seed dispersal role 22 . Although per capita bushmeat consumption in urban areas is lower than in rural areas, the vast majority of the bushmeat is consumed in urban areas because that is where the majority of the people in forested Central Africa lives (levels of urbanisation vary from 34 % in DRC to 86 % in Gabon 23 ). Furthermore, the contribution of urban areas to the overall bushmeat consumption is likely to continue increasing as the population of Central African countries continues to urbanise.

        "| 219 #3 Conservation issues and challenges Bushmeat is a much-needed source of protein in rural areas where there is generally very little availability of meat from domestic livestock. When wild fish is available it can outweigh the importance of bushmeat in the diet of forest dwellers, who will readily switch from one to the other according to availability. In urban areas, there is greater availability of alternative meat sources but where meat alternatives are more expensive than bushmeat (e.g. Kisangani, Bangui) the poorer households will tend to opt for bushmeat. How- ever in the larger cities of Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Cameroon where there is more wealth, bushmeat is more of a luxury product rather than a protein necessity. Although bushmeat is primarily used by rural populations for basic subsistence needs, most families will also hunt to supple- ment their incomes. Bushmeat is often seen as a buffer to see families through hard times (crop failure, unemployment) or to gain income for special needs (funerals, school fees, weddings) and this safety net is particularly important for the more vulner- able members of the community. However the commercial trade is undoubtedly the primary driver of the increasing levels of bush- meat offtake in Central Africa. A large amount of bushmeat trade occurs across borders in Central Africa but there is also a significant international trade outside of the region. 2.1.2 Massive, criminally organised, international trade in wildlife and ivory Like almost all the other African elephant range states, poaching for ivory has dramatically intensified over the past decade. Central African elephants are particularly sought after by poach- ers because the ivory from forest elephants is denser than that of savannah elephants and preferred by ivory carvers in Asia. The Central African forests are also prized hunting areas because it is difficult to detect and arrest poachers in the forest environ- ment, and poor governance and a lack of resources and political will result in very ineffective law enforcement. Most of the ivory poached is smuggled out of Central Africa and finally ends up in Asia where the price is so high that well-organ- ised criminal networks are now involved in the entire chain from the African forest to the illegal and \u2018legal\u2019 markets in China. Actors in the criminal networks are numerous and varied, and include corrupt law enforcement, customs and administrative officers in range states, armed militia and rebel groups, and diverse Afri- can (often West African) and Asian middlemen. Ivory is smuggled out of the Central African states in various directions: overland to Sudan (Khartoum), by air, land and sea to West African capitals acting as transit points (Togo, Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal) for the Far East, or overland to the East African ports of Mombasa and Dar es Salaam. \u2303 Severed and smoked hands of a western lowland gorilla. Primates of all species constitute part of the estimated 4.5 million tons of bushmeat consumed annually in the Central African moist forest region.

        "220 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Central Africa The increasing involvement of armed militia and rebel groups in the organised poaching of elephants is a particular concern because of its implications for national security. Several such cases have been documented in Central Africa. The Lord\u2019s Resist- ance Army (LRA) is involved in elephant poaching in Garamba NP (DRC) 24 to fund its brutal campaign, and Sudanese militia were responsible for the slaughter of elephants in Bouba-Ndjida NP in northern Cameroon in 2013. The involvement of rogue elements of the national armed forces is widespread. Their involvement ranges from doing the poaching themselves, to supplying weap- ons and ammunition to poachers, to providing protection for the transport of the ivory. High-tech resources are often deployed. For example, the Ugandan Army is suspected of having used its helicopters to poach elephants in Garamba NP 25 . Also kidnapped children who have escaped from the LRA attest to the fact that helicopters (of undetermined origin) regularly landed at their camps to collect ivory. Elephant populations have declined dramatically all over their range in Central Africa. A paper published in April 2013 26 analysed all available survey data for Central African forest elephants between 2002 and 2012 and concluded that there had been a 62 % decline. In the savannahs and woodlands to the north and south of the rainforest block, intense poaching over many years has reduced elephant populations to very low levels, and has extirpated them from large areas. Large-scale slaughters of ele- phants have been recorded in Zakouma NP, Bouba Ndjida NP and the north of the CAR. As elephant populations have declined around the edges of the rainforest block, poachers have moved deeper and deeper into the forested areas. Despite having 60 % of Central Africa\u2019s rainforests, the DRC now has only 19 % of its remaining forest elephants. The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) estimated DRC\u2019s forest elephant population at 19 000 indi- viduals in 2011. The last remaining stronghold for forest ele- phants is now the trans-border area between north-eastern Gabon, southwest Cameroon, northern Congo and south-western CAR (the TRIDOM and TNS landscapes), an area containing 12 national parks totalling some 250 000 km\u00b2. However even this area is now under intense pressure. For exam- ple, a survey conducted by the Gabon\u2019s National Park Agency (ANPN), WCS and WWF 27 showed that Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 NP in Gabon, regarded as the park with one of the highest elephant populations in Central Africa, lost between 16 000 and 20 000 elephants between 2004 and 2012, with much of this ivory going out through Cameroon. Gabon is the only remaining Central African country where ele- phants occur throughout the territory and is home to an estimated 40 000 to 64 000 elephants, about half the remaining forest ele- phants in Africa.

        "| 221 #3 Conservation issues and challenges In the transition zone and in the savannahs and woodlands to the north of the rainforest block, the remaining elephant populations are found in scattered pockets, mainly in and around the following protected areas: Zakouma NP (Chad), Bouba Ndjida and Waza NPs (Cameroon), Garamba NP (DRC) and Zemongo WR (CAR). In the transition zone, Garamba NP (DRC) has between 1 500 and 2 000 elephants 28 , Mbam et Djerem NP (Cameroon) still contains an esti- mated 1 000 elephants, while in the Bili-Gangu sector of the vast Bili-Uere complex in north-central DRC numbers have declined dramatically and are currently estimated at 650 individuals 29 . Many other wildlife species and products are traded in Central Africa. There is a large and poorly regulated international trade in grey parrots throughout Central Africa and the trade is clearly unsustainable 30 . Illegal trading of pangolin scales, mainly for the Asian market, is widespread. There is also a local, but large-scale trade in fruit pigeons in DRC. In both cases bais are the preferred location for catching these species as they visit them in large num- bers and can be caught quite easily using nets or lures smeared with natural glues. 2.1.3 Habitat loss Forest degradation, deforestation and forest fragmentation are important direct threats to wildlife and biodiversity in Central Africa. Deforestation leads to total loss of biodiversity, while habitat frag- mentation negatively affects gene flows and ecological processes, both of which ultimately result in biodiversity impoverishment. Annual net deforestation rates 31 across the Congo Basin are lower than in Amazonia and Southeast Asia but are accelerating. Net deforestation for the period 1990-2000 was 0.09 % and rose to 0.17 % for the period 2000-2005 32 . Net annual deforestation was highest in DRC with 0.11 % for 1990-2000 and 0.22 % 33 for 2000-2005. Congo had the next highest net deforestation rate (0.07 % for 2000-2005), while Gabon\u2019s net rate for this period was zero. An assessment of forest degradation between 2000 and 2010 in the DRC published in 2013 34 reports a loss of 1.02 % of primary forest cover due to clearing and predicts that degra- dation of intact forests could increase up to two-fold over the next decade. The key agents of habitat loss and impoverishment in Central Africa are shifting agriculture (slash and burn), fuelwood collec- tion and charcoal. Fragmentation is also caused by industrial logging and mining with their associated road and rail infrastruc- tures, agro-industrial plantations (with oil palm plantations becoming an increasingly important threat) and hydroelectric dams. Competition for grazing and access to water points by domestic livestock herds also causes habitat impoverishment in the moist forest-savannah transition zones and is often associ- ated with the killing of wildlife, particularly large carnivores. Shifting agriculture This type of agriculture has been part of the ecosystem for cen- turies but it becomes a problem when fallow periods are short- ened as the human population grows and more land is required for production. Shorter fallow periods lead to a decline in tree regeneration, soil fertility and agricultural yield. In Central Africa, shifting agriculture is most intense along main roads, near vil- lages and on the outskirts of urban centres. The problem is exac- erbated by the rapid expansion of the road network, particularly by industrial logging (see below). Fuelwood and charcoal Fuelwood and charcoal represent 90 % of all wood removal from the forests of Africa 35 . Fuelwood is the main energy source for over 80 % of people in Central Africa, and its consumption is ( 28 ) Bolan\u00f5s N.C. (2012). Aerial animal census 2012. Garamba National Park, DRC.

At the height of the crisis an estimated 900 tons for wood was being removed daily. expected to continue to grow in the coming decades 36 (indeed Africa is the only continent where fuelwood consumption will continue to rise). In the DRC, 94 % of total round wood production is for fuelwood, compared with 24 % for Gabon. Peri-urban forests play a key role in providing fuelwood and charcoal, so deforest- ation and biodiversity loss are highest in these areas. In Kinshasa, a city of over 7 million inhabitants, the halo of deforestation from charcoal extraction extends for up to 200 km from the city, but a significant proportion of its charcoal comes from even further afield \u2013 by river, over distances of up to 1 000 km. Industrial logging Most of Central Africa\u2019s rainforests are being, or will be, selec- tively logged. Logging is generally selective for high-value species with average extraction rates at between two and six trees per hectare. In addition to the direct forest loss caused by the extrac- tion of trees (secondary damage from felling and extraction), forest is lost for the construction of roads, sawmills and logging camps. Soil erosion, water pollution and reduction of the regen- eration capacity also occur. Logging also removes nutrients and escalates forest fragmentation. The extensive network of roads created by logging activities also allows people to move into the forest to settle, and opens up vast new areas for hunters. Industrial mining and oil extraction The African continent contains one-third of global mineral resources. The subsurface strata of the Congo Basin contain very important oil and mineral resources. Several of the world\u2019s largest iron-ore deposits are found in the Tri-national Dja Odzala Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 (TRIDOM) landscape (Cameroon-Gabon-Congo transfrontier zone) (Figure 2). Other minerals present in the landscape include cobalt, nickel, copper, manganese, platinum, silver, uranium, zinc, lead, gold and diamonds. Key iron-ore deposits that are being, or will soon be, exploited are Belinga (Gabon), Mbalam, Nkout (Cameroon), Nabeba, Letioukbala, Avima, Badondo (Congo). The Belinga and Mbalam deposits are estimated at 1 billion tons each. They are among the largest in the world, and the ore has an exceptionally high iron content. To exploit the Mbalam deposit, a 500 km rail- way line to Kribi on the Cameroon coast is planned. The capital cost of the Mbalam project over 25 years is currently estimated at USD 4.7 billion. To exploit Belinga, an extension to the trans- Gabonese railway is planned and the construction of a hydro- electric dam on the Ivindo River has also been considered. This would severely impact the Ivindo NP, a potential World Heritage Site, with its spectacular series of rapids and waterfalls at Koungou. Development and consumption pressures Linked to the growing human population are the associated increases in development and consumption, including develop- ment in the energy and transport sectors. These are leading to habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, and an increased accessibility to previously isolated sites, which increases the vul- nerability of biodiversity in these areas, as well as socio-economic problems for rural communities who are dependent on the affected natural resources. It is essential that such developments undertake a rigorous independent social and environmental impact assessment (SEIA) process, and identify adequate miti- gation and compensation measures in response. To achieve this it is critical that African countries have strong SEIA policies and the capacity for its monitoring and implementation. Onshore oil has been exploited for decades along the coastal area of Gabon and Congo and onshore oil exploration permits are begin- ning to appear all over the Congo Basin. As with mining permits, many of these oil \u2018blocks\u2019 overlap partially or wholly with protected areas. The most worrying example is Virunga NP, a World Heritage Site and the oldest park in Africa, where an oil exploration permit has been granted inside the park in contravention of the World Heritage Convention to which the DRC is a signatory.

Pollution is also a major concern. Mining also attracts massive numbers of people into the forest in search of economic opportunities. This leads to permanent settlements, agriculture and commercial hunting. The very rich gold deposits also attract thousands of artisanal miners and associated hunters and traders. In 2011, the Gabonese army evacuated a mining camp of over 6 000 people from Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 NP. Agro-industrial plantations Oil palm originates from Central Africa. Due to the huge profits that can be made, there is currently a strong push, mainly from Southeast Asian companies, to greatly expand oil palm plantations, particularly in Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, CAR and DRC. A Rainforest Foundation study 37 reveals that new industrial oil palm expansion projects currently underway in the Congo Basin cover 0.5 million ha, and that at least 1.6 million ha are planned, with companies seeking even larger areas. The terms of the agreements between palm oil companies and Congo Basin governments have mostly been conducted and concluded in complete secrecy. Furthermore, a recent study by the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) 38 suggests that cash crops are generally more profitable than logging if the timber from a forest concession is harvested sustainably, which means that if REDD+ 39 initiatives are to come to the rescue of forests in Central Africa, the global market values for carbon will have to increase significantly. Oil palm plantations have a devastating effect on biodiversity as they result in total forest loss. They also cause fragmentation of forests and, if badly planned, can block gene flows and disrupt ecological processes. 2.1.4 Emerging diseases Over the past two decades research has highlighted the importance of emerging diseases as a serious threat, not only to human pop- ulations but also to wildlife. Since the mid-1990s there have been several outbreaks of Ebola in Gabon 40 and Congo 41 in human pop- ulations and all were traced back to hunters handling ape carcasses found in the forest 42 . The Ebola outbreaks in and around Odzala NP in Congo between 2000 and 2004 resulted in the probable loss of 80 % of the gorilla population. It is now known that HIV originated in chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys and made the jump to humans; more than 40 different non-human primate species have been tested positive for simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) 43 . As humans are consuming the meat of many of those species, the risk of many new SIV strains jumping over to humans is believed to be significant. Observations made in Cameroon of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) symptoms but without HIV or SIV-positive test results are causing concerns over the ongoing creation of new HIV strains, which ultimately could make it even more difficult to find a cure against acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). \u2303 The skull of a western lowland gorilla killed by the Ebola virus in Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Congo.

Given the scale of the bushmeat trade, the presence of these pathogens constitutes a very serious human health hazard. Wild primate populations are also at risk from human diseases such as influenza and measles. This is particularly relevant in the case of ape-based tourism where humans come into close con- tact with habituated groups of gorillas and chimpanzees 44 . These apes are particularly vulnerable to certain human diseases and this is therefore a major concern in the case of endangered spe- cies such as the mountain gorilla where only a few hundred indi- viduals remain in two discrete populations (Bwindi forest and Virunga mountains). As deforestation continues, wildlife will be increasingly confined to patches of forest surrounded by human settlements. This enhances the chances of contact between virus-bearing animals and humans, thus increasing the chances of new diseases emerging. 2.2 Key drivers of threats 2.2.1 Human population growth, poverty and agricultural systems Human population growth, allied with continuing poverty and agricultural production systems practiced in the region, is the overriding driver of biodiversity loss. Some nations of the Congo Basin rank among the lowest in the world on most human welfare indicators, and among the highest in population growth and fertility. Average annual population growth in Central Africa is between 2 % and 3 %. The population of the DRC is predicted to increase from 67 million in 2013 to 155 million in 2050 (Sum- mary document \u2013 Synthesis, Section 1.4, Table 1). Poverty, particularly in the rural areas, means that local popula- tions remain heavily reliant on natural resources from the forest for their subsistence. However, a lack of economic opportunities in rural areas leads to communities engaging in commercial exploitation of forest resources for the burgeoning urban markets where roughly half of Central Africa\u2019s population lives. For most forest wildlife species, particularly the medium to large-bodied species, commercial exploitation almost always leads to overex- ploitation of the resource 45 . Inefficiencies in the agricultural production systems \u2013 both crop- ping and animal husbandry \u2013 in the region exacerbate this situ- ation. Inefficient agricultural production results in a loss of economic opportunity for rural populations, thus increasing the dependence on natural resources, including wildlife and forests, for income and livelihoods. Furthermore, poor agricultural pro- duction and livestock-keeping practices mean that people need ( 44 ) Macfie E.J. and E. A. Williamson (2010).

In the absence of any kind of effective family planning pro- grammes, population growth, particularly in agriculturally rich areas such as the Albertine Rift highlands, has led to overpopulation in the highlands and a tendency for people to migrate to the lower altitude forests to the west. Not only are these forests not able to support such high population densities (resulting in larger areas of forest being cleared for agriculture) but also migration leads to conflict for land with the local indigenous communities. Overlapping customary and modern land tenure systems make these conflicts particularly difficult to resolve and this has often led to violence (e.g. eastern DRC) as indigenous and migrant populations clash over land tenure and power structures. Commercial hunting of wildlife for the urban bushmeat markets is a classic example of \u2018open access\u2019 to resources leading to over- exploitation. Immigrant hunters moving in to an area recently made accessible by new roads are often resented by indigenous communities who see these \u2018outsiders\u2019 earning revenue from \u2018their\u2019 resources. However, levels of poverty in these forest com- munities are such that the indigenous populations will often col- laborate with the immigrant hunters in order to obtain a share of the economic profits. For example, the semi-nomad indigenous people (pygmies) will willingly work for commercial hunters (for very little financial return) and as they are such proficient hunters they can rapidly deplete an area of its wildlife. 2.2.2 Poor governance Corruption is a significant obstacle to building the strong institu- tions needed for the governance over and management of natural resources, including wildlife, forests and water. For the purposes of this section, the term \u2018poor governance\u2019 is used to cover not only corruption, but more broadly the problems of a lack of polit- ical will and the multitude of ways in which poorly designed and implemented government policies, laws and programmes (cov- ering all sectors: environment, education, justice, land tenure, health, infrastructures, mining, etc.) lead to irreversible negative impacts on biodiversity. The extractive industries (logging, mining and oil) are a major source of investment and revenue in Central Africa but the coun- tries have generally not succeeded in translating revenues to sustainable economic development. In some cases, large extrac- tive industry revenues even appear to have retarded economic and social development through a number of phenomena known as the \u2018resource curse\u2019 46 (theft of revenue from resources by the ruling elite, conflict over access to resources). Despite being one of the richest countries on the planet in terms of natural resources, the DRC is lowest ranked in the world in terms of per capita gross domestic profit (GDP) (USD 415) 47 . Equatorial Guinea is an exam- ple where huge oil and gas revenues have placed it 30th in the world\u2019s nations in terms of GDP (USD 29,742), but 144th in the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s (UNDP) ranking of Human Development Index trends 48 . The countries of Central Africa are ranked among the world\u2019s worst in terms of corruption 49 . It permeates all aspects of life, and undermines all development efforts. In Central Africa, poor governance is the overarching driver, compromising the sustain- ability of all conservation efforts. It impacts wildlife and biodi- versity in many ways: \u2022 Lack of political will to provide the necessary support for PAs. While the political discourse from Central African gov- ernments is firmly in favour of biodiversity conservation and PA management, in reality most of the governments invest less than the bare minimum in their PAs. Almost without exception the only PAs in Central Africa that are being man- aged more or less adequately are those that are receiving support from foreign donors and conservation NGOs. Local- level corruption hampers the efficient and effective opera- tions of park authorities, NGOs and communities undertaking measures to conserve and protect biodiversity. \u2022 Dysfunctional legal systems mean that lawbreakers are rarely prosecuted. Impunity from prosecution, particularly at the highest levels of government where corruption on a grand scale is openly tolerated, sets the standards for everyone else and breeds contempt for legal processes and a feeling that \u2018anything goes\u2019. In the case of wildlife crime, successful pros- ecutions are rare and penalties are anyway not dissuasive enough. There are also wide disparities between the wildlife laws of the different countries in terms of severity of penal- ties for wildlife crimes. \u2022 Poor land-use planning regularly results in competing and incompatible land-use attributions. Inter-ministerial commu- nication and collaboration is notoriously weak, resulting in development choices that often do not integrate biodiversity conservation needs. Local level corruption in the process results in land and resource allocations that are unjust and do not reflect the will of the community, but rather the power of the elite, thus undermining the process and incentivising people to work against the system of management of the resource base. As a result, over-exploitation can be seen as an honourable act of rebellion against the injustices of the system. ( 46 ) (2008). Governance of extractive industries in Africa.

        "| 227 #3 Conservation issues and challenges \u2022 Allocation of resource rights and environmental per- mission: Environmental impact assessments are generally of very poor quality and are often viewed as an administrative hurdle to enable companies to continue \u2018business as usual\u2019. Examples are road infrastructures, hydroelectric dams, agro- industrial plantations, mining permits, etc. in areas of high bio- diversity value, including inside PAs. The attribution of an oil exploration permit inside the Virunga NP World Heritage Site is one of the most high-profile examples. This example also high- lights another aspect to the problem which is that even when it is known that a mining or oil permit overlaps a PA, countries are often unwilling to forgo the potentially huge revenues that would be generated and are prepared to override, or change, existing laws in order to allow exploitation to go ahead. \u2022 Insecurity of land tenure leads to an unsustainable use of resources. In some countries, customary and state systems of land tenure overlap and this can create conflicts in land use. When forest-living people feel that they do not have a real stake in the \u2018ownership\u2019 of their forest resources there is little incentive to exploit them sustainably. This often results in a situation of \u2018open access\u2019 to resources, resulting in over- exploitation for commercial purpose. \u2022 Dysfunctional education systems mean that a large pro- portion of children, particularly in rural areas, do not attend school. The quality of higher education structures is highly variable across the region. The environment is generally very poorly covered in school curricula and concepts of conserva- tion and the sustainable use of natural resources are poorly understood by the young generation. \u2022 Dysfunctional national armies where discipline is poor and soldiers are often badly paid (or in the case of DRC, often not paid at all). Members of the armed forces at all levels are frequently involved in poaching and other illegal activities such as mining. In eastern DRC, members of the armed forces even collaborate with rebel groups to exploit and commercialise the same resource (e.g. gold, diamonds, coltan, charcoal). The pres- ence of a band of highly armed and well-organised Sudanese poachers, apparently operating with complete impunity in CAR and northern Cameroon, went unchallenged by the national defence forces until international public opinion forced them to act (by which time it was too late). 2.2.3 National and regional conflict Central Africa has been blighted by conflict (internal and external) over the past three decades. This has had a devastating impact on livelihoods, socio-economic development and natural resource protection. Many of these conflicts can in fact be described as natural resource conflicts (eastern DRC, northern CAR, Chad, Congo). The DRC is a particularly striking example where its immense riches have brought little more than conflict. At the time of the wars of liberation between 1997 and 2004, the armies of at least seven neighbouring countries were present on Congolese territory, the major motivation for most, if not all, of them being to exploit the country\u2019s natural resources. A legacy of armed conflict is that countries end up being flooded with automatic weapons and these often end up in the hands of hunters or their patrons. The two Congos, CAR and Chad have been particularly affected by this problem, but the porosity of international borders in this region means that other countries are also affected. The recent evolution of the elephant poaching crisis highlights how the void created by the breakdown in law and order (either in the situation of bad governance or in periods of conflict) has allowed armed militias and terrorist groups to move in and operate with virtual impunity. \u2303 Park equipment and stores destroyed during an attack by the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) on the headquarters of Garamba National Park, DRC, in January 2009.

Together these two struc- tures provide the strategic framework for regional cooperation and donor collaboration in Central Africa. The CBFP (Appendix 1) coordinates programmes and policies of the different partner organisations in order to improve the coherence and effectiveness of their programmes for the sustainable development of the Congo Basin\u2019s forest ecosystems within the framework of the COMIFAC strategic plan (Plan de Convergence) which was revised in 2014. Technical support to COMIFAC is provided by a number of partner organisations, including RAPAC (Central African Protected Area Network) and OFAC (Central African Forest Observatory). Conservation of biological diversity (including PA management) is a key component of COMIFAC\u2019s nine-point strategic plan (Box 1). The landscape approach is an integral part of the CBFP\u2019s support to COMIFAC. This approach aims to enhance the ecological integ- rity of PAs and their surroundings by addressing conservation management issues in the multiple-use zones that link them. Key regional law enforcement and biodiversity conservation- planning initiatives and agreements that have been developed recently include: \u2022 Regional action plan for strengthening national wildlife law implementation for the period 2012-2017 (PAPECALF) devel- oped by COMIFAC 50 . The plan aims to (i) strengthen cooper- ation and collaboration between supervisory bodies and the legal authorities concerned by wildlife law enforcement at national and regional levels, (ii) intensify investigations and law enforcement operations at key transit points, borders, trans-border zones and local markets, (iii) establish effective deterrents to poaching and the illegal commercial wildlife trade, and ensure that cases are properly prosecuted and the results widely publicised, and (iv) strengthen awareness about the illegal wildlife trade; \u2022 Extreme urgency anti-poaching action plan (PEXULAB) 51 , a short- term component of PAPECALF; \u2022 Regional action plan for the conservation of gorillas and chim- panzees in Central Africa 52 ; \u2022 Eastern DRC great apes conservation action plan 2012-2022 53 ; \u2022 Bonobo Conservation Strategy 2012-2020 54 ; \u2022 Central African Elephant Conservation Strategy (2005); \u2022 Tri-national Agreement \u2013 a ground breaking agreement signed in 2000 between the governments of Congo, CAR and Cameroon for the joint protection and management of the Tri-national Sangha complex of protected areas.

The Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS, CEEAC in French) has become increasingly involved in addressing the issue of wildlife crime because of the damage it does to economies and security in the region.

        "| 231 #3 Ongoing conservation efforts 3.2 Key funding agencies and conservation partners Biodiversity conservation in Central Africa is delivered predomi- nantly through international donor agencies, conservation NGOs and other technical partners working in partnership with the national forestry, wildlife and PA authorities. NGOs work with funds provided by donor agencies but also mobilise many sources of private funding. There are very many organisations working in Central Africa and it is not possible to provide a detailed descrip- tion here of their different interventions. Over the past two decades, the EU and the USA have been, and continue to be, the most important donors in terms of funds mobi- lised for the region. Individual European nations are also making significant contributions, particularly Germany and France. Germany\u2019s focus is mainly on protected areas while France\u2019s has been mainly on the forest sector; Spain supports conservation initiatives in DRC, Congo, Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea; and Norway has recently started contributing, through its International Climate and Forest Initiative. International institutions such as the World Bank (through the Global Environment Fund \u2013 GEF), African Development Bank, Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organisation (UNESCO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) also support conservation efforts in the region. The paragraphs below summarise the interventions of the largest donors in Central Africa.

        "232 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Central Africa European Union To date, the EU has committed more than EUR 500 million for biodiversity conservation in Africa over the past 28 years. Support to PAs by the EU is either through grants to international or local NGOs who are then responsible for the implementation of activ- ities, or through bilateral cooperation (beneficiary state/EU). Through the regional ECOFAC (Forest Ecosystems in Central Africa) project, launched in 1992 (and still operational) the EU pioneered a regional approach to conservation in Central Africa, which promoted regional collaboration for PA management through coordinated support to specific PAs in each country. The Central African Protected Areas Network (RAPAC) emerged from ECOFAC and is one of the structures through which the EU mobi- lises its funds for conservation. Other PAs are also supported within the framework of public-private partnerships: Zakouma NP, Odzala NP, Nouabal\u00e9-Ndoki NP (planned), Virunga NP, Gar- amba NP and Akagera NP (see Section 4). Over EUR 203 million are currently proposed for conservation activities focusing on PAs in Central Africa. The EU also funds cross-cutting projects which include Central African components such as MIKES (Minimising the Illegal Killing of Elephants and other Endangered Species), BIOPAMA (Biodiver- sity and Protected Areas Management in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries) and OFAC (Central African Forest Observatory). It also disburses its funds through other international agencies, e.g. UNESCO\u2019s Central African World Heritage Forest Initiative (CAWHFI), targeting existing or potential Central African World Heritage Sites. Through the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) process, the EU also contributes indirectly to biodiversity conservation by ensuring that timber imported into Europe has been exploited in conformity with national forestry laws. The EU supports training and capacity building through its support to the Regional Post-graduate Training School of Integrated Man- agement of Tropical Forests and Lands (French acronym ERAIFT) and the University of Kisangani (DRC). United States of America The US government delivers its conservation aid to Central Africa through Agence de coop\u00e9ration des \u00c9tats-Unis (USAID) and United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). USAID USAID\u2019s CARPE programme (Central African Regional Programme for the Environment) was launched in 1997 and, like ECOFAC, promotes a regional approach to conservation. An accent is placed on the landscape approach with significant resources mobilised in the buffer zones of protected areas in 12 landscapes across Central Africa for land-use planning, community-based natural resource management activities and capacity building of local structures. CARPE partners with international conservation NGOs experienced in the region for the implementation of its activities. Over the past two decades it has mobilised between USD 10 mil- lion and USD 15 million p.a. CARPE III will be rolled out from 2013 to 2018 through two pro- grammes: Central African Forest Ecosystem Conservation (CAFEC) and Strengthening Central African Environmental Management and Policy Support (SCAEMPS). A total of USD 92.3 million is expected to be mobilised for CAFEC \u2013 USD 21.6 million of which will come from Norway\u2019s International Climate and Forest Initia- tive (NICFI) over five years. Actions will be concentrated on eight landscapes located in the two Congos.

In addition, grants (from USD 50 000 to USD 250 000) will be available for a variety of other initiatives aimed at reducing the bushmeat trade, strengthening judicial processes for wildlife crime, identifying and managing new PAs, and training wildlife managers 57 . It is anticipated that around USD 5-6 million will be made avail- able annually (subject to Congress approval each year). Germany Germany has been a long-term supporter of conservation in Central Africa, most notably its uninterrupted support to DRC\u2019s Kahuzi- Biega NP (World Heritage Site) since 1983, and is currently one of the largest donors for conservation in Central Africa. German support for conservation is delivered through the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and implemented by Deutsche gesellschaft f\u00fcr technische Zusam- menarbeit (GIZ) (technical cooperation) and Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) (financial cooperation). Over EUR 125 million is currently committed or in the pipeline for KfW-implemented initiatives. German support targets various aspects of the conservation chal- lenges in the region. Forest policy and governance are addressed through support for several processes, including COMIFAC, FLEGT, certified forest exploitation and REDD+ preparation, and DRC institution building. Recognising the shortcomings of national conservation institutions and the need for long-term support for PAs and sustainable sources of funding to avoid the negative impacts of stop-start funding cycles, Germany makes significant investments in PA management (particularly in sites where expe- rienced NGO partners are present) and sustainable funding mech- anisms. At least 15 important PAs are receiving, or are about to receive, direct support for management 58 and Germany was one of the first European countries to capitalise trust funds in Central Africa.

Over the past 20 years, the AFD has made a particularly strong contribution to achieving sustainable management practices in logging concessions. It has helped place 20 million ha of forest in the Congo Basin under management, 5 million of which are certified under international standards. AFD\u2019s biodiversity con- servation strategy aims at protecting, restoring, managing and developing ecosystems and fairly sharing the benefits of their development, mainstreaming ecosystem conservation in indus- trial development policies and strengthening partnerships between French biodiversity players and other players where AFD operates. Achieving sustainable financing for biodiversity protec- tion through foundations (AFD contributes to the TNS Foundation), payments for ecosystem services and biodiversity offsets is also a key element of their strategy. AFD also finances conservation activities through debt conversion mechanisms. A EUR 50 million debt conversion for Gabon is being used to fund conservation and sustainable management of Gabon\u2019s forest ecosystems, including implementation of ANPN\u2019s anti-poaching activities. AFD\u2019s current commitments for biodiversity are around EUR 160 million p.a. with about 75 % going to Sub-Saharan Africa. The FFEM mobilises about EUR 200 million annually, of which roughly EUR 5 million goes for biodiversity conservation in Africa. In Central Africa, FFEM supports efforts to improve best practices in logging and to integrate sustainable forest management (sup- ported by France for many years) into REDD strategies for Central African countries. Other areas of support include PA management, conservation and sustainable management of wildlife in buffer zones, sustainable village hunting and communal forests. FFEM has also played a role in facilitating the creation of trust funds, including the TNS Fund. World Bank/GEF The World Bank supports biodiversity conservation in the DRC through its National Parks Rehabilitation Project (PREPAN) and its Forest and Nature Conservation Project for which around USD 75 mil- lion are committed. The objectives of these interventions include support to high priority PAs (Virunga NP, Maiko NP), creation and capitalisation of the Okapi Trust Fund for the DRC PA network and institution building of the national PA authority (ICCN) and its Ministry (MECNT). In southern Cameroon, the World Bank/Global Environment Fund (GEF) will support an initiative for the conser- vation and sustainable use of the Ngoila-Mintom forest block located in the strategically important zone between the Dja World Heritage site and Boumba-Bek National Park. United Nations UNDP/GEF funding supports the TRIDOM project, a strategically important trans-border biodiversity conservation initiative in the Mink\u00e9b\u00e9-Dja-Odzala interzone of Gabon, Cameroon and Congo, which contains nine protected areas and logging and mining con- cessions (the zone includes the Ngoila-Mintom forest block men- tioned above). The initiative aims to officially establish governance structures for conservation and sustainable natural resource use in this tri-national trans-border complex. Activities focus on land- use planning, monitoring of biodiversity and natural resource use, law enforcement and biodiversity conservation systems in logging concessions and community-based natural resource management. UNEP \u2013 UNEP coordinates the Great Apes Survival Partnership (GRASP), a partnership of great ape range states targeting the objectives of the Global Strategy for the Survival of Great Apes. The UNESCO World Heritage Centre mobilises funds from various sources (EU, France, Italy, Belgium) in support of eight of the nine existing World Heritage Sites, as well as for the identification of new potential World Heritage Sites through its two programmes: support to DRC\u2019s WHS in Danger and the Central African World Heritage Initiative (CAWHFI). The CAWHFI initiative places a par- ticular focus on transfrontier protected area complexes and engagement with the private sector for biodiversity conservation in interzones connecting the protected areas. UNESCO also launched the ERAIFT regional postgraduate training school in Kinshasa in 1999 and continues to coordinate it. The FAO/GEF has recently launched a USD 10 million regional initiative for the sustainable management of the wildlife and bush- meat sector in the DRC, Gabon, Congo and CAR. Through a series of pilot projects, the initiative aims to overcome the barriers to effective participatory wildlife management. This will involve policy reforms to give communities legal rights to the use of wildlife on their lands, develop tools for the development of community level rules for wildlife management, and strengthen capacities of key stakeholders (community managers, supporting institutions and oversight bodies) for participatory wildlife management. Non-governmental organisations and foundations International NGOs (INGOs) and NGOs play a central role in Central African conservation initiatives. For many of the funding agencies they are the preferred structures for delivering their support as they are experienced operators on the ground, often with long-term commitments in the areas where they work, have specialist skills and generally leverage several other sources of private funding (foundations, private donors, etc.) in addition to their own \u2018core\u2019 funding.

World Heritage in the Congo Basin, 63pp. 4.1 The best remaining assemblages of biodiversity are in protected areas Almost without exception in Central Africa, the areas with the most intact assemblages of biodiversity are in protected areas (or areas under active management like sport-hunting zones). Furthermore, the PAs where biodiversity is being most effectively protected are those that are receiving support from donor agen- cies and their technical partners because most national PA agen- cies are so weak and under-resourced. 4.2 Long-term funding is essential for successful biodiversity conservation Biodiversity conservation requires sustained long-term support. Stop-start funding cycles must be avoided because wildlife pop- ulations can be lost very quickly but take a long time to recover. The EU\u2019s sustained support to Zakouma NP is a particularly good example of what uninterrupted long-term funding can do to bring an area back from the brink. In the late 1980s, when the EU first intervened, very little wildlife could be seen. By the mid 1990s, Zakouma NP was teeming with wildlife and was attracting sig- nificant numbers of tourists, both local and international. Without Germany\u2019s 30-year support to Kahuzi-Biega NP (DRC) it is doubt- ful that that the park would have survived the prolonged period of war and anarchy. The same applies to the long-term interna- tional support for Virunga and Garamba NPs. Long-term conser- vation investment in PAs helps create conservation \u2018hubs\u2019 that have a better chance of surviving periods of civil war because institutions and governance are stronger. More streamlined and coordinated financial mechanisms to support high-priority PAs (where several funding agencies/organisations) are present also lowers the administrative burden associated with managing multiple donors and/or relatively short-term contracts and improves the chances of positive conservation outcomes. 4.3 A landscape approach, including TFCAs, enhances biodiversity conservation While species diversity is high in the moist forests of Central Africa, densities of species are relatively low and so for this rea- son most of the PAs, except for the very largest and best pro- tected, are probably not large enough to ensure the long-term conservation of the full range of species and biological processes. This has led to a shift in conservation strategies in recent years with an increasing emphasis on a landscape approach to conser- vation, the idea being to enhance the ecological integrity of PAs and their surroundings by addressing conservation management issues in the multiple-use zones that link them. The strategy is to manage the impact of human activities in such a way that gene flows and ecosystem processes are maintained across the landscape, so that PAs are prevented from becoming isolated islands of biodiversity. Since most ecological landscapes lie astride international boundaries, a regional, transfrontier approach goes hand in glove with the landscape approach 60 . In Central Africa there are several examples where contiguous complexes of PAs straddle international boundaries as transfrontier PAs. In addition to ensuring protection over a larger area (important for wide-ranging species like elephant), the conservation costs are shared between the countries, and they provide refuges (reservoirs) for wildlife in the event of a breakdown of law and order in one of the countries. A good example is the complex of PAs in the Virunga landscape shared between DRC, Uganda and Rwanda. At the begin- ning of the 1990s, the hippo population of DRC\u2019s Virunga NP was over 25 000. Ten years later it was down to 500 individuals through poaching. However there is little danger of local extinction of this species because stability in Uganda ensures that the contiguous Queen Elizabeth NP serves as a reservoir for repopulation. The principle is the same for gorillas and elephants. Inter-state collab- oration for the management of transfrontier protected areas also strengthens regional integration and security. Collaboration for the management of this transfrontier complex is achieved through the Greater Virunga Transboundary Collaboration agreement (Chap- ter 2, Section 3.4.2, Box 16). >4 _ Lessons learned and promising approaches ",

The long term support for Virunga from the EU since the second half of the 80s has been critical to the survival of this exceptionally important ecosystem. Spanning an altitudinal range of over 4 000 m, and covering an area representing only 0.3 % of the surface area of the DRC, Virunga NP is home to over half of DRC\u2019s mammal species, and two thirds of its bird species. 4.4 Partnerships with the private sector offer promising models for enhancing biodiversity conservation in central africa Two types of partnership with the private sector have been tested in Central Africa: partnerships for the management of PAs and partnerships with extractive industries in buffer zones of PAs. Both have produced promising results. Public-private partnerships for PA management One of the major constraints to effective PA management through classic donor-funded technical assistance projects for PAs is that the technical partners responsible for project implementation do not have a strong enough mandate to take the required actions and make the difficult decisions (such as replacing corrupt or incompetent staff). PPP agreements give the implementing partner a stronger and clearer mandate with greater decisional independence (including powers to hire and fire) and greater administrative and financial flexibility. In effect, the private part- ner brings a more business-like approach to park management. The involvement of the private sector partner also acts as an important lever for raising other sources of funding 61 . PPP agree- ments are particularly pertinent in countries where national capacities for PA management are very weak, although there was initial resistance to this kind of approach 62 . PPP agreements in DRC (Virunga NP, Garamba NP), Congo (Odzala-Koukoua NP), Chad (Zakouma NP) and Rwanda (Akagera NP) are delivering positive conservation results, often in extremely difficult contexts, and others are planned in the region (Salonga NP, Nouabal\u00e9-Ndoki NP, Okapi WR). Box 2 below describes the African Parks PPP model for PA management.

African Parks \u2013 A new model for protected area management African Parks (AP) is a non-profit organisation that takes on direct responsibility for the rehabilitation and long-term management of national parks in partnership with governments and local communities. By adopting a business approach to conservation, supported by donor funding, African Parks aims to make each park sustainable in the long-term, thereby contributing to the economic development of the region. Fundamental elements necessary for the success of their model are full accountability for their work, for which they require a secure long-term management mandate, and sound governance structures to ensure full transparency and avoid unwarranted interference. African Parks currently manages eight parks in six countries \u2013 Chad, Republic of Congo, DRC, Malawi, Rwanda and Zambia \u2013 with a combined area of 5.9 million hectares. The main governing body , African Parks Network (APN), based in Johannesburg, South Africa, is the strategic and decision- making entity which is responsible for the business plan for each park, determining capital investments, operating budgets, standard operating procedures and appointing skilled park management. Each park managed by AP is established as a separate legal entity , registered in the host country with its own board of directors. The board is represented by partner institutions, key stakeholders and AP representatives, and is directly accountable to government for the professional management of the park. AP aims to have majority representation at the park board level or to appoint the board chairman. Four critical partnerships are necessary for an AP project. Government must support the AP approach and must be prepared to delegate management responsibilities to AP. Community considerations are built in to each project, often through a formal relationship with community structures represented on the park management board. Donors are required to support capital investment and annual operating costs until financial sustainability is achieved. Commercial investors are sought to develop tourism and other commercial enterprises in order to create a sustainable income base for a park. A secure long-term mandate is a key to success, with a clear separation of functions between the State, which retains responsibility for legislation, policy and regulatory control, and AP which is responsible for implementation. Having clear day-to-day management control of the park is crucial, as is ensuring that commercial income flows are used to contribute to the park\u2019s financial sustainability. In the short-term, donor funding is key, whilst long-term income streams are a combination of donor funding, commercial revenues from tourism and related enterprises, endowment income and payment for ecosystem services. The long-term aim of AP is to create a conservation-led economy in each region where it operates with the park at its core (diagram below). The multiplier effects in the region in terms of socio-economic development, improved distribution of resources, better governance, and much more are what will build conservation constituencies and hopefully dispel the political indifference that undermines efforts to promote biodiversity conservation and effective protected area management.

Private sector partnerships in buffer zones of protected areas Logging concessions cover, or will soon cover, essentially all of the exploitable Congo Basin forests. While this may seem at first view a disaster scenario, in reality a well-managed logging con- cession in the periphery of an actively managed PA offers better possibilities for conserving the forest and its wildlife than a forest with no form of management regime and no control over how the forest is used. The importance of ensuring \u2018boots on the ground\u2019 within the PA while implementing collaborative agree- ments with adjacent logging concessions should be emphasised. For much of the eight-year period when Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 NP lost between 12 000 and 16 000 elephants (Section 2.1.2), there were active collaborative agreements with adjacent logging concessions, but surveillance within the park was almost non-existent. Central African forest laws are generally sound and if imple- mented correctly can have considerable positive impacts for con- servation. Concessionaires control access to their concessions and are legally bound to integrate wildlife protection and other conservation measures in their forest management plans. Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified companies are generally keen to collaborate with specialist conservation organisations (Box 3). In logging concessions in Gabon, the way forward is seen as being to undertake Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs and then to integrate the mitigation measures into the concessionaire\u2019s legally binding Environmental and Social Management Plan. Partnerships with industrial mining companies are relatively new in Central Africa, but given the potentially massive impacts on biodiversity that they will have on the vast pristine TRIDOM trans- frontier forest landscape, conservation practitioners are increas- ingly engaging with them. With the financial resources at their disposal, the political leverage that this gives them, and their need to safeguard their international image, there are clear opportunities to influence what happens to wildlife in their con- cessions and leverage biodiversity-offset arrangements. Since almost all forest outside of PAs is (or will soon) be attributed to private operators, conservationists have to engage with them if we are to preserve connectivity between PAs and ecological functions across large tracts of forest. Finally, as noted throughout this document, conservation NGOs play a very important role in the implementation of conservation activities in Central Africa. However it is important that their roles and man- dates should be very clearly defined from the outset so that donors do not end up funding NGOs to implement activities for which they do not have the mandate from the host government.

Using a five-pronged approach PROGEPP combined law enforcement, the development of alternative activities, education and awareness-raising, and research and monitoring. Given that the motivations of each partner for entering into this kind of partnership may be very different (logging companies want to improve their image and access to markets and financial resources, NGOs are motivated by gains in conservation, governments pursue socio-economic development), effective collaboration requires formal protocols that clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each partner. Partnerships based on a shared vision are more enduring than those of convenience, and all partners must be actively involved in the implementation of conservation actions on the ground. Trust, respect and transparency between partners help to overcome the inevitable challenges to the partnership. Finally the combined expertise and resources of the three partners allows conservation to be conducted at much larger scales than is possible when working only in protected areas. Conservation actions in logging concessions are most successful when communities are integrated early into the land use planning process and when the access rights of indigenous people to land and resources are recognised and guaranteed. Successful conservation actions that were developed by PROGEPP include: \u2022 application of strict internal company regulations concerning hunting and the transport of bushmeat; \u2022 mobilisation of a law-enforcement guard force funded by the logging company but supervised by WCS and the government; \u2022 management of hunting zones for local communities and logging company personnel; \u2022 importation of domestic meat by the logging company for sale in the logging camps.

        "| 243 #3 Lessons learned and promising approaches 4.5 Political will at the highest level is essential for effective biodiversity conservation In most of the Central African countries there is a serious discon- nect between the political discourse regarding natural resource conservation, and the resources that governments mobilise to conserve them. In most countries, PAs remain one of the lowest priorities in terms of national budgets. Most PA authorities are seriously underfunded and personnel are expected to work for salaries (if and when they are paid) that are well below what could be considered a decent living wage. Furthermore, little con- sideration is given to the fact that the work is arduous and can be particularly dangerous (Virunga NP has lost over 140 park guards in the past 20 years). National budgets often make no provision for capital investment, and corruption ensures that even the meagre budgets allocated are misappropriated. Finally, there are no proper career advancement structures for biodiversity conservation personnel, very little provision is made for training and retraining, and the high, and often arbitrary, turnover of key staff disrupts conservation initiatives. Too often biodiversity is considered to the \u2018affair of westerners\u2019 and the donor community is expected to pay for it. As a result, in several important PAs that have received overseas support since the early 1990s, conserva- tion partners are still paying top-up salaries and/or bonuses to staff and covering almost all capital investment costs. 4.6 Creating conservation constituencies in forest environments has proved challenging Creating a constituency for conservation in local communities around PAs is a key element of PA management but has proved to be one of the most challenging aspects for conservation projects in Central Africa. Various approaches are used: outreach pro- grammes for agriculture, health centres, clean water sources, small hydroelectric turbines 63 , community-run tourism enterprises, envi- ronmental education, etc., all with varying levels of success. In forested regions, so called \u2018community conservation\u2019 initiatives have had limited success for various reasons. Local populations living in these areas often do not have secure land tenure, and therefore control over the use of the forest resources. Local tra- ditional land tenure is superimposed with State land tenure, but the State is generally incapable of effectively controlling how forest resources are used and by whom. This frequently leads to a situation of \u2018open access\u2019 to resources, resulting in overexploita- tion, especially when people with economic power (e.g. salaried workers in extractive industries), or better organisational capac- ities 64 , migrate to an area.

The importance of high-level political support for conservation Gabon is setting the example of how strong political support in favour of biodiversity makes a significant difference to conserva- tion outcomes. At the beginning of the 2000s, Gabon did not have a single national park. In 2002, a network of 13 national parks, designed by a team of experienced conservation scientists and encompassing almost all of the important biomes in the country, was declared by the President and enacted in law in 2007. Where there was conflict between proposed national park boundaries and logging permits, tough decisions were made and solutions found. In order to create Lop\u00e9 National Park, a logging permit located inside the proposed national park boundary was cancelled and an equivalent area elsewhere was attributed to the concessionaire. A protected area agency, Agence nationale des parcs nationaux, (ANPN) was established, and its government budget has increased significantly and steadily since it was created. As the Agency develops the absorptive capacities to use these funds effectively, the inevitable teething problems are being addressed and progress is being made. ANPN receives strong political support from the highest level for implementation of the government\u2019s flagship policies of \u2018Green Gabon\u2019 and \u2018Blue Gabon\u2019, which target the sustainable development of the terrestrial and marine environments. In just one year the EU fishing agreements were completely renegotiated, bogus fishing permits cancelled (involving the politically risky decision of closing down the fisheries industry for a month), no-fishing zones established and enforced, and a large extension to the network of marine protected areas proposed, encompassing 23 % of Gabon\u2019s territorial waters. Illegally operating trawlers are being systematically seized and heavy fines imposed. Gabonese vessels are now equipped with tracking devices and followed by ANPN and the Fisheries Ministry, and fish catches are monitored and reliable statistics are starting to be compiled for the first time ever. At the regional level, the president, together with the president of Chad, are showing strong leadership in the fight to stem the ivory poaching crisis. For example, a deal was brokered at presidential level to halt the killing of elephants in the famous Bayanga elephant bai in CAR by rebel forces loyal to the April 2013 putchists, and in 2012 Gabon publicly burned its entire five-ton stock of seized ivory (picture above). \u2303 In June 2012 six tons of confiscated ivory were burnt in Libreville, Gabon. ",
        "| 245 #3 Lessons learned and promising approaches Forest communities are also generally very poor, often poorly educated and are characterised by an individualistic approach to the use of forest resources. Indeed the concept of \u2018community\u2019 in forest-living peoples is misleading since the only really strong social unit is the family, and villages are simply stronger or weaker associations of families. Mobilising forest people to work together to adopt sustainable methods of natural resource use for the benefit of all is therefore complex, time-consuming and costly, and requires expertise from many different fields (biology, social science, agriculture, communications, etc.). Furthermore, community conservation models from Southern Africa have little relevance in the moist forest milieu. Much effort has been spent by conservation projects trying to develop \u2018alternative activities\u2019 to unsustainable resource use but there have been many more failures than successes. For example, attempts to introduce ani- mal husbandry or fish farming, as alternatives to bushmeat, have rarely had lasting success because (a) there is no cultural tradition for these activities, and (b) hunting will remain the preferred source of meat protein as long as there remain populations, even very depleted ones, of wild animals in the forest. Essentially peo- ple will wait until there are no longer any animals before consid- ering other meat sources, by which time it is almost too late. 4.7 Conservation projects should not be expected to resolve all the socio-economic problems of local communities Following on from the above point, the \u2018conservation-linked-to- development\u2019 paradigm that dominates modern biodiversity con- servation thinking has resulted too often in conservation projects having to address all the socio-economic problems of populations living around PAs, despite rarely having either the financial resources or the expertise to do this. Furthermore, it still remains to be clearly demonstrated that improving livelihoods of local communities inevitably leads to less pressure on natural resources. On the contrary, as livelihoods improve, local commu- nities will often exert even greater pressures on biodiversity 65 (but see following point). While improving livelihoods and allevi- ating poverty will always be priority components of development aid, it is essential that conservation projects should be designed in such a way that they are accompanied by properly funded and resourced socio-economic development initiatives, with objectives compatible with wildlife conservation. ( 65 ) As forest people move into a monetary economy, their increased purchasing power enables them to acquire cartridges and wire for snares. There are many examples where salaried activities in the forest environment (logging concessions, infrastructure projects, even conservation projects) have led to increased hunting pressure. \u2303 The chief of Obenge village, Oriental Province, DRC, expresses her point of view during a public meeting. An eight year consultation process with local communities lead to the creation of the Lomami National Park, DRC, and agreements on sustainable livelihood activities in the buffer zone. ",

Consumptive and non-consumptive tourism (sport hunting and eco-tourism) have so far provided the best examples as they generate tangible spin-offs for local communities (employment, revenue sharing, a stake in the management of the resource). Mountain gorilla tourism generates millions of dollars annually and as a result is well supported, both at the community and national levels. Indeed mountain gorillas are a central element of Rwanda\u2019s international marketing image. Despite being located in an area of prolonged conflict, the warring parties have always understood the economic importance of gorillas and have ensured their protection 66 . While not generating such spectacular revenues, lowland gorilla tourism in CAR and Congo has also proved success- ful, particularly when it can be combined with wildlife viewing in forest clearings ( bais ), which provide unique opportunities for observing the large mammal fauna of the Central African forests. Constraints to lowland forest eco-tourism are the difficulties of access to these remote areas, the absence of an enabling environ- ment for eco-tourism (serious local operators, adequate infrastruc- tures, visa difficulties) and the challenging conditions of the lowland forest environment for tourists. Safari sport hunting has been successful in preserving wildlife when safari operators collaborate with local communities to man- age the resource and share the benefits. Surprisingly (given the history of conflict in the region) the best examples come from the savannah-woodland area of CAR. The European Commission- funded Zones cyn\u00e9g\u00e9tiques villageoises (village safari hunting zones) in northern CAR was very successful 67 until the zone was overwhelmed by pastoralists and armed militia from Sudan and Chad. The key factors to its success were the presence of healthy populations of flagship trophy species for hunters (notably giant eland and bongo), the active participation of local communities in the protection and exploitation of the zone through collabora- tion agreements with the safari hunting operators, sharing of revenues and other spin-offs (e.g. meat) and a low human pop- ulation density, enabling the benefits to be felt by everyone. In 2010, an aerial survey of the PAs and surrounding hunting zones showed that all the remaining wildlife was concentrated in the hunting zones 68 . A similar situation is currently being played out in Chinko 69 (eastern CAR) where a dedicated group of safari operators are successfully protecting a large area of Sudanian savannah woodlands containing surprisingly intact assemblages (though low densities) of wildlife, despite the chaos and conflict that has characterised CAR for the past two decades. A promising model of community conservation is being tested by the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) in the Maringa-Lopori- Wamba landscape in the bonobo range. Here the conservation project intervenes to improve farmers\u2019 access to markets for their agricultural products, as a livelihood alternative to unsustainable farming practices and commercial bushmeat hunting. The inter- vention involved providing local communities with a boat to trans- port crops from the forest landscape to DRC\u2019s main markets in Kinshasa and Mbandaka, as well as new methods of sustainable farming. The barge\u2019s round-trip journey takes approximately two months and transports up to 400 tons of product \u2013 crops travel- ling one way, humanitarian aid the other. The Congo Shipping Project has allowed farmers to sell produce for profit, increasing the overall income of their community. It is anticipated that farm- ers will have less incentive to engage in the commercial bushmeat trade and that farming practices will enable fallow periods to be lengthened, thus reducing the rate of forest degradation 70 . ( 66 ) Rebel forces occupying the gorilla habitat have even financed their activities by organising gorilla tourism.

        "| 247 #3 Lessons learned and promising approaches 4.9 Wildlife law enforcement outcomes improve significantly if the entire judicial process is closely monitored The EAGLE (Eco Activists for Governance and Law Enforcement) network of wildlife law enforcement NGOs 71 are achieving remark- able success with their approach to investigations, law enforcement operations, legal assistance for prosecution of cases and media coverage of the results. These organisations work closely with all the national law enforcement organisations (forest and wildlife, police, gendarmerie, customs, justice department, national repre- sentatives of INTERPOL) to detect and prosecute wildlife crime. A network of informers provides evidence, and when arrests are made, lawyers are on hand to make sure that the correct legal procedures are strictly adhered to (arrest protocol, witness state- ments, trial, etc.) in order to ensure successful prosecution. Cases are given wide publicity in the local and international media. High- level political support is important, particularly when high-level persons are prosecuted for wildlife crimes 72 . The wide publicity contributes to improving wildlife governance by raising understand- ing of the laws and serving as a warning to potential offenders. 4.10 Law enforcement alone is not a long-term solution to the bushmeat crisis There are no examples in Central Africa where a comprehensive solution for tackling the bushmeat trade has been developed and tested. A review of experiences of livelihood alternatives for the unsustainable use of bushmeat commissioned by the Convention on Biological Diversity\u2019s (CBD) Bushmeat Liaison Group highlights the paucity of successful examples from Central Africa 73 . While interdiction and enforcement-only policies have been widely used, they are not the complete answer in the short and medium term. However, satisfactorily regulating and managing the entire supply chain, from sustainable hunting in the forest to the sale of dis- ease-free meat in urban markets, is also highly problematic given the problems of governance in Central Africa. Bushmeat is a food security issue as much as a biodiversity issue 74 in rural environ- ments and needs to be tackled from this perspective. By contrast, in urban areas bushmeat is more of a \u2018luxury\u2019 item so actions should focus on reducing the supply to urban markets by exerting pressure on the supply routes (roads, rivers, railways, airlines) and encouraging a shift in feeding habits away from bushmeat consumption.

The strategic approach must be first and foremost to concentrate efforts on helping the national PA agencies to secure the protection of priority PAs and their immediate buffer zones in KLCs. If wildlife cannot be protected here there is little chance that it can be preserved elsewhere, given the pressures on wildlife and the speed with which wildlife populations are being impoverished across the Central African region. A pragmatic and realistic approach is required that recog- nises that we cannot protect wildlife everywhere. Where it is fea- sible, efforts should be made to ensure connectivity between PAs, but it should be understood that this will not be possible every- where. As a general principle, the areas where conservation efforts are likely to have the most success are those that are large and intact; in other words they have the full complement of species, in the \u2018right\u2019 proportions, and where the population structure of the longest-lived components (the trees) has not been too badly compromised by human activities, such as farming and logging. Areas where there are clear opportunities for developing effective collaboration with communities and private-sector operators in the buffer zones linking the PAs (FSC-certified logging concessions, mining companies) are also considered to be of particular impor- tance. However, some PAs containing exceptional species richness and/or endemism, particularly in the highly threatened Afro- montane habitats, are already so isolated that efforts will inevita- bly be focused almost entirely on protecting the PA. The priority KLCs are those that meet as many of the following criteria as possible: \u2022 recognised as a World Heritage Site for its global (scientific) importance; \u2022 protects a functioning ecosystem with viable wildlife popu- lations in the face of increasing isolation caused by an expanding rural population; \u2022 established as a transfrontier conservation area or in the process of formal development as a TFCA; \u2022 protects the most important populations of free-ranging ele- phants in the region; \u2022 protects a key population (as rated by the appropriate IUCN SSC Specialist Group) of one or more of the other iconic Cen- tral African wildlife species (gorilla, chimpanzee, bonobo, okapi, forest elephant, endemic small primates, endemic ungulates, etc.) which are categorised as endangered or vul- nerable according to IUCN Red List Criteria; \u2022 protects a globally important dry-season concentration area for wildlife populations together with their wet-season dis- persal zones; \u2022 plays an important role in protecting important wintering grounds for Palearctic bird migrants (e.g. wetlands recognised as Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas \u2013 IBA); \u2022 protects a regionally important hotspot of endemism and diversity; \u2022 contains wildlife landscapes of exceptional scenic interest; \u2022 protects a watershed that human populations are highly dependent on; \u2022 plays a vital role in sustaining a key natural resource, such as a fishery or source of freshwater, that has critical national importance through public, commercial, recreational, artisanal or subsistence use. In the moist forest zone, certain KLCs span international bound- aries. These TFCAs provide good opportunities for economies of scale, sharing of conservation costs, regional cooperation for conservation and \u2018buffering\u2019 in time of civil unrest in one or other of the national components of the ecosystem (see also Sec- tion 4.3). Three such TFCAs stand out in the Central African moist forest zone: the Greater Virunga TFCA (DRC, Uganda, Rwanda), the TRIDOM-TNS TFCA (Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, CAR), and the Gamba/Conkouati TFCA (Gabon, Congo) (see Section 5.1.1. below for more detailed information). Between them they account for roughly one-third of the Central African region\u2019s category I-IV protected areas and almost certainly protect the majority of Cen- tral Africa\u2019s floral and faunal diversity. They also include most of the priority areas identified in the Central African Chimpanzee and Gorilla Action Plan and the Eastern DRC Great Apes Action Plan, and cover the majority of Africa\u2019s remaining forest ele- phants, of which Gabon alone probably holds 50 % 75 . >5 _ Indicative conservation actions ( 75 ) Maisels F., S.

        "| 251 #3 Indicative conservation actions In the drier ecosystems to the north of the moist forest block, spanning the forest-savannah transition zone and the east Suda- nian savannahs of CAR, northern DRC, southern South Sudan and southern Chad, there are a number of important sites harbouring wildlife characteristics of these zones. These include Zemongo/ Chinko complex in eastern CAR, the Garamba NP/Bili-Uere com- plex in northern DRC and the Southern NP in South Sudan. How- ever much of this area suffers from high levels of insecurity and conflict and is intensively used for wildlife trafficking. In these areas it is not only very difficult to work effectively within the existing PAs but opportunities for developing concrete conserva- tion activities in the areas linking them are currently limited. However, although wildlife populations have been seriously depleted over much of this area, it is considered important not to abandon it since, given the very low human density and the vastness of the area, there is potential for recovery if security and law and order can be restored. The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) working in this area has had success developing what they refer to as Conservation Security Partnerships through which wildlife law enforcement is linked with efforts to address security threats to local people (Box 5). In addition to these very large KLCs, a number of individual sites containing a single PA and its buffer zone should be targeted for support. Priority should be given to existing World Heritage Sites which, by virtue of their WHS status, are internationally recognised as being of global importance for nature conservation, and to sites which are on the countries\u2019 Tentative Lists for WHS status or which protect specific globally important features not found elsewhere. In countries open to public-private partnerships (PPPs) for the management of their PAs, this approach should be promoted (DRC, Chad, Congo). Elsewhere, where the institutional context is favourable (such as in Gabon), support to the PA agency through collaborative agreements should be considered. This could include the secondment of qualified staff (expatriate or otherwise) to the national organisations with a dual management and training role. \u2303 An adult male mountain gorilla Volcanoes NP, Rwanda.

Conservation Security Partnerships \u2013 A concept for linking wildlife conservation efforts with efforts to address security threats to local people The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), working in the South Sudan/CAR/north DRC transfrontier area, have developed the concept of Conservation Security Partnerships (CSPs) for operating in zones of high wildlife value where insecurity and lawless- ness is an issue. It is based on a similar approach developed by the Northern Rangelands Trust of northern Kenya, and aims to embrace explicit conflict mitigation and security enhancement objectives together with wildlife protection and protected area management. At the regional level, the CSP involves partnerships between wildlife law enforcement forces, police, military, international security organisations, for example United States Africa Command (AFRICOM), and local community leaders, which link wildlife law enforcement efforts to protect and secure wildlife with efforts to address security threats to local people (cattle raiding, local militia/rebels) as well as broader security threats to state and regional stability. For example, in Southern NP in South Sudan, park rangers are linked in with AFRICOM, Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army (SPLA) and Uganda People\u2019s Defence Force (UPDF), as well as local community scouts, to eliminate LRA threats and contribute to elephant protection and anti-trafficking. At the local level, Community-based Conservation Security Partnerships (CBCSP) involve local communities directly in monitoring illegal activities, intelligence gathering, first alert systems, joint patrolling with wildlife forces and inter-tribal peace processes, by using common security and wildlife conservation concerns as a neutral common ground. \u2303 Park rangers on patrol in Zakouma National Park, Chad. Protected areas in the zone extending from northern Cameroon, through southern Chad, northern CAR, South Sudan and northern DRC have had to battle with heavily armed militia and rebels, often from Sudan, making raids with impunity into these countries to poach elephant and rhino. Their presence creates great insecurity for local communities. ",
        "| 253 #3 Indicative conservation actions The support for PA management should place particular emphasis on: Strengthening anti-poaching and general law-enforcement activities: \u2022 Equipment (and, importantly, mechanisms for proper man- agement of the equipment) and law enforcement training, including paramilitary training, will be major components at many sites. Where feasible and appropriate, specialist anti-poaching/surveillance organisations should be involved 76 . \u2022 Establishing law-enforcement monitoring tools (Spatial Mon- itoring and Reporting Tool \u2013 SMART, CyberTracker 77 or others, Box 6) and protected area management effectiveness mon- itoring tools as standard features of park management procedures. \u2022 Mainstreaming the Last Great Ape Alliance (LAGA) approach (investigations, operations, legal assistance, media coverage) into the PA management operations (see Section 4.9 above). Ensuring that there are sufficient resources for regular mon- itoring of key conservation targets , particularly great apes (see the different great ape Conservation Action Plans 78 ) and forest elephants. In addition to data on the target species, it should be remembered that these surveys generate a great deal of other essential information for managers, notably human activities. Over the past 20 years, much work has been done to refine the methodologies for large mammal survey methods in the moist forest environment and standard methodologies are now being used widely across the region, enabling more reliable compari- sons to be made. However these surveys require considerable resources and until now have not been conducted with sufficient frequency. For forest elephants for example, in addition to the official Central African MIKE sites, a number of other important sites require urgent surveys. These are Lob\u00e9k\u00e9, Nki, Mbam and Djerem NPs and Ngoila-Mintom zone (Cameroon); Conkouati and Ntokou-Pikounda NPs (Congo), Moukalaba-Doudou, Wonga- Wongue, Loango, Birougou, Mwagne, Ivindo, Waka and Monts de Cristal NPs (Gabon). Aerial monitoring and surveys is a very cost-effective tool for which sufficient resources should be made available. While its usefulness over the open savannah ecosystems is self-evident, aerial moni- toring over the moist forest ecosystem has also proved highly effective, particularly for monitoring the use of the ecologically important forest clearings (by humans and animals), and also for monitoring mining and logging activities (new roads and tracks, etc.). This should be an integral part of monitoring activities. Training of field staff (wardens, assistant wardens, monitoring officers, community outreach officers): This is in addition to the specific anti-poaching training referred to above. This should include on-the-job training as well as formal training in special- ised regional or international institutes (see also Section 5.3). Box 6. Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool \u2013 SMART In order to strengthen the effectiveness of monitoring and patrolling, a global consortium of NGOs and conservation agencies (WCS, WWF, Zoological Society of London \u2013 ZSL, Frankfurt Zoological Society, Convention for the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)-MIKE and North Carolina Zoo) have developed the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART; www.smartconservationtools.org). SMART harnesses ranger-collected data on threats and performance by applying new technologies to local needs and capacities through an easy-to-use software tool, and a suite of best practices for patrol monitoring and management. At the local level, SMART can support anti-poaching by enabling identification of poaching hotspots, evaluation of ranger performance, and more efficient targeting of enforcement efforts; at the national level, the information can strengthen institutional communica- tion channels to better allocate financial and human resources to improve anti-poaching efforts; and globally, the information provides standardised, reliable, and accountable measures of poaching and performance to prioritise funding streams and encourage better governance. SMART is being implemented in more than 100 protected areas worldwide through technical support provided by SMART partners in collaboration with host government agencies. In Africa, SMART is being used in protected areas in 14 countries, with national-level adoption of the system already secured in Gabon and underway in Uganda, Kenya and Democratic Republic of Congo. The SMART Partnership is also engaged with several global institutions and conventions in joint efforts, such as CITES-MIKE and the World Heritage Centre. Through these and other multi-lateral and international mechanisms, SMART has the potential to become the global standard for improved law enforcement monitoring (LEM) across protected areas.

Outreach programmes developed by the park must not attempt to resolve all the socio-economic ills of the neighbouring populations. That task should be assigned to specialist organisations with appro- priate budgets, and the objectives of the interventions must be compatible with the conservation objectives of the park, and preferably run in parallel with support to the PA. Addressing the issue of population growth, through strategic partnerships between development and conservation organisations to promote family planning, will be crucially important. Awareness building and effective communication between stakeholders will be an integral part of outreach activities. The International Conservation and Education Fund (INCEF) 79 approach is considered particularly effective for awareness-raising and dissemination of information in local communities. INCEF focuses on locally produced and dis- seminated videos as an educational tool to foster improvement of the health and well-being of human and wildlife populations. It does this by building the capacities of local media professionals to produce quality films in local languages, and building capaci- ties among local education teams to disseminate the videos and measure their impacts. 5.1.1 Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs) Brief descriptions of important KLCs spanning international boundaries as TFCAs are given below. Greater Virunga TFCA This complex encompasses 11 protected areas in DRC (Virunga NP), Rwanda (Volcans NP) and Uganda (Queen Elizabeth NP, Mga- hinga Gorilla NP; Bwindi NP, Semiliki NP, Ruwenzori NP, Kibale NP, Kasyoha-Kitomi FR, Kalinzu-Maramagambo FR, Kyumbura WR). Covering about 12 860 km\u00b2, and with an altitudinal range of 600 to 5 100 m, this area protects the world\u2019s remaining 800 moun- tain gorillas, as well as a significant proportion of the Albertine Rift endemics. It is considered one of the most species-rich regions on earth 80 and is undoubtedly one of the most spectac- ular landscapes in Central Africa. It is also the only area in Central Africa where very substantial tourism revenue is guaranteed (gorilla, chimpanzee, active volcanoes, Ruwenzoris, savannah fauna). Mountain gorilla tourism generates millions of euros annually for the national economies of the countries involved and enhances their international standing. Indeed, the safeguarding of the mountain gorilla population was one of the few issues over which the three countries, variously in conflict with each other over the past 20 years, were able to agree. The Greater Virunga Transboundary Collaboration, with its Executive Secretariat based in Kigali, Rwanda, is a mechanism established by the three coun- tries for strategic, collaborative management of the Greater Virunga landscape. The gorilla population has increased steadily since the late 1970s. Tourism revenue is guaranteed to increase so long as the mountain gorilla population remains protected. Gorilla tourism is also one of the few examples from Central Africa where local communities benefit clearly from the presence of the park (and most recognise the fact that they do \u2013 an impor- tant nuance). \u2303 Community outreach activities in Lomami National Park, DRC, using locally produced and disseminated videos.

If plans for a hydroelectric dam materialize this important area for forest elephant and great apes will be lost. Greater TRIDOM-TNS TFCA This TFCA covers a very large area of essentially contiguous moist forest spanning the borders of three countries (Cameroon, Gabon and Congo). It includes two Central African landscapes known as TRIDOM (Tri-national Dja-Odzala-Mink\u00e9b\u00e9) and TNS (Tri-national Sangha) but is also extended to include Lop\u00e9 NP WHS and Lac Tele Community Reserve, since the habitat linking all these PAs is almost contiguous and much of it is under concession to the logging and mining industries. It covers 15 protected areas in Gabon (Ivindo NP, Mwagne NP, Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 NP, Lop\u00e9-Okanda WHS), Cameroon (Dja WR WHS, Nki NP, Boumba Bek NP, Lac Lobeke NP, Kom NP), Congo (Odzala NP, Nouabal\u00e9-Ndoki NP, Ntokou-Pikounda NP, Lac Tele CR) and CAR (Dzanga-Ndoki NP, Dzanga RS). The TNS part of this KLC differs from other PAs in this landscape in that it is a transfrontier World Heritage Site (the first in the world) composed of four contiguous protected areas managed within the framework of a tri-national agreement 81 between the governments of CAR, Cameroon and Congo, and funded through its own Trust Fund (see below). Lop\u00e9- Okanda is both a natural and cultural World Heritage Site. This vast area of over 250 000 km\u00b2 contains the majority of Central Africa\u2019s forest elephants, lowland gorillas and chimpan- zees, as well a wide cross-section of the Congo Basin fauna. Floristically, the PAs together protect a substantial proportion of the Congo Basin flora 82 . Almost all the forest in between the PAs is, or soon will be, under the management control of extractive industries (logging and mining). This offers many possibilities of PPP in order to enhance wildlife conservation in the concessions and thus preserve forest connectivity between the networks of PAs (see Section 5.2). Some of the PAs have extraordinary tourist potential (TNS, Odzala, Ivindo) because of the presence of many forest clearings with guaranteed viewing of forest elephant and gorilla and a wide spectrum of other forest animal species. In TNS, Odzala and Ivindo, tourist infrastructures have already started attracting international tourism, although it is still a long way from being a profit-making operation. The private sector partner in Odzala has invested in particularly impressive high-end infrastructures 83 , which is a clear indication of the conservation importance and tourism potential of this site. Over the past 15 years, conservation partners and logging com- panies have developed collaborative partnerships and tested methodologies for wildlife management, anti-poaching and sus- tainable hunting in the logging concessions adjacent to this com- plex of protected areas. Lessons learned from these partnerships should be used to guide evolving partnerships with the mining sector, a more recent arrival in the landscape with an enormous capacity to influence, both negatively and positively, what hap- pens here. PPP management agreements exist for the manage- ment of Odzala NP and Nouabal\u00e9-Ndoki NP. In 2007, the TNS Trust Fund (FTNS) was established with support from the World Bank/WWF Alliance for Forest Conservation and Sustainable Use, Deutsche gesellschaft f\u00fcr technische Zusam- menarbeit (GTZ), WCS, AFD and USAID-CARPE. Currently the FTNS has a capital of approximately EUR 25 million provided by KfW, AFD and Regenwalt Striftung through the \u2018Krombacher Regenwald Kampagne\u2019. These funds are invested in international markets and are expected to produce a stable revenue stream to cover targeted activities for conservation and sustainable development.

Over the past 15 years, conservation and research partners, nota- bly WWF and the Smithsonian Institution, have developed inno- vative and successful partnerships with private-sector logging and oil companies 84 active in the area to enhance biodiversity conservation. These types of partnership should be continued and developed. Garamba/Bili-Uele/Southern/ Zemongo-Chinko TFCA It is recognised that this TFCA is significantly different from the others described above in that the area is characterised by extreme insecurity and lawlessness, which has led to the deple- tion of wildlife populations over the past 25 years. However it is considered important to maintain a presence in the zone to (i) secure the PAs, one of which is a WHS in Danger, and (ii) con- tribute to conservation security in the intervening zones. Traffick- ing of wildlife to northern Sudan from this area, as well as from further south in the Congo Basin, occurs across this vast, largely uncontrolled area. There is therefore a need, and good potential, for a broad northern DRC/eastern CAR/south-western South Sudan conservation-security partnership (Box 5 above) that includes the wildlife services of the three countries, NGOs operational in the areas (WCS, APN, Chinko Project), AFRICOM, US Departments of State and Defense, and local military operators (SPLA, UPDF, UN armed missions). Gabon\u2019s ANPN has also recently become involved in helping the CAR Government with wildlife security issues, including in Chinko. Historically the Giant Eland (Derby\u2019s Eland), the world\u2019s largest antelope, was found in the narrow band of woodlands and wooded savannahs extending from Senegal to the Nile. Currently it survives only in highly fragmented populations in Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic and South Sudan. Old males are among the most highly prized big game trophies and sport hunting is likely to be a key to the future of this species (section 4.8). < ",

I to IV) Other Protected Areas (IUCN cat. V and VI) Biologically the area contains vast intact areas of biodiversity-rich forest-savannah mosaic, as well as the drier Sudanian savannah and woodland wilderness areas. As recently as the early 1980s this area supported the highest density of elephant in Africa and there is potential for recovery given the low human densities and the intactness of vast areas of natural habitat. The area contains three national parks: Garamba NP in DRC, and Lantoto NP (con- tiguous with Garamba) and Southern NP in South Sudan. Other PAs are the vast Bili-Uere complex of wildlife and hunting reserves in DRC and the Zemongo Wildlife Reserve and Chinko Hunting Reserve in CAR. Garamba NP has the most important elephant population remaining in the region (although currently suffering intense poaching pressure from the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) and Sudanese gangs 85 ). Southern NP remains a stronghold for giant eland and also contains roan, hartebeest and wild dog 86 . The Chinko-Zemongo complex has a remarkably intact (though low density) array of wildlife species typical of the forest-savan- nah ecotone, including giant eland, buffalo, bongo, lion, elephant, chimpanzee and giant forest hog. Similarly recent surveys in the long abandoned Bili-Uere complex have confirmed important pockets of wildlife, particularly in the forest sections of the for- est-savannah mosaic 87, 88 . The Monts de Cristal \u2013 Altos Nsork TFCA This mid-altitude mountain range spanning Gabon and Equatorial Guinea represents a Pleistocene refuge with the highest species richness and diversity of any site in western Central Africa, including perhaps the greatest plant diversity in Africa. With a unique combi- nation of primary rainforest and cloud forest, it has one of the high- est numbers of butterfly species in Africa (many species are found only in these two countries). It has a significant population of ele- phant and mandrill, and is a key water source for the region. The Korup-Takamanda-Mount Cameroon TFCA is covered in Chap- ter 4 (Western Africa).

Democratic Republic of Congo: \u2022 The remaining three DRC World Heritage Sites: Okapi WR, Kahuzi-Biega NP and Salonga NP: (Virunga NP is covered in the Greater Virunga TFCA, and Garamba NP in the Garamba- Bili Uere-Southern-Chinko TFCA.) Their status as WHSs con- firms their global importance. Globally important DRC endemics are protected by these sites (okapi, Grauer\u2019s gorilla, bonobo, Congo peacock, aquatic genet, numerous small pri- mate endemics). The Okapi Wildlife Reserve is the most important protected area for the Eastern chimpanzee (about 6 000 individuals) and contains the DRC\u2019s largest forest ele- phant population (estimated at 1 200 in 2011 89 ). \u2022 Lomami NP (in the process of being gazetted): This area contains several DRC endemics including the iconic bonobo and okapi. Scientists have also recently described a new endemic monkey species, the lesula monkey ( Cercopithecus lomami- ensis ) 90 and a second new species is currently being described. This is a very remote area of moist forest with relatively limited human and development pressures on its boundaries. \u2022 Lomako-Yokokala NR: A priority area for bonobos in the northern part of its range (IUCN Bonobo Conservation Strategy) and an area where long-term research has been conducted. \u2022 Tumba-Lediima NR: A priority area for bonobos in the west- ern part of its range (IUCN Bonobo Conservation Strategy). In addition, the swamp forests of Lac Tumba (together with those of Lac Tele CR in the Congo Republic \u2013 see below) constitute the largest area under protection of the vast and unique Congolian swamp forests. \u2022 Itombwe-Kabobo: The Itombwe Massif and the adjacent Kabobo-Luama landscape on the Albertine Rift are both in the process of becoming protected areas: the Itombwe Nat- ural Reserve and the Ngamikka National Park respec- tively. These contain the highest number of Albertine Rift endemics of any site on the Albertine Rift with many species that are unique to the two sites. Recent discoveries include three mammal and five plant species, and a possible ten new amphibian species. Kabobo-Luama landscape may have as many as 2 000 chimpanzees, while the Itombwe Massif has both chimpanzee and Grauer\u2019s gorilla populations. \u2022 Maiko NP: Given the highly heterogeneous distribution of the Grauer\u2019s gorilla (making it vulnerable to local extinctions outside of PAs), this park is important for the protection of this DRC endemic. Several other Congo endemics occur there (Congo peacock, okapi, aquatic genet). This park is currently very difficult to operate in because of problems of access and the presence of Simba rebels who have been living in the park since the late 1960s. \u2022 The two Katanga national parks \u2013 Kundelungu NP and Upemba NP \u2013 and the Zone annexe connecting them: These are the only national parks in the Central African region that protect the miombo woodland ecosystem. The endemic Congo zebra survives in Upemba NP and there is strong potential for recovery of wildlife populations given proper protection. The area also has significant tourist potential (spectacular landscapes). Central African Republic: \u2022 Gounda-St Floris World Heritage Site and the sur- rounding Village Safari Hunting Zones ( Zones Cyn\u00e9g\u00e9- tiques Villagoises ) (ZCV): Although this area is currently overwhelmed by conflict, the past history of community con- servation successes based on consumptive tourism in the ZCV justifies keeping this area on the list of priority zones where interventions could restart if and when security returns to this area. A key feature of this zone is the large population of giant eland. Cameroon: \u2022 Bouba-Ndjida-Benou\u00e9: An area of Sudanian savannah, Bouba-Njida previously contained >500 savannah ele- phants, but has potential for recovery. Both have giant eland populations. \u2022 Mbam and Djerem NP: This is a large, mostly intact area of the biodiversity-rich savannah-forest transition ecotone and has one of the largest remaining populations of savannah elephants in Central Africa (estimate 800). \u2022 Mount Oku and Ijim Ridge: Although not category I-IV PAs, the area contains the Oku Floral Sanctuary ( Sanctuaire \u00e0 flore d\u2019Oku ) and contains the largest extent of, and highest, Afro-montane forest in West Africa, the only Alpine bamboo forest and the only Podocarpus forest in West Africa. It also has exceptional floral, herpetological and bird endemicity. Chad: \u2022 Zakouma NP: This is Chad\u2019s emblematic protected area which was brought back from the brink by >30 years of sus- tained support for protection. Zakouma is the flagship- protected area of the Sudanian savannah ecosystem. Con- servation efforts in the park (managed by the African Parks Network - APN under a PPP) receive political support at the highest level. It also has very significant tourist potential.

        "266 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Central Africa 5.2 Engage with the private sector extractive industry to enhance biodiversity conservation outside protected areas Since almost all forest outside the protected areas is (or will soon) be attributed to private extractive industry operators, conserva- tionists have to engage with them if we are to preserve connec- tivity between protected areas and ecological functions across large tracts of forest. Currently the most promising opportunities for this type of collaboration are in the forests of Gabon, northern Congo and southern Cameroon in the Greater TRIDOM/TNS land- scape. Since protected areas cover only 20 % of the forest in this zone, the areas attributed as concessions cover the overwhelming majority of the forest, and therefore probably still contain much of the zone\u2019s wildlife. Ideally collaborative agreements should be established between the government forestry/wildlife institutions, the extractive indus- try concessionaires and conservation organisations with the objective of developing and implementing best practices to avoid wildlife loss as a result of the extractive activities. The exact nature of measures will depend on the particular circumstances of each case but it will be necessary to work on several fronts including wildlife and socio-economic surveys to create baselines, establishing strong company internal regulations concerning wild- life issues, implementing wildlife surveillance strategies, bio- diversity offset mechanisms for \u2018no net loss\u2019 of biodiversity, and monitoring conservation outcomes. Working with local commu- nities in the concessions to clarify owner and user rights of forest resources, particularly wildlife, will be a crucial step in the process of managing sustainable hunting of bushmeat species. These measures should be an integral part of a company\u2019s management plan, which is a legally binding document (see further discussion in following section on tackling the bushmeat issue). The inclusion of adherence to wildlife laws in the matrix of FLEGT legality criteria would further enhance the conservation outcomes in non- FSC forest concessions. Priority should be given to working with mining and logging com- panies that are located within the Greater TRIDOM/TNS and Gamba/Mayumba/Conkouati TFCAs (Section 5.1.1). 5.3 Training and institution building In Central Africa, much important training of wildlife managers (wardens, monitoring officers, community conservation officers, rangers, etc.) takes place on site in the form of on-the-job training within the framework of externally funded projects. While the value of this kind of training is undeniable, and has led to the emergence of many highly competent national conservation prac- titioners, the weakness of the protected area agencies to which they belong (absence of career opportunities, poor management of staff, governance issues) means that many of these individuals end up leaving their institutions for better paid, and more stable and fulfilling jobs with INGOs or international agencies where they have real career opportunities. The other common scenario is that, because of the lack of competent PA authority staff, indi- viduals from outside of the management authorities are brought in to a site and trained, but once trained very few of them are integrated into the national authority (nor do many of them even wish to be integrated). There is therefore an urgent need for fundamental institutional reform in almost all of the Central African PA authorities. PA man- agement needs to be professionalised and proper career prospects offered for people entering the service. This is such a necessary fundamental change that many years of institution building will be required before tangible results will be seen in terms of improved PA management. It will also require a genuine political will for change (and improved governance) in order to overcome the resistance to change that undoubtedly exists within certain countries of the region. However, as noted in Chapter 2, Section 5.4.2, institutional reform of PA management authorities is a cost-effective conservation investment because all PAs and wildlife stand to benefit. Developing institutional capacity and tackling poor governance across the board is of vital importance to wildlife, both within and outside protected areas. The EU should provide support for main- streaming biodiversity into development strategies and policies, building governments\u2019 institutional capacities, improving the coor- dination and communication between ministries and ensuring that governmental decision-making processes include appropriate environmental expertise. Three simultaneous lines of action are therefore required: \u2022 Continue with on-the-job training at sites within the frame- work of externally supported interventions (see Section 5.1 for more detail). Training should be a standard component of all interventions in support of the sites identified in this report. \u2022 Support the main regional training centres (EFG, ERAIFT, ENF in Cameroon, DRC and Gabon respectively) in collab- oration with their other international partners. This would involve capacity building for the institutions themselves, as well as providing scholarships for students. Other train- ing centres located in the heart of the moist forest zone, ",
        "| 267 #3 Indicative conservation actions such as the Alphonse Makanga Training Centre in Lop\u00e9, could be supported and links strengthened with the above- mentioned regional training centres. \u2022 Support national-level institutional support/reform for national PA authorities and all other authorities involved in natural resource and land management in countries demonstrating genuine political commitment to see the reforms through. 5.4 Tackling the bushmeat issue Over-exploitation of wildlife threatens food security and wildlife. It is recognised as a global concern by the Convention on Biolog- ical Diversity 91 , which has established a Liaison Group on Bush- meat to work with the CITES Central Africa Bushmeat Working Group. In Central Africa, demand for bushmeat is higher than the sustainable level of production. One of the most important root causes of overhunting is the breakdown in traditional controls over access to land and hunting areas, and the fact that legal frameworks of the Central African nations do not recognise local control over traditional lands and the rights of local populations to manage or regulate hunting on these lands 92 . As a result, traditional rules over hunting have broken down and in many areas there is now a situation of open access with little or no control by local communities over hunting by outsiders. Faced with the scale of bushmeat hunting and the evident impov- erishment of large areas of forest in Central Africa, conservation- ists have tended to favour a law-enforcement approach to prevent irreversible impoverishment of the forests. Develop- ment-orientated actors suggest that a regulated bushmeat trade, which maintains the supplies of appropriate species from forests, can contribute to economic growth in areas where there are few other options, but conservationists argue strongly that sustaina- ble offtake can only be achieved where human populations do not exceed about 1 inhabitant/km\u00b2 and where the meat is con- sumed at home (i.e. not sold outside the area) 93 ; but this is an increasingly rare situation in Central Africa. As long as rural pop- ulations remain poor and the demand for bushmeat in urban markets remains high, an unsustainable trade in bushmeat will continue to exist. Establishing a regulated and sustainable system of harvesting bushmeat will therefore be extremely complex and time-consuming to achieve, given the fundamental changes to legal frameworks that must occur across Central Africa and the scale of capacity building of local communities for wildlife man- agement that will be necessary. The legitimate fear of conservationists is that by the time the regulatory frameworks are in place and capacities of local communities for sustainable wildlife management have been built, most of the wildlife will already have disappeared from the forests outside the protected areas. \u2303 Smoked monkey (left) and monitor lizard (right) sold at markets in Brazzaville (Congo) and Gamba (Gabon) respectively.

Bushmeat is a food security issue in rural environments, whereas in urban areas this is not necessarily the case. The protein gap therefore needs to be tackled in rural areas by combinations of various actions at different points of the value chain and of the enabling environment. Three strategic approaches are therefore necessary: (i) reducing the demand for bushmeat; (ii) improving the sustainability of the supply by better management of the resource, and (iii) creating a conducive and enabling institutional and policy environment. The ultimate goal should be to achieve sustainable harvesting of bushmeat for local con- sumption in rural areas, and eliminate bushmeat consump- tion in urban areas. 5.4.1 Reduce the demand for bushmeat Hunters and rural consumers: \u2022 Develop alternative sources of protein at a cost similar to bushmeat. With an estimated yearly extraction rate in the Congo Basin of 4.5 million tons of bushmeat, cattle ranching is never going to be an ecologically sustainable solution since an estimated 25 million hectares of forest would have to be converted to pastures 94 . Pigs and chickens have much higher conversion rates than do cattle and both can thrive on kitchen scraps and crop residues. Near Ouesso, one of the region\u2019s biggest bushmeat markets, opportunities exist for producing chicken feed locally (from soya and maize) at a price below bushmeat 95 . Developing sustainable fisheries in the rivers and lakes should also be investigated as fish are so important in local diets and can be a substitute for bushmeat. However, as noted in Section 4.10, attempts to develop alternatives for bushmeat have so far had limited success in Central Africa. Requiring extractive industry concessionaires to import domestically produced meat for their workers should also be a standard requirement. \u2022 Improve economic opportunities in productive sectors. This will cover a wide range of possibilities depending on the local context. \u2022 Raise awareness through environmental education and aware- ness-building via local media using the International Conser- vation and Education Fund (INCEF)-type approach. Retailers and urban consumers: \u2022 Strictly enforce the ban on the sale and consumption of pro- tected and endangered species. Protected species found on sale should be publicly destroyed. International consumers: \u2022 The international trade must be completely stopped. Heavy fines should be levied for possessing or trading bushmeat, regardless of the status and provenance of the species. \u2022 A concerted effort is needed to raise awareness among per- sonnel stationed at exit points (ports, airports, border posts). \u2022 Airline and shipping companies should commit to banning the transport of all bushmeat (regardless of its status) and should be made accountable for enforcing this. Regardless of the issue of sustainability, the international trade in bushmeat constitutes a serious public health risk. 5.4.2 Improve the sustainability of the supply by better management of the resource This will require developing models of wildlife management with local communities, research and extension, and engagement with the extractive industries. Hunters and rural consumers: \u2022 Work with hunters and rural communities to establish hunting rules that allow harvesting of resilient species but ban the hunting of vulnerable species. This process will involve par- ticipatory land-use planning at the local community level and should lead to the definition of hunting rules (period, location, hunting tools, quotas, etc.), and simple methods to self-mon- itor their activities. This will be a highly complex undertaking requiring adequate financial and technical resources. Lessons learned from past experiences in the region (e.g. PROGEPP) should be drawn on rather than trying to \u2018reinvent the wheel\u2019. Research and extension services: \u2022 Understanding the dynamics of hunting and its impact on the dynamics of heavily hunted resilient species and their more vulnerable competitors is highly complex and will require a concerted effort in terms of research and monitoring by appropriate research bodies. The SYVBAC programme 96 , established by TRAFFIC, is one such monitoring initiative. \u2022 Analysing the relationships and trade-offs between bushmeat and other protein sources is also a key component of improv- ing the sustainability of the supply. Rural communities will usually switch from bushmeat to fish as the price or availa- bility fluctuates with the seasons. However, a decline in one resource can lead to overharvesting of the other so under- standing the feedback loop between fish and meat catches is essential.

        "| 269 #3 Indicative conservation actions under what circumstances consumers will transition to domestic meat is also key to achieving sustainability in the supply of bushmeat. Extractive industries The extractive industries dominate the forest landscape and have considerable potential to influence how the bushmeat \u2018crisis\u2019 will evolve. Current legislation in most of the Central African countries requires conservation to be integrated into their sustainable forest management plans, for example the setting aside of no- logging \u2018conservation series\u2019, and they have the responsibility to ensure that their personnel respect wildlife legislation. However, companies should go further in a number of ways: \u2022 Internal regulations and codes of conduct concerning wildlife in the concessions should become part of the companies\u2019 standard operating procedures. The transportation of bush- meat should be strictly forbidden on company vehicles and manned checkpoints with trained personnel should be estab- lished on the main logging roads in the concessions. \u2022 Companies should be required to provide alternative sources of protein for their workers at cost. \u2022 Companies, in collaboration with experienced technical part- ners, should organise and support community hunting schemes for communities living within their concessions. \u2022 Companies should subscribe to certification schemes that will give them preferential access to environmentally sensitive international markets, which are prepared to pay a premium for sustainably sourced timber from concessions where wild- life regulations are respected. The same principle applies for the mining concessions. 5.4.3 Create a conducive and enabling institutional and policy environment For participatory wildlife management to become a reality, national polices, laws and regulations must be able to grant to communities the rights to the land and wildlife that they will manage, and allow community members to market locally the bushmeat and other wildlife products (from permitted species) that are harvested. These provisions are not yet firmly integrated in the policy and legal frameworks of the Central African coun- tries. Several countries are, however, developing policies or strat- egies for wildlife management (CAR, DRC, Gabon, Congo) and only one country (Congo) makes very general provisions in its wildlife law for participatory wildlife management (but which cannot be rendered operational until the ministerial regulations are passed). None of the legal frameworks clearly allow the marketing of bush- meat from community-managed lands and the general perception is that the bushmeat market chain is illegal. The distinction between sales for local consumption and trade further afield remains very blurred and is a source of recurring conflict. Action will be required at several levels: National policy-making \u2022 Policies, laws and regulations will need to be revised in order to provide an adequate legal framework for enhancing own- ership and tenure rights and allowing participatory wildlife management. \u2022 At the same time it will be necessary to legitimise the bush- meat debate in order to properly address the fraught question of the legality of the bushmeat market chain, and acknowl- edge the contribution of bushmeat to food security in national strategies. \u2303 Ba\u2019Kola semi-nomads with traditional duiker hunting nets in the buffer zone of Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Republic of Congo. In many areas traditional rules over hunting have broken down resulting in a situation of \u2018open access\u2019 with little or no control by local communities over hunting by outsiders. ",
        "270 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Central Africa International policies \u2022 Companies or individuals not complying with CITES regulations must be firmly punished and denounced (\u2018name and shame\u2019). \u2022 Wildlife issues must be systematically covered within inter- nationally supported policy processes. \u2022 A clear link must be made between the international bush- meat trade and emerging disease risks. Local institutions \u2022 Once the policy and regulatory frameworks are in place, local institutions that have a vested interest in protecting their wildlife resource should be supported and capacities strength- ened for managing and monitoring a sustainable local trade in bushmeat. Finally, it should be reiterated that in urban areas, where the great majority of bushmeat is consumed, bushmeat is generally not a food security issue. A bushmeat strategy for the region should therefore concentrate on achieving sustainable off-take in rural areas but should not try to \u2018develop\u2019 or manage the bushmeat chain in urban areas. Ultimately the aim should be to see the bushmeat trade in urban areas disappear by squeezing the transport lines to the urban markets through control of the major access routes (roads, rivers, railways, airlines). Dissuasive penalties for transporting bushmeat on trains, internal airlines, public and private transport (logging trucks, buses, boats) would require strong political will but could significantly reduce the vol- ume of trade to the cities. Since there are no \u2018silver bullet\u2019 solutions to the bushmeat prob- lem, it is recommended that a series of pilot projects be estab- lished in the countries in order to test different approaches in the range of contexts across the region. These pilot projects should build on lessons learned from other ongoing initiatives of this type and should be replicated as and where feasible. Ideally pilot projects should comprise as many of the following components as possible: \u2022 be conducted in an area contiguous with a PA that is receiving long-term support from the EU (or other agency). This would be part of the PAs\u2019 community conservation/livelihood programme; \u2022 be conducted in collaboration with a private-sector partner (e.g. in Central Africa with an FSC-certified logging company) as part of its community development obligations; \u2022 include, or be associated with, a component for developing alternative domestic animal protein at a competitive price (e.g. intensive chicken production where chicken feed can be produced locally without involving habitat loss); \u2022 include, or be associated with, a scheme to develop sustain- able harvesting of freshwater fish (either wild-caught or fish farming); \u2022 a strong research and monitoring component, ideally in asso- ciation with an experienced research organisation \u2013 sustain- able harvesting of wildlife, particularly in the forest ecosystem, is still a very inexact science. \u2022 a strong community-relations component for awareness building and local governance structures. Associating private sector, PA management and research partners in the work with the local communities would bring important added value in terms of scientific method, local governance build- ing, law enforcement and awareness building. \u2303 Confiscated weapons and illegal ivory in Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Republic of Congo.

        "| 271 #3 Indicative conservation actions 5.5 Dismantling wildlife crime networks and curbing the demand This aspect is treated fully in the section on wildlife trade of Chapter 5. The recommendations of that chapter are entirely relevant to the Central African context. There has been a concerted effort over the past year to translate the ten-point Action Plan of the Marrakech Declaration into con- crete actions in the Central African region. The Marrakech Plan proposes a series of actions around three key themes: (i) building collaboration between organisations and agencies; (ii) strengthening law enforcement; (iii) properly penalising wildlife crime. Central Africa\u2019s response has been to adopt a regional action plan entitled PAPECALF (Action Plan for the COMIFAC sub-region for strengthening the enforcement of national wildlife laws) and to initiate a process leading towards the establishment of national coordinating units (NCUs) for fighting wildlife crime. These NCUs will bring together all the arms of government concerned by wild- life crime \u2013 justice, interior, defence (police, criminal police, INTER- POL), finance (customs), wildlife \u2013 as well as the NGOs involved in wildlife enforcement, such as the EAGLE network and WWF. The presence of NGO wildlife enforcement networks (WENs) is essential in order to guarantee full transparency. Representatives of diplomatic missions should also be involved in the NCU. As the NCUs will bring together so many government departments, it is proposed that they should work directly under the Office of the Prime Minister. The mission of the NCUs will be to: \u2022 establish a mechanism for collecting, storing and sharing information on wildlife crime; \u2022 build awareness about wildlife criminality among stakehold- ers and disseminate information on wildlife laws; \u2022 strengthen capacities of actors involved in combating wildlife crime. In addition to supporting the process of establishment of effective wildlife crime NCUs, support from the EU should also include: \u2022 Continued support for international trade regulation through support for the CITES core functions and expansion of the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC). The ICCWC is a collaborative effort of five inter- governmental organisations: CITES, INTERPOL, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), World Bank and the World Customs Organisation, which works to bring coordi- nated support to the national wildlife law-enforcement agen- cies, as well as to the sub-regional and regional networks that are fighting wildlife crime on a daily basis. The aim is to ensure better-coordinated responses to wildlife crime in order to increase the risk of detection and punishment for wildlife criminals. UNODC is currently aiding Gabon in developing a plan for improving criminal investigations for wildlife crime and establishing forensic investigation capacities. This kind of initiative should be supported and expanded. \u2022 Support for the EAGLE network of NGO wildlife law enforce- ment organisations. Given the problems of governance and capacities in the sub-region, the EU should support the EAGLE network. These NGOs, run by highly motivated national and international staff, have demonstrated over the past five years their effectiveness and efficiency (they work with very modest budgets). They work well with national law-enforce- ment agencies and make an important contribution to strengthening their capacities. They also help to ensure greater transparency and a wide media coverage of wildlife crime operations. \u2022 The mobilisation of specialist international wildlife security advisors (Chapter 5, Section 3.9.3.3) in support of the NCUs. Dismantling wildlife crime networks requires specialist skills that are rarely available in the region. ",

        "290 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 West Africa Aspects of West African biodiversity The following aspects characterise the biodiversity of West Africa: \u2022 wide diversity of habitats and species; \u2022 strong degradation; \u2022 greatest richness of biodiversity in lowland and mountain forests (the Guinea forest in West Africa contains half the mammal species on the African continent); \u2022 presence of some of the largest and most beautiful antelopes in the world; \u2022 a pattern of extinction of mammals in the wild that becomes progressively greater, moving from the coastal and forest biomes to the deserts (including the desert protected areas); \u2022 progressive decline in the representation of biomes in pro- tected areas (PAs), moving from the desert towards the forest and coastal areas. The current interventions for conservation in West Africa do not ensure the protection of wildlife or its biodiversity heritage. Those interventions that assist in situ conservation are highly concen- trated in the savannah areas. Interventions in favour of ex situ conservation do not protect some of the key endemic mammals at risk of extinction (e.g. West African lion). The survival of some key species (e.g. oryx) requires the adoption of a mixed strategy of in situ and ex situ conservation due to poor genetic heritage of the mammals supposedly extinct in nature and existing only in captivity. The effects of climate change and the important development of industrialisation in the southern countries in West Africa are causing significant in-migration of human populations. The effects of these phenomena are higher pressure on and con- sequently greater degradation of coastal and lowland forest eco- systems, which are the most threatened ecotypes in the region. The current fragility of biodiversity and the significant threats to the overall biodiversity heritage of West Africa require conserva- tion interventions that are highly specific to this region \u2013 this is in addition to the more general strategic approach outlined in the summary document \u2013 Synthesis. For the strategic approach to wildlife conservation in West Africa, there is specific need for the following: \u2022 In situ support for conservation which includes: i) specific strategies and actions for the four ecotypes: (a) deserts, (b) savannahs, (c) forests and (d) mangroves/coastal area; ii) special analysis of species and habitats that are highly threat- ened with extinction; and iii) specific training in wildlife pro- tection on the ground (see Sections 5.1.2, 5.1.8, 5.1.9). \u2022 Strengthening management capacity in wildlife conservation with a focus on regional coordination through the following: i) institutional support to raise capacity for wildlife conservation and strengthen coordination between countries of the region; and ii) governance training for management authorities so that the landscape approach proposed by this strategic approach can be adopted (see Sections 5.2.1, 5.2.5). Organisation of this chapter The first section presents the key elements of the West African countries concerning: (i) development indicators, driving forces causing wildlife decline and the impacts of climate change; (ii) an overview of the wildlife in West Africa following an analysis of four major ecotypes (deserts, savannahs, forests and mangroves/ coastal) including the coastal and marine PAs, the more threat- ened species and the risks of species disappearing; (iii) a quick analysis of two elements connected with long-term wildlife con- servation: the need for regional institutional support and for con- servation capacity building in West Africa. The second section indicates the key direct threats and the key indirect threats to conservation in West Africa. The section pre- sents an analysis of: \u2022 four key direct threats to conservation: (i) availability of funds; (ii) institutional governance; (iii) illegal wildlife income and corruption, and iv) weak planning, management, effectiveness and monitoring; \u2022 five key indirect threats to conservation: (i) population growth and poverty; (ii) fragmentation, reduction and isolation of PAs in the landscape; (iii) coup d\u2019\u00c9tats, rebellions, civil unrest and religious fundamentalism, Ebola crisis (epidemics/pandemics), and refugee crises; (iv) negative economic trends; (v) policy and sectorial approaches. The third section is a short presentation of the ongoing conserva- tion effort organised for the four major ecotypes: deserts, savannahs, forests and mangroves/coastal. At present the ongoing conservation efforts are characterised by: (i) low funding for desert PAs with a strong involvement of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), (ii) comparatively strong support in the savannah area; (iii) low funding for rainforest areas, with mixed interventions by govern- ment and NGOs; (iv) a small-scale success story for the recovery of mangrove forests through a public-private partnership. The fourth section looks briefly at the negative and positive les- sons learned and promising approaches. The success of the prom- ising approaches depends on the functional integration of three strategies: (a) consistent, uninterrupted interventions on the ground with a specific strategic approach of intervention for each major ecotype but coordinated between them, (b) a decision sup- port system based on the collection and organisation of informa- tion on biodiversity and management effectiveness in collaboration with BIOPAMA (Biodiversity and Protected Areas Management >0 _ Executive Summary ",
        "| 291 #4 | 291 Executive Summary Programme, a European Union programme), and (c) shared deci- sion-making at institutional and political levels. The fifth section is the most developed and gives details about the two parallel processes, active and proactive, to try to establish or restore the fundamentals for a better wildlife conservation in West Africa. The active process has a focus on more feet on the ground to take action against key direct threats and for the pro- tection of areas of high biodiversity, while the proactive process is an external support for better governance, monitoring and planning, and against the key indirect threats on PAs. The active process has five main activities: 1. dissemination and analysis of the proposals about sites and priorities for conservation in West Africa; 2. specific strategies and actions for the major ecotypes: deserts, savannahs, forests and mangroves/coastal; 3. dismantling wildlife traffic networks; 4. special analysis; 5. wildlife protection training. The objectives of the active process are: (i) to balance the interventions between the four major ecotypes; (ii) to save threatened species from extinction; (iii) to preserve critical habitats (e.g. wetland, Mount Nimba, mangrove); (iv) to improve the management effectiveness of national and transborder parks; (v) to promote landscape conservation initiatives for maintaining connections between the blocks of PAs; (vi) to ensure a better representation of the realities of wildlife in West Africa. The proactive process attempts , by creating \u2018institutional support and coordination\u2019 under the West Africa Economy and Monetary Union (WAEMU), to coordinate and promote: 1. monitoring and planning; 2. communication; 3. biological research; 4. management-governance training. The objectives of the proactive process are: (i) to improve the availability and proper use of resources; (ii) to ensure a shared and harmonised implementation between countries; (iii) to develop a stronger balance of conservation initiatives in the macro-ecotypes of West Africa; (iv) to give greater attention to the specificities of conservation at national, regional and interregional level (e.g. highly threatened species, wetlands at risk of extinction, mangrove ecosystems). At present there is no organisation that provides the required institutional, technical and scientific capacities in West Africa. This document therefore recommends the combination of existing institutions and organisations with adequate support to establish a unit to implement the proposed strategic approach. The Appendix 1 present basic information that will support the development of a strategic approach to the conservation of bio- diversity in West Africa: (i) key, threatened, rare and high-value species; (ii) data on the main conservation projects in West Africa, and (iii) miscellaneous data on West Africa. \u2303 The coasts of West Africa offer many stop-over sites for members of the Palearctic population of greater flamingos.

Cape Verde was not considered in the report because there are no protected areas (PAs) in the country, but it was associated with this strategic approach in a few specific analyses. Moreover, a specific analysis of this country will be conducted in a study dedicated to African insular ecosystems. 1.1.1 Development indicators The countries of West Africa have a population of 340 million; about 60 % of the inhabitants live in rural areas. The average yearly income for each person in West Africa is USD 800 (2011). This compares with an average yearly income for each person in Sub-Saharan Africa of USD 1 500. The region\u2019s economic growth has averaged only 2.9 % during the past three years, in contrast with what was the best gross domestic product (GDP) growth for Africa in the past, while its population has been growing by 2.8- 2.9 % a year. It is estimated that economic growth of about 6-7 % a year would be required to meet the goal of cutting extreme poverty in half by 2020 (see Table 1, Figures 2 and 3). >1 _ Special features of the West African region SENEGAL SENEGAL N I G E R N I G E R LIBERIA LIBERIA GAMBIA GAMBIA BURKINA FASO BURKINA FASO BENIN BENIN GHANA GHANA M A U R I T A N I A M A U R I T A N I A SIERRA SIERRA LEONE LEONE N I G E R I A N I G E R I A GUINEA-BISSAU GUINEA-BISSAU M A L I M A L I G U I N E A G U I N E A C\u00d4TE C\u00d4TE D'I V OI RE D'I V OI RE TOGO TOGO Figure 1.

        "296 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 West Africa 1.1.2 Conflict Over the past 15 years, nine of the 15 members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) \u2013 Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo \u2013 have experienced conflict ranging from high intensity civil wars to violence during elections. One of the most common rea- sons advanced for the prevalence of conflict is weak governance. The area accounts for more than 70 % of military coups in Africa. There is a high degree of illicit trade in diamonds, timber and wildlife, which can be directly related to the conflict. In the last years, the conflicts in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Mali have been particularly damaging for the region and also for biodiversity in the country. Maintaining peace in the region is seen as a prerequisite for improving its development outcomes. In 1999, it was estimated that USD 800 million that could have been used for development was instead diverted into conflicts. 1.1.3 Food crisis Underdevelopment, low rainfall, climate change, coup d\u2019\u00c9tat, rebellion, civil and religious fundamentalism, epidemic (Ebola) and unrest continue to disrupt local and cross-border staple food and livestock markets. Consequently the forced migrations, pov- erty, declining food stocks and rising food prices are all key factors that are contributing toward a chronic food crisis in West Africa. Fifteen million people across the region are directly or periodically affected by the food crisis. Also a higher-than-average staple food price is causing an increase in the illness rate in West Africa as many people are becoming severely malnourished. 1.1.4 West Africa and the Millennium Development Goals West Africa is lagging behind in its efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals 1 for the following reasons: \u2022 over 55 % of West Africans live on less than USD 1 per day; \u2022 life expectancy at birth is only 46 years; \u2022 secondary school enrolment is at 20 %; \u2022 42 % of adults are illiterate; \u2022 malnutrition affects 29 % of children under the age of five. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 1990 1985 1980 1995 2000 2005 2010 2,00 2,25 2,50 2,75 3,00 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 -5 0510 15 20 25 Note the increasing population density and agricultural land with decreasing forest areas and formally maintained protected areas.

Previously common, over-hunting and habitat destruction during the 20th century has resulted in the extinction of this species in the wild. 1.1.5 Climate change For West Africa, the most recent estimates of the effects of climate change show the following: \u2022 high risk for the desert and savannah areas of the Sahelian zone; \u2022 increasing desertification of Sahelian acacia savannah eco- types and the West Sudanian savannah; \u2022 probable degradation of agricultural systems for: (i) the south- east of Nigeria; (ii) the cross-border area between Guinea, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone; (iii) the cross-border area between Senegal, Gambia, Guinea and Guinea-Bissau; \u2022 increased threat of floods on the Niger Delta. 1.1.6 Conclusions West Africa has a number of negative aspects that are acting as constraints on conservation actions: 1. high political instability and security risks; 2. high population growth (featuring high concentrations in big cities but a reduction in the urban population) with an esti- mated doubling time of the population over the next 25 years; 3. slow-growing economy in relation to the objectives of the Millennium Goals; 4. significant environmental fragility due to the pressures of deforestation, cyclical periods of drought and climate change; 5. constant food crises which increase the tendency of migration to coastal areas, and reduce the effectiveness of conservation in savannah and coastal areas because of the higher pressures on natural resources, pressure on land, and economic activities; 6. the high risks arising from climate change; 7. an insufficient awareness of wildlife by civil society. 1.2 Overview of ecological characteristics of the West African region West Africa has high biodiversity value because of the wide range of ecosystems: deserts, savannahs, forests, big rivers and flood- plains, mountains, mangroves and seas. Despite greatly reduced wildlife populations, the region still has a high conservation value 2 because of the following: \u2022 large antelopes which can be considered among the most beautiful in Africa, such as the giant eland, roan antelope, major (or western) hartebeest, addax, and also some spec- tacular small antelopes such as zebra duiker and Jentink\u2019s duiker, including a newly discovered (2009) species of duiker ( Philantomba walteri ); \u2022 extensive and important terrestrial ecosystems, including the cross-border WAPOK complex of parks (W, Arly, Pendjari, Oti Monduri, Keran and hunting reserves of about 38 000 km\u00b2) that host the largest elephant population in the region (with 20 to 60 elephants per 100 km\u00b2) 3 ; \u2022 many endemic and isolated populations of wildlife \u2013 giraffe ( G. c. peralta ), pygmy hippopotamus, manatee, lion, cheetah and African wild dog; \u2022 populations of two subspecies of chimpanzee and one highly threatened subspecies of gorilla; \u2022 very important area for migrating birds from Europe, both waterbirds and landbirds 4 ; \u2022 inland waters supporting a high diversity of aquatic species with high levels of endemism; \u2022 unique and critical habitat for the conservation of amphibians (e.g. Mount Nimba), which are the most endangered class of animals in the world.

Due to the geopolitical area limitation, the biomes and some ecore- gions of West Africa also fall in other regions of Africa. The major ecological zones (or ecotypes) of West Africa are (see Table 2 and Figure 4): \u2022 A \u2013 Deserts (Realm: Palearctic; Biome: Deserts and xeric shrubland). The ecotypes of the desert area are: (D1) Sahara Desert; (D2) Atlantic coast; (D3 and D4) south Saharan steppe and woodlands; (D5) west Saharan montane xeric woodlands; and Senegal Delta. \u2022 B \u2013 Savannahs (Realm: Afrotropics; Biome: Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannahs and shrublands). The ecotypes of the savannah area are: (S1) Sahelian acacia savannah; (S2) west Sudanian savannah; (S3) Guinean forest- savannah mosaic; (S4) Jos Plateau forest-grassland mosaic; and Inner Niger Delta, Lake Chad Basin and Hadeja-Nguru. \u2022 C \u2013 Forests (Realm: Afrotropics; Biome: Tropical and sub tropical moist broadleaf forests. The ecotypes of the forest area are: (F1) Guinean Montane Forests; (F2) west- ern Guinean lowland forests; (F3); eastern Guinean forests; (F4) Nigerian lowland forests; (F5) Cameroonian Highlands forests; (F6) Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests; (F7) Niger Delta swamp forests; (F8) Cross-Niger transition forests. \u2022 D \u2013 Mangroves/coastal (Realm: Afrotropics; Biome: Mangrove) . The ecotypes of the mangrove area are: (M1) Guinean mangroves and (M2) Central African mangroves. 1.2.2 Conservation issues and challenges (key and threatened, rare and high-value species) 1.2.2.1 Elephant West Africa has lost more than 90 % of its elephant population in the 20th century. There is little reliable data on the numbers of elephants in West Africa but estimates indicate that elephant populations are small and isolated. Nearly two-thirds of them consist of little more than 100 elephants, with the exception of one population in the WAPOK complex, which has a density of 0.58 elephant/km\u00b2 (CR 28 %) 5 . 1.2.2.2 Sahelo-Saharan antelope These vast arid lands contain relatively few antelope, but those that are here are highly charismatic and emblematic of the spe- cies. As a result of the successive droughts during the 1980s and increasing human pressures, the Sahelo-Saharan antelopes are seriously threatened (addax, Dama gazelle and Darcas gazelle) or even probably extinct (oryx). The desert antelopes survive essentially through ex situ conservation but their genetic heritage must be improved to ensure the survival of these species. In the future there should be carefully planned reintroductions, adapted to the specific needs of these highly mobile species, into an effec- tively managed network of protected areas. 1.2.2.3 Primates Logging is considered to be one of the most serious threats to biodiversity and particularly to great apes. In recent years in Africa, this view is more nuanced in the case of responsible sus- tainable logging, in particular in Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified concessions, where specific ecological and social requirements are imposed, and the ban on hunting of primates and especially great apes is strictly enforced. This is not the case in West Africa. In West Africa an estimated 80 % of the region\u2019s original forest cover was gone by the 1980s, affecting not only the habitats of great apes but also the rainfall; during the last three decades, precipitation has diminished in West Africa even faster than it has in the drier regions of the Sahel 6; 7 . In West Africa, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List gives the following primates as critically endangered: Niger Delta red colobus, Preuss\u2019s red colobus and Cross River gorilla. The endangered primates (IUCN Red List) are white-naped mangabey, drill, Preuss\u2019s guenon, Roloway monkey, Benin sub- species of red-bellied guenon, Badius species of red colobus and Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee.

With climate change and the increasing frequency of droughts in West Africa, a number of water-dependent species, such as manatees and crocodiles, will come under increasing threat. ( 8 ) The lion in West Africa is critically endangered. See Panthera\u2019s Lion Program Survey, Dr Philipp Henschel, PLOS ONE, 2014. ( 9 ) Di Silvestre I. (2002). Lion (Panthera leo) in: Suivi de la population des grands carnivores de la R\u00e9serve de la Biosph\u00e8re de la Pendjari. 1.2.2.4 Carnivores West African lions have unique genetic sequences not found in any other lions, including those held in zoos or other form of captivity. Recent surveys (January 2014) have suggested that the African lion population is facing extinction across the entire West African region 8 . The results represent a massive survey effort taking six years and covering 11 countries where lions were pre- sumed to exist in the last two decades. The team discovered that West African lions now survive in only three national parks and in the transfrontier W, Arly and Pendjari National Parks or WAP complex. The PAs with lion are only in five countries of West Africa: Senegal, Nigeria, Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso. Counting lions is extremely difficult, and we may never know precisely how many lions there are in West Africa, especially if, as the few specialists suggest, we could find lions outside the PAs. In West Africa, the primary threats to lions are the loss, degradation and fragmentation of lion habitats; the decline of the lion\u2019s wild prey base; and human-lion conflict. The lion is the principal predator of domestic cattle, so livestock loss combined with poor capacity for managing human-lion conflict lead to the elimination of lions, particularly by poisoning 9 . Trophy hunting is only practiced in three lion conservation units. A West and Central Africa regional conservation strategy for chee- tah and African wild dog is being drafted. The Saharan cheetah (listed as critically endangered since 2009 on the IUCN Red List) is very rare but can still be found in small numbers in Algeria (Ahaggar and Tassili N\u2019Ajjer) and Niger (Termit and A\u00efr), and pos- sibly also in Mali, Chad and Mauritania. In the south, cheetahs are known to occur in the W Transborder Park and the Arly Pen- djari PAs. Although a persecuted species, this large carnivore is probably scarce by nature and also impacted by the effects of periodic droughts on its prey species. African wild dogs have disappeared from much of their former range in West Africa where they were present in all regions, from deserts to mountain summits, with the exclusion of the lowland rainforest and the driest deserts. The species is virtually eradicated from West Africa, and survives only in Bafing-Niokolo Koba areas. In West Africa, leopards remain widespread, albeit now patchily distributed within the region. The most marked range loss in West Africa has been in the Sahel belt, as well as in Nigeria. They have been locally extirpated from densely populated areas or where habitat conversion is extreme. There are no reliable conti- nent-wide estimates of population size, but it is supposed that in the northern part of the West African savannah-forests there is a low density with less than 1 000 individuals, and in the southern part of the savannah-forests there is a medium density with between 1 000 and 10 000 individuals. 1.2.2.5 Other rare and threatened species The Guinea forest in West Africa contains half the mammal species on the African continent. Other important regional biodiversity val- ues must be mentioned, including the West African manatee, the rare pygmy hippopotamus, the zebra duiker and the drill, etc. In view of climate change and the increasing frequency of droughts in West Africa, the number of water-dependent species, such as manatees and crocodiles, will come under increasing threat. 1.2.2.6 Birds West Africa plays a fundamental role for Afro-Palearctic (Europe- an-African) long-distance migratory birds that use the Palearctic Western route from Western Europe through Spain across the Straits of Gibraltar. The ecological networks of habitats play a decisive role for migratory birds because they provide key sites along migration routes where birds can recover from their strenuous journeys. Many migratory birds have little choice in the selection of suitable areas to use. They need access to specific sites located along their ",
        "302 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 West Africa migration routes. If one of these important sites is damaged or destroyed, it usually means disaster for the birds that depend on that area. So it is vital for West Africa to preserve a functional network of habitats, especially the several wetlands in the Sahe- lian zone, such as the Niger and Senegal rivers, the inner Niger delta (30 000 km\u00b2 situated in the middle of the Sahelian land- scape), the Hadejia Jamare Komadogu Yobe Basin and the flood- plains in Senegal and Niger, which are very important for millions of migratory birds. 1.2.2.7 Aquatic species in inland waters The inland waters of West Africa support a high diversity of aquatic species with high levels of endemism. Many of these species provide direct (e.g. fisheries) and indirect (e.g. water puri- fication) benefits to people. More than 14 % of species across the region are currently threatened and future levels of threat are expected to rise significantly due to a growing population and the corresponding demand on natural resources. The West African region supports a significant proportion of the world\u2019s species that are dependent upon freshwater wetland habitats. Given that the region represents approximately 5 % of total global land mass (excluding Antarctica), it is apparent that many groups \u2013 water- birds, plants and mammals in particular \u2013 are well represented within the region. Of the 1 435 species assessed here at the regional scale, just over 14 % are regionally threatened. Table 3.

These include the extraction of trees for charcoal making, general timber and high-value woods. Most affected of the high- value woods are: \u2022 Afromosia or African teak ( Pericopsis elata ) \u2013 endangered or critically endangered, with levels of exploitation that have been unsustainable in all countries and the species\u2019 habitat has declined, especially in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire 10 , Ghana and Nigeria; \u2022 the Meliacaea family ( Khaya species ); \u2022 V\u00e8ne ( Pterocarpus erinaceus ); \u2022 African blackwood ( Dalbergia melanoxylon ). 1.2.2.9 Final note This strategic approach document cannot analyse all the bio- diversity aspects of the West African region. Consequently, we used the information from several sources already organised as macro-indicators and indicators or as aggregated data to examine the trends in the conservation status of key species. The analysis was complex because of the difficulties of obtaining updated and structured data. The results of the exercise should be considered only as indicative of trends in conservation status based on infor- mation currently available (see Table 3 and Figure 5). Figure 5.

The WAEMU is more operational than the ECOWAS and acts more directly on the harmonisation of policies and interventions in the areas of agriculture, forestry and con- servation. The WAEMU may occur throughout the West African region at the request of countries; institutions use this possibility for moving forward on convergence plans (strategic plans) on management of wildlife and forest resources. This approach could help if orientated towards the definition of a common regional conservation strategy. 1.3.2 Conservation capacity building in West Africa This analysis considers the available institutional capacities and the present and future management needs of protected areas in West Africa 11 . The IUCN training-needs study for West and Central Africa highlights current inadequacies. In particular it concludes that training institutions in West and Central Africa do not provide skills for improving management effectiveness of PAs, do not provide an adequate knowledge base and practical tools for PA management, and do not adequately address the needs of bio- diversity conservation. The study identifies the most important training needs and the institutions that offer courses on the sub- ject, but does not address the training requirements for rangers in terms of protection and interactions with resource-users in the buffer zones. We recommend that capacity building for PA man- agement effectiveness is enhanced by integrating West African and Central African training institutions. In West Africa there are currently two training schemes supported by IUCN that are implemented in collaboration with the University of Senghor in Egypt: \u2022 a training in protected area management for university-level graduates (eight weeks training in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; \u2022 a Masters in Development, specialising in the management of protected areas (two years in Alexandria, Egypt). In Central Africa, the formal training options are: \u2022 a Masters, with an option in PA management, at the \u00c9cole nationale des eaux et for\u00eats (ENEF) in Cape Esterias, Gabon; \u2022 a training L-M-D with the \u00c9cole r\u00e9gionale d\u2019am\u00e9nagement int\u00e9gr\u00e9 des for\u00eats et territoires tropicaux (ERAIFT) in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; \u2022 a three-year professional certificate to be developed at the \u00c9cole de faune de Garoua (EFG) in Cameroon. Further analysis is required of existing activities in capacity build- ing; also the new skills required by PA managers and rangers are still to be identified. The recipients of capacity building should be: \u2022 the departments of wildlife and protected areas; \u2022 the parastatal agencies responsible for PA management, e.g. the Centre national de gestion des r\u00e9serves de faune (CENAGREF) in Benin or the Office national des aires pro- t\u00e9g\u00e9es (OFINAP) in Burkina Faso; \u2022 PA managers and rangers; \u2022 the national and international conservation and development NGOs; \u2022 the local administrations and communities as part of the imple- mentation of decentralised natural resource management policies; \u2022 the private sector (companies related to the sectors of forest, ecotourism and safari hunting). Finally, if the future PA management and governance training requirements are to be adequately covered in West and Central Africa, the type of training offered by regional institutions must evolve in line with modern conservation approaches. The capac- ities of the institutions to dispense this training must be greatly strengthened. In addition a selected number of PAs where ranger training can be given must be identified, and long-term financial and technical partnerships built to ensure uninterrupted, high-quality training opportunities.

Thus direct threats are synonymous with sources of stress and proximate pressures. The principal direct threats to the survival of wildlife in the various ecosystems of West Africa are loss of habitat for wildlife and unsustain- able hunting by humans. West Africa still has one of the highest annual population growth rates of any region on the continent (or in the world), estimated at about 2.6 % in 2012 12 . Economic development (and particularly the growth of commercial agriculture and extractive industries) has accelerated in forest-zone countries as several civil conflicts have subsided. West Africa currently has the fastest rate of GDP growth on the continent, predicted at 6.8 % in 2013 and 7.4 % in 2014 13 . These drivers are reinforced by the tendency of all human beings (not just those in West Africa) to give priority to their short-term self-interests, and to consume resources beyond their immediate survival needs. In the forest zone of West Africa, the area of relatively undis- turbed high-canopy rain forest has been steadily declin- ing over the last 100 years . Outside the few national parks that protect rainforests and some forest reserves, the rate of forest loss may recently have accelerated. Good data is lacking for many countries in the region, but the estimated annual percentage forest loss in Nigeria in 2000-2010 was the highest in the world, at 3.7 % 14 . Forest is being lost to subsistence agriculture, the expan- sion of industrial-scale plantations of oil palm and other crops (including \u2018land grabs\u2019 that involve foreign companies), timber and fuelwood harvesting, mining operations, road and dam construc- tion, and the spread of settlements. In other words, West Africa today is being affected by the same kinds of development that long ago destroyed the original forest cover of much of Europe, the United States of America and large areas of East Asia. It is difficult to single out one of these threats as more significant than another \u2013 and they vary in extent from country to country \u2013 but farming and plantation agriculture are probably causing greater forest loss than any other activities . Hunting of wild animals for meat has been a major factor in the decline of larger mammals in West Africa for a very long time, probably related in significant part to high human population den- sity and long-established trade networks. Hunting for subsistence has always been important, but as human populations have contin- ued to grow and urbanisation increases, hunting has become increas- ingly commercialised, and supports an important \u2018bushmeat trade\u2019. The bushmeat trade is pushing some mammal species ( and rain-forest primates especially ) towards extinction , in part because their populations have often been reduced to small, highly vulnerable isolates by loss of habitat 15 . Mammal species of the West African forest zone rated as critically endangered (CR) or endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List are: Cephalophus jentinki (Jentink\u2019s duiker, EN); Choeropsis liberiensis (pygmy hippopotamus, EN); Gorilla gorilla (gorilla, CR \u2013 only in Nigeria in West African); Mandrillus leucophaeus (drill, EN \u2013 only in Nigeria in West Africa); Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee, EN); Procolobus badius (West African red colobus, EN); Procolobus preussi (Preuss\u2019s red colobus, CR \u2013 only in Nigeria in West Africa). Several subspecies are also rated as CR or EN, and many species and subspecies (including the African elephant) are listed as \u2018vulnerable\u2019. There are only a few areas within the West African forest zone where all wildlife is fully protected by law. From Guinea to the Nigeria-Cameroon border there are only 11 national parks distributed across eight countries in the forest zone , together with a handful of wildlife or game sanctuaries. Most of the national parks are small (less than 50 000 ha in area) and therefore not of maximum value for the long-term protection of viable populations of large mammals. Liberia, which lies at the heart of the Upper Guinea forest region, and which is clearly a biodiversity hotspot, has only a single national park, Sapo. Even within the few national parks, management is generally weak and hunting for bushmeat often rife. ( 12 ) African Development Bank Group 2012. Africa\u2019s Demographic Trends.

        "| 309 #4 Conservation issues and challenges 2.1.1 Availability of funds for PAs Analysis Funding is a critical limiting factor for all the PAs in West Africa. International and domestic funding for PAs have struggled to keep pace with the growth in the number and area of PAs and the eco- nomic crisis. Governments have progressively reduced funding due to the negative economic trend in the region that began in 1960, with the most difficult times in the 1990s. Despite the current economic recovery in West Africa, and the endorsement of inter- national environmental treaties and the commitments for the cre- ation of more protected areas, government funding for PAs is still very low. On an area basis of just USD 150/km\u00b2/year, only a few European Union (EU) projects of PAs in West Africa spend close to this target (about USD 120-140/km\u00b2/year), while private funding for game reserves in West Africa is far less, although the size of this contribution is unclear. In conclusion, the current spending on PAs is grossly inadequate, not only to support the costs of existing sites, but also to ensure the creation and effective management of a representative regional system of PAs. The existing low level of financial support for biodiversity in West Africa is mirrored by a low capacity level in the management of PAs. It is extremely rare to find examples of effective wildlife man- agement in the region. The funds invested in conservation provide only weak and very short-term effects without long-term sustain- ability outcomes. This funding gap has historical reasons arising from the way that institutions were established. Whereas institu- tions providing capacity building in forest management and strong forestry bodies in the countries were developed, the same process was not implemented for wildlife management. The lack of capacity to manage wildlife has led to a general underestimation of the value of wildlife within government. The final result was the devel- opment of an operating strategy for natural resources that did not incorporate an improved management of wildlife. This situation stands in marked contrast with that in Eastern and Southern Africa. High population growth, political instability and unfavourable nat- ural processes (desertification and fragility to climate change) have contributed to the reduction of protected areas as they become utilised for agricultural and pastoral uses. Investments in wildlife conservation in West Africa must be orien- tated in a variety of activities: building PA management capacity, protecting endangered species, improving communication about the values of biodiversity, improving the monitoring of biodiversity, and tackling corruption and illegal trafficking. The only hope for West African biodiversity is to restore the fundamentals of conser- vation and to bring about sustainability in the uses of natural resources. Effects Under-resourcing is the most important constraint acting on man- agement effectiveness. The PAs of West Africa do not have enough staff, resources, equipment and infrastructure to ensure the control of conservation areas (including anti-poaching meas- ures and bio-monitoring) and to develop community-based sup- porting activities in the buffer zones. This results in degradation and encroachment of the PAs, which can ultimately lead to their degazettement. \u2303 Drills at the Pandrillus Sanctuary, Nigeria.

        "| 311 #4 Conservation issues and challenges 2.1.2 Institutional governance of PAs Analysis In most West African countries, the state is the owner of the land and of the natural resources. In the past, governments established numerous and large protected areas, and classified forests and game reserves. To manage the various conservation aspects, the governments created centralised institutions for forestry, parks or wildlife and more recently for the environment. Effects The indirect drivers such as population growth, increased poverty, government budget reductions, increased democratisation and decentralisation, and sectorial approaches render ineffective many aspects of direct centralised management of wildlife and protected areas by the state. Also their institutions are ill adapted to cope with rapid structural changes in the countries. Protected area agen- cies are seen by West African governments as a relatively low priority, and until now tend to be too centralised. Their staff struc- tures are often out of date, staff training is inadequate, and their enabling legislation is too restrictive. 2.1.3 Illegal wildlife trade income and corruption Analysis Given the decline in the purchasing power of salaries over the past 30 years and the increased incomes possible from illegal wildlife trade, corruption has spread and it is growing at all levels with the involvement of populations, local and central government bodies, including forest rangers and officers, police, army and justice. The increasing importance of the West African coast as a key transit hub for drugs is another potential danger for the illegal wildlife trade. Poaching levels of elephant in West Africa have increased since 2006 but not as rapidly as in other regions. However in West Africa, the rise in poaching is particularly worrying because the small fragmented populations could disappear completely. In the WAPOK complex however, the population is estimated at nearly 8 000 indi- viduals 16 , which is more robust although 150 elephant were lost in 2013 (Box 1). The issue of bushmeat hunting is highly politicised and the com- mercial circuits are well organised to supply the urban areas where it is consumed. The high rate of bushmeat harvest, combined with habitat loss and alteration, has led to very severe population declines. It has already resulted in widespread local extinctions throughout the Upper Guinea Forest Ecosystem of West Africa. The forests and savannahs with no large animals are known as the \u2018empty forest\u2019 or \u2018savannah syndrome\u2019. The large and small antelopes of West Africa can be considered amongst the most beautiful in the continent (including giant eland, roan antelope, major hartebeest and zebra duiker) but they are targets for black-market traders who will smuggle live animals into wealthy countries, including other African countries such as South Africa. \u2303 Pangolin and cane rats on a market stall in Lagos, Nigeria (left) and an African palm civet for sale in a village in Cross River state, Nigeria (right).

Importance of WAPOK The WAPOK complex is a large area of about 38 000 km 2 of intact habitat that is of great importance to the survival of large mammals in West Africa, including many that are endangered. These different blocks constitute the largest remaining wilderness and the only functional ecological complex in West Africa. This large landscape of contiguous conservation areas is located at the borders with Burkina Faso, Benin, Niger and Togo. The landscape encompasses one transborder park (W), two national parks (Pendjari and Keran), two more important faunal reserves (Arly and Oti Monduri), one giraffe area not classified, ten hunting concessions and many adjacent village hunting zones. The complex is situated in a transition zone between savannah and forest lands. The site reflects the interaction between natural resources and humans since Neolithic times and illustrates the evolution of biodiversity in this zone. The park is known for its large mammals: lion, cheetah, leopard, giraffe, buffalo, roan, hartebeest, manatee, baboon and hippopotamus. In West Africa, this complex provides a home for the largest, and in a few cases the last, populations of lion, elephant, cheetah, manatee and giraffe. The WAPOK area is also known for its bird populations, especially transitory migrating species, with over 350 species identified in the complex. The PAs in the complex are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites (W in Niger and Pendjari in Benin \u2013 requested), all as Man and the Biosphere Programmes (MAB/UNESCO), many of them as Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar) and as BirdLife International Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs). The area is largely uninhabited by humans, having been (until the 1970s) a malarial and tsetse zone comprising wetlands formed by the delta of the Mekrou River with the Niger. Historically, the area was at one time a major area of human habitation, judging by the important archaeological sites found in the area (mostly tombs and furnaces) (see the analysis of the ECOPAS project* ). It is quite possible that the Iron Age in the savannah areas of West Africa started in the W transborder park. The \u2018W\u2019 National Park was so named because of the local configuration of the Niger River and was the first MAB transborder regional park to be classified in Africa. Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger have implemented an inter-state cooperation agreement, based on the ecological complex of adjacent protected areas with national parks, wildlife reserves and hunting zones forming a large regional complex (called WAP from the names of the major PAs of each country: Regional Park W, Arly Faunal Reserve and Pendjari NP). After several years of intervention, under the supervision of the WAEMU and the support of EU and German funds, there was an improvement in the status of the natural ecosystems. Given the success of the conservation intervention in the WAP complex, Togo, in the years 2006-2009, proposed to join the initiative with the adjacent PAs Oti-Mandouri and Keran, so the complex has been enlarged and has now become WAPOK (this name comes from the names of the most important PAs of the four neighbouring countries). At present, the situation in the WAPOK complex is at risk of degrading with increasing pressures from elephant poaching, mining, increasing poverty in rural and urban areas and desertification. Conservation interventions should be based on a participatory approach involving the political and technical representatives at central and decentralised levels, traditional authorities, users, people, private sector, NGOs, national and international institutions, and the civil society.

At least 12 West African countries are known to be acting as transit points for illegal ivory destined for Asia. According to the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) Nigeria and Togo are the major exit points for ivory, much of it coming from Central Africa and Eastern Africa. Effects Poaching in the small and highly fragmented elephant populations of West Africa is high, and increasing throughout the region. Ivory trafficking through Nigeria is the major illegal wildlife trade in West Africa. Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) statistics 17 indi- cate that Nigeria and Togo are the major exit points but ten other countries are also involved, as source countries for export, transit countries or countries with significant domestic markets. Nigeria is the country with the largest flows of illicit ivory but more recently other countries such as Togo have become involved in large-scale smuggling of ivory. Most of this ivory appears to originate in Central Africa, but Nigeria was also identified as the destination of major shipments of ivory from Kenya, suggesting that ivory from as far away as Eastern Africa may now be moving through this country. The increasing involvement of Chinese buyers in Nigeria, as well as the involvement of organised crime syndicates in the illegal wildlife trade and in deforestation for cannabis cultivation, means that Nigeria is playing an increasingly important role in biodiversity loss in West Africa. One favourable factor is that bushmeat is no longer the most important source of protein in the region because the wildlife populations have been so depleted by years of unsustainable hunting for meat. Furthermore, analyses in Ghana indicate that among cocoa farmers, the value of harvested bushmeat is rela- tively low and contributes little to household production. Rodents have replaced ungulates and primates as the most commonly eaten wild animals. The illegal live mammals\u2019 trade is concentred in Togo. The country acts as a hub for the transit of large and small West African ante- lopes destined for hunting reserves in other African countries and even outside of Africa (see the officially sanctioned captures of giant eland in Niokola-Koba National Park for export) 18 . A small illegal wildlife trade in ivory trinkets, birds and live small animals occurs along the coasts from Nigeria to Mauritania. 2.1.4 Weak planning, management effectiveness and monitoring of PAs The analyses of the illegal wildlife trade (above) have some com- mon and specific aspects. First, some possible common solutions are presented here. Analysis The quality of PA management effectiveness in West Africa is poor, and in some cases very poor. The IUCN management assess- ments conducted in the PAs of West Africa scored far less than PAs in other African regions. To put this in a wider context, the overall mean for the assessment of African PAs is well below the world mean. Effects PAs in West Africa are managed with insufficient knowledge of the biodiversity values, trends and threats arising from direct and indirect causes. There is a lack of planning, monitoring, adaptive management and proactivity. Inadequate resources and weak capacities to implement the management processes lead to the ( 17 ) UNEP, CITES, IUCN, TRAFFIC (2013). Elephants in the Dust \u2013 The African Elephant Crisis.

At present, the WAPOK complex, com- posed of PAs and hunting reserves covering more than 38 000 km\u00b2, is the only functional and stable ecological complex, despite the high threats that it faces. Major parks and reserves in West Africa are highly degraded, but even so a few can still be recovered. Specific projects are needed to preserve important or endemic species. In a few degraded protected areas, the administration still provides an institutional presence in the hope of a possible recovery of the area at some later date. The general tendency, however, is to reduce the conservation areas because of lack of funds and the capacities to manage them. Possible global solutions to direct threats As planning, management and monitoring are closely linked, inte- grated solutions must be found. The authors recommend the fol- lowing general solutions: \u2022 improving information to build a more effective monitoring and decision-support system in order to facilitate (i) legiti- macy, accountability and fairness in park management, and (ii) adaptive management and proactivity; \u2022 emphasising the role of stakeholders and rights-holders, local, national and international NGOs, private sector and other non-traditional partners with a view to improving manage- ment effectiveness over a broader landscape which includes the PAs and buffer zones; \u2022 strengthening institutional capacities (and providing training opportunities) to govern management frameworks and for multi-scale management of protected areas at local, national and regional levels; \u2022 integrating \u2018species-based\u2019 and \u2018habitat-based\u2019 approaches; \u2022 protecting the original ecosystem is generally less costly than ecosystem restoration; \u2022 integrating in situ and ex situ conservation of genetic diversity, which can serve the needs of restoring ecosystems and PAs. 2.2 Key indirect threats to conservation Indirect threats to conservation have been defined as the ultimate factors, usually social, economic, political, institutional or cultural, that enable or otherwise add to the occurrence or persistence of proximate direct threats 19 . Halting biodiversity loss (or reducing it to a minimal level) requires tackling the combined effect of human activities. The indirect drivers of biodiversity loss are related to economic, demographic, socio-political, cultural and technological factors. Also, indirect drivers affect biodiversity loss differently from direct drivers. Charismatic mega-fauna, such as elephant, benefit from intense conservation efforts and research when subject to direct or indi- rect threats to their conservation. By contrast, many endangered species of antelopes, amphibians, insects and plants are affected by indirect drivers but fail to draw the same amount of attention as the charismatic mega-fauna. The solutions are global and are listed at the end of this section. 2.2.1 Population growth and poverty Analysis In West Africa, population growth is between 2.5 % and 3.5 % per annum and this is resulting in increasing levels of poverty over an ever-enlarging area. The effect is greater than any of the other African regions and is placing enormous pressure on the capacity of the environment to provide services for human well-being (see Figure 8). Effects As the demand for resources increases, all the protected areas in West Africa face pressure from grazing and cultivation, the harvesting of wood, meat, fish, water and medicinal plants. In Burkina Faso, the populations in the buffer areas of some parks and reserves draw 33 % of their basic needs from the natural resources of the PAs. 2.2.2 Fragmentation, reduction and isolation of protected areas in the landscape Analysis As land outside protected areas is exploited more and more inten- sively in WA, the increasing isolation of protected areas in the landscape poses a serious threat to the long-term viability of many wildlife populations. Effects The primary effects of isolation of protected areas are: \u2022 habitat loss (pastoral and forested lands converted to agriculture); \u2022 disturbance from human infrastructures (wildlife abundance increases with distance from human settlements); \u2022 overhunting (widespread along protected area boundaries); \u2022 disease (transmission from livestock, domestic animals and humans). \u2018Europe-like\u2019 intensification of large-scale, mechanised agriculture is rapidly spreading and forms perhaps the single biggest threat to many species such as migratory landbirds, to local livelihoods and to climate resilience. The savannah agroforestry mosaic, with long fallow cycles, provides a rich array of climate-coping mech- anisms as well as habitat, yet this is the very landscape that is disappearing.

Effects Breakdowns in law and order generally have devastating effects on PAs, as recently seen in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Protected areas and their natural resources become targets for everyone: populations for land, grazing, wood, bushmeat, etc.; illegal traders who target the most precious woods and wildlife; armies who use wildlife and natural resources as sources of money and food; rebels and reli- gious fundamentalist movements who use PAs as places of ref- uge and sources of funding. Protected areas in West Africa have, and are still suffering greatly from these effects. However in cases where there are decentralised systems, and where NGOs and community groups are involved, the PA management and governance have proved better able to partially save conservation areas (e.g. Sapo National Park in Liberia, where the local commu- nity is involved in the park\u2019s management). 2.2.4 Negative economic trends Analysis Between 1960 and 2002, declining national economies and steady population growth in West Africa meant that the combined effect of servicing international debts and providing education and health care for the burgeoning populations resulted in a reduction of fund- ing for protected areas. Poverty has led to increasing levels of poaching and illegal activities in the PAs, and the prolonged political crisis in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is also threatening the economic recovery in West Africa. The peaceful solution to the crisis in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire brought some relief, but higher international oil and food prices have now started to cause inflation. Effects The situation for PAs has remained unchanged. PA staff are poorly paid and equipped, materials and equipment are totally inade- quate, and infrastructure is poorly maintained. Illegal grazing, woodcutting, agriculture and poaching in PAs continue, sometimes with the complicity of the PA rangers. 2.2.5 Policy and sectorial approach Analysis Investment in the primary sectors like agriculture (e.g. cotton), pastoralism (e.g. transhumance grazing systems), forestry (e.g. logging concessions or firewood provision), wildlife conservation (e.g. new PAs) or in sectors such as mining operations or energy infrastructure all affect the socio-economics of the region, raising a range of political, administrative, economic, industrial, environ- mental, infrastructural and energy issues. As elsewhere in Africa, the West African countries, with the support of donors and private funds, implement their policies, strategies and projects with a sectorial approach without the inter-sectorial coordination and collaboration that is essential to ensure the mainstreaming of natural resource conservation and management issues. Effects Governments and populations continue to regard PAs as unpro- ductive areas to be exploited on a short time base (unsustainable exploitation) rather than as important economic and spatial ele- ments of the landscape. Consequently pressures on PAs are increasing and resulting in biodiversity loss and the degradation of many ecosystem services. \u2303 Destabilizing effects of political instability, civil unrest, armed conflict, religious fundamentalism and epidemics such as Ebola (above) severely weaken natural resource governance.

        "| 317 #4 Conservation issues and challenges Possible global solutions to indirect drivers People make decisions concerning biodiversity based on a range of values related to their well-being, including the use and non- use values of biodiversity and ecosystems. The well-being of local people must dominate many responses, including those relating to protected areas, governance and wildlife management. Responses to indirect drivers with a primary goal of conservation could be the following: \u2022 manage protected areas for a wide range of sustainable uses (as is found in IUCN category VI PAs). This is extremely impor- tant where, as in West Africa, biodiversity loss is sensitive to changes in key drivers; \u2022 design and manage PA systems in the context of an ecosys- tem approach, with due regard to the importance of corridors and interconnectivity of PAs, if possible; \u2022 mainstream natural resource conservation and ecosystem services in all the primary sectors such as agriculture, pasto- ralism, forestry, fisheries, mining and in energy. Approaches should be explored to promote greater use of environmental safeguards that seek to minimise ecological and social prob- lems arising from development projects. These include the International Finance Corporation\u2019s (of the World Bank) Per- formance Standards and the African Development Bank\u2019s Integrated Safeguards System 20 ; \u2022 adopt inter-sectorial coordination and collaboration to ensure the mainstreaming of biodiversity conservation and manage- ment issues; \u2022 capture the benefits and reduce the costs of wildlife for local communities, especially the local opportunity costs in line with the principle of equitable sharing; \u2022 increase transparency and accountability of government and private-sector through involvement of concerned stakehold- ers and rights-holders in decision-making on biodiversity; \u2022 increase coordination among multilateral environmental agree- ments and between environmental agreements and other international economic and social institutions; \u2022 raise the level of public awareness, information-communication and education. \u2303 Conservation and natural history lesson in a school in Kanare, Niger.

In terms of percentage of the allocation of these funds, Nigeria and Ghana received more than 15 %, whilst the smaller countries (Gambia, Guinea-Bissau), the less secure countries (Sierra Leone) and the countries of the desert ecotype received about 1-3 % of the funds. Funding for transborder protected areas was about 10 % of the total. The regional programmes on conservation used about 12 % of the available funds. The analysis can also be extended to each major ecotype. 3.1 Deserts International NGOs have long been involved in arid land conser- vation through reserve management, genetic research, wildlife monitoring, wildlife veterinary work, captive breeding and rein- troductions, and tourism development (e.g. Zoological Society of London, Sahara Conservation Fund). Currently conservation in the desert ecosystem is focused on Termit & Tin Toumma (Niger). In the Atlantic coastal desert there are Important Bird Areas (IBAs), such as Banc d\u2019Arguin National Park (NP) and Diawling NP (Mauritania), and Djoudj NP (Senegal). 3.2 Savannahs Savannah PAs have received significant support, particularly from the EU. Today the effort is focused on the WAPOK complex (W, Arly, Pendjari, Oti Monduri, Keran in Benin, Burkina Faso, Niger and Togo). Other PAs receiving lower and more irregular levels of support are Como\u00e9 (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire), Mole (Ghana), Niokolo Koba NP (Senegal), Gourma Elephant FR (Mali), the Sahel Wildlife Reserve (Burkina Faso) and the Volta Transboundary Ecosystem Wildlife Corridors (Burkina Faso and Ghana). 3.3 Forests There have been numerous projects in support of rainforest PAs but only a few of these areas still retain their biological value. Where the administration alone is responsible for management, the PAs are effectively \u2018paper parks\u2019. PAs with important biological values are: Gola Forest Reserve and Loma Mountains (Sierra Leone), Sapo (Liberia), Tai (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire), Cross River (Nigeria), and Ankasa and Bia conservation areas (Ghana). There are inter- esting possibilities for a landscape approach in which the PA is at the core of wider sustainable land uses. The particular land- scape approach could be adjusted according to a wide range of conditions and land-use practices, from strict protection to inten- sive development. The communities surrounding PAs could benefit from forest and biodiversity resources and services whilst con- tributing to their conservation. At the same time, well-managed commercial forest blocks con- tribute to the protection of PAs and biodiversity. The landscape approach is, therefore, a wider mosaic of land uses where the protected areas form part of the overall socio-economic network: human settlements, agricultural areas, and forested and non- forested areas. Interesting possibilities for a landscape approach are: Gola Forest Reserve (Sierra Leone) and the Lofa and Foya Forest Reserves (Liberia); Mount Nimba and East Nimba nature preserves (Guinea, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Liberia); Outamba-Kilimi National Park (Sierra Leone); and Madina Oula, Soy and Oure Kaba sub-prefectures (Guinea). It is important to underline that there are still important forest blocks that could complement the overall biodiversity of this ecotype but these do not have protected area status. Granting this added protection should be a priority. >3 _ Ongoing conservation efforts ",
        "#4 | 321 Ongoing conservation efforts 3.4 Mangroves/coastal There are few PAs in the mangrove forests. The Niger Delta, the most important area of mangrove forest in Africa, and the third most important in the world, does not have a protected area. In West Africa, the most important example of mangrove conser- vation is the public-private partnership (PPP) for conservation, management and sustainable use of mangrove forests in Guinea- Bissau (Orango NP, Tarafes Cacheu NP and Rio Cacheu Mangrove, Lagoas de Cufada, Rio Grande de Buba, Cufada, and Cantanhez Forest). In Guinea-Bissau, the intervention enabled six new conser- vation areas to be created \u2013 a rare success story in the conservation of this important ecosystem. In the other countries, actions on mangroves are basically shared between the administration, communities and NGOs, as with Songor Lagoon and Keta Lagoon Ramsar site (Ghana) and Niumi National Park (Gambia). Other coastal conservation actions target Important Bird Areas: the Banc d\u2019Arguin NP and the Diawling NP (Mauritania), the Saloum Delta NP and the Lower Casamance NP (Senegal). The remaining blocks of mangrove forests constitute an opportunity for the estab- lishment of new conservation areas. This action should also be a priority. 3.5 Conclusion In conclusion, biodiversity conservation in West Africa is charac- terised by: \u2022 low funding for desert PAs but with the benefit of strong involvement by NGOs; \u2022 an almost constant level of support going to the protected savannah areas; \u2022 low funding for rain forest protected areas with mixed inter- ventions of government and NGOs; \u2022 a small-scale success story for the recovery of mangrove forests through a PPP. \u2303 Fishermen in the Canchungo mangroves of Guinea-Bissau. There are very few protected areas in mangroves in West Africa, and none at all in the Niger Delta, the most important area of mangrove forest in Africa. Mangroves forests are extremely productive ecosystems that provide many vital goods and services including fisheries and coastal protection. ",

The phenom- enon is further amplified by the absence of a culture and tradition in PA management, and the lack of education and training in wildlife and protected area management. \u2022 The futility over the long-term of short-term investments in conservation in countries where indirect threats to natural resources and biodiversity are high. \u2022 The severe drought cycles linked to climate change have led to the spread of pastoralism and transhumance essentially at the expense of savannah PAs. This phenomenon is made even more acute by the investment of powerful and influen- tial people (politicians, administrators, traders) in livestock. As a result it is extremely difficult to oppose the illegal occu- pation of PAs by transhumant herders. \u2022 The enormous challenges posed by corruption, particularly in public institutions. \u2022 Wasting a huge potential in promoting an exclusively ethnic and cultural tourism in the desert areas and omitting to invest in ecotourism and safari hunting, despite that potential (i.e. WAP transborder park and the wildlife reserves). \u2022 The abandonment of the fundamentals of PA management (control of territory, anti-poaching activities, bio-monitoring, etc.) in favour of less expensive and more popular actions; new strategies for the maintaining of PA control alongside conflict management have not been instigated. \u2022 Encouraging NGOs to take on a major role in conservation has not always helped state structures to address their issues of weak capacities. Furthermore, the predominant position occu- pied by NGOs has sometimes led to a situation where the main priority of the NGO is to maintain its position of power and influence rather than to pursue the conservation objectives. 4.2 Positive lessons learned \u2022 Long-term and sustained conservation investments and pro- fessional management, as in the case of the EU-funded W transborder park project, have been shown to have very positive conservation outcomes in terms of reduced illegal activities, increased wildlife, ecotourism development and environmental education. \u2022 The potential of PPPs for conservation and sustainable devel- opment in the mangrove forest ecosystem in Guinea-Bissau. \u2022 The importance of the work of strongly motivated national and international NGOs with clear objectives: e.g. the conser- vation of desert antelopes, assisting government in law enforcement in relation to the trade in great apes and ivory, and the protection of great apes (e.g. Last Great Ape Organ- isation \u2013 an NGO in wildlife law enforcement), giraffes and other charismatic species. \u2022 Using cultural heritage, even in times of conflict, to promote the protection of important areas, such as the conservation activities in the Gola Rainforest NP that have involved the com- munities of both Sierra Leone and Liberia which share similar cultures, as well as many species of plant and animal use. \u2022 The potential of sport hunting areas (e.g. Burkina Faso), which help to maintain the only functioning ecosystem (including its elephant population) in the major savannah ecotype of West Africa. \u2022 The potential for a species to become a national symbol as in the case of the giraffe in Niger. During the great drought of 1984, about 50 giraffes moved south to Niger from Mali. Currently the population numbers nearly 400 animals, living outside a PA and protected jointly by local populations and the national wildlife service. 4.3 Promising approaches Improving biodiversity conservation in West Africa should be based on the regional integration of three strategies: \u2022 consistent, uninterrupted interventions on the ground with a specific strategic approach to each major ecotype, with strong coordination between ecotypes; \u2022 a decision-support system based on the collection and organ- isation of information on biodiversity and management effec- tiveness in collaboration with the EU\u2019s BIOPAMA programme; \u2022 shared decision-making at institutional and political levels (Figure 9). The success of this overall approach will depend on the functional integration of these three specific strategies. >4 _ Lessons learned and promising approaches ",

The specific intervention strategies on the ground are based on a composite approach (arranged here only in alphabetical order): (i) composite in situ and ex situ conserva- tion, (ii) ecosystem approach, (iii) habitat approach, (iv) in situ conservation, (v) species approach. Below are presented the pro- posed priority intervention approaches for each major ecotype in West Africa (Table 4). 4.3.2 Biodiversity and management information system In West Africa, data on conservation is scattered, often out of date and not focused on the issues to be solved. The sources of information at the global level are very generic and do not allow the development of a strategic approach with a coordinated series of conservation activities. The BIOPAMA programme (Box 2) proposes the creation of regional observatories in Africa and then to connect the collected information in a more general system entitled the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas or DOPA (Box 3), which is managed jointly with IUCN. Through this project, the EU has an opportunity to turn the simple provision of infor- mation into a system that will enable conservation data to be organised and used in a decision-support system to identify pri- orities, formulate strategies and monitor the impact. The synergies between information, decision-making and conservation action are essential. Table 4.

Biodiversity and Protected Areas Management Programme (BIOPAMA) The Biodiversity and Protected Areas Management Programme (BIOPAMA) is an initiative of the ACP Secretariat funded by the European Union. BIOPAMA aims to address threats to biodiversity in African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries while reducing poverty in communities in and around protected areas. Specifically, the programme will enhance existing institutions and networks by making the best available science and knowledge accessible for building capacity in order to improve policies and better decision-making on biodiversity conservation, protected areas management and Access and Benefits Sharing (ABS). BIOPAMA consists of two components: 1) protected areas component (jointly implemented by the IUCN and the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre), which includes: a) capacity building for regional and national institutions and agencies, and PA managers; b) improved access to and availability of biodiversity data through the establishment of regional observatories and information systems to improve decision-making; 2) Access and Benefits Sharing (ABS), a component implemented by the Multi-donor ABS Capacity Development Initiative managed by Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH. The actions of the protected area component will be implemented in four BIOPAMA regions: West and Central Africa, Eastern and Southern Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific. One of the main objectives is establishing regional observatories that should support the conservation interventions in the field by: \u2022 developing a Regional Reference Information System (RRIS); \u2022 supporting decision-makers at various levels (regional, national, and local, i.e. PA level); \u2022 strengthening capacity-building; \u2022 operating a regional review on information needs and gap analysis; \u2022 indicating priorities of PA funding (ACP/EU++) and addressing the Aichi targets and national reporting obligations to MEAs; \u2022 supporting the assessment of biodiversity values mainstreaming biodiversity; \u2022 contributing towards improving PA management effectiveness; \u2022 proposing the assessment of ecosystem services \u2013 arguments for protection. \u2303 Mangrove: A Common Redshank wading in mangroves.

Digital Observatory for Protected Areas (DOPA) The Digital Observatory for Protected Areas (DOPA) has been developed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission to support the EU\u2019s efforts \u2018to substantially strengthen the effectiveness of international governance for biodiversity and ecosystem services\u2019 (EC/COM/2006/0216 final) and more generally for \u2018strengthening the capacity to mobilize and use biodiversity data, information and forecasts so that they are readily accessible to policymakers, managers, experts and other users\u2019 (UNEP/CBD/COP/10/27). DOPA is conceived as a set of distributed Critical Biodiversity Informatics Infrastructures (databases, web modelling services, broadcasting services, etc.) combined with interoperable web services to provide a large variety of end-users including park managers, decision-makers and researchers with means to assess, monitor and possibly forecast the state and pressures on protected areas at local, regional and global scales. Aside from the services hosted at the JRC, databases contributing to DOPA are typically The Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN), the World Database of Protected Areas (IUCN and United Nations Environment Programme-World Database of Protected Areas), and the species occurrences provided by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). In particular, DOPA aims to: 1. provide the best available material (data, indicators, models) agreed on by contributing institutions, which can serve for establishing baselines for research and reporting (e.g. Protected Planet Report, National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans); 2. provide free analytical tools to support the discovery, access, exchange and execution of web services (databases and modelling) designed to generate the best available material but also for research purposes, decision-making and capacity building activities for conservation; 3. provide an interoperable and, as much as possible, open source framework to allow institutions to develop their own means to assess, monitor and forecast the state and pressure of protected areas, and help them to further engage with the organisations hosting critical biodiversity informatics infrastructures. DOPA Explorer (Beta version, 2013: http://ehabitat-wps.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dopa_explorer/) has been developed to provide simple means to explore areas around all marine and terrestrial protected areas that are greater than 150 km 2 , identify those with the most unique ecosystems and species, and assess the pressures they are exposed to because of human development. Ecological data derived from near real-time earth observations is also made available, although currently limited to African protected areas. Two other main interfaces to the web services are planned for the period 2014-16: 1. DOPA Validator (2015) will allow registered users to validate/invalidate the information summarised in DOPA Explorer and provide additional observations about individual protected areas; 2. DOPA Analyst (2016) will be providing end-users with a broad range of modelling tools for forecasting climate change impacts on protected areas, assessing connectivity, computing niche models or to allow end-users to simulate conse- quences of adding or removing a protected area on regional indicators.

Safeguarding the pop- ulations of elephants, the desert ecotype wildlife, the specificities of the rainforests, and the wetlands and mangroves requires greater coordination between the countries of the region and greater collaboration between countries and donors on the subject. This collaboration can be achieved firstly by empowering a special unit at the institutional policy level (i.e. WAEMU) and a strong coor- dination of activities among donors, which is always to take place through this special unit at institutional level. The creation of a special unit at the institutional level should provide greater awareness in government decision-making; and the creation of a coordinated response by donors ensures greater synergy of inter- ventions in financing long-term, and specific and emergency inter- ventions (see Section 5.2.1 for implementation).

        "332 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 West Africa H aving reviewed the main conservation issues in West Africa, including the status of wildlife in four major ecotypes and the nature of direct/indirect threats to wildlife, this report now moves on to consider a strategic approach for the conser- vation of biodiversity in West Africa. The most important points to remember about conservation in West Africa are the following: \u2022 high biodiversity values in a wide range of ecosystems, but weak funds, management, protection and sustainable devel- opment of wildlife and other natural resources; \u2022 strong direct threats such as loss of habitats and fragmen- tation, unsustainable poaching, and poor institutional govern- ance with weak monitoring and planning; \u2022 strong indirect threats such as human population growth and poverty, a weak policy and sectorial approach with unsustain- able land and resource use. This strategic approach focuses on the following key needs: A. an active conservation process with more feet on the ground to counter the direct threats and to enhance protection of bio- diversity whilst at the same time promoting its high values; B. a proactive process with more external support for better governance, monitoring and planning, and in support of actions taken to reduce indirect threats on conservation. A. Active process The active process has its own goals: \u2022 to balance the interventions between the four major ecotypes; \u2022 to save threatened species from extinction; \u2022 to preserve critical habitats (e.g. wetlands, Mount Nimba, mangroves); \u2022 to improve management effectiveness of national and trans- border parks; \u2022 to promote the initiatives of landscape-based conservation, including the maintenance of connections between blocks of PAs; \u2022 to ensure a better awareness and representation of the real- ities of wildlife in West Africa. The active process has five main activities: 1. dissemination and analysis of the proposals for site conser- vation and for other conservation priorities in West Africa; 2. specific strategies and actions for the major ecotypes: deserts, savannahs, forests and mangroves/coastal; 3. dismantling the wildlife trafficking network; 4. special analyses; 5. training in wildlife protection. The objective of the first activity (dissemination and analysis) is to confirm the conservation strategic approach for West Africa and to refine the details necessary for the implementation of the proposals. The action is only scheduled for the first year. The second activity (specific strategies and actions) entails prior- itising interventions for the most important KLCs and Key Conser- vation Areas (KCAs); itemising the main objectives of every single KLC and KCA; and preparing proposals to prevent the further decline of wetlands and to create new or larger KLCs and KCAs. For each major ecotype, the process provides priorities of imple- mentation based on criteria related to species, habitats and typol- ogies of conservation (Table 4). The mangrove ecotype also includes marine and coastal PAs, but a harmonised and more detailed analysis could be undertaken here to incorporate the strategic plan for marine protected areas on the Atlantic coast of Africa as an implementation of the Abidjan Convention. The third activity is part of the active conservation approach with activities on the ground. It will include dismantling wildlife traf- ficking networks in four sub-actions: > political and diplomatic support; > intelligence and security; > judiciary and the conviction of illegal activities in PAs; > security communications. The fourth activity on special analysis is split into three sub-activities: > monitor and plan highly threatened species and habitats; > population and habitat viability assessment (PHVA); > establish new or larger KLCs and KCAs. The fifth activity on wildlife protection training will assist in win- ning back control of the parks and in curbing poaching. It has three steps: > identify conservation sites with the capacity to deliver basic training for new rangers; > prepare and implement training programmes that target the specific needs of each PA; > support the implementation of appropriate anti-poaching programmes for each PA. >5 _ Indicative conservation actions ",
        "| 333 #4 Indicative conservation actions B. Proactive process The proactive process attempts to support and boost the active process on a long-term basis by creating a unit of \u2018institutional support and coordination\u2019 allocated under the WAEMU with the support of a special task force. The establishment of a regional coordination unit should exclude the creation of a new regional entity, and aim to strengthen an existing regional institution (WAEMU) in the specific field of conservation This proposal rec- ommends that this is achieved by a special unit reinforced by a task force of experts. A unit under WAEMU will have the mission of coordinating and promoting the following: \u2022 monitoring and planning in coordination with the biodiversity and protected area observatory installed by BIOPAMA in West and Central Africa. The information provided by the observa- tory is intended to feed into decision-support system at local, national and regional levels; \u2022 communication , in order to increase the awareness of the region on conservation via a far-reaching communication process; \u2022 biological research, which is highly targeted and orientated towards the improvement of management effectiveness on specific aspects of conservation in West Africa; \u2022 training on management and governance training in order to raise the capacity of senior-level officers of PAs and central government so that they are equipped to adopt the most advanced and suitable techniques for the long-term manage- ment and conservation of biodiversity in West Africa. 5.1 Active process 5.1.1 Dissemination and analysis of the proposals about sites and conservation priorities in West Africa The implementation of inputs and proposals for intervention in the short and medium term requires the transmission of infor- mation through regional channels (ECOWAS \u2013 WAEMU) in favour of national institutions, NGOs and representatives of stakeholders in conservation. The information is intended to confirm the gen- eral conservation strategic approach and refine the details nec- essary for the implementation of the proposals. The EU should promote the first initiative, but in the future the regional obser- vatory set up by the BIOPAMA project will support the coordination of the regional and national institutions by its regional reference information system on conservation (see Boxes 2 and 3). This intervention should be carried-out under the coordination of WAEMU. \u2303 A rare West African giraffe killed by poachers in south west Niger. ",

The highly degraded situation and the strong, persistent threats sug- gest the need for a more structured intervention on conservation based on: a) major ecotypes, to extend the interventions of conservation from savannahs and forests to the areas that have received less attention in the past, such as desert PAs, and mangrove and coastal-marine PAs; b) species, so as to prevent the extinction of rare and charis- matic species (desert antelopes, elephant, primates, carni- vores, giraffe, eland, pygmy hippopotamus, birds, plants and amphibians); c) habitats, to defend sensitive areas such as wetlands, water basins, inner deltas and the montane habitats; d) KLCs, to allow for better management of habitats and species; e) transborder conservation areas (TFCAs), through better regional coordination and to act as a symbol of a possible peace process between neighbouring countries; f) KCAs, to guarantee the basic intervention of conservation in support of high threatened specific habitats and species. The strategic approach organises these interventions according to the four major ecotypes to ensure a balance between the different conservation realities of West Africa and to spread the current strong focus on savannah protected areas. This strategic approach places more attention on key, rare and endangered species, and special and unique habitats in the KLCs, TFCAs and KCAs. Consequently the strategic approach will carry out conservation actions on the following: A. KLCs of major desert ecotypes; B. KLCs, KCAs and endangered wetlands of savannah ecotypes; C. existing KLCs and KCAs and new or larger KLCs and KCAs (in Liberia, Ghana and Nigeria) of forest ecotypes; D. KLCs, KCAs and new or larger KLCs and KCAs (in Nigeria, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Guinea) of mangrove/ coastal ecotypes. Beginning with the desert ecotype, this strategic approach pre- sents specific proposals for the conservation of every site and for each major ecotype. The elements of each site are presented in table format under the following headings: \u2022 conservation objectives; \u2022 key species; \u2022 key habitats. The summary elements of each major ecotype are presented in table format under the following headings: \u2022 protecting biodiversity; \u2022 countries; \u2022 biomes/ecotypes; \u2022 main protected areas and priorities; \u2022 analysis; \u2022 objectives and proposed actions. \u2303 A village near the border of W National Park, Niger.

Otherwise the Sahara is a vast area of largely undisturbed habitat. The areas of steppe and woodlands in the desert are also heavily influenced by drought and the effects are exacerbated by large numbers of domestic livestock. The desert areas of the Atlantic coast are severely degraded: overgrazing, cutting of trees for firewood and timber, and soil erosion aggravated by drought are contributing to desertification. The chief faunal values are along the coast where key migratory staging posts for the birds using the Atlantic Coastal Flyway are found. The large mammal species have suffered from uncon- trolled hunting but the coast also supports the world\u2019s largest population of the critically endangered Mediterranean monk seal ( Monachus monachus ). It is recommended that the highest priority be given to KLCs and KCAs in the following ecotypes: \u2022 desert with the ecotypes of Sahara Desert; south Saharan steppe and woodlands, and west Saharan montane xeric woodlands; \u2022 Atlantic coast. The proposal for the West African desert ecotype is to establish one large desert Key Landscape for Conservation. > Niger-Chad-Algeria Desert KLC (416 750 km 2 of PAs) The conservation field activities should focus on the area between Niger, Chad and Algeria where there are probably the only remain- ing PAs that contain populations of many of the larger ungulates of this ecotype. However, this vast area has long been plagued by political insecurity and civil unrest, and the current situation of the desert wildlife is far from certain. Many desert species track seasonally variable and patchy resources and require large natural landscapes to persist. Con- sequently, and if necessary, in situ conservation should cover the entire area between the priority PAs. Special habitats to protect are the water sources and riparian habitats, which are critical for the persistence of many desert species. For this reason, agree- ments between countries should be defined to determine a com- mon intervention strategic approach at the regional level. The desert KLCs encompass three PAs in Niger: 97 000 km 2 Termit & Tin Toumma, 78 339 km 2 A\u00efr and T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9, and 12 754 km 2 Addax Sanctuary; two PAs in Chad: 83 000 km 2 Ouadi Rim\u00e9-Ouadi and 1 739 km 2 Fada Archei; and two PAs in Algeria: 98 900 km 2 Tassili-n-Ajjer and 45 000 km 2 Ahaggar. The key threats to be addressed are the reduction of large mam- mal populations and the Saharan cheetah, and the poorness of the genetic heritage of the desert antelopes. The large spaces and the system resilience, despite climate change, argue for adopting these measures: (i) species approach, together with (ii) a combined in situ and ex situ conservation approach to pro- tect the endangered species in the priority PAs (see below) and to preserve and improve the genetic heritage of desert antelopes with ex situ conservation. To have the greatest probability of conservation success, in situ and ex situ conservation techniques should be applied synergis- tically and must: \u2022 be flexible to act in areas and countries as soon as security conditions allow it; \u2022 save the habitat in which the species can live and reproduce (PAs and ecosystem); \u2022 preserve and improve the genetic heritage (DNA 21 ), under the responsibility of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums \u2013 WAZA), with a view to the possible reintroduction of species in their natural habitat. Care must be taken to ensure that the natural habitat is preserved until reintroduction can take place (see Table 5). Table 5.

        "| 337 #4 Indicative conservation actions The proposal for the Atlantic coast is to establish two KLCs as follows. > Senegal-Mauritania \u2013 Atlantic Coastal KLC (2 465 km 2 of PAs) This landscape includes: the contiguous 659 km 2 Diawling NP in Mauritania; and in Senegal, the 209 km 2 Parc national des oiseaux du Djoudj , the nearby 461 km 2 Saint-Louis Marine pro- tected area, the 486 km 2 Ndiael Wildlife Reserve and the 650 km 2 For\u00eat de Keur Momar Sarr . This complex contains the most import wetlands in West Africa (WAF-02 in Figures 10-12 and more detailed in Figure 11) and consists of lagoons, saline flats and a small area of mangroves, as well as dunes, alluvial plains and an interconnecting network of rivers, lakes and ponds. There are seasonally inundated and marshy areas with small channels, especially adjacent to the river, and some of these are extremely important for birds in some years or at certain times of year, depending on flood and rain- water levels. The PAs and the buffer areas are incorporated in sites classified as IBAs (Table 6). Table 6.

        "| 341 #4 Indicative conservation actions ( 23 ) The strategy must prioritise the intervention in the WAP complex (W, Arly and Pendjari) and less so in the Togo complex of Keran-Oti-Monduri due to the high level of degradation and the resources needed to restore the protected areas of Togo. 5.1.4 Specific strategies and actions for the major savannah ecotypes The original savannahs of West Africa have been greatly reduced, degraded and fragmented by farming, grazing, and the cutting and burning of trees and bushes for wood and charcoal. The degradation is exacerbated in areas of high human population density such as Nigeria (up to 300 persons/km\u00b2). Also the inter- lacing forests and savannah areas, with their critical habitat for a number of large charismatic mammals, are highly degraded and the PAs preserve only 2 % of the forest-savannah mosaic. The periodic droughts are further threats, exacerbating human pressures on biodiversity. The remaining blocks of intact habitat are found mainly in the protected areas, but most are under- resourced; even within the better-managed protected areas poaching is still rife and predators are systematically poisoned by transhumant herders. Over-hunting has decimated most of the populations of larger mammal species. West African popula- tions of elephant are small, but of great conservation interest and draw attention to the value of the protected areas. Roan antelope and West African savannah buffalo are relatively more numerous but restricted to protected areas. Species that are at risk of extinction include giant eland, waterbuck, West African giraffe, wild dog, lion, leopard and cheetah. The lions of West Africa are a particular concern. Dr Philipp Henschel of the NGO Panthera explained: \u2018When we set out in 2006 to survey all the lions of West Africa, the best reports suggested they still survived in 21 protected areas. [In 2013] we] surveyed all of them, representing the best remaining lion habitat in West Africa. Our results came as a com- plete shock: all but a few of the areas we surveyed were basically paper parks, having neither management budgets nor patrol staff, and had lost all their lions and other iconic large mammals.\u2019 Bird species are also declining. The annual passage in the area of the huge numbers of migrant birds (Afrotropical-Palaearctic and intra-African migration) is particularly threatened by drought, overgrazing in the Sahel, and by the drainage and pollution of West African wetlands (Box 4). The most important PAs in the West African savannahs include: the W transborder park between Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger, Pendjari NP in Benin, Arly NP in Burkina Faso, Como\u00e9 NP in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, River Gambia in Gambia, Mole NP in Ghana, Boucle du Baoul\u00e9 NP and Gourma Elephants in Mali, Kainji Lake and Yankari NP in Nigeria, and Niokolo-Koba NP in Senegal. Finally, threats to the conservation of biodiversity on West African savannahs are the degraded and fragmented ecosystems; the high poaching levels and high extinction risk for large mammals species; and the high vulnerability of the area to climate change, exacerbating desertification and degradation of agricultural systems, with knock-on effects for PAs. The intervention\u2019s stra- tegic approach requires: 1. concentrating conservation actions on the WAP 23 transborder area, the only functional ecological complex to maintain bio- diversity in West African savannahs; 2. preserving the most important ecological blocks of PAs (even if faunal densities are low) and the corridors between them for possible future rehabilitation; 3. determining the most appropriate conservation actions for threatened species ( in situ and ex situ conservation, special conservation, translocation, etc.) by the establishment of pop- ulation and habitat viability assessment (PHVA) analysis if necessary, and the preservation of specific habitats, espe- cially wetland areas for birds. The West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), with the support of experts in West African savannah management, has proposed interventions which are summarised and integrated with other proposals in the following key points: \u2022 establish a convergence plan of interventions on conservation in the ecotypes; \u2022 save the WAP ecosystem (W, Arly, Pendjari), the only func- tional ecological complex to have the potential to serve as a site for the regeneration and reintroduction of species back into the other degraded PAs in the savannah ecotype; \u2022 preserve the most important ecological blocks of protected areas: 1. W-Arly-Pendjari-Oti Monduri (Benin, Burkina Faso, Niger and Togo); 2. Como\u00e9-Mole (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana); 3. Niokolo-Badiar-Bafing-Faleme-Fouta Djalon (Guinea, Mali and Senegal) and 4. Gourma Elephant and Sahel Faunal Reserve (Mali and Burkina Faso), even though faunal densities may be low; \u2022 support transborder complexes of protected areas and special conservation measures (cross-border activities) in the major savannah ecotypes in West Africa, such as the WAPOK; \u2022 implement new management initiatives such as the proposal to establish transborder corridors between major ecological blocks, like the Volta Transboundary Ecosystem Wildlife Corridors between Burkina Faso and Ghana.

The decline of wetlands (From Zwarts L. et al (2009). Summary of Living on the Edge: Wetlands and Birds in a Changing Sahel. KNNV Publishing, Zeist, The Netherlands.) The Palearctic-African bird migration draws birds from the geographical range between 10\u00b0 W (Ireland) and 164\u00b0 E (Kolyma Basin, north-eastern Siberia). Long-distant migrants from this vast region pour into sub-Saharan Africa, amassing mainly in the northern savannahs of the Sahel and Sudan-Guinea zone. Although the region is close to the Sahara, it has four huge Sahelian wetlands: the Senegal Delta, the Inner Niger Delta, Lake Chad and the Hadejia-Nguru wetlands. These wetlands are of critical importance to the migrating waterbirds. Senegal Delta (WAF-02 in Figures 11 and 12) (Desert) The Senegal Delta has a unique ecosystem because seawater can enter the floodplains, hence the change from marine to freshwater. In the past, the water level varied by 3.5 m in an area of 3 400 km 2 . Currently the floodplains are irrigated farmland, the permanent water body has invasive plant species (water lettuce, Kariba weed), the level is reduced to 0.5 m and the bird life has reduced dramatically. No wetland in West Africa has changed as much as the Senegal Delta . The creation of Djoudj NP (Senegal) and Diawling NP (Mauritania) has offset some of the ecological disasters associated with the loss of the floodplains and both sites are now important wetlands for migratory bird species. (For conservation measures, see Section 5.1.3.) Inner Niger Delta (WAF-07 in Figures 12 and 16) (Savannah) The Inner Niger Delta in Mali is huge. The area covered by water at any one time could amount to 25 000 km 2 but in most years the areas of floodplain are smaller . The Inner Niger Delta also stands out for its hydrological dynamics. The water could rise by more than 6 m in wet years, but in extremely dry years the flood level rises only by 3 m. For waterbirds the large annual differences in flood extent are a matter of life and death (starvation or preying). Dams in the Niger upstream of the Delta and large irrigation works and breeding (as in the Senegal Delta) take so much water that the floodplains are now reduced to an estimated 15-20 % of the total. The drier the Inner Niger Delta, the fewer migrants survive the northern winter. For a few species, the population in the Inner Niger Delta constitute a substantial part of their entire population. The significance of this area for European and Asian migrants can hardly be overestimated. (For conservation measures, see Section 5.1.4.) Lake Chad Basin (WAF-18 in Figure 12) (Savannah) In the past, Lake Chad was very large, varying in size between 15 000 and 25 000 km 2 . Currently the decline in the water level is due to irrigation along the Logone and Chari Rivers and climate change. All in all, birdlife on Lake Chad must have changed a great deal, but hard data is lacking. However, although Lake Chad was reduced in size, the floodplains have increased in size, which is good news for foraging birds. The complete bird count reveals the significance of Lake Chad for not only local species, but also for migrants. (This area is not covered by a direct conservation measure, but should be supported by the special fund for new or larger KLCs and KCAs in savannah areas.) Hadejia-Nguru wetlands (WAF-19 in Figure 12) (Savannah) The Hadejia-Nguru wetlands lie on the southern edge of the Sahel savannah in north-eastern Nigeria. The area is a flood-plain complex, comprised of a mixture of seasonally flooded land and dry upland. There are 20 dams upstream of the Hadejia-Nguru and the size of the floodplain varies annually, depending on the size of the river\u2019s discharge, between 300 and 3 600 km 2 . Large parts of the wetland are under rice cultivation during the rainy season and, during the dry season, are usually utilised for growing other crops as water levels drop. Livestock graze uncultivated areas. The bird counts, performed between 1988 and 1998, show that numbers are related to the size of the floodplains: 300 000 waterbirds were counted in wet years, but only 50 000 in dry years. (This area has not been covered by a direct conservation measure, but it should be supported by the special fund for new or larger KLCs and KCAs in savannah areas.) ",
        "| 343 #4 Indicative conservation actions It is recommended that the highest priority be given to the fol- lowing KLCs and KCAs. > WAPOK Savannah KLC (38 000 km 2 of PAs) This large complex of contiguous conservation areas is located near to the international frontiers with Burkina Faso, Benin, Niger and Togo. The landscape encompasses the 10 400 km 2 W trans- border park between Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger; the 1 823 km 2 Pendjari NP in Benin; the 839 km 2 Arly Faunal Reserve (renamed Park) in Burkina Faso; the 1 450 km 2 Oti Monduri Faunal Reserve; and the 1 196 km 2 Keran NP in Togo. The WAPOK complex includes one giraffe area not classified in Niger, ten hunting concessions and many adjacent village hunting zones. The WAPOK complex is a large area of about 38 000 km 2 of intact habitat (with the exclusion of Togo\u2019s PAs) with great importance for the survival of large mammals, including lion and other spe- cies that are at high risk of extinction in West Africa. These dif- ferent blocks constitute the largest remaining wilderness; they make up the only functional ecological complex in West Africa that has the potential to serve as a site for regeneration and reintroduction of species back into other degraded PAs in the savannah ecotype. The survival of the WAP complex is the highest priority in West Africa. This strategic approach prioritises and stresses the intervention in the WAP complex (W, Arly and Pendjari and their faunal reserves). It also emphasises the Togo complex of Keran-Oti-Monduri but recognises the high level of degradation of the PAs of Togo and the greater resources needed for their restoration (Table 9). Table 9.

The two PAs are situated near the borders between the two countries, but they are not contiguous. The land- scape encompasses the 11 671 km 2 Como\u00e9 NP (the largest PA in the savannahs of West Africa) and the 4 900 km 2 Mole NP in Ghana. The CM savannah KLC is characterised by savannah woodlands, which cover almost the totality of the parks, and the riparian forests that fringe the rivers. Isolated forest patches of varying size occur throughout the savannah. Other habitat-types include alluvial plains and flat seasonal marsh. The Como\u00e9 NP is highly degraded but it must be preserved, even though faunal densities are low, in the expectation and hope of a better future for conservation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire after the recent civil wars and violence. The initiative will also serve to support cross-border activities and establish transborder corridors between major ecological blocks in order to save the large pop- ulations of mammals and the threatened species in West Africa (Table 10).

The landscape encom- passes the 8 423 km 2 Niokolo NP in Senegal; the contiguous 278 km 2 Badiar NP in Guinea; the 1 600 km 2 Bafing NP; and the 3 935 km 2 Boucle du Baoul\u00e9 NP in Mali. The complex includes the Faleme area (Mali and Guinea) and two chimpanzee areas, one in Mali (Bafing) and the other in Guinea (Fouta Djalon,) and more than nine hunting zones. The complex is mostly flat with large areas of floodplain and marsh, which are inundated during the seasonal rains (June to October). The area includes low hills and rugged and broken ter- rain, especially in the west where there are spectacular escarp- ments. The area is crossed by large rivers that dry up during the dry season, but the waters of the artificial lake form the eastern boundary of the Bafing NP for much of its length. The vegetation includes herbaceous savannah dominated by Andropogon gayanus in the valleys and plains, and dry forest, gallery forest and more luxuriant vegetation along the watercourses. There is a proposal for the creation of a 38 000 km 2 Bafing-Fal\u00e9m\u00e9 transborder protected area (BFTPA), which will be very important, both in terms of biodiversity and regional water security. With a mean population density of just ten people/km 2 , one of the lowest in the region south of the Sahel, the BFTPA is considered one of West Africa\u2019s last wild places. The stability of its unique ecosys- tems is now threatened by road construction and mining, and a growing demand for arable land, energy, wildlife products and other scarce resources (Table 11).

The landscape encompasses the 5 715 km 2 Gourma Elephant in Mali; the 18 150 km 2 Sahel Faunal Reserve in Burkina Faso; and the 2 560 km 2 of five Important Bird and Bio- diversity Areas (IBAs) in the Inner Niger Delta (see Figure 16). Tombouctou is the biggest IBA, immediately north of the town. The savannah ecosystem, which also includes the seasonal lakes and wetlands of the Sahel Faunal Reserve in Burkina Faso, is home to the most northerly elephant population in Africa. The complex houses a large number of birds including hundreds of thousands of wintering birds and breeding colonies of cormorant, heron, spoonbill, ibis and other waterbirds (Table 12). The habitats are characterised by wetlands, sand dunes, semi- desert grasslands, open eroded shields, drainage lines, inselbergs rising out of the plains and a series of hills. On the seasonal floodplain there is a rich plant community providing important dry season grazing. The IBAs in the Inner Niger Delta consist of permanent and semi-permanent wetlands, which are sometimes connected. Depending entirely upon the annual run-off from the rains of July to September, the lake levels vary considerably from year to year. Some lakes are ringed by important stands of trees. Under natural conditions, the wetlands retain floodwater from the Niger throughout the dry season in years of good rainfall, but otherwise have dried out completely by April. The sites include cultivation and scrub woodland along the course of the Niger and its tributaries, fixed dunes and ephemeral interdunal slacks. The most important areas for waterbirds are thought to be the clusters of dry season shallow ponds. Table 12.

        "| 347 #4 Indicative conservation actions > Lion Key Conservation Areas (8 200 km 2 of PAs) Recent surveys (8 January 2014) have suggested that the African lion population is facing extinction across the entire West African region 24 . The team discovered that West African lions now survive only in the transborder WAP complex (fewer than 200 lions) and in three national parks: Niokolo Koba NP in Senegal (fewer than ten lions), Kainji Lake NP (fewer than 20 lions) and Yankari NP (fewer than five lions) in Nigeria. Counting lions is extremely difficult, and we may never know precisely how many lions there are in West Africa, especially if, as few specialists suppose, that we can find lions outside the PAs. The strategic approach for the protection of the savannah fauna of West Africa includes the 5 824 km 2 Kainii Lake NP (and the Wari-Maro-Mont Kouffe-Agoua Forest in central Benin, to be explored), and the 2 387 km 2 Yankari NP with the main objective of contributing towards saving the last lions and wild dogs (in Kainii Lake NP) of West Africa (Table 13).

        "350 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 West Africa 5.1.5 Specific strategies and actions for the major forest ecotypes The forest ecotype of West Africa consists of scattered mountains, high plateau areas, gently undulating landscape but also lowland and coastal forests. These forests contain some of the highest levels of faunal species richness of any African forest, especially in terms of forest-restricted mammals, birds and butterflies; but many areas are essentially unstudied. The diversity of life inhab- iting these forests is astonishing (Mt Nimba has more than 2 000 species of vascular plants recorded, more than 500 are new species and many of them are endemic; Ta\u00ef Forest, the largest area of protected lowland forest in the region has 1 300 vascular plant species recorded). Discoveries of new species of plants and insects are frequent. The global demand for valuable hardwoods continues to spur logging in this region so most of the high forest areas that remain are late secondary stands and isolated from each other by slash-and-burn farming. Some of the mountain zones remain largely untouched (Loma Mountains), while others have been severely degraded and fragmented (Mt Nimba, Fouta Djalon, etc.). Only in a few areas are there sufficiently large and interconnected forests to allow migrations of animals to continue occurring. The forest blocks of Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forest between Nigeria and Cameroon are still connected. The forests in West Africa have been degraded by high human population density resulting from natural population growth, immi- gration from the northern countries and refugees from civil war in the coastal countries (Liberia, Sierra Leone and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire). High anthropogenic pressures for farmland, bushmeat hunting for local consumption, large rubber and oil palm plantations (including \u2018land grabs\u2019 that involve foreign companies), timber, fuelwood and mineral resources have all contributed to reducing the size and biotic potential of the West African forest habitats, especially the lowland forests. Outside the few rainforest national parks and some of the forest reserves, the rate of forest loss has acceler- ated recently. The loss of forests has been severe in Nigeria (3.7 %, in 2000-2010, the highest in the world 25 , Guinea and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Subsistence agriculture in the wake of commercial log- ging together with hevea and palm oil plantations have reduced the area of primary forest to just fragments. Siltation from mining for diamonds and gold is threatening freshwater fish populations, while hunters have increased poaching to supply bushmeat to the mining settlements. Organised crime networks involved in cannabis cultivation (which means forest clearance) and cross- border wildlife trade also contribute to the disappearance of forests. Habitat loss for farming and plantations, coupled with an intensive bushmeat trade, are pushing some mammal species, particularly rain-forest primates, towards extinction. The largest stands of forest in West Africa are found within pro- tected areas and forest reserves. The management of protected areas and reserves is currently poor or non-existent, especially in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The total area of protected forest in West Africa is just under 3 % for all national parks and other reserves. However there are still important forest blocks that could complement the overall biodiversity of this ecotype, but these have not been elevated to the status of conservation areas. A recent study on the pattern of mammal extinctions in the PAs of West and Central Africa shows that there is no significant correlation between the size of PA, the high demographic pressure, and the size and number of functional mammal extinctions 26 . However, ( 25 ) Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (2010). Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010, FAO, Rome, Italy. ( 26 ) Brugiere D., B. Chardonnet and P. Scholte (2014).

        "| 351 #4 Indicative conservation actions the extinction of mammals increases if following a south-north gradient: it is lower for the PAs of rainforests and higher for the PAs of the Sahelio-Saharan savannah and steppes. So despite the small size of the forest PAs and the high anthropogenic pressures, biodiversity values in West African rainforests could be maintained if habitats are preserved and poaching curbed. The threats to biodiversity are habitat degradation by farming and woodcutting, and high levels of poaching. Endemic plants, insect, birds, amphibians and small and large mammals are all at risk of extinction. Furthermore, the low representation of PAs across the whole forest area means that there is a danger of losing hitherto unknown biodiversity. For example, there are no protected areas in the Niger Delta swamp forests. Deforestation and degrading agri- cultural systems also makes the area more vulnerable to climate change (which will lead to further pressure on PAs). Selecting key sites in the West African forest zone on which to concentrate resources should be an important part of any con- servation strategic approach. Choosing appropriate sites in West Africa is not difficult, because so few protected areas of reason- able size exist in the forest zone. Among the most important sites are Gola Forest and (the newly created) Loma Moun- tains in Sierra Leone, Sapo in Liberia, Ta\u00ef in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Cross River in Nigeria, along with the Ankasa and Bia Conservation Areas in Ghana. These protected areas contain some of the most important populations of forest ele- phant, pygmy hippopotamus and great apes in the region. The intervention strategic approach requires: (i) concentrating actions in principal KLCs and KCAs (see below) \u2013 they are all equally important in terms of species richness and diversity; (ii) reducing threats on PAs by adopting a holistic approach to ensure inter-sectorial policy development, analysis of envi- ronmental impacts, the valuing of ecosystem services and the respect of conservation principles; (iii) determining the most appropriate conservation actions for threatened species, by the establishment of PHVA analysis if necessary, the preservation of specific habitats inside or outside the PAs, and the combination of in situ and ex situ conservation if necessary. For a summary of global data, see Table 22. \u2303 Land cleared for a palm oil plantation in Pujehun district in southern Sierra Leone. \u2018Land grabs\u2019 for such projects lead to irreversible loss of biodiversity.

The landscape is located along the Cameroon- Nigeria border (Figure 18). The forest blocks of Cross-Korup are still connected. The Cross River NP is divided into two sections that are separated by about 50 km of disturbed forest. The (1.a) Oban Division (IBA \u2013 NG007), the largest sector of the park, is contiguous with Korup National Park in Cameroon (IBA \u2013 CM019). The (1.b) Okwangwo Division (IBA \u2013 NG010), the smaller part of the park, is connected with the Tamakanda NP. The complex is a large area of lowland and sub-montane rainforest. In the less accessible areas, the forest has had little interference, but elsewhere the exploitation has resulted in secondary regrowth and the establishment of planta- tions of oil palm and rubber. The terrain is rough and generally flat with hills and escarpments but rises from the river valleys to over 1 000 m in mountainous areas. The Mount Cameroon NP is one of Africa\u2019s largest volcanoes, rising to 4 040 metres. It has a wide range of habitats including low- land, evergreen rainforest, mangrove, coastal vegetation, swamp forest, sub-montane forest, montane forest and grassland. Mont Cameroon is home to 49 strictly endemic and 50 near-endemic plant species, 20 of the 28 restricted-range bird species of the EBA, including two strictly endemic species, three endemic species of butterfly and large mammals, including the forest elephant. The Gashaka-Gumti NP (IBA \u2013 NG001), the largest of Nigeria\u2019s national parks, is contiguous with Tchabel Mbabo in Cameroon (IBA \u2013 CM009), both far from the isolated Faro NP (IBA \u2013 CM008). The area is situated on mountains rising to 2 400 m but there are also extensive lowland areas. The area is a heterogeneous mix of habitats comprising montane forests and grasslands, derived savannah with relict lowland forest, riparian forest and Sudan- Guinea savannah woodlands. The Faro NP is a large block of Sudanian savannah on gently undulating terrain at 250-500 m (Table 16). Table 16.

Importance of Cameroon-Nigeria border and transborder conservation measures The Cameroon-Nigeria border region, where the Cross River gorilla occurs, is a biodiversity hotspot of global significance that supports a high diversity of animal and plant species that can occur in large numbers in restricted ranges. Many of them are threatened. These forests contain some of the highest rates of animal species richness of any African forest, especially in terms of forest-restricted mammals, birds and butterflies. Many of these animals are endemic. The ecotype is heavily impacted by human use, including logging and plantation agriculture. Threatened primates share parts of the same habitat, including the Cross River gorilla, the Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee and the drill ( Mandrillus leucophaeus ). Given the small and highly fragmented populations of the Cross River gorilla, it is important to protect the corridors connecting the sub-populations and to increase the effectiveness of existing and proposed protected areas within their range. Taken together, these findings serve to emphasise the need to expand our knowledge of the gorilla\u2019s range. Transborder conservation measures have already been developed or proposed for a number of other protected areas that lie on either side of the Nigeria-Cameroon border. These are the Oban Division of Cross River NP in Nigeria and the connected Korup NP and Tamakanda NP; and the block Gashaka Gumti NP in Nigeria, Faro NP and a proposed protected area at Tchabal Mbabo in Cameroon.

Ta\u00ef NP is the largest and best-preserved remnant of Upper Guinean rainforest in West Africa. This humid tropical forest has a high level of endemism. The park contains some 1 300 species of taller plants; much of the forest in the park is unlogged, mature, old growth with emergents rising to 60 m. The fauna is fairly typical of West African forests and the park contains 47 of the 54 species of large mammals known to occur in Guinean rain- forest, including five threatened species. Mammals include the mona monkey, white-nosed monkey and Diana monkey, black and white colobus, red colobus and green colobus, sooty mangabey, chimpanzee, giant pangolin, tree pangolin and long-tailed pan- golin, golden cat, leopard, elephant, bushpig, giant forest hog, pygmy hippopotamus, water chevrotain, bongo, buffalo and an exceptional variety of forest duikers. Over 230 bird species have been recorded, 143 of which are typical of primary forest. The Grebo National Forest is an area of evergreen lowland rain- forest enclosed on three sides by a large, easterly projecting meander of the Cavalla River, on the international frontier with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in the extreme east of the country. The Sapo NP contains the second-largest area of primary tropical rainforest in West Africa after Ta\u00ef National Park in neighbouring C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The park is a biodiversity hotspot that has \u2018the highest mammal species diversity of any region in the world and one of the richest variety of floral species in the country, with many endemic species. The Sapo NP is hosting around 125 mammal species and 590 types of bird, including a number of threatened species. The park is home to the pygmy hippopotamus. Note that the IUCN Species Survival Commission reports: \u2018Sapo NP is the only realistic choice of a suitable conservation area for the Pygmy Hippopotamus\u2019 27 . Other important species are forest elephant, seven species of monkey (including chimpanzee and the endan- gered Diana monkey), crocodile, leopard, three species of pangolin and seven species of duiker antelope (including the vulnerable Jentink\u2019s duiker and zebra duiker). Sapo National Park remains relatively inaccessible, and this significant and environmentally rich area remains somewhat undeveloped for management, research and tourism (Table 17). Table 17.

This area was designated as a Biosphere Reserve in 1980 and a World Heritage Site in 1981. Rising above the surrounding savannahs and covered in dense forests, Mount Nimba (and its surrounding mountains) is an area with some of the highest biodiversity in West Africa due to its unique geographical and climatic location. The complex is home to a large number of plant species, more than 317 vertebrate species (107 of which are mammals, including a significant pop- ulation of West African chimpanzees) and more than 2 500 inver- tebrate species, many of which are only found in this region. More than 2 000 species of vascular plants, including several endemic or quasi-endemic plants, have been recorded. This site has been identified as an Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) species/site profile due to it containing a critically endangered or endangered species with a limited range. Mount Nimba has received legal protection from both Guinea and the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, but the habitat is still threatened by activities occurring adjacent to the site boundaries and spreading into the protected area. While a large portion of the forests are still pres- ent inside the Biosphere\u2019s reserve core, much of the fauna have suffered because of human practices, such as poaching, agricul- ture, bush fires, and mining. The project \u2018Steward\u2019 of the United States Agency for International Development\u2019s (USAID) regional programme for conserving the biodiversity of the Upper Guinean Forest of West Africa is the promoter of the Nimba transborder initiative and it is still working in the area. \u2018Steward\u2019 was conceptualised in 2005-2006 and is currently (2011-2015) in its implementation phase (see Table 18).

The complex encompasses a first block of the 750 km 2 Gola Forest Reserve in Sierra Leone, and the 800 km 2 Lofa and 1 000 km 2 Foya Forest Reserves in Liberia; and a second block of the c. 550 km 2 Mano, the 995 km 2 Wologizi and the 380 km 2 Wonegizi in Liberia, and the 914 km 2 Ziama in Guinea. The complex encompasses the Gola-Lofa-Foya Transborder Peace Park between Sierra Leone and Liberia, and the forest and moun- tain complex of Mano-Wologizi-Wonegizi-Ziama between Liberia and Guinea. The Transborder Peace Park unites the Gola Forest Reserve in Sierra Leone and the Lofa and Foya Forest Reserves in Liberia. The proposed Sierra Leone-Liberia Transborder Peace Park (Figure 21) covers a large area of rainforest, which is evergreen in the south, becoming progressively more semi-deciduous to the north. The rivers in the parks are characterised by spectacular rapids and waterfalls and are usually unfordable. The human population within the parks is very low and the vegetation remains largely unmodified. Both areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia are IBAs. The Wologizi Mountains are an isolated area of upland located in northwest Liberia that includes Liberia\u2019s highest mountain (Mount Wuteve at 1 447 m) and other peaks. Lower parts are covered with relatively open forest. Large areas of savannah woodland surround the foothills and lower valleys. The Wonegizi Mountains (IBA \u2013 LR002) is contiguous with the Massif du Ziama Biosphere Reserve (IBA \u2013 GN016) in Guinea. The vegetation consists mainly of semi-deciduous forest, similar in composition to that found on the Wologizi Mountains (IBA \u2013 LR001). The site spans a still largely intact transition from lowland rainforest to semi- montane Parinari-dominated forest at altitude. The Massif du Ziama Biosphere Reserve forms part of the Guinea Highlands; part of its western boundary is contiguous with the Wonegizi Mountains in Liberia. Much of the terrain is extremely rugged. The whole area was forested originally, but primary forest only now remains in the remote upland parts of the southwest, next to the Liberian border. There are also areas of swamp and of wooded savannah on lateritic outcrops of the high plateaux. The core zone of the reserve covers 600 km 2 (Table 19). Table 19.

The Gola-Lofa-Foya and Mano-Wologizi-Wonegizi-Ziama forests \u2013 An example of long-term international and local partnerships for landscape and transfrontier conservation Covering an area of 71 070 ha, the Gola Rainforest National Park (GRNP) in Sierra Leone is characterised by extensive rolling hills cloaked in evergreen and semi-deciduous forest divided into three blocks: Gola North, Central and South. The park comprises the largest remaining area of intact, lowland rainforest in Sierra Leone and is a significant remnant of the once vast Upper Guinea Forest belt of West Africa, a global biodiversity \u2018hotspot\u2019 and a priority for international conservation efforts. The Government of Sierra Leone, the Conservation Society of Sierra Leone (BirdLife in Sierra Leone) and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (BirdLife in the UK) have partnered for the past 25 years to conserve and sustainably manage GRNP. Botanical assessments have identified close to 1 000 plant species, half of which are endemic to the Upper Guinea Forest ecosystem. The forests of the GRNP have largely remained intact in spite of sporadic logging and a decade of civil war during the 1990s. Regenerating secondary forest (in old logging areas) is largely confined to the edges of the park with the core interior zone supporting high primary forest and abundant wildlife. Current satellite imagery shows the park as an \u2018island of green\u2019 in a largely agricultural landscape, confirming that the park\u2019s forests are continuing to be effectively protected. GRNP is home to 60 globally threatened species, including chimpanzee, forest elephant, pygmy hippo and the endemic Gola malimbe. So far, 327 bird species, 49 large mammals, 43 amphibians and over 600 species of butterflies have been recorded there. The partners are finalising the first Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) project, which has already been validated to the two leading international standards on the voluntary market, being awarded double gold in Biodiversity and Climate Change Adaptation. The Gola REDD project is covering the national park (71 070 ha) as well as a leakage belt (~70 000 ha), providing direct benefits to over 120 forest-edge communities. Finally, GRNP is part of what is commonly referred to as the Greater Gola Landscape/Transboundary Peace Park that covers over 300 000 ha across Liberia and Sierra Leone, which BirdLife and its partners are committed to conserve and sustainably manage. The vision is for this to be a matrix of protected areas and community forest areas, representing the largest remnant of the Upper Guinea forest. Source: BirdLife International KLCs ",

The complex encompasses the 1 110 km 2 Outamba-Kilimi NP and forest reserves in Sierra Leone (Kuru Hill) and Pinselli and Soya in Guinea. The park is split into two areas, Outamba and Kilimi, between which lies an unprotected strip of land. Guinea\u2019s protected forests are in the Madina Oula, Soya and Oure Kaba sub-prefectures. The complex has varying landscapes of savan- nah and forest. With a diverse landscape, the areas are home to large numbers of fauna and flora. Some 256 bird species have been recorded in the park, including three species of global con- servation concern. The site is an important refuge for at least nine species of primate and also several large mammals, such as the leopard, pygmy hippopotamus and forest elephant. The project \u2018Steward\u2019 of the USAID\u2019s regional programme for conserving the biodiversity of the Upper Guinean Forest of West Africa is the promoter of the transborder initiative and it is still working in the area. Steward was conceptualised in 2005-2006 and it is currently (2011-2015) in its implementation phase (Table 20). Table 20.

The forest has the greatest biological diversity of any PA in Ghana, with over 300 dif- ferent plant species having been recorded in a single hectare of forest. Animal life includes the elephant, bongo, ten types of pri- mate including chimpanzee (although these have not been seen for some time) and Diana monkey, leopard, more than 260 spe- cies of birds (IBA \u2013 GH001) and hundreds of varieties of butterfly. The park incorporates the former Nini-Suhien National Park and has benefited from recent EU conservation funding. Bia NP in Ghana The 190 km 2 park and the 563 km 2 of the connected resource reserve are characterised by a transitional forest between moist evergreen and moist semi-deciduous trees. The core area is untouched rainforest with the distinction of having some of the tallest trees in West Africa, but the site is isolated, being sur- rounded by mixed farms and secondary forest. Bia NP has forest elephant, chimpanzee, Colobus monkey, Diana monkey, leopard, buffalo, giant hog and a variety of antelopes. The park is the only known natural home of the newly discovered lizard, Agama Sylvanus , and the variety of animal life is outstanding. Bird species number about 200 including a few endangered birds (IBA \u2013 GH003) (Table 21). This park has also benefited from recent EU conservation funding. Table 21.

        "362 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 West Africa 5.1.6 Specific strategies and actions for the major mangrove/ coastal ecotypes In West Africa, mangroves are found discontinuously from Senegal to the Niger Delta. Some 14 % of identified mangrove areas in West Africa fall within nationally and internationally designated pro- tected areas. However, there are strong concerns about the man- agement coordination and effectiveness of the coastal and marine protected areas that encompass the mangroves, predominantly due to financial and administrative constraints in the region. West African mangroves are in moderate decline, with an esti- mated average decline of 25 % between 1980 and 2006. The Atlantic coast of Africa has some of the highest human popula- tion densities on the continent. The majority of industry in West Africa is located in the coastal zone (Nigeria and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire). In West and Central Africa, some 20-30 % of mangroves have been lost in the past 25 years (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire shows a particularly severe decline in mangrove habitat). This, together with rapid growth, high poverty, low development indices, poor governance in rural regions and open access of coastal resources, has depleted the mangrove forests. Threats include urbanisation, industrialisation (such as the oil refineries in the Niger Delta), agriculture, timber and petroleum exploitation, fishing with dyna- mite and poison, canalisation, discharge of sewage, and other pollutants and siltation. The West African mangroves are allocated different ecotypes. The Guinean mangroves, influenced by a large tidal range and high inputs of freshwater, contain the best-developed mangroves in West Africa. This ecotype provides important habitat for migra- tory birds and endangered species such as the West African man- atee. However, the mangrove habitat has been affected by poor rainfall over the entire region during the past three decades. The most extensive blocks of Central African mangroves are found in the Niger Delta, which supports the single most extensive man- grove system in Africa, and the third most extensive worldwide after India and Indonesia. Despite its size, it is extremely threat- ened because none of it falls within a PA. These mangroves occur in suitable low-energy marine environments and they trap large amounts of sediment. The mangroves of this region have no endemic species but support some endangered species, such as manatees and, it seems, also the pygmy hippopotamus in the Niger Delta. Mangroves here, as elsewhere, are important as nursery and feeding areas for marine fish. The conservation of mangroves depends upon coastal and marine protected areas and both of these are highly dependent on their environment, in particular on the context and dynamics of devel- opment, including development taking place far from the man- grove sites. The extension of coastal and marine protected areas to new sites and the prioritising of mangrove areas for conser- vation intervention requires accurate forecasting about human developments as the latter are moving much faster than conser- vation efforts. Careful examination of different development scenarios is essential in order to guarantee the viability of con- servation investments in coastal and marine protected areas. Recent data identified by the Master Plan for Coastal West Africa 28 , produced by IUCN between 2009 and 2011, confirm the importance of the dynamics of human developments that occupy the coastal strip at the expense of mangroves. This is often over- looked by conservation organisations. A further problem is that some coastal and marine protected areas do benefit from long-term funding whereas others are almost forgotten.

The need to improve the consistency and effectiveness of the ecotype networks of coastal and marine areas led the authors to consider the following conservation measures as a priority: \u2022 implementation of conservation actions in some key areas which have not benefited from conservation (e.g. Sherbro, Sierra Leone); \u2022 conservation of the river-sea connections (a complex of small estuaries) in the Gulf of Guinea; \u2022 strengthening inter-sectorial management of some border areas of high biological value and heritage; \u2022 address strategies and practices of the fishing and processing industries and enterprises that have significant impacts on mangroves; \u2022 integrate conservation with extractive activities, especially those related to oil and oil storage devices by strengthening marine spatial planning; \u2022 search for synergies between mangrove conservation activ- ities and the need for reducing coastal risks of flooding, espe- cially in areas where the coastline is particularly dynamic. At present, the Abidjan Convention is implementing a strategic plan for marine protected areas on the Atlantic coast of Africa from Mauritania to South Africa. The implementation phase is working in detail on three connected geographical areas: from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, from Liberia to Nigeria, and from Cameroon to Democratic Republic of Congo. Threats to conserving the biodiversity of mangrove forests are as follows: clearing, overharvesting mangrove trees, mining, river changes, poaching, pollution and exotic/invasive plants. Climate change is another major threat because mangrove forests require stable sea levels for long-term survival. The interventions of this strategic approach require: (i) adopting legislation and international conventions relating to mangroves, and developing adequate policies and inter- sectorial approaches to implement actions; (ii) concentrated actions in the priority PAs (see below) and the community mangrove forests; (iii) collaborating with national and international NGOs, and empowering local communities to maintain and monitor the community mangrove areas; (iv) developing an integrated PA and reserve network of coastal and marine areas encompassing mangroves and other coastal habitats; (v) establishing a fund to maintain a sustainable economy and the management of mangroves and coastal habitats; (vi) determining the most appropriate conservation actions and studies to ensure management effectiveness of PAs and mangrove forests, and related threatened species.

The complex of mangrove forests is contiguous to the 10 279 km 2 Bijagos Archipelago Biosphere Reserve with three marine pro- tected areas (MPAs): (i) Ilhas Formosa, Nago and Tchedi\u00e3 (Urok); (ii) Orango, and (iii) Jo\u00e3o Vieira and Poil\u00e3o Marine National Park. This complex includes the ocean coasts and the land on both banks of the rivers and lakes. Much of the area is covered in mangrove as well as fresh and brackish water marshes. The com- plex encompasses primary forest and sacred forest, palm forest, semi-dry woodland, savannah areas and agricultural land. The area includes mudflats and sandbanks, rivers, freshwater lagoons and lakes (Table 24). Table 24.

The site should be classified as a MPA, one of the largest in the region. The Sherbro Island and the Turtle Bank Is a mosaic of rivers and marine areas unique to the region and a breeding ground for green sea turtle as well as leatherback sea turtle. Senegal Saloum Delta National Park This 1 800 km 2 site is an IBA (SN013), but only 760 km 2 are designated as a national park and Ramsar site. The site consists of deltas of the seasonal rivers. There is a network of interlinking channels and additional, seasonal freshwater streams that flow into the delta. The site is made up of sea, sandy coast and islands and islets with mangrove, savannah and forest. The national park and part of the buffer zone of the Biosphere Reserve are man- aged by the central authorities, but the remainder is managed by liaising between a rural council and national park and forest service authorities. Basse Casamance National Park The 50 km 2 of the national park (IBA \u2013 SN014) is in the delta of the Casamance River. The habitat consists of low-lying lands with mangroves fringing tidal channels, seasonally bare saline mud- flats, some wooded savannah and terrestrial forest, including the only remaining small area of Guinea-Congo forest in the country. Ghana Keta Lagoon Ramsar site (Ghana) The 530 km 2 Keta Lagoon (IBA \u2013 GH033) is an extensive, brackish body of water situated to the east of the Volta river estuary. The site comprises the open water of the lagoon and the sur- rounding floodplains and mangrove swamps. The lagoon is bor- dered by numerous settlements and the surrounding floodplain consists of marsh, scrub, farmland and substantial mangrove stands, which are heavily exploited for fuelwood. Songor Lagoon The 232 km 2 Songor Lagoon (IBA \u2013 GH036) is, with Keta Lagoon, one of the two major lagoon systems associated with the Volta river estuary. The site comprises a brackish lagoon with extensive mudflats and islands, saltpans, a broad sandy beach and the flood- plains of a number of small streams. It is separated from the sea by a narrow sand dune on which small villages are situated. The lagoon has no direct access to the sea and seawater replen- ishment is from seepage through the sand dunes. The main wet- land vegetation type is saline marsh with degraded mangrove. Table 25.

At present, priority is being given to the establishment of agree- ments between countries 29 and the strengthening of border con- trol actions for the WAPOK complex. The proposal for dismantling wildlife trafficking networks in West Africa is structured by areas of intervention. The analysis below concerns the international illegal wildlife trade (elephant poaching and ivory trade, and live animal trade). Further details of the efforts throughout Africa to tackle wildlife trafficking are presented in Chapter 5 of this report. Political and diplomatic \u2022 Build awareness of the serious threats that poaching and smuggling pose to economic, regional and social security at the national and international 30 levels. \u2022 Build awareness of the current limitations in the effort to combat poaching and wildlife smuggling. \u2022 Strengthen the outreach to West African countries on the illegal wildlife trade. \u2022 Adopt a regional approach to fighting the illegal wildlife trade and dismantle international criminal networks. \u2022 Strengthen national wildlife legislation, and establish the principle of international crime for illegal wildlife activities in West African countries. \u2022 Designate / establish a high authority for this task within regional institutions (WAEMU under ECOWAS). Intelligence and security \u2022 Develop and implement national and international intelli- gence gathering systems. \u2022 Increase investigations, especially at key transit points or borders, and in local markets. \u2022 Establish effective lines of communication with the different services concerned (wildlife, police, defence, security), intra- and interstate. \u2022 Strengthen the capacities of anti-poaching operations in PAs (human resources, training, equipment, facilities, resources and incentives). \u2022 Strengthen the capacities of the teams responsible for inves- tigating and arresting poachers and wildlife traders (human resources, training, equipment, facilities, resources and incentives). \u2022 Establish effective collaboration between NGOs and govern- ment and intergovernmental agencies to support the estab- lishment and operation of intelligence and security networks. It would be worthwhile to support the growth of a net- work of non-governmental organisations in West Africa that support government law-enforcement efforts under the auspices of, or closely linked with, the Last Great Ape Organisation (LAGA) (already initiated by WAEMU) (see also Chapter 3 on Central Africa). The NGOs\u2019 intervention should be supported but not coordinated by the regional insti- tutions to preserve their specific approach. ( 29 ) Benin and Burkino Faso signed an agreement on 12 July 1984 to fight against poaching; Niger joined in 1986. The agreement was implemented from January 1986.

Security communications \u2022 Provide regular information on the evolution of intelligence, security and legal proceedings. \u2022 Define indicators and benchmarks for actions to dismantle wildlife trafficking networks. \u2022 Monitor and communicate operations by the designated authority within regional institutions (WAEMU \u2013 ECOWAS). \u2022 Provide full press coverage. The interventions should be carried out under the coordination of a special task force headquarters in the WAEMU (currently under discussion) and implemented by a competent body or an associ- ation of competent bodies. 5.1.8 Special analysis Monitoring and planning of highly threatened species and habitats This is a priority action that must establish: (i) the status of the most endangered species and habitats and (ii) a bailout plan at regional and interregional levels (i.e. a plan for an emergency package in support of threatened key species such as desert antelope and gorilla, and habitats such as the Inner Niger Delta and its mangroves). The actions must be entrusted to the IUCN specialist groups or to specialised NGOs. The actions must be associated with PHVA analysis (see below) and could lead to joint actions in situ and ex situ conservation between specialist national conservation agencies, NGOs and international institu- tions, and WAZA. Population and habitat viability assessment (PHVA) The PHVA is a key planning tool to develop targets and recom- mendations for the conservation of endangered species and hab- itats, or for the analysis and support for the introduction or reintroduction of individuals into a new habitat. The PHVA is based on knowledge of stakeholder groups and uses stochastic and social measures (threats and opportunities), each of them with a degree of sustainability and uncertainty, leading to con- crete proposals. The core element of the PHVA is a quantitative assessment of the risk to species and habitat extinctions, a pro- cess known as population viability analysis, or PVA. Population viability analysis evaluates the risk of wildlife population decline or extinction under current conditions, or under future conditions by using computer simulation models. The model can project the demographic behaviour of a simulated population for a specified period of time into the future, under a specific set of assumed conditions. These underlying conditions can then be altered to determine the primary drivers of population growth or decline, as well as the best options for population manage- ment to minimise the risk of extinction. The PHVA has successfully contributed to preserving the last pop- ulation of Giraffe peralta in West Africa. Considering the high extinction risk of species and habitats in West Africa, this strategic approach proposes using this key tool in a programme of direct action to better target interventions in order to safeguard endan- gered species and habitats. New or larger KLCs and KCAs In West Africa, the high level of degradation of wildlife, the inad- equate representation of ecosystems and habitats, and the frag- mentation and reduced connections between the PAs all contribute to the need for a special contingency plan to better amalgamate protected areas, forming new Key Landscapes for Conservation to recover significant wildlife ecosystems and endangered species and habitats. The action is critical but will not succeed unless some emergency actions are first taken. Direct interventions for saving the PAs identified in this document are urgently required, alongside a brief initial presentation phase to national and regional institutions in West Africa to confirm and win support for the strategic approach. The process of creating new PAs is very important, but it is a long and difficult step that requires emergency interven- tions on existing sites of conservation if it is to succeed. ",
        "| 369 Indicative conservation actions The intervention in support of KLCs should be carried out under the coordination of a special unit with headquarters in WAEMU and implemented by a competent body or an association of com- petent bodies. The specially tasked WAEMU unit should propose KLC formation studies in the following prioritised ecosystems: \u2022 wetland ecosystems in the savannah ecotype (e.g. Hadejia- Jamare Komadogu Yobe Basin) so as to prevent the further decline of wetlands and to preserve the Afrotropical-Palaearctic and intra-African bird migrations; \u2022 new and/or larger KLCs and KCAs to protect wildlife ecosys- tems in the forest and mangrove/coastal ecotypes. In the case of marine-coastal PAs, the planning should take place in col- laboration with the strategic plan for marine protected areas on the Atlantic coast (as an implementation of the Abidjan Convention). Further information on the resources required to implement the proposed studies on formation of new KLCs and KCAs, and on wetlands, is presented in Sections 5.1.3 to 5.1.6 under the \u2018spe- cific strategies and actions\u2019 given for each major ecotype. 5.1.9 Wildlife protection training One of the principal threats to the survival of wildlife in West Africa is the unsustainable hunting and poaching of wild animals. This is related in significant part to the comparatively high human population density and long-established trade networks. On the other hand, given the decline of salaries and the increased incomes from illegal wildlife trade, corruption has also spread amongst the rangers and other staff of the parks. Illegal activi- ties, such as poaching, fishing and logging, have converted some PAs into empty forests or empty savannahs that can only be classified as paper parks. To reverse this trend, it will be necessary to return to the funda- mentals of conservation: first and foremost, full control of the parks must be gained by re-establishing the park-management tradition and esprit de corps. To achieve this it is necessary to build capacity for the protection of wildlife. The following steps are required for ranger training: \u2022 identify conservation sites with the capacity to deliver basic training for new rangers; \u2022 prepare and implement training programmes that target the specific needs of each specific PA; \u2022 support implementation of the appropriate anti-poaching programmes for each PA; \u2022 attractive career opportunities for rangers must be assured to enable staff turnover and the welfare of rangers after their period of anti-poaching activities. These interventions should be carried out under the coordination of a special task force with its headquarters in WAEMU and implemented by a competent body or an association of compe- tent bodies. \u2303 The Langue de Barbarie National Park on the northern coast of Senegal is an extremely important site for large numbers of breeding and wintering gulls and terns. #4 ",

At present, there is no single organisation in West Africa that can provide all the services needed for the interventions of conser- vation in the region. Coordinating the actions for wildlife conser- vation must therefore also ensure the establishment of institutional, technical and scientific, and organisational capaci- ties. It is recommended that the institutional reform involves the combination of existing institutions: the West Africa Economy and Monetary Union (WAEMU), the West Africa Protected Areas Net- work (WAPAN) and a task-force unit to provide support. WAEMU is more operational on conservation than ECOWAS. It has the capacity to coordinate the active and proactive processes described above during implementation by agencies, NGOs, insti- tutions and universities, as demonstrated by their expertise in other sectors (agriculture, biosecurity). Furthermore, a conserva- tion unit of WAEMU currently supports a programme of interven- tions in the WAPOK complex. This strategic approach proposes that this conservation unit is maintained and extended to under- take the coordination of the governance and implementation of the wildlife strategic approach in West Africa. To achieve theses goals, WAEMU must observe the following institutional aspects: \u2022 promote and coordinate conservation activities in the coun- tries of West Africa by complying with the regional strategic approach; \u2022 support and harmonise policies and laws; \u2022 boost the convergence plan (strategic plans) for achieving specific and inter-sectorial interventions in favour of conservation; \u2022 ensure institutional support in the fight against the illegal wildlife trade. \u2303 Monitoring the endangered population of West African (or peralta) giraffe at Kour\u00e9, Niger.

        "| 371 #4 Indicative conservation actions The technical part of the coordination unit must: \u2022 technically support WAEMU and ECOWAS in order to fully adopt the principles of the wildlife strategic approach; \u2022 upgrade the strategic approach over time; \u2022 coordinate with the regional BIOPAMA observatory on making informed decisions about directing funds towards key man- agement priorities and institutions. It is recommended that WAPAN operates on the technical aspects of conservation: (i) promote, monitor and develop the regional strategies; (iI) detect the needs for planning and managing conservation with regard to landscapes, species and habitats; (iii) identify and set up conservation actions on the ground; (iv) monitor indicators of the key aspects of PA conservation and management effectiveness in collaboration with the BIOPAMA project. The task force, as a support unit of WAEMU and the WAPAN, must ensure: \u2022 high levels of technical support in collaboration with the IUCN\u2019s Protected Areas Programme for Central and West Africa; \u2022 organisational and financial/administrative support. The proposed structure composed of WAEMU, WAPAN and the task force does not currently exist and requires a solid investment of one or two years at the beginning of the implementation phase to organise the unit, followed by several years to establish its capacity to intervene in all aspects of conservation in West Africa. Specifically, WAEMU must evolve from managing priorities for transborder parks to the promotion and support of transborder and national landscape interventions, and to improving the status of key and threatened species and habitats. WAPAN (with the West Africa Marine Protected Areas Network, or WAMPAN) must evolve from its role as a representative body of the directors of PAs to a regional technical support body coordinating the insti- tutional parties represented by WAEMU and the international technical and financial institutions. The task force must provide technical support and facilitate the mobilisation of funds for the conservation initiatives in West Africa. The task force should be closely advised by the IUCN\u2019s Programme on African Protected Areas & Conservation (IUCN-PAPACO). The IUCN-PAPACO could offer technical support, experience with both capacity building with cross-regional initiatives amongst neighbouring countries of West Africa and the mobilisation of specialist groups for analysis in decision support systems, and as a partner in the BIOPAMA project. The expertise from the EU and other international part- ners could ensure a consistent evolution of the strategic approach and help in the mobilisation of resources. The special unit on this strategic approach to conservation in West Africa (composed of WAEMU \u2013 WAPAN \u2013 task force) could assure the promotion and coordination of the following tasks: \u2022 dismantling the wildlife traffic networks; \u2022 special analysis; \u2022 wildlife protection training; \u2022 monitoring and planning; \u2022 communication; \u2022 biological research; \u2022 management \u2013 governance training. 5.2.2 Monitoring and planning The poor performance of wildlife conservation in West Africa arises from insufficient availability of information on biodiversity, and a lack of coordination and inter-sectorial approach in the interventions. Data on conservation in West Africa is insufficient, and is not available as a structured and orientated decision support system. This large deficit in the capacity of West African conservation can be improved by the use of resources and tools made available by two EU initiatives: (i) the Biodiversity and Protected Areas Management Programme (BIOPAMA) (Box 2) and (ii) the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas (DOPA) (Box 3). The two initia- tives are complementary: BIOPAMA strengthens the process of collecting, organising and structuring information as a decision support system at the local, national and regional levels; DOPA operates at a higher level on informatics infrastructures com- bined with interoperable web services connected with the Regional Reference Information System (RRIS) of BIOPAMA. The two initi- atives form a bottom-up (BIOPAMA) and top-down (DOPA) inte- grated information system as a decision support system at all levels of the interventions on conservation. BIOPAMA forecasts the establishment of regional observatories and the RRIS to improve the access and availability of data on biodiversity in the four regions of Africa. The BIOPAMA regional observatory for West and Central Africa should collect and organ- ise existing information, and also boost the collection of informa- tion through the use of a form organised for collecting vital information on the state of conservation, management effective- ness and quality of governance (this last element is scheduled as a future action). The periodic update of data scheduled by the BIOPAMA observa- tory could enable West and Central African regions to have base- lines and trends on the key aspects of their wildlife and its conservation. The objective will be to base the management effectiveness of wildlife conservation on an information baseline and related benchmarks. ",

Awareness raising is particularly needed in West Africa where there is very little environmental awareness amongst all age groups. Building conservation constituencies to change attitudes and mobilise political support for conservation will require action at many levels: \u2022 undertake environmental education at both the local level (where the direct threats are occurring) and in the urban areas (where many of the drivers of threats originate and political decisions are made); \u2022 make greater use of broadcast media and use well known charismatic personalities to deliver conservation messages; \u2022 implicate international NGOs specialised in environmental education to strengthen and stimulate national NGO environ- mental education activities; \u2022 stimulate nature clubs in schools to inspire tomorrow\u2019s con- servation leaders 31 ; \u2022 create small-scale urban natural parks to allow urban com- munity members, who may not have the means to visit or to participate regularly in nature-based recreation, the oppor- tunity to interact with nature and learn about conservation. The interventions should be carried out under the coordination of a special task force with its headquarters in WAEMU (currently under discussion) and implemented by a competent body or an association of competent bodies. 5.2.4 Biological research Knowledge on the biology and threats to West African wildlife remains relatively superficial (for instance, a survey is under- way in Togo at the time of writing to ascertain whether or not any chimpanzees still survive in that country). Although spon- soring scientific research may be outside this document\u2019s immediate scope in this instance, the need for more research must not be ignored. Apart from further surveys on the distribution of and threats to the most endangered spe- cies, better genetic data is vital for some conservation priority-setting and decision-making. To take one example, it remains a matter of debate as to how many species of elephant should be recognised in Africa. The IUCN Red List (2013) states: \u2022 Preliminary genetic evidence suggests that there may be at least two species of African elephants, namely the Savannah Elephant ( Loxodonta africana ) and the Forest Elephant ( Loxodonta cyclotis ). A third species, the West African Elephant, has also been postulated. The African Elephant Specialist Group believes that more extensive research is required to support the proposed re-classification. Premature allocation into more than one species may leave hybrids in an uncertain conservation status 32 . The African Elephant Specialist Group\u2019s statement of 2003 (AfESG 2003) does not appear to have been updated. It recommends that: \u2022 Further analysis of the existing West African samples should be carried out. \u2022 Additional genetic samples from a wider range of sites should be collected and analysed. \u2022 There should be a consensus on the significance of the genetic and morphological data between the scientists work- ing on this issue. This scientific issue needs urgent resolution, both for conservation priority-setting and for the design of legislation affecting protec- tion and trade. It is especially important to understand the dis- tinctiveness of West African elephants, which are now so rare. The Conference of the Parties (CoP) to CITES agreed in their meet- ing in Bangkok in March 2013 that the DNA testing of large ivory seizures should be mandatory. For such testing to be of full value the evolutionary genetics of all African elephants (at the DNA level) needs to be well understood as a matter of urgency . The interventions should be carried out under the coordination of a special task force with its headquarters in WAEMU and imple- mented by a competent body or an association of competent bodies. ( 31 ) For example, many of BirdLife\u2019s African Partners run long-standing nature clubs in schools across their countries. BirdLife Partners have also developed a flyway-scale education programme, \u2018Spring Alive\u2019, to help children across the East Atlantic flyway to understand and enjoy the wonder of migration.

        "| 373 #4 Indicative conservation actions 5.2.5 Management \u2013 Governance training In the West African region, biodiversity conservation activities are mainly in IUCN category II sites (national parks). Other categories of protected area and governance systems are largely overlooked for biodiversity conservation. In West Africa the focus has tradi- tionally been on highly centralised management with a strong accent on law enforcement, which requires substantial resources. Less than 100 PAs have permanent staff and resources, and these are generally insufficient. Given the current difficulties and constraints in terms of resources, policy-makers are looking towards a more decentralised and diversified approach to PA management, including greater community involvement. The new approach requires new skills, particularly for planning and the implementation of cross-sectorial and participatory management for conservation, and for managing the sustainable use of natural resources (hunting, fishing, forestry, non-timber forest products). The new approach enables livelihood issues and poverty reduction to be addressed, both in categories IV to VI PAs (where sustain- able resource use is already allowed) and in category II PAs (national parks, where development activities are conducted in the buffer zone). This change in the conservation strategic approach represents a major challenge for biodiversity conser- vation in West Africa. The new scenarios require a variety of new management competencies for ensuring the conservation of bio- diversity but at the same time boost the development process of local populations. Capacity building in the community model of conservation must be organised for the mid-level (senior site officers) and high-level officers (senior government officers and other wildlife profes- sionals working in conservation, education and environmental sectors). The most important capacity-building institutions are the \u00c9cole r\u00e9gionale d\u2019am\u00e9nagement int\u00e9gr\u00e9 des for\u00eats et terri- toires tropicaux (ERAIFT) in Kinshasa, DRC and the \u00c9cole de faune de Garoua (EFG) in Cameroon. However, neither institution is able to provide direct and specific support for implementing the wild- life strategic approach in West Africa. This strategic approach recommends an intervention to strengthen these institutions for the creation of specific conservation courses for mid-level and high-level officers from West Africa. Finally attractive career opportunities in conservation must be created if PAs are to attract and retain quality staff. Staff capacity building needs to be accompanied by attractive career prospects, otherwise the brightest managers will continue to seek employ- ment elsewhere. The interventions recommended here should be carried out under the coordination of a special unit with its headquarters in WAEMU and implemented by a competent body or an association of com- petent bodies. \u2303 A group of senior West African protected area staff participating in a regional training course at Tapoa, W National Park, Niger.

        "374 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 West Africa 5.3 Concluding recommendations Halting or reducing biodiversity loss requires tackling both its direct and indirect drivers. The direct drivers can be divided into general and specific. General direct drivers apply across the region of West Africa and in some cases to all of Africa. Specific direct drivers are formulated for each of the four major ecotypes: desert, savannah, forest and mangrove (and coastal areas). 5.3.1 Recommendations for tackling key indirect threats to conservation There are several factors in West Africa that mitigate against effective conservation actions: high political and security insta- bility, rapid population growth, slow growing economy, permanent food insecurity, significant environmental fragility, high risks from climate change, and insufficient awareness of civil society on wildlife matters. These issues generate an increasing demand for natural resources in the ecosystems, and consequently all the protected areas in West Africa face pressure from grazing, culti- vation, wood harvesting, hunting, fishing, use of water and extrac- tion of natural medicines. This results in fragmentation, reduction and isolation of PAs in the landscape with habitat loss, intrusion of human infrastructures and overhunting. Governments generally do not invest in PAs: protected areas are considered as unproductive areas that are reserved (hence the term \u2018reserves\u2019) for later exploitation and are generally not viewed as economic and spatial elements of the landscape. PA manage- ment is also inadequately supported. As a result, PAs are exploited for illegal grazing, cutting, agriculture, fishing and poaching, some- times with the complicity of PA rangers. In the case of breakdowns in law and order, the PAs easily become targets for refugees and rebel groups or are used as sources of funding and illegal trading by rebel groups and religious fundamentalist movements. Possible global solutions to indirect drivers must be linked to issues of livelihoods, including the sustainable use of natural resources and the exploitation of non-use values of biodiversity and ecosystems. Focusing exclusively on responses and values at one level (e.g. provisioning economic services) often hinders responses that could promote wider values (e.g. services that support livelihoods, cultural values). In conclusion, the following actions are recommended for tackling indirect drivers of biodiversity loss: \u2022 Managing protected areas and their surroundings for a wide range of sustainable uses. This is extremely important in West Africa where biodiversity loss is sensitive to changes in key drivers. \u2022 Mainstreaming biodiversity conservation and ecosystem ser- vices into all the primary sectors, such as agriculture, pasto- ralism, forestry, fisheries, mining and energy, through an inter- sectorial approach. \u2022 Build the capacity of African governmental and non-govern- mental institutions to adopt the new specific and inter- sectorial approaches to conservation (e.g. ERAIFT, the regional postgraduate school for the integrated management of natural resources in Sub-Saharan Africa for students and governmental officials from 23 African countries). \u2022 Strengthen the institutions with control over the environmen- tal and biodiversity impacts of mining, agro-industry, hydro- electric and other infrastructure projects. \u2022 Support government institutions on questions of internal security (police, forestry, wildlife and/or national parks\u2019 departments, and justice) with respect to wildlife law enforce- ment as part of national programmes and projects financed by donors. \u2022 Capture benefits and reduce costs for local communities, especially the local opportunity costs based on the principle of equitable sharing. \u2022 Increase transparency and accountability of the government and private sector through the involvement of concerned stakeholders and rights-holders in decision-making on bio- diversity issues. \u2022 Increase public awareness, communication and education. \u2022 Promote and facilitate awareness building in civil society for wildlife management and protection; support the growth of a network of local non-governmental wildlife organisations in West Africa. 5.3.2 Recommendations for tackling general direct threats to conservation The wide range of ecosystems in West Africa is what gives it such biological richness and diversity. From the African continental perspective, West Africa has an enviable natural heritage: \u2022 largest system of deserts; \u2022 most extensive mangrove system; \u2022 highest levels of plant and animal species richness of any forest in Africa; \u2022 some of the largest and most beautiful antelopes; \u2022 high levels of endemism; \u2022 immense importance for over two million migrant birds (Afro- tropical-Palearctic and intra-African migrations). Yet these natural resources and biodiversity are being degraded rapidly due to the complex political and socio-economic situation. In particular, West African governments generally do not give enough importance to PA management for two reasons: inadequate prioritisation of funds and poor institutional governance. The results are: (i) weak and ineffective planning, management and monitoring of PAs, and (ii) illegal wildlife trade and corruption. ",
        "| 375 #4 Indicative conservation actions Recommendations to tackle general direct drivers of biodiversity decline are as follows: Availability of funds for PAs \u2022 Increase the opportunity for more private sector investment and sponsorship in management, eco-tourism activities and in valuing ecosystem services (Payments for Ecosystem Services \u2013 PES). \u2022 Plan for long-term financial sustainability for each PA by extending the time frame of interventions and strengthening the inter-sectorial approach for community support (to reduce threats and, indirectly, surveillance costs). Institutional governance of PAs \u2022 Seek more efficient structures that avoid duplication in nat- ural resource management. This will require creating inter-sectorial guidelines on natural resource management and biodiversity conservation at national and regional levels (convergence in legislation, strategies and planning). \u2022 Create parastatal bodies, and link the wildlife skills of national and international NGOs, natural resource rights-holders and the private sector. \u2022 Integrate aspects of wildlife and habitat management into national forestry policies for logging concessions. Illegal wildlife trade and corruption \u2022 Seek greater support for law enforcement with better- equipped and trained anti-poaching units, and greater integ- rity from wildlife officers, police, army and justice. Specific measures for the West African elephant \u2022 Highlight the importance of the WAP complex to ensure the survival of West Africa\u2019s most important elephant population. \u2022 Evaluate viable populations, and provide special protection for them (e.g. the elephants at national level and for those in Zakouma NP in Chad). \u2022 Create and strengthen intelligence-gathering services, with monetary incentives for useful information leading to suc- cessful anti-poaching results. Bushmeat \u2022 Develop partnerships involving the private sector, commu- nities and government agencies for forest and wildlife management in logging concessions. This must include economic alternatives, alternative sources of protein and wildlife monitoring. Illegal live wild animal trade (see common solutions above) Weak and ineffective planning, management and monitoring of PAs \u2022 Improve data collection to build a more effective monitor- ing and decision support system (objectives \u2013 indicators \u2013 bench markers) that facilitates adaptive management and proactivity. \u2022 Emphasise the role of stakeholders and natural resource rights-holders, national and international NGOs, private sector operators and other non-traditional partners with a view to enhancing management effectiveness at the ecosystem/land- scape scale (PAs and buffer zones). \u2022 Strengthen institutional capacities, particularly through greater training opportunities, for protected area manage- ment at the local, national and regional levels. 5.3.3 Recommendations for tackling specific direct threats to conservation The major recommendation to overcome both general and spe- cific threats to conservation in West Africa in the medium term is to invest in a comparatively small number of Key Landscapes for Conservation that have the capacity to conserve viable pop- ulations of the large and charismatic wildlife species within intact and self-sustaining ecosystems. This will greatly assist in revers- ing the decline of threatened species and the loss of biodiversity in the region. Our proposals for conserving 14 KLCs are summa- rised in Table 27. On a short-term basis, we further recommend that conservation efforts are focused on Key Conservation Areas to stem the wildlife emergency, which threatens to bring about the extinction of West African lions and other key wildlife species (Table 27).

        "| 379 #4 Indicative conservation actions 5.3.3.3 Forests \u2022 Concentrate actions in the principal PAs, with equal priority for all the sites given their biological diversity and richness. \u2022 Create new or enlarged national protected areas (Liberia, Ghana and Nigeria) in the important forest blocks to comple- ment the overall biodiversity protection of this ecotype. Fill in information gaps (and scientific knowledge) and estab- lish priorities, objectives, indicators and benchmarks for con- servation actions. \u2022 Reduce threats to PAs by adopting a systems approach to ensure inter-sectorial policy and development activities, anal- ysis of environmental impacts, the valuing of ecosystem services and the respect of conservation principles. \u2022 Determine the most appropriate conservation actions for threatened species (by the establishment of PHVA analysis if necessary), the preservation of specific habitats inside or outside PAs, and the combination of in situ and ex situ conservation. \u2022 Create the political will to tackle conservation problems. 5.3.3.4 Mangroves \u2022 Apply legislation and international conventions related to mangroves, and adopt adequate policies and inter-sectorial approaches for the implementation of actions. \u2022 Concentrate actions in priority PAs and community man- grove forests. \u2022 Create new or enlarged national protected areas (Nigeria, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Senegal and Guinea) and develop an inte- grated PA and reserve network of coastal and marine areas encompassing mangrove and other coastal habitats. Collab- orate with national and international NGOs and empowered local communities to maintain and monitor the community mangrove areas. \u2022 Develop an integrated PAs and reserves network of coastal and marine areas encompassing mangrove and other coastal habitats. \u2022 Establish a fund to maintain sustainable economies that are based on the ecologically sustainable management of man- groves and coastal habitats. \u2022 Determine the most appropriate research and conservation actions for improving the management effectiveness of PAs and mangrove forests and related threatened species. \u2303 Wooded savannah in the morning mist, Fazao National Park, Togo.

Calculation of the proportion of transformed land was based on the reclassification by Hoekstra et al. 34 of the GLC3 Global Landcover Classification 35 . Hoekstra et al. defined four classes of transformed land: 1) artificial surfaces and associated areas, 2) cultivated and managed areas, 3) mosaic: cropland/tree cover, and 4) mosaic: cropland/other natural vegetation. In this section, all four classes have been integrated into the calculation of the proportion of transformed land. The area covered by classes 3 and 4 was divided by two, assuming that this reflects their mosaic character, with a certain proportion of land remaining untransformed. Note that this method does not account for the degree of fragmentation within the mosaic land cover classes. Data on protected areas (IUCN categories I-V) was obtained from WRI 2005 36 . Table 29.

Its importance, whether viewed from an economic perspective (both positive and negative) or an ecological one (as a habitat engineer), is so well documented as to be beyond dispute. Not surprisingly therefore \u2013 with almost 100 elephants being lost daily \u2013 the current onslaught on the species for its ivory is a cause for great international concern, and a key catalyst for the present study of African conservation needs and strategies on behalf of the European Commission (EC). 1.1 Status: Distribution and numbers The African elephant ( Loxondonta africana ) is still widespread, being found in 35-38 range states 1 in all four regions, as shown in Table 1 and the map that follows. The numbers given are for 2012/13, as posted on the website http://elephantdatabase.org, from which full details at country and individual population levels may be obtained. Forest populations are very likely to be under- estimated due to obvious counting difficulties. Conversely, many savannah populations have suffered heavy poaching losses since (see Section 1.2.1 below), but an up-to-date continental dataset is not yet available. The distribution of elephants varies considerably across the four regions, with small fragmented populations in West Africa, and large tracts of range remaining in Southern Africa. Holding just over 52 % of the continent\u2019s DEFINITE plus PROBABLE elephants, Southern Africa has by far the largest known number of elephants in any region. Eastern Africa holds just over 28 %, Central Africa 17 % and West Africa 1.6 %. In Southern Africa, Botswana holds by far the largest population in that region and on the continent. Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe hold large elephant populations. Data is scanty in Angola and smaller populations persist in Swaziland and Malawi. While numbers seem to be increasing in Namibia and South Africa, there appear to be declines in some of the populations in Zimbabwe and Zambia. The vast majority of Eastern Africa\u2019s known elephants are in just two countries, Tanzania and Kenya 6 . Currently two morphologically different subspecies of African elephant are recognised, namely the bush or savannah elephant ( L.a. africana ) typical of Eastern and Southern Africa, and the forest elephant ( L.a. cyclotis ) found in parts of Central and West Africa. However, recent genetic studies suggest there may be two (possibly three) distinct species.

Status of African elephant populations and levels of illegal killing and the illegal trade in ivory: a report to the CITES Standing Committee: http://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/sc/65/E-SC65-42-01_2.pdf recognise two sub-species. The derivation of separate conserva- tion strategies for the distinct forms is complicated by the hybrid- isation evident in some interface areas, notably in Central Africa. Overall, the species is currently listed as \u2018vulnerable\u2019 on the IUCN Red List, but with an increasing number of populations being reduced to critically low numbers as a result of the range of threats described below. All populations of African elephant have been listed on CITES Appendix I since 1989, except for four national populations that were transferred back to Appendix II (Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe in 1997, and South Africa in 2000). 1.2 Threats and trends Land-use pressure, range and habitat loss, human elephant con- flict, and illegal killing for both meat and ivory all pose threats to the long-term survival of elephant populations across Africa. Recent research also points to climate change and the increasing frequency of droughts as a major threat to elephant populations in the Sudano-Sahelian ecoregion. At this time, however, by far the most acute threat facing African elephants arises from large-scale poaching and the illegal ivory trade as confirmed by data derived from two key Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) monitoring programmes, namely Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) and Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS). The fact that the MIKE and ETIS data is consistent with each other gives confidence that each set of results and their interpretation is robust. The information provided throughout this section is sourced pri- marily from the status report that was jointly prepared for the 65th Meeting of the CITES Standing Committee, 7-11 July 2014, by the AfESG, MIKE and ETIS on behalf of the CITES Secretariat 7 . 1.2.1 Illegal killing The MIKE programme is managed by the CITES Secretariat under the supervision of the CITES Standing Committee and imple- mented in collaboration with IUCN. Since implementation began in 2001, MIKE has benefitted from the generous financial support of the European Union. MIKE aims to inform and improve decision-making on elephants by measuring trends in levels of illegal killing of elephants, identifying factors associated with those trends, and by building capacity for elephant management in range states. To date, MIKE operates in a large sample of sites spread across elephant ranges in 30 countries in Africa and 13 countries in Asia. There are some 60 designated MIKE sites in Africa, which include many of the continent\u2019s prime national parks \u2013 such as Chobe, Etosha, Kruger, Ruaha, South Luangwa and Tsavo \u2013 as well as some of its most famous game reserves, such as Selous and Niassa. Taken together, the elephant popula- tion at MIKE sites is estimated to represent 30-40 % of the con- tinent\u2019s elephant population. MIKE data is collected by law-enforcement patrols and other means in designated MIKE sites. When an elephant carcass is found, site personnel try to establish the cause of death and other details. This information is recorded in standardised carcass forms, details of which are then submitted to the MIKE programme. \u2303 Elephants gather at one of the dry season water holes in the Bahr Salamat, Zakouma NP, Chad. During the rainy season the elephant disperse over a wide area outside the park where they are more vulnerable to poaching. ",

        "| 405 #5 | 405 Interregional section on elephants ( 8 ) Carcass ratios were roughly 33 % and 15 % respectively, compared with the 7-8 % associated with natural mortality. ( 9 ) 5 PIKE levels above 0.5 indicate that illegal annual off-take is likely to be higher than the number of elephants born annually into a naturally increasing population. In other words, a PIKE level of 0.5 or higher means that the elephant population in question is very likely to be in net decline. \u2303 A group of elephants killed by poachers at a watering hole in Zimbabwe\u2019s Hwange National Park, October, 2015. Data from MIKE sites show that Southern Africa presents the lowest overall poaching levels while Central Africa consistently presents the highest. A database of more than 13 000 carcass records has been assembled so far, providing a substantial information base for statistical analysis. MIKE evaluates relative poaching levels based on the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE), which is calculated as the num- ber of illegally killed elephants found, divided by the total number of elephant carcasses encountered by patrols or other means, aggregated by year for each site. Coupled with estimates of pop- ulation size and natural mortality rates, PIKE can be used to esti- mate the number of elephants killed and absolute poaching rates. The data shows a steady increase in levels of illegal killing of elephants starting in 2006, with 2011 displaying the highest levels of poaching since MIKE records began in 2002. In 2012 and the first six months of 2013, the trend seems to flatten out at levels close to those recorded in 2011. PIKE levels seem to have begun a gradual decline thereafter, reaching similar levels in 2013 to those recorded in 2010. Despite the decline since 2011, poaching levels overall remain alarmingly high, with nearly two-thirds of dead elephants found in 2013 deemed to have been illegally killed. Overall, the elephant population at MIKE sites is likely to have continued to decline in 2013, as poaching rates exceed likely intrinsic population growth rates. In some areas, a decline in PIKE may be the result of a substantial decline in the elephant population, making it more difficult for poachers to find suitable targets in such areas. However, without recent and reliable elephant population esti- mates from such areas, it is difficult to verify the impact of poaching on such populations. Differences in poaching levels between the different African regions are evident, with Central Africa consistently showing the highest overall poaching levels (see also Chapter 3, Section 2.1.2), in contrast with Southern Africa (see also Chapter 1, Section 3.2.1), which has shown the lowest overall levels. In Eastern Africa, which has contributed the largest number of carcass records, the trend is very similar to the continental one. Counts of Tanzania\u2019s biggest elephant populations carried out in October/ November 2013 show alarming declines since the previous counts in 2009. In this period, the Mikumi-Selous population (numbering around 109 000 in 1976), fell from an estimated 38 975 to 13 083 (66 %), while the Ruaha-Rungwa population fell from an estimated 31 625 to 20 090 (36.5 %) 8 . West Africa has the smallest elephant population and has submitted the smallest number of records (see also Chapter 4, Section 6.1.1). As a result, there is a high level of uncertainty around PIKE estimates in that region, which makes it difficult to determine the trend. Nevertheless, overall higher PIKE levels are apparent in all four African regions in the second half of the period covered by MIKE monitoring (2008-2013). While PIKE levels in 2013 were lower than in 2011 in all four regions, they remain above the 0.5 level in all but Southern Africa 9 . Modelled PIKE levels for 2012 translate into an estimated 15 000 elephants illegally killed across all African MIKE sites in that year alone, or about 7.4 % of the total elephant population at those sites. As elephant populations seldom grow at more than 5 % p.a., the model suggests that at this level of offtake, the overall pop- ulation in MIKE sites is likely to have declined by around 2 % in 2012. Furthermore, the model estimates that the threshold of sustainability was crossed in 2010, with poaching rates on top of natural mortality remaining above the population growth rate ",

It is therefore likely that populations at MIKE sites have been in net decline since 2010. This does not mean declines at every site, merely a decline on average, with some taking larger losses perhaps and some smaller. However, most observers believe this average decline, extrapolated from a 30-40 % sam- ple, almost certainly reflects a continent-wide trend for the spe- cies as a whole. One authoritative study published recently has concluded that over 100 000 African elephants were killed in the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, an average of 33 630 per year 10 . According to the AfESG, it is not yet possible to derive a robust estimate for the scale of elephant poaching in 2013. However, an indication can be derived from the above estimate of ele- phants killed at MIKE sites in 2012 (around 15 000) in combina- tion with the estimated change in PIKE between 2012 and 2013 (a decline of 5.86 % across African MIKE sites). This preliminary and rough calculation results in an estimate of more than 14 000 elephants killed at MIKE sites alone in 2013. The AfESG has stated that there are good reasons to believe that the number of ele- phants illegally killed throughout Africa in 2013 ran, as in previ- ous years, into the tens of thousands, perhaps in the order of 20-22 000. Also in line with previous evidence, however, is the likelihood that MIKE-derived data returns underestimates of mortality at an overall continental level 11 . 1.2.2 Illegal trade According to ETIS, the frequency of large-scale ivory seizures, in which 500 kg or more of ivory is seized through a single law- enforcement intervention, has increased greatly since 2000. Prior to 2009, an average of five and never more than seven such events occurred each year but thereafter an average of 15 and as many as 21 large-scale ivory seizures have taken place each year. In the period from 2009 to 2013, at least 77 large-scale ivory seizures occurred. Although data for 2013 may still be incomplete, 19 large seizures have been reported to ETIS for the year, yielding a greater quantity of ivory than any other previous year going back to 1989 12 . Whether this constitutes an increase in actual illegal trade vol- umes or reflects improved law enforcement in particular countries remains to be determined. It is known, however, that the upward surge in terms of the weight of ivory seized from 2009 until 2011 does represent increased illegal activity, which is being driven by consignments in the large-scale weight class. Furthermore, such seizures are indicative of the presence of organised crime in the illicit ivory trade, which often involves Asian-run, Africa-based sourcing of ivory. According to TRAFFIC, the raw data on large- scale ivory seizures represents the salient evidence of ivory trade crime orchestrated by transnational criminal operatives. As large- scale seizures of ivory typically generate media coverage and become known soon after they occur, tracking them serves as a crude early indicator of the illicit ivory trade as a whole. For this reason, the 2013 data is regarded with considerable alarm as it suggests that the illegal trade in ivory is continuing to increase. \u2303 A pile of confiscated ivory weighing just over 6 tons was burnt by the Ethiopian authorities in Addis Ababa in March 2015. Ethiopia has lost 90 percent of its elephants in just three decades. ",
        "| 407 #5 | 407 Interregional section on elephants ETIS large-scale seizure data has allowed an analysis of the routes followed by illegal ivory when in transit between supply countries in Africa and consumer countries (mostly) in Asia, and show how these keep changing in order to elude detection. However, determining the provenance of seized ivory remains a major constraint to dismantling the illicit networks involved in the trade (see also Section 1.4.5 below). 1.2.3 Factors associated with poaching and the ivory trade The MIKE programme has statistically evaluated relationships between PIKE levels and a wide range of ecological, biophysical and socio-economic factors at site, national and global levels. Three such factors consistently emerge as very strong predictors of poaching levels and trends: poverty at the site level, govern- ance at the national level and demand for illegal ivory at the global level. Previous MIKE analyses have used human infant mortality rates in and around MIKE sites as a proxy for poverty. Infant mortality emerged in successive MIKE analyses as the single strongest site- level correlate of PIKE, with sites suffering from higher levels of poverty experiencing higher levels of elephant poaching. A new poverty-related variable, namely the proportion of people living in extreme poverty (defined as people living with less than USD 1.25 per day) in and around MIKE sites was tested in the most recent analysis. This variable was found to be as strong a predictor of PIKE at the site level as the infant mortality rate, with higher poaching levels found in and around sites where poverty is more prevalent. While these relationships highlight a close linkage between the well-being of people and that of the elephant popu- lations with which they coexist, they do not imply that wildlife conservation areas \u2013 or indeed poaching therein \u2013 cause poverty. Rather, these relationships simply suggest that poaching is more likely to be adopted as an economic activity in areas where human livelihoods are insecure. At the national level, the strongest correlate of PIKE is govern- ance, as measured by Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) or the World Bank\u2019s Worldwide Governance Indicators. High poaching levels are more prevalent in countries where governance is weaker, and vice versa. This is likely to be a causal relationship, with poor governance facilitating the illegal killing of elephants and the movement of illegal ivory, be it through ineffective law enforcement or active aiding and abetting by unscrupulous officials. Ultimately, however, the illegal killing of elephants for ivory is driven and sustained by demand from consumers who are willing to pay for illegal ivory. ETIS analyses indicate that, in recent years, China has become the world\u2019s largest consumer of illegal ivory. This is corroborated by the fact that temporal PIKE trends are strongly related to patterns in consumer spending in that country. This relationship does not hold for other traditional destination markets for ivory (Europe, United States of America or Japan) or for countries known to be important transit points in the ivory trade chain (Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand or Vietnam). However, as household consumption expenditure is a measure of general consumer demand for goods and services, and not a spe- cific measure of demand for ivory, a more specific proxy measure was sought with a view to replacing it in MIKE analyses. To that end, it was recently hypothesised that demand for mammoth ivory \u2013 the international trade in which is legal and reliable data on which is therefore more easily obtainable \u2013 would serve as a better predictor and a better proxy for elephant ivory demand, not least because China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) account for virtually all global imports. \u2303 Officials hold confiscated African elephant tusks before destroying the ivory at the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, in Bangkok, Thailand. Just over two tons of ivory were destroyed during this event in August 2015. ",
        "408 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections When tested against models developed in previous analyses, the time series of mammoth ivory import values per kilogram for China (including Hong Kong SAR) was indeed found to be a better predictor of PIKE than the Chinese household consumption expenditure variable used in the past. In other words, mammoth ivory import prices do appear to be a better proxy for the demand for ivory than household consumption expenditure. It is important to note that no claim has been made that mammoth ivory imports cause elephant poaching. It is rather more plausible that high demand for ivory results in both high raw mammoth ivory prices and high levels of poaching in Africa. Temporal PIKE trends are also correlated with another demand- related variable, namely trends in large-scale ivory seizures as reported by ETIS. The three main factors identified by MIKE anal- yses \u2013 poverty, governance and demand \u2013 explain nearly two- thirds of the variation observed in PIKE levels across African sites. Poverty and governance explain spatial patterns in poaching levels, while demand accounts for the temporal trend. As things stand, the four range states with elephant populations currently on Appendix II of CITES may not apply to sell ivory until after 2017 at the earliest, and so any such proposal could not be considered until the Conference of the Parties (CoP) 18 (in 2019) at the earliest. States with elephants on Appendix I may not apply to sell ivory. The earliest any Appendix 1 state may apply to down-list its elephant populations to Appendix II would be at the next conference, CoP17, in South Africa (in 2016). No seized ille- gal ivory may ever be sold. However, it must be noted here that there is a considerable diver- gence of opinion amongst professional conservationists as to whether or not totally banning the trade in ivory is in the ele- phants\u2019 best interests. This often heated debate has been raging since the CITES ban of 1989, and continues to this day. The related literature is extensive. Amongst the latest pro-trade inputs are arguments based on claims that the massive increase in ivory poaching in Africa is not being driven by rising demand for carved ivory in China, but by speculative stockpiling of ivory in China, and that the current policies stamping down on the illegal ivory trade are actually fuelling the main driving force behind poaching, cre- ating a counter-productive positive feedback loop 13 . On the anti- trade side, recent inputs based on advanced economic analyses of market and trader behaviour indicate that a properly controlled and supervised legal trade as a mechanism for balancing supply and demand can never be attained in a corrupt world 14, 15, 16 (see also Section 2.4.6). The simple conclusion to be drawn from this intractable debate is that probably there never will be any single or perfect solution to the ivory trading dilemma, which just underlines the importance of improving in situ protection, while at the same time working to stop or at least minimise demand from the ultimate consumer. When it comes to trade issues, the EU should maintain a policy of following and supporting decisions of CITES\u2019 full Conference of the Parties. This recommendation is made in the belief that the CoP will not make decisions that are not based on an adequate consensus of scientifically informed opinion. In the meantime, suit- able measures to support the ongoing fight against the illicit trade in ivory are considered in Section 1.4.4.2 below. 1.3 Conservation planning and coordination In 2010, the continental African Elephant Action Plan (AEAP) was adopted by a consensus of all the African elephant range states. The AEAP defines a set of eight key objectives aimed at securing, and restoring where possible, sustainable elephant populations throughout their present and potential range in Africa. At the next level, regional action plans are in place in Central, Southern and West Africa. Fifteen countries have also adopted national action plans and strategies in the last ten years. A list of existing strat- egies is given in Table 2. Other more recent plans not listed include, at a continental level, the 14 Urgent Measures formulated and adopted by the recent high-level African Elephant Summit whose purpose is described in Box 1, while the measures themselves are reproduced in Annex 1. Building on both the AEAP and the AES, Gabon is promoting the Elephant Protection Initiative, an agreement that is to be signed between itself, Botswana, Chad, Ethiopia and Tanzania regarding the \u2018federation\u2019 of national parks and wildlife agencies in order to exchange lessons learned and technical experience aimed at pro- moting south-south cooperation and finding African solutions to the elephant crisis.

African Elephant Summit (December 2013) The African Elephant Summit (AES) took place in Gaborone, 2-4 December 2013. It was co-hosted by the Republic of Botswana and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to address a conviction that, given the magnitude of the problem, and the fact that illegal trade is increasingly entrenched in organised crime networks, the African elephant crisis required political commitments at the highest level of government to secure viable elephant populations across the continent and to halt the illegal ivory trade at all points along its value chain. Thus the AES brought together senior representatives of African elephant range states, ivory transit states and the states that are the major consumers of ivory in order to secure their commitment to take urgent measures designed to remove barriers to effective elephant protection and significantly reduce the amounts of illegal ivory in trade. The Summit duly debated, endorsed and adopted a set of 14 well-defined Urgent Measures required over a 12-month period from both supply and consumer states. \u2303 Botswana\u2019s President Ian Khama (R) stands with IUCN Director General Julia Marton-Lef\u00e8vre on the opening day of the African Elephant Summit, held in Gabarone, Botswana, from 2-4 December 2013.

        "410 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections At a national level, the eight countries most implicated in the illicit ivory trade were required by CITES at its March 2013 CoP16 in Bangkok to prepare special National Ivory Action Plans and take urgent measures to implement them in order to demonstrate their commitment to the Convention 17 . These eight plans have been prepared and submitted, and their implementation will be subject to periodic review at meetings of the CITES Ivory Enforce- ment Task Force. The CITES Secretariat is now also seeking similar plans from countries of \u2018secondary concern\u2019 (Cameroon, the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Mozambique and Nigeria) as well as from others identified as being of \u2018importance to watch\u2019 (Angola, Cambodia, Japan, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) 18 . A number of bodies exist which provide oversight and coordina- tion to the other more regular plans listed in Table 2. Chief amongst these is the African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) 19 of the IUCN\u2019s Species Survival Commission (SSC), which maintains the African Elephant Database (AED) and periodically publishes African Elephant Status Reports (AESR) and various guidelines for many aspects of elephant management. Most elephant range states are party to CITES, and with all populations listed on either Appendix I or II, the Convention provides the single most powerful instrument available to influence action to protect and manage elephant populations on the one hand, and investigate and control the ivory trade on the other. CITES decisions on these matters are guided primarily by information collated and interpreted by AfESG in close collaboration with the MIKE and ETIS programmes 20 : these three bodies being mandated to report to the CITES Stand- ing Committee on all elephant-related decisions and resolutions of the parties (see Section 1.2 above). The AEAP is overseen by a Steering Committee (see also Section 1.4.2), while the national agency responsible for wildlife manage- ment is generally responsible for the implementation of national level plans. 1.4 Action being taken The recent escalation in elephant poaching and the widespread publicity it has received has stimulated a huge response from intergovernmental organisations (IGOs), governments and non- governmental organisations (NGOs) (see the extensive list in Sec- tion 3.3.4 on trade in this chapter). One interesting revelation of this was the finding at the recent African Elephant Summit that action is already being taken by numerous organisations of different types with respect to ALL of the 14 Urgent Measures adopted by the delegates. In addition to the \u2018shock-value\u2019 of the publicity given to the car- nage, another very important factor underlying the overall response is the links that have been made to national security in sensitive parts of the continent and the growth of organised crime activity in Africa. Due to escalating demand, a kilo of ivory can sell for USD 3 000 to collectors in China or America. With such high value, ivory is widely believed to have become a commodity that rebel militias such as the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA), which originated in Uganda, or al-Shabaab in Somalia use to finance their operations, at least opportunistically. Having received enough credible information as to links between poaching and LRA activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the UN Security Council adopted a Resolution (No 2136) in January 2014, which makes specific reference to illegal wildlife trafficking, espe- cially of elephant ivory, and authorises sanctions such as arms embargos, travel bans and asset freezes on groups and individ- uals that are complicit in illegal wildlife trade 21 . Together with negative impacts on the tourism sector, the appar- ent links to organised crime as well as national and regional insecurity have helped motivate both national governments and international organisations to take action. As summarised below, the character of the overall response varies: some of it is general, while some is focused on a specific issue or site.

        "| 411 #5 | 411 Interregional section on elephants 1.4.1 Awareness raising Awareness of the elephant poaching and ivory trade crisis has been raised through a variety of means including publications, meetings, campaigns and other initiatives. A few notable examples are: \u2022 E lephants in The Dust: The African Elephant Crisis , a joint report from United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), CITES, IUCN and TRAFFIC, published in English and French, and launched in March 2013 at the CITES CoP16 in Bangkok. \u2022 Vira V. and T.

Out of Africa: Mapping the global trade in illicit elephant ivory . Born Free USA and C4ADS. \u2022 The African Elephant Summit, described above, can be thought of as a high-level awareness exercise directed at the governments of both ivory supply and consumer states. Of course its main focus was on solutions, not only awareness (see Box 1). \u2022 The world\u2019s leading conservation NGOs have all responded to the poaching crisis with their own awareness and fund-raising campaigns to support specific elephant and ivory-orientated programmes and projects addressing both ends of the supply chain, as well as the routes in between. The Wildlife Conser- vation Society\u2019s (WCS) 96 Elephants campaign is just one example. Some approaches are innovative: WildAid has pio- neered the use of celebrities to modify public opinion in China, while Space for Giants has run a combined publicity and fund-raising campaign through The Independent , a leading UK daily newspaper. Hands Off Our Elephants is a notable example from Kenya of a national level campaign in a \u2018source country\u2019 led by an indigenous NGO, in this case an organisa- tion called WildLife Direct. The campaign has published strong-impact advertisements, and has benefited from the direct involvement and support of the country\u2019s First Lady: it has also signed a mutually supportive Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with UNEP. NGO awareness campaigns in \u2018consumer countries\u2019 are mentioned in Section 1.4.4.3 below, headed \u2018Stop the demand\u2019. \u2022 Destroying ivory stockpiles. An increasing number of countries have burnt or crushed their stockpiles recently (e.g. Belgium, Chad, China, France, Gabon, Hong Kong SAR, Philippines and the United States of America in the period 2012-2014). 1.4.2 Funds dedicated to elephant conservation \u2022 African Elephant Fund. An African Elephant Fund (AEF) jointly administered by a Steering Committee (AEFSC) and UNEP has been put in place to help fund the implementation of the AEAP, for which UNEP charges a modest cost-recovery overhead. Governance is vested in the range states who elect the AEFSC, which in turn follows well designed grant-making procedures based on sound eligibility criteria. At the time of writing there have been only two funding rounds resulting in a number of small grants. One reason for this is that meetings of the AEFSC cannot be financed by the fund, so it meets seldom and opportunistically. Donors have included the USA and South Africa, as well as the following EU Member States: France, Germany, Netherlands and the United Kingdom, with Germany and the Netherlands both announcing further con- tributions at the recent African Elephant Summit 22 . To date, all donations have been relatively small in relation to the AEAP\u2019s overall budget of USD 97 million. So far grants total- ling just over USD 367 000 have been disbursed to 12 projects in Eastern (49 %), Southern (17 %) and West Africa (34 %). Few if any applications have been received from Central Africa and none approved. According to a report received from UNEP as administrator of the fund, there is approximately USD 567 000 available for projects. Consequently a third call for proposals is anticipated before the end of 2014. \u2022 Elephant Crisis Fund. Save the Elephants (STE) and the Wild- life Conservation Network (WCN) have created and jointly administer the Elephant Crisis Fund (ECF), which aims to address the current ivory crisis and complement other efforts by the growing coalition of concerned organisations. The ECF intends to provide at least USD 10 million to partners around the globe that are undertaking actionable projects focused on anti-poaching, anti-trafficking and demand reduction over the next five years. The Elephant Crisis Fund was launched in 2013 and has already been able to make a difference for elephants. As of September 2014, the ECF had disbursed over USD 2.8 million, supporting 15 anti-poaching projects, 8 anti- trafficking projects and 9 demand-reduction projects across Africa and East Asia. \u2022 CGI Partnership to Save Africa\u2019s Elephants. In 2013, the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) brokered a formal partnership with the Wildlife Conservation Society, African Wildlife Foun- dation, World Wildlife Fund, International Fund for Animal Welfare, Conservation International and a number of other organisations 23 committed to preventing further elephant poaching by directly targeting the chief drivers of poaching.

        "412 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections This commitment takes a three-pronged approach by dedi- cating funding to \u2018stop the killing\u2019, \u2018stop the trafficking\u2019 and \u2018stop the demand\u2019. A total of USD 80 million 24 will be used to hire and train park rangers at 52 MIKE sites encompassing a large proportion of the entire elephant population in Africa; to fund sniffer-dog teams along the top smuggling routes; and to train law-enforcement officials and judges responsible for prosecuting international trafficking gangs. The CGI is look- ing to raise an additional USD 70 million for the anti-poaching plan over the next three years. Following the great success of the first year\u2019s single commitment, the CGI announced at its Annual Meeting on 23 September 2014 a scaling-up of the partnership into the Elephant Action Network , which now includes 21 different commitments made by 16 individual organisations, which reach 58 different countries and touch upon each of the same three key pillars: stop the killing, stop the trafficking, stop the demand. The network now has formal links with the Gabon-led Elephant Protection Initiative (see Section 1.3 above). \u2022 African Elephant Conservation Fund. As part of its Wildlife Without Borders programme, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) administers the AECF. In 2012, USFWS awarded 20 new grants for African elephant conservation, totalling USD 1 397 916, which raised an additional USD 1 606 004 in leveraged funds. Field projects in 13 countries were sup- ported. Over USD 30 million were allocated in the years 2007 to 2012. \u2022 Species Protection Grant Fund. This is a relatively new trust fund being raised and administered by the African Wildlife Foundation to protect a range of \u2018flagship\u2019 species including the African elephant for which an associated action plan has been developed using an in-house methodology that identi- fied ten key populations qualifying for priority support 25 . \u2022 MIKES Emergency Response Mechanism. The upcoming MIKES programme (see below), includes a small (c. USD 0.5 mil- lion) but important provision for flexible emergency action. \u2022 Following adoption of the Paris Declaration in December 2013 (see Section 3.3.2), the French Government donated EUR 10 mil- lion to Gabon to support the fight against poaching. This reflects France\u2019s commitment to fight wildlife crime and was publicised as \u2018an invitation to other countries and international institutions to follow suit to save Africa\u2019s last elephants\u2019.

        "| 413 #5 | 413 Interregional section on elephants 1.4.3 Monitoring 1.4.3.1 MIKE, MIKES and ETIS The CITES Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) Pro- gramme referred to many times in this report is currently being funded by the European Commission through an interim, EUR 2 million project (MIKE 3.0) which runs until December 2014. Thereafter, the MIKE Programme will be financed by a new project called the Minimising the Illegal Killing of Elephants and other Endangered Species (MIKES) project. MIKES will be implemented by CITES in collaboration with participating range states and other partners over a 4.5-year period commencing in late 2014, with a budget of EUR 12.3 million being supported in full by the European Development Fund (EDF). The MIKES Project will build on the successes that have been achieved by the MIKE Programme over the past decade, but with an expanded focus to include: a) other CITES-listed flagship species threatened by international trade, such as rhinos and great apes; b) initiatives aimed at minimising the impact of poaching and the illegal trade on the target species, in par- ticular through efforts to strengthen the capacity and capabil- ities of law enforcement agencies to combat poaching at both site and national levels 26 , and c) piloting the MIKE Programme\u2019s successful adaptive management and monitoring approaches in selected Caribbean and Pacific sites. In Africa, support will continue to be provided for monitoring the illegal killing of elephants in the existing 56 MIKE sites, with additional support for strengthening law-enforcement capacity focused on a sub-set of eight yet-to-be-selected sites, while additional sites may be enlisted to the programme through complementary activities by partners 27 . Importantly, under MIKES, collaboration and integration with ETIS will be greatly strengthened, with MIKES providing significant support for ETIS activities. 1.4.3.2 Population surveys In order to maintain and update the African Elephant Database, the AfESG collates all available survey data and works to stand- ardise and improve the precision of the aerial and ground-count methodologies used. Survey costs are invariably high, and seldom financed by governments without external assistance. Thus secur- ing funding for surveys is a perennial challenge, and so the recent announcement of a USD 7 million grant from the Paul G. Allen Foundation to the Botswana-based NGO Elephants Without Bor- ders to implement a series of aerial surveys across the elephant\u2019s range in partnership with governments and a number of other competent NGOs is a very important contribution to the overall monitoring effort. Known as the Pan-African Elephant Aerial Survey (PAEAS), this exercise will cover savannah populations throughout much of Eastern and Southern Africa, as well as some savannah areas in Central and West Africa 28 . Surveying in forests represents a much greater challenge because of difficult access, limited visibility, more complicated data col- lection and analysis methodologies, and a relative lack of com- petent expertise in them. All this makes it difficult to raise the money needed, but some surveys have been ongoing for years, partly funded by the EU, partly by the US Agency for International Development\u2019s (USAID) Central African Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE) and partly by USFWS, although funding overall has been insufficient to carry out regular surveys at more than about a seven-year cycle, or worse, at many sites. Consequently additional funds are urgently required to support an ongoing and more frequent forest survey cycle, especially as the upcoming MIKES programme has no provision for the neces- sary ground surveys (nor aerial, for that matter). At the time of writing in November 2014, there were indications that the Paul G. Allen Foundation might fund ground as well as aerial surveys which would be extremely welcome and valuable, as without information on live numbers, interpretation of the monitoring data for forest populations will be index-based only. 1.4.4 Law enforcement As demonstrated by the Elephant Crisis Fund and the CGI Partner- ship outlined above, most programmes and projects aim to support realisation of one or more of the three key strategic objectives recognised by all organisations working to conserve elephants, and which address the full ivory value chain, namely stopping the killing, stopping the trafficking and stopping the demand. While some elements of each of these overarching strategic objec- tives concerning elephants are discussed here, a much fuller discus- sion of their application to the illicit trade and trafficking of wildlife products in general (not just ivory), and from which elephants will benefit, is given in Sections 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 of this chapter. Government action in these areas generally conforms to the pri- orities identified in their respective Elephant and/or Ivory Action Plans (where these exist). ( 26 ) Including through the Law Enforcement Capacity Assessments discussed in Section 3.6.2. ( 27 ) As mentioned elsewhere, WCS intends, through the CGI Partnership, to support MIKES objectives and monitoring protocols in 50 complementary sites, many of which are MIKE sites already.

Government responses have included strengthening existing anti-poaching forces (often PA-based), as well as forming, training, equipping and deploying specialised units or strike forces that are highly mobile and so able to move into a \u2018hot-spot\u2019 to reinforce local operations at very short notice (e.g. Kenya, Uganda). Where it is felt anti-poaching operations are needed on a very large scale, some governments have assigned units of their standing defence forces to assist (e.g. Botswana, Tanzania). Such operations can backfire badly if poorly managed. Tanzania\u2019s recent Operation Tokomeza Ujangili had to be suspended when enforcement personnel allegedly vio- lated citizens\u2019 rights by abusing their powers of search, interro- gation, confiscation and arrest, leading to the dismissal of four ministers 29 . In terms of seizures and justifiable arrests however, the resumed exercise is being deemed a success. Several countries are instituting proactive and reactive intelli- gence procedures as part of a multi-agency approach to the problem. Other government actions being taken to help stop the killing involve promulgation of truly deterrent punishments for persons caught poaching elephants (and other wildlife). In most cases this requires the re-enactment of relevant policies and laws, such as those passed by Kenya in December 2013, under which poachers now face life imprisonment and a fine of KES 20 million 30 , although concerns remain as to possible loop- holes (see Chapter 2: Eastern Africa, Section 3.2.1). In parallel with this, the training of prosecutors and the judiciary is also being addressed. The NGO approach to stopping the killing typically involves help- ing strengthen government operations at specific sites, usually PAs with important elephant populations (see Chapters 1 to 4 for many regional examples). This may cover training and equipment, including specialised equipment such as drones and tracker dogs. The WCS and the South Sudan Government have a national level elephant protection and monitoring programme in place tracking all the remaining major elephant groups in South Sudan. Save the Elephants provides elephant tracking services via Google Earth to provincial anti-poaching control centres in Kenya to help guide deployment of ranger forces and provide rapid response to poaching incidents. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has made funds available for the creation and installation of a similar elephant collaring and monitoring system for the Greater Ruaha ecosystem in Tanzania 31 . Occasionally individual elephants, invariably big tuskers, get spe- cial protection. The whereabouts of a bull named Satao, bearer of the largest known tusks in Kenya, were monitored daily from the air by the Tsavo Trust as part of their Big Tusker Project. Despite this he was killed by poachers in late May 2014; some speculate whether it was leaked information as to his location that led to his downfall. Close protection may backfire if any of those involved are or become corrupt. ( 29 ) Natural Resources and Tourism; Livestock and Fisheries; Home Affairs; Defence and National Service.

        "| 415 #5 | 415 Interregional section on elephants 1.4.4.2 Stopping the trafficking This strategy is based on the realisation of the need to integrate and coordinate the work of different agencies involved along the entire ivory value chain, between the killing site at one end, to the buyer of raw ivory or an ivory carving at the other. Although catalysed primarily by the ivory and rhino horn trades, emerging anti-trafficking measures such as Wildlife Enforcement Networks (WENs) are relevant and applicable to any illegal nat- ural product, and as such are discussed in an entire separate chapter of this report dedicated to the trade in African wildlife generally (see Section 3.7 below). Anti-trafficking measures being taken that are specific to ivory include the following: \u2022 establishment by CITES of an Ivory and Rhino Enforcement Task Force; \u2022 registration and securing of ivory stockpiles, including com- prehensive marking and inventory of stored ivory. Tools exist for stockpile management, including an ivory inventory data- base user\u2019s manual developed originally for the CITES man- agement authority of Gabon, and a new system devised by the NGO Stop Ivory for establishing an inventory using an \u2018app\u2019 on electronic tablets that meets all CITES information storage requirements, including photographs of all tusks; \u2022 destruction of ivory stockpiles: in addition to the important publicity and awareness-raising value of such measures, their destruction is recommended because they are costly to secure and maintain; it diverts scarce resources away from front-line elephant conservation; and their content may enter the illegal supply chain (through theft) and drive speculation 32 ; \u2022 forensic investigation to determine the provenance of seizures \u2013 the subject of detailed discussion in Section 1.4.5 below; \u2022 deployment of sniffer dogs specifically trained to detect ivory in port and airport situations. It should be noted also that analysis of the ETIS data is able to identify those countries most heavily implicated in illegal ivory trade flows and the roles they play in the trade as source, transit or end-use countries. These results are essential for identifying and monitoring those countries that are failing to address serious ivory trade issues. Where progress is not occurring, in spite of repeated interventions, such countries are liable to sanctions under CITES. 1.4.4.3 Stopping the demand Clearly the prime targets of demand-reduction efforts must be the current and potential consumers throughout East and South-east Asia, principally China and Thailand. A strategic response can only be effective if it is built on a good understanding of the drivers for consumption in each of the dominant consumer countries. Obvi- ously these will vary from country to country, so relevant research is a first requirement on the basis of which country or locality- specific actions to neutralise drivers should be designed. ( 32 ) The need for destruction may be repetitive: in countries with large populations, the annual accumulation of ivory from natural mortality alone is very high, meaning stockpiles are continually being replenished one way or another. \u2303 An illegal consignment of five tons of ivory confiscated from smugglers is destroyed during the African Elephant Law Enforcement Day in Tsavo West National Park, Kenya, in July 2011. The confiscated consignment, recovered from smugglers in Singapore in 2002, is believed to have originated from poaching activities in both Zambia and Malawi. ",
        "416 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections TRAFFIC is leading on consumer research approaches, while several major international NGOs are already conducting targeted and effective awareness campaigns, much influenced by the finding that the majority of consumers simply do not know anything about the cruel and devastating impacts of the illegal trade in ivory 33 . In order to highlight this they are cleverly and effectively exploiting local culture and enlisting local celebrities to the cause. Artists working for the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) for example have embellished the Chinese character for elephant to show bloody ivory and used this in advertisements. Save the Elephants (STE), in collaboration with WildAid and UNEP, brought the Chinese basketball star Yao Ming and leading Chinese actress Li Bingbing to Africa and then distributed articles and film of their reactions to gruesome poaching scenes. Following such efforts, more and more truly indigenous conservation movements are tak- ing up the challenge. Such initiatives serve to raise awareness of the issue, but in order to be certain of influencing consumers behaviour research is required into the motivations for such behav- iour, and the factors that influence it; one cannot assume that Chinese consumers do indeed respond to demonstrations of the gruesome nature of elephant poaching. A recent study has shown that a more important issue perhaps is dealing with the demand stimulated by a growing Chinese interest in arts investment 34 . Efforts from NGOs and authorities of the sort described above have greatly improved public awareness of the problems. These endeavours should be continued, but they should be more targeted by grounding them in a realistic contextual and factual understanding of consumers and their motivations. To facil- itate this, it is necessary to go beyond the conservation sector and involve current non-participants who may have an important role to play in this issue; for example, the arts investment community, cultural preservation groups and religious groups. Calls to curb demand by closing all domestic ivory markets through involuntary, legal mechanisms are gaining strength. Some US mar- kets have been closed down recently (see Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.4), and all other countries with active domestic markets are under increasing pressure to follow suit. 1.4.5 Forensic investigation to determine the provenance of seized ivory An aspect of the effort to understand and dismantle trade networks that is specific to elephant conservation is the need to be able to trace seized ivory back to its natural origin. Adding this information to records of the ports through which it was trans-shipped should greatly improve the chances of national and international enforce- ment networks being able to reconstruct and then disrupt the transit routes and trade syndicates involved in moving the ivory from source to final destination. This need has been recognised in two Decisions made at the March 2013 CITES CoP16, firstly to examine forensic investigation techniques for sourcing and ageing ivory as well as identify relevant facilities, and secondly to require all parties to submit samples from large-scale seizures (500 kg or more) for forensic analysis (see also Box 3). These decisions under- pin Urgent Measure 14 adopted by the Elephant Summit, which is to \u2018Support the development of a network of accredited forensic laboratories able to determine the origin of seized ivory according to internationally standardized protocols for DNA and isotopic anal- ysis that can provide evidence admissible in a court of law\u2019. Through the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC), the CITES Secretariat is working closely on ivory forensics with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which assists states in gaining access to quality forensic scientific ser- vices in their efforts to combat illicit drugs and crime. As a result, UNODC has recently produced a manual on Guidelines on methods and procedures for ivory sampling and laboratory analysis . Law-enforcement officers responsible for the investigation of cases involving large-scale ivory seizures are often confronted with the challenge of identifying the most appropriate way to collect and submit specimens to appropriate facilities for forensic analysis. The UNODC manual provides a practical guide that shows best practices and logistical procedures. It is intended for worldwide application in order to facilitate the use of wildlife forensics to the fullest extent possible to combat wildlife crime, and in particular the illegal ivory trade. It includes detailed protocols on methods of ivory sampling and analysis, which can be applied by law-enforce- ment officers and by laboratories with appropriate facilities. While forensic labs exist for wildlife generally, such as that run by the USFWS in Ashland (and which are even being developed in a number of African supply and Asian consumer countries), there are very few specialising in products from specific taxa such as rhinos (horn) and elephants (ivory). UNODC is drawing on its part- nership with the World Bank under the ICCWC to bolster the capac- ities of laboratories in affected countries (see Section 3.2.5). At present, expertise in ivory-specific forensic analysis is being developed around two complementary methodologies: the one based on DNA, the other on isotopes. The lab, directed by Prof. Sam Wasser at the Centre for Conservation Biology in the University of Washington, is leading with the former approach, having assembled an important reference collection of ivory samples from around the African continent; it is said that his team can now ascertain the geographic origin of a tusk to within a 160-mile radius 35 . DNA analysis focused on the origin has already produced interesting results that prove its potential utility (see Box 2, for example). ( 33 ) E.g. the awareness and attitudinal survey carried out in China as part of an ivory demand study by WildAid and STE in 2012: http://www.wildaid.org/sites/default/files/resources/WEBReportIvoryDemandinChina2014.pdf ( 34 ) Gao Y. and S.G.

        "| 417 #5 | 417 Interregional section on elephants Box 2. Ivory DNA analysis The testing of 6.5 tons of illegal elephant ivory seized in Singapore in 2002, 3.9 tons confiscated in Hong Kong in 2006, and another 11 tons confiscated in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan (also in 2006) determined that the massive consignments came from closely related elephants in specific localities: eastern Zambia for the Singapore seizure, a small section of eastern Gabon and neighbouring Congo for the single Hong Kong seizure, and southern Tanzania/northern Mozambique for all samples in the 11-ton seizure. Forensic analysis also has the power to link suspects to specific crimes. In addition to providing information on where a tusk came from, DNA analysis can be used to identify individual elephants killed in a particular incident. When a mass killing occurs, tissue samples from carcasses can be analysed, so that when and if the tusks enter the illegal market, they can be matched to that same incident. DNA analysis could also be used to show that domestic ivory markets are operating legally. Recently, Chinese officials have disputed allegations of large-scale importation of illegal ivory and insisted that there is no linkage between their legal imports and the massive elephant poaching presently taking place. One way they could prove their point would be to provide random samples of ivory from China\u2019s legal markets for DNA analysis. If that analysis showed that it is all from Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia, where one-off sales were allowed, such allegations could be rejected. But if the DNA analyses pointed to origins elsewhere, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Tanzania or Kenya, there would be clear grounds for rejecting the Chinese claims. \u2303 Personnel of the Philippines\u2019 Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau (PAWB) use a caliper and pencil to measure a section of a confiscated elephant tusk before it is extracted for DNA sampling at the PAWB headquarters in Manila in June 2013. The seized tusks were part of 13.1 tons of Tanzanian elephant tusks seized in 2005 and 2009. ",
        "418 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections A potential problem with the Washington lab, however, is an alleged reluctance to share its reference materials with other labs, mean- ing that its methods cannot be replicated elsewhere, thus main- taining an effective monopoly on DNA-based forensic investiga- tions of ivory 36 . Another is that neither it nor any of the other labs which are currently sourcing ivory to geographical locations have ever had their results independently verified anywhere else. A final problem is the lab\u2019s alleged lack of neutrality in the ivory trade debate, which inhibits some range states from using its services. Given that UNODC actively supports the work of this lab while promoting ivory forensics globally, it is to be hoped these concerns will be resolved in the near future. The separate isotopic approach, which provides both age and source information (based on chemicals linked to diet), is being led by scientists working for the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation. A pre-declared intent of this programme is to give other labs unrestricted access to its reference data collection, but this is still being built. It is reported that the sourcing of ivory or tissues for reference \u2018libraries\u2019 has been a major problem, with many range states just not participating: hopefully they will in time become more cooper- ative as the participating labs become more open and neutral. To encourage this, it is clearly important to ensure that forensic labs are independent and de-linked from any advocacy activities. A separate development that acknowledges the potentially crucial role of forensic investigations in combating elephant poaching and ivory trafficking throughout Africa is the decision taken by the CITES Secretariat at the recent internal launch meeting (8-9 January 2014) for the MIKES Project, to incorporate a new project component relating to forensic investigations, under Result 4: International actions. A provisional budget of USD 300 000 has been allocated as part of the broader Result 4 budget line for MIKES Emergency Responses. Although the specific forensic activ- ities to be supported are yet to be fleshed out (this will be done during the preparation period of the project prior to the main project launch in January 2015), the CITES Secretariat envisages that the main focus of support will be for building capacity in order to carry out forensic investigations at the site level 37 , as well as for piloting the application of forensic techniques at different levels throughout the forensics chain (i.e. site-national-international levels). 1.4.6 Human-elephant conflict Human-elephant conflict (HEC) continues to pose a serious chal- lenge throughout the elephant range, and the cursory mention afforded to it here is in no way commensurate with its huge impor- tance as a symptom of what is arguably the biggest long-term threat to elephant survival: the rapid conversion of land in Africa leading to habitat degradation and permanent range loss. Both land conversion and human-wildlife conflict (HWC) in general are considered more fully in the broader context of the various regional chapters of this report. Much of the problem lies in the fact that most mitigatory actions are very expensive, particularly in the case of HEC. Fencing is a prime example, with NGOs such as Rhino Ark devoting their entire pro- gramme to this approach. Although a number of innovative methods are emerging to add to the toolbox to help mitigate HEC (such as the strategic deployment of beehives along farm boundaries by Save The Elephants), long-term land-use planning and cooperative management of elephant populations with local communities are required to provide sustainable solutions. Studies of elephant move- ment patterns are ongoing in many sites and these are expected to provide useful information for land-use planning that would mini- mise future conflict (e.g. identification of corridors). ( 36 ) Other institutions reported to have experience in ivory DNA analysis are Duke University and the University of Copenhagen. Utah University has experience in isotopic analysis.

        "| 419 #5 | 419 Interregional section on elephants 1.5 Actions recommended for EU support Range states need urgent and sustained financial and technical support for: anti-poaching work in the field; to strengthen and enforce national laws protecting elephants and preventing traffick- ing; to deliver regional, national and international intelligence- sharing and law-enforcement efforts; to safeguard habitats; and to support communities which live alongside elephants, particularly with regard to the development of sustainable livelihoods and the reduction of human-elephant conflict. Although the actions needed to conserve the African elephant therefore are many and are replicated throughout its range, the scale and diversity of the response to date is such that any addi- tional contributions from the EU need to be carefully focused. On the basis of the review presented here, it is recommended that this focus should embrace the following urgent, short and medium- term interventions. 1.5.1 Urgent and short-term measures 1.5.1.1 Support to priority and emergency measures through the funding of funds The formal adoption of the African Elephant Action Plan (AEAP) by all range states is a remarkable and important achievement that deserves, in line with AES Urgent Measure 8, wider recognition by way of input to the associated African Elephant Fund (AEF) 38 . As noted earlier, donations to date have been limited, perhaps due to the fact that the Steering Committee (SC) is made up of gov- ernment representatives raising concerns, firstly as to the propor- tion of funds that will be spent on what is needed, and secondly as to its ability to develop large-scale projects. Given the involve- ment of UNEP and the commendable grant-giving procedures in place, the former concern is invalid. In the opinion of several persons closely involved in the evolution of the AEAP and AEF however, the second concern remains valid, at least in the sense that the political dimensions of so many range states competing for limited funds probably means it will always remain a small grants fund. The advice therefore is to boost donations, but in sensible incre- ments until such time as the fund has proved (or otherwise) its ability to absorb more. If the European Commission wishes to pur- sue its interest in supporting the AEF, it is recommended that it makes an initial donation of no more than EUR 1 million and encourages the SC to try and leverage additional funds against it. ( 38 ) This overall position with respect to the AEAP is exactly consistent with that recommended by the recent Expert Conference on the EU Approach against Wildlife Trafficking. \u2303 Customs agents hold ivory tusks in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris in February 2014 prior to the public destruction of three tons of ivory confiscated over two decades.

        "420 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections Given the crisis nature of the current situation, the European Commission is understood to be keen to contribute to unforeseen emergencies but none of its existing mechanisms allow this, and the emergency funds to be provided under MIKES are not yet available. Of the various funds devoted to elephants, it appears that only the Elephant Crisis Fund (ECF) is geared specifically to genuine emergency action without site-specific pre-conditions. Access to such flexible and quickly mobilised resources is poten- tially of very great assistance to governments and NGOs alike. Accordingly it is further recommended that the Commission should consider making a donation to the ECF, perhaps matching any made to the AEF. As noted, the ECF\u2019s basic strengths lie in its ability to respond quickly to support multiple institutions working on different aspects of the ivory crisis. Led by two well-respected non-profit organisations, the ECF combines elephant conservation experi- ence and the network of Save The Elephants (STE) with the finan- cial and administrative efficiency of the Wildlife Conservation Network (WCN). This combination provides a unique model to jumpstart and scale-up immediate strategic interventions by rap- idly deploying financial resources to carefully vetted field part- ners. STE leads the project review and vetting process: WCN leads the financial and administrative requirements of grant adminis- tration. A strong emphasis is placed on efficiency, with a short application turnaround, streamlined reporting requirements, and communications conducted virtually to ensure maximum inputs are given to conservation efforts. The ECF is committed to guaranteeing that 100 % of funds will be used to support actionable, on-the ground programmes that save elephants. Two other characteristics set the ECF apart: \u2022 Donors can double the impact of their contributions with a dollar- for-dollar match (currently up to a total of USD 1 million) \u2022 Donors who contribute more than USD 5 000 may designate their gift to support specific actions, such as anti-poaching efforts, anti-trafficking efforts and decreasing demand, or have it used as an additional match. 1.5.1.2 Forensic analysis of ivory in Africa The importance of being able to ascertain the provenance of seized ivory is elaborated above, but the ability to do so remains limited. In line with Urgent Measure 14, a network of suitably equipped laboratories is needed in both Africa and Asia to ensure that the requisite analyses can be carried out as cost- and time-effectively as possible. This is of increasing importance now that CITES parties are required to submit samples from large- scale seizures for analysis (see also Box 3). CITES and UNODC are in the process of identifying facilities in which such capacity could be developed. An obvious candidate in Africa is the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory (VGL) at the Univer- sity of Pretoria, a facility that has pioneered the DNA-based anal- ysis of rhino horn (see Section 2.4.5). Another potential candidate in Africa is the forensic lab being developed by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), originally to address bushmeat seizure issues (see Chapter 2, Section 3.2.2). From 1 to 5 September 2014, UNODC conducted a joint field visit to Botswana with experts from TRACE Wildlife Forensics Network and the Netherlands Forensic Institute to carry out a coordinated assessment of wildlife DNA forensics and identify possible models for developing wildlife DNA forensic capacity. The Agence Nationale des Parcs Nationaux (ANPN) in Gabon is also working with UNODC to develop a lab there. Box 3. Forensic investigation of ivory seizures In the coming months, compliance with the CITES decision for parties to submit samples from large-scale ivory seizures should be closely watched. While some countries might assert that financial constraints prevent them from sending in DNA samples, the truth of that claim is suspect because the analysis itself will be funded by outside sources. If a country opts not to submit samples, one might speculate whether it is doing everything it can to stop elephant poaching and ivory trafficking. And it might cause one to wonder if the government was allowing seized ivory to find its way into the illegal trade. It is, in this context, a matter of considerable concern to note that none of the countries that have destroyed ivory stockpiles since this decision was made have either inventoried or done any forensic work on their ivory before doing so (including the USA, which had strongly supported the decision). These wasted opportunities represent a serious loss of invaluable information. In contrast, a willingness to supply samples from seized ivory will help demonstrate a country\u2019s commitment to stopping the illegal ivory trade. ",
        "| 421 #5 | 421 Interregional section on elephants The development of forensic labs capable of analysing the iden- tity and provenance of a variety of wildlife products, not just ivory and rhino horn, is an important part of the overall approach to curbing the trafficking of wildlife in general. Accordingly, recom- mendations on EU support for forensic labs are presented under the Trade section of this chapter (see Section 3.9.3.4). 1.5.1.3 Support for forest census work As noted earlier (Section 1.4.3.2), the funds available for counting elephants in forests are very limited. The need for objective and repeatable enumerations of forest populations is really critical, because without the live elephant numbers the strength of MIKE information is greatly reduced. In order to secure the full value of the money invested in MIKES therefore, it is recommended that the European Commission secures additional funds to this end in line with AES Urgent Measure 5. Subject to confirmation by the executants, it is estimated that carrying out censuses on all MIKE forest sites probably requires funding in the order of at least EUR 2.5 million over two to three years. However, there are many other sites apart from MIKE sites that need to be surveyed, especially in Central Africa (see Chapter 3). Overall, the important forest elephant sites (including MIKE) will cost about USD 4 to 5 million to survey over the next five to seven years (F. Maisels, pers. comm.). At the time of writing in November 2014 there were indications that the Paul G. Allen Foundation might contribute to ground as well as aerial surveys, but the extent and duration of that support remain unknown. Competent donor coordination is therefore needed. 1.5.1.4 Support for the African Elephant Database and African Elephant Status Report Recent and current pressures on the African elephant are attract- ing a huge amount of attention from all quarters. All these inter- ested parties rely on the AfESG for accurate information on the status of the species. Therefore it is vital that the AfESG is ena- bled to continue providing reliable and up-to-date information to allow well-informed decision-making and actions. Many of the new commitments and initiatives at local, national and interna- tional levels rely explicitly on verifiable evidence of elephant numbers and trends for financial assessments to be disbursed. Accordingly, the AfESG is urgently seeking finance to ensure that the African Elephant Database (AED) can meet these expecta- tions, now and into the future 39 . Also under discussion is the potential addition of other important databases of African species to the AED platform (e.g. lions and buffalos), which could bring considerable synergies, not least of which could potentially be real cost savings to all those sharing it. The AfESG and its Data Review Working Group have numerous ideas for improvements and enhancements to the AED, but lack the resources needed to underpin its Secretariat\u2019s ability to imple- ment them, making the AED one of the AfESG\u2019s highest fundrais- ing priorities. Currently there is only one full-time staff member on the AED, and dedicated funds are sought to hire a database manager to oversee the AED, including undertaking those infra- structural improvements that have been identified as essential. The AfESG also needs funds to update and publish a full African Elephant Status Report (AESR) in both 2015 and 2018, as well as conduct a new Red List Assessment for the species in 2018. \u2303 A forest elephant mingles with bongo and forest buffalo in the mineral-rich Dzanga Bai (forest clearing) in the Central African section of the Tri-national Sangha World Heritage Site. Given the nature of the forest environment estimating population numbers of forest elephants is a complex and time consuming, but vitally important, exercise. ( 39 ) As of November 2014, USD 288 000 were still being sought to complete the co-funding required for a full four-year programme. A detailed proposal and budget is available from the AfESG. ",
        "422 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections 1.5.1.5 Ivory in the European Union In line with the USA and other nations, the EU and its Member States should develop a new Regulation to close domestic ivory markets, beginning with the implementation of Article 11 of the European Parliament resolution on wildlife crime, adopted in January 2014, which called on EU Member States to \u2018introduce moratoria on all commercial imports, exports and domestic sales and purchases of tusks and raw and worked ivory products until wild elephant populations are no longer threatened by poaching\u2019. Furthermore, and following the example of Belgium, it is recom- mended that any such Regulation includes the destruction of ivory stockpiles, in accordance with Article 12 of the European Parlia- ment resolution which calls on Member States \u2018to join other CITES parties in sending out a clear signal against wildlife trafficking and demand for illegal wildlife products by destroying their stockpiles of illegal ivory\u2019. This would incontrovertibly demonstrate that EU Member States do not tolerate either trafficking in ivory or the poaching driven by that trade. It would also place the EU in a strong position to encourage other governments to follow suit, which is important in countries where stockpile \u2018leakage\u2019 is problematic. Although contested by some commentators 40 , the destruction of stockpiles, and the closure of domestic ivory markets, are fully consistent with the decisions of the CITES CoP. 1.5.2 Medium and long-term measures 1.5.2.1 Monitoring and coordination Without continual monitoring, the objective basis on which to decide what actions are needed where and how urgently will be lost. The longer one studies any animal the better one understands it and as the 30-year Amboseli Elephant Project continues to show, this is especially true of a very long lived animal like the elephant. It is important therefore for the European Commission to recognise the need to sustain its support for MIKES and ETIS indefinitely. In other words, it should already start preparing for a follow-on to the next phase which will end in mid-2018. At the same time, all stakeholders in elephant conservation need to recognise the invaluable services and inputs provided by the AfESG in terms of general coordination: technical guidance and advice given to CITES, managers across the African elephant range states, donors, interested parties and the general public. To the urgent support needed to maintain the AED and periodically publish the AESRs already highlighted in Section 1.5.1.4 may be added the sum required to edit and publish the journal Pachyderm 41 . All this is typically done on a shoestring, and efforts to sustain the flow of core funds needed to support adequate staffing across the range, hold and attend meetings, and publish documents etc. currently consume a disproportionate amount of the core staff\u2019s time. \u2303 Long-term monitoring is an essential pre-requisite for good conservation decision making. This is especially true of very long lived animals, as exemplified by the 30-year Amboseli Elephant Project. ( 40 ) \u2019t Sas-Rolfes M., B. Moyle and D. Stiles (2014).

        "| 423 #5 | 423 Interregional section on elephants Although the MIKES budget includes nominal money for specific activities of the AfESG, such piecemeal funding is both insufficient and unsustainable. The EU\u2019s previous core support grant to the AfESG was highly successful and its evaluation showed a high level of delivery against objectives. The present study would like to rec- ommend therefore that the European Commission should not only provide fully comprehensive core funding to the AfESG over at least five years, but also to all other specialist groups with a remit in Africa. Although not all make contributions equivalent to those of the AfESG, they do all face funding challenges to some extent. A suitably well-endowed programme should be negotiated with IUCN\u2019s Species Survival Commission. It should be noted that by helping understand the status of many taxa and their conservation and management needs, this single intervention has the potential to provide multiple benefits. As such it would be an extremely cost- effective use of conservation funds. For similar reasons of coordination, it is recommended that the European Commission extends its support to the CITES Joint Ivory and Rhinoceros Enforcement Task Force, either directly or through the ICCWC. Recommendations regarding other, complementary support to these two bodies are presented in the chapter on wildlife trade in this report (see Section 3.9.3.1). 1.5.2.2 Direct support to key elephant populations and ranges In other parts of this report, arguments are presented to justify a need to focus European Commission resources on a selection of areas that are of such outstanding importance and value that basically a commitment should be made to protect them for pos- terity, at all costs. It is further argued that if that perception of value is primarily one of the developed world, then it is the devel- oped world that must be ready and willing to bear those costs \u2013 alone if absolutely necessary. The elephant features as one of a few major criteria used in the identification of the Key Landscapes for Conservation (KLCs) 42 . There is no doubt that this is justified, not simply because of its own charisma and the knock-on benefits to other ecosystem fea- tures to be derived from securing a wide-ranging \u2018apex species\u2019, but also because conserving elephants comes with costs that host nations often find socially, politically and economically difficult to meet or even to accept. In the chapter on Eastern African, it is suggested that all areas containing more than 5 % of a region\u2019s elephants should be classified as Very Important Elephant Areas and automatically be considered for inclusion in its list of KLCs (see Chapter 2, Section 4.2.1). An indefinite commitment to KLCs that hold elephants is the most effective way in which the European Commission can make a con- tribution to the species\u2019 survival in perpetuity. As part of this overall commitment, including support for behav- ioural research on elephants is particularly compelling because of the very large areas over which they have to range. Their move- ments, very often far outside the boundaries of PAs, bring them into greater contact not only with elephant poaching gangs but also with rural farmers. Human-elephant conflict is an issue that alienates local populations and leads to the further killing of ele- phants. Much effort is required to try and address the problem of elephant movements outside PAs, including the development of secure elephant corridors. Care needs to be taken that potential corridors are not just drawn on maps without taking the elephants\u2019 natural movement and habits into account. It follows that money on research to identify actual travel routes would be well spent before millions are invested in corridor developments that may otherwise fail. ( 42 ) A fuller description of the criteria used to select the final list of the continent\u2019s KLCs is given in the Summary document \u2013 Synthesis, Section 5.1. ",

Urgent Measure 1: Applying a zero tolerance approach, secure and report on maximum, and therefore deterrent, sen- tences for wildlife crime using a combination of existing laws and strengthened regulatory frameworks for investigation, arrest, seizure and prosecution of suspected wildlife criminals; such laws may include, inter alia , wildlife, corruption, money laundering, organized crime, fire arms, employment and terrorism laws. Urgent Measure 2: Form and support National Interagency Mechanisms to allow immediate action against anyone impli- cated in or abetting illegal killing of elephants and the illegal trade in ivory. Urgent Measure 3: Enhance capacity of law enforcement and wildlife protection agencies at the national level to respond to well-armed, highly organized poaching syndicates. Urgent Measure 4: Introduce elephant poaching and the illegal ivory trade as a standing agenda item of National Security Commit- tees (or their equivalent) in countries where proceeds from these criminal activities are known or are likely to be used to fuel internal conflict, armed rebellion or external aggression. Include, where pos- sible, the head of the national wildlife agency on the National Secu- rity Committee (or its equivalent) in these countries. Urgent Measure 5: Over the next year, in order to support evi- dence-based decision-making, pool efforts to improve the coverage of monitoring of: a) African elephant populations, transmitting data as a matter of urgency to the IUCN/SSC African Elephant Specialist Group, the agreed data repository for elephant population data; b) levels of illegal killing, transmitting data as a matter of urgency to CITES MIKE, the agreed monitoring pro- gramme; and c) levels of illegal trade, transmitting data as a matter of urgency to ETIS, the agreed monitoring programme. Urgent Measure 6: Strengthen cooperation among law enforce- ment agencies in range, transit, and consumer states, including through participation in activities of the CITES Ivory Enforce- ment Task Force , and, through the use of controlled deliveries, whenever possible, and other appropriate law enforcement tech- niques; with support from the International Consortium on Com- bating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC). Urgent Measure 7: States that are signatories to regional wild- life law-enforcement networks such as the Lusaka Agree- ment Task Force (LATF); Rhino and Elephant Security Group of Southern Africa Development Community (SADC); Horn of Africa Wildlife Enforcement Network; the Central African Wildlife Enforce- ment Network; ASEAN [Association of South East Asian Nations] Wildlife Enforcement Network; and the recently proposed Wildlife Enforcement Network for Southern Africa; recommit their individual support to the objectives of the regional agencies and to meeting their material, financial and human resource commitments. Urgent Measure 8: Mobilise financial and technical resources from various national and international sources utilizing those mechanisms that best support the implementation of the African Elephant Action Plan and these agreed urgent measures at national, regional and continental level. Urgent Measure 9: Design and carry out national studies and public awareness programs , aimed at all sectors, which include information on the ramifications of illegal killing of elephants and the illegal ivory trade on the economy, national security, public safety and the ecosystem services elephants provide. Urgent Measure 10: Implement efficient measures to register and secure ivory stockpiles , including comprehensive marking and inventory of stored ivory, as agreed under CITES Resolution Conf. 10.10 (Rev. CoP16). Urgent Measure 11: Develop and implement strategies to eliminate the illegal trade in ivory and use evidence-based campaigns for supply and demand reduction that use targeted strat- egies including, where appropriate, government-led approaches, to influence consumer behaviour. Urgent Measure 12: In African elephant range states, engage communities living with elephants as active partners in their conservation by supporting community efforts to advance their rights and capacity to manage and benefit from wildlife and wilderness. Urgent Measure 13: Strengthen existing or implement new legislation to classify wildlife trafficking involving organ- ized criminal groups as \u2018serious crime\u2019 to effectively unlock international law enforcement cooperation provided under the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime, including mutual legal assistance, asset seizure and forfeiture, extradition, and other tools to hold criminals accountable for wildlife crime. Urgent Measure 14: Support the development of a network of accredited forensic laboratories able to determine the origin of seized ivory according to internationally standardized protocols for DNA and isotopic analysis that can provide evidence admissible in a court of law.

        "428 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections T he recent history of rhinoceros species in Africa sends mixed messages. The Southern white rhino provides one of con- servation\u2019s great success stories, having been brought back from the brink of extinction to be the most numerous rhino in the world 44 . However, the stories of its northern relative and the var- ious races of black rhinoceros are of a dramatic conservation struggle in the face of an unremitting demand for rhino horn, despite immense conservation efforts. In recent years, this demand has escalated and with it the value of horn, to the point that no rhinos remain in West or Central Africa, and even the Southern white is under unprecedented pressure. Consequently many formerly secure rhino populations are now in grave danger. This is a cause for great international concern, and together with the parallel elephant/ivory situation was a key catalyst for the present study of African conservation needs and strategies on behalf of the European Commission. 2.1 Distribution and status White rhinoceros ( Ceratotherium simum ) Two subspecies are recognised: the Southern white rhino (SWR) C. s. simum in Southern Africa; and the Northern white rhino (NWR) C. s. cottoni , which currently has only one confirmed population in Ol Pejeta (a private Kenyan conservancy) that was created in December 2009 following the translocation from the Czech Republic of the last four potentially breeding NWR in captivity. The Northern white rhino used to range over parts of north-west- ern Uganda, southern Chad, south-western Sudan, the eastern part of Central African Republic, and north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The only previously confirmed population in Garamba National Park in north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo is now considered extinct, despite systematic ground surveys over its probable range and additional foot patrols and aerial reconnaissance. Although there was an unverified sighting in the Domaine de Chasse in 2012, and a trickle of unconfirmed reports of rhino in Southern Sudan, no incontrovertible sightings of live rhinos have been made since 2007. The Southern white rhino is now the most numerous of the rhino taxa, with South Africa remaining the stronghold for this subspe- cies despite increased poaching. Sizeable populations occur in the greater Kruger National Park (which incorporates additional pri- vate and state reserves) and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, but also occur in numerous state-protected areas and private reserves (some of which are also well protected) throughout the country. There are smaller reintroduced populations within the historical range of the species in Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Swaziland, while a very small number may survive in Mozambique. Populations of Southern white rhino have also been introduced outside of the known former range of the subspecies in Kenya, Uganda and Zambia. Black rhinoceros ( Diceros bicornis ) Throughout most of the 20th century, the black rhino was the most numerous of the world\u2019s rhino species, which at one stage could have numbered around 850 000. Relentless hunting of the species and clearances of land for settlement and agriculture reduced numbers and by 1960 only an estimated 100 000 remained. Between 1960 and 1995, large-scale poaching caused a dramatic 98 % collapse in numbers. Three recognised subspecies of black rhinoceros now remain, occupying different areas of Africa. A fourth recognised subspe- cies, D. b. longipes , once ranged through the savannah zones of central-West Africa but it is now considered to have gone extinct in its last known habitats in northern Cameroon. The other three more numerous subspecies are found in Eastern and Southern African countries. The putative D. b. bicornis range includes Namibia, southern Angola, western Botswana, and south-western and south-eastern South Africa, although today they occur only in Namibia (the stronghold) and South Africa, with a sighting of one animal in Angola and unconfirmed reports of possibly another three animals. Following translocations from Namibia and subsequent population growth, numbers of this sub- species are increasing in South Africa, with its distribution cover- ing more arid areas in the southwest of the country and expanding into the Eastern Cape. D. b. michaeli was distributed from Southern Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia through Kenya into northern-central Tanzania and Rwanda. Its current stronghold is Kenya. Smaller numbers occur in northern Tanzania. The single animal that survived in Rwanda has died. One important free-ranging population occurs outside its range in a private game reserve in South Africa. Contractually, these D. b. michaeli animals may only be translocated back to a historical range and not elsewhere in South Africa. The repatri- ation of some of these animals back to a former subspecies range in Tanzania commenced in 1997, with animals going to Mkomazi Game Reserve and Ngorongoro Crater Conservation Area, the ( 44 ) In 1910, it is thought only about 100 animals remained >2 _ Interregional section on rhinos ",

D. b. minor is believed to have occurred from southern Tanzania through Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique to the northern, north-western and north-eastern parts of South Africa. It also probably occurred in southern Democratic Republic of the Congo, northern Angola, eastern Botswana, Malawi, and Swaziland. Today, its stronghold is South Africa and to a lesser extent Zim- babwe, with smaller numbers remaining in southern Tanzania. The south-central black rhino is probably now extinct in Angola and Mozambique. The subspecies has also been reintroduced to Botswana, Malawi, Swaziland and Zambia. The latest available data on the status of all rhino species and subspecies extant in Africa today is given in Table 3 45 . As shown, the majority of Africa\u2019s (black and white) rhinos (98 %) are con- served by just four range states: South Africa, Namibia, Kenya and Zimbabwe. Botswana, Tanzania and Swaziland each conserve over 100 rhinos with smaller numbers in Zambia, Malawi, Uganda, Mozambique and Angola. The white rhino as a species is currently listed as \u2018near threatened\u2019 on the IUCN Red List, but its status is under review because if current poaching trends continue unabated it could soon qualify for re-classification as either \u2018vulnerable\u2019 or \u2018endangered\u2019. The black rhino is listed as \u2018critically endangered\u2019. By 1977, all African rhino species were listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and all international commercial trade in rhinos and their products was prohibited. However, following a continued increase in numbers, the South African population of southern white rhino was down-listed in 1994 to Appendix II, but only for trade in live animals to \u2018approved and acceptable destinations\u2019 and for the (continued) export of hunting trophies. In 2004, Swaziland\u2019s southern white rhino were also down- listed to CITES Appendix II, but only for live export and for limited export of hunting trophies according to specified annual quotas.

        "| 431 #5 Interregional section on rhinos 2.2 Threats and trends 2.2.1 Illegal killing The African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) has provided updated rhino poaching numbers up to the end of June 2014 (Table 4). While poaching, encouragingly, continues to decline in Zimbabwe, poaching at a continental level continued to escalate in 2013 with just over 1 100 being recorded poached. South Africa conserves 82 % of Africa\u2019s rhinos and it also has experienced the most poaching in absolute terms since 2009 (for more information on rhinos in Southern Africa, see Chapter 1, Section 3.2.2). Poaching also spiked in Kenya in 2013, and while at similar levels in relative terms, rhino poaching in Kenya is now a little higher than in South Africa. While poaching levels in both these countries are currently still at sustainable levels (i.e. not currently leading to population decline), both are approaching the tipping point where poaching ceases to be sustainable and deaths will start to exceed births. AfRSG modelling against a realistic range of assumed net repro- ductive population growth rates predicts that if continental poach- ing continues to escalate exponentially in 2014 onwards as it has done in the period 2008-13 (a 38.76 % increase per year), then the \u2018tipping point\u2019 \u2013 when rhino numbers start to decline because deaths exceed births at a continental level \u2013 could be reached sometime between 2014 and 2016. Furthermore, if poaching con- tinued to increase exponentially at this rate, rhino numbers are predicted to drop to less than 10 000 (by over 60 %) by the end of 2019, and reach zero the following year. However the latter figure for extinction in the wild is unrealistic as this simplistic modelling ignores the likelihood that the last few rhinos are likely to be harder to find and poach, and most probably would be under very high protection. In reality therefore, it probably would take longer to reach extinction than predicted by this simple exponential model. Nonetheless, this and other more conservative arithmetic models do highlight the urgent need to stop poaching from increasing, or at the very least to significantly slow its rate of increase, in order to buy more time for other initiatives, such as demand reduction, to work and prevent the gains of two decades being destroyed. 2.2.2 Illegal trade The main threat to all rhinos is poaching for the international rhino horn trade. Historically the demand for rhino horn has been based on two main uses: traditional use in oriental medicine and orna- mental use (for example, rhino horn is a highly prized material for making ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers or jambiyas worn in some Middle East countries). Despite the fact that rhino horn was officially removed many years ago from the formal pharmacopoeias of most countries, including China, in favour of substitutes from other species (such as buffalo), and despite the fact that demand for jambiyas is now negligible, there has in recent years been an upsurge in black-market prices for rhino horn accompanied by an increase in poaching in all range states. ( 46 ) Note that these figures represent the minimum number reported poached; the true figure is likely to be higher as some carcasses will not have been detected (especially in very large areas or in the case of very young animals). Young calves that disappeared or died after their mothers were poached and injured animals that subsequently died are considered as poaching deaths. A few of the immobilised animals that had horns hacked off have survived but these too have been counted as poached. Table 4.

        "432 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections These trends have coincided with the emergence of non-tradi- tional uses of rhino horn, such as a supposed cancer treatment (for which there is no supporting clinical evidence of its effective- ness), and as a detoxification ingredient to be shared with friends as a symbol of wealth and high status. The latter is its main use in Vietnam, to the extent that that country is now rhino horn\u2019s largest consuming market 47 . While these coincidences are relevant, the explanation for the recent upsurge is much more complex, involving the sequence and interplay of many factors on both supply and demand sides of the market 48 . As a result the average retail price of rhino horn is believed to have risen from around USD 4 700 per kilogram in 1993 to as much as USD 65 000/kg in 2012: if so rhino horn is now worth more, per unit weight, than gold, diamonds or cocaine. Such high value has encouraged a far more concerted and sophis- ticated organised crime element to enter the rhino horn market, and this is reflected in the tenacity and methods used by the current illegal suppliers. Robberies of horns from museum spec- imens across Europe have taken place. Even some dehorned rhi- nos have been poached because of the value of the remaining horn stubs. 2.2.3 Other threats Civil unrest, the free flow of weapons and better communication systems have all had a significant negative impact on African rhino conservation efforts. Poaching and civil wars in both Democratic Republic of Congo and neighbouring Sudan have had a devastating impact on northern white rhino, with no confirmed reports from either country in several years. Black rhino popula- tions in Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda have to varying degrees all suffered from the consequences of war and civil unrest since the 1960s. The negative effects of conflict have been exacerbated when combined with a lack of political will and a lack of conservation expenditure by some governments. Some detrimental effects include the trading of rhino horn and ivory for weapons, increased poaching due to increased poverty in times of civil unrest, and diminished levels of protection for rhino populations as funds are diverted away from wildlife departments. In South Africa, the live-sale of white rhinos at auction, limited sport hunting of surplus males, and ecotourism have provided incentives for private sector conservation and generated much needed funds, which can help pay the high cost of successfully monitoring, protecting and managing rhino. Historically this has resulted in a significant expansion of range and numbers on pri- vate land, to the extent that there are now more white rhino on private land in South Africa than there are rhino in the whole of the rest of Africa. However, increased poaching, increased security costs and perceived reduced incentives for their conservation have resulted in declining white rhino live-sale prices, and an increasing number of owners is now seeking to get rid of their rhino. This worrying trend, which in 2014 showed no sign of abating, threatens to reverse the expansion of range, and has the potential to also significantly reduce conservation budgets (due to declining live sales) and negatively affect metapopulation growth rates in future. The successful clamp down on pseudo-hunting by South Africa, the Czech Republic and Vietnam that was initiated in early 2012 will have significantly constricted that particular source of illicit rhino horn supply (see Box 4), but the criminals so affected could be expected to compensate by turning to alternative sources, such as illegal dehorning, poaching, or robberies. However increases in poaching in Kenya and Zimbabwe in the last quarter of 2012 suggest that other factors completely unrelated to South Africa\u2019s policy decisions and legislative and law enforcement changes are needed to explain those increases, such as increasing demand and value in end-use markets, leading to expanding corruption (government involvement in the trade) and increasingly lucrative livelihood opportunities for poachers in source countries (greater numbers of poor people deliberately choosing to become rhino poachers for money). Other threats that can cause populations to decline include hab- itat changes, competing species and alien plant invasions. 2.3 Conservation planning and coordination In 1999, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) helped produce an African Rhino Conservation and Action Plan (ARCAP). This still provides the continental framework with guidelines for the successful conservation of African rhinos, high- lighting specific actions that have formed and should continue to form part of successful rhino conservation strategies and policies. Range state management authorities and stakeholders have the responsibility and mandate to conserve rhinos in their respective countries, and the continental plan seeks to provide them with guidance to assist in the development and implementation of sound rhino conservation policies and plans. Over the years, the IUCN\u2019s Species Survival Commission\u2019s African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) 49 has, on request, routinely assisted range states develop and revise their own national plans and strategies, and these are usually reviewed and updated every five to ten years.

        "| 433 #5 Interregional section on rhinos Box 4. How South Africa fights pseudo-hunting Pseudo-hunting refers to the procedure whereby European individuals with no hunting experience or background are recruited by Vietnamese middlemen representing organised crime groups to hunt rhinoceros legally with the purpose of later obtaining their horns for purposes other than hunting trophies. To counteract this, South Africa (currently the primary source for illegal rhino horn in light of the number of animals that continue to be poached there) has introduced additional measures in terms of the regulations on hunting rhinoceros. These include all applicants being required to provide proof of the following: \u2022 that they belong to hunting associations in their country of residence; \u2022 that they have hunted African species before; \u2022 that they provide a curriculum vitae in this regard. In addition, South Africa considers whether the country of usual residence has legislation that will enable them to monitor the use of the trophy once exported from South Africa. South Africa liaises with the importing countries on this issue as soon as applications are received. Since the introduction of these measures there has been a significant reduction in the number of applications to hunt rhinoceros and the applications received are from countries that historically hunted in South Africa. Permits are currently not issued to Vietnamese citizens and this restriction will remain in place until Vietnam can confirm whether the rhino horn trophies exported to Vietnam are still in the possession of the hunters. However, this approach could be abused if, as the Czech Republic reports, third-country nationals claim to be the exporter whilst they are just middlemen. To avoid this loophole, all countries should be encouraged to cooperate with the precautionary screening being undertaken by South Africa of all countries claimed as destinations, to ensure that rhino horns are only exported where the aforementioned requirements have been met. \u2303 A Southern white rhinoceros female that lost her horns in an attack by poachers, Kariega Game Reserve, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.

Southern Africa is the only region to have prepared its own plan, but this has not been updated since the end of funding for the Southern Africa Development Community\u2019s (SADC) Regional Programme for Rhino Conservation. All other countries have prepared national action plans and strategies with confirmed and viable populations. Even Mozambique, which has few if any rhinos of its own, was under pressure from CITES to submit an Action Plan to the Secretariat by 31 October 2014. This is because of the impact that the weak law-enforcement capacity of that country is having on South African rhinos, and which facilitates the trafficking of South African horn to Asia through Mozambique. A number of bodies exist which provide oversight and coordination to these plans. Chief amongst these is the AfRSG, which maintains a database on the distribution and numbers of all subspecies and rates pop- ulations as \u2018key\u2019 and \u2018important\u2019 in terms of how critical they are for the species\u2019 survival. All rhino range states are party to CITES (as are most \u2018consumer states\u2019), and with all populations listed on either Appendix I or II, the Convention provides the single most powerful instrument available to influence action to protect and manage rhino popu- lations on the one hand, and investigate and control the trade in live animals and horn on the other. CITES decisions on these matters are guided primarily on information collated and inter- preted by the AfRSG, the Asian Rhino Specialist Group (AsRSG) and TRAFFIC, these bodies being mandated to report to the Con- ferences of the Parties, the CITES Standing Committee and the Committee\u2019s Rhino Working Group. Thus the AfRSG is the continental coordinating body for rhino con- servation in Africa.

A proposed framework for short-, medium- and long-term responses by range and consumer States to curb poaching for African rhino horn, Pachyderm 51, pp. 52-59. At a national level, the agency responsible for wildlife manage- ment is generally responsible for the implementation of country plans. National-level associations also exist to coordinate private rhino holders, such as the Private Rhino Owners Association of South Africa and the Association of Private Land Rhino Sanctu- aries of Kenya. 2.4 Action being taken The recent escalation in rhino poaching has stimulated a signif- icant response from intergovernmental organisations (IGOs), governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) com- parable to that afforded the parallel elephant and ivory crisis. Indeed rhino horn is the more valuable commodity, 1 kg being worth more than 20 kg of ivory, and thus more easily transported and hidden than ivory. The problems confronting the rhino, however, may appear more intractable than those facing the elephant due to its longer history as an endangered species, and the fact that horn \u2013 unlike ivory \u2013 has alleged medicinal values. However, more and more evidence is emerging that the rarity of rhino horn and its status value \u2013 e.g. when gifted as carved libation cups or when offered for consump- tion at banquets \u2013 is becoming the primary motivation for its con- sumption. In this respect the situation is similar to that of ivory. Most rhino conservation plans and projects aim to support one or more of the strategic approaches discussed below. Government action in these areas generally conforms to the priorities identi- fied in their respective Rhino Action Plans. Kenya and South Africa in particular have considerably increased the resources available to protect their rhino populations and to identify horn smuggled through or out of their countries. 2.4.1 Awareness raising Awareness of the rhino poaching and horn trade crisis has been raised through a variety of means, including publications, meetings, campaigns and other initiatives. A few notable examples are: \u2022 In May 2011, the CITES Secretariat distributed an updated briefing document on the Poaching of and illegal trade in rhinoceros. \u2022 In 2012, in collaboration with the United Nations Television (UNTV), CITES produced a video documentary entitled Rhinos under threat about the current surge in the illegal killing of rhinoceros and the international trade in rhinoceros horn 50 . \u2022 Many international and local conservation NGOs have responded to the poaching crisis with their own awareness and fund-raising campaigns to support specific rhino and horn-orientated programmes and projects addressing both ends of the supply chain, as well as the routes in between. The African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) for example has part- nered with WildAid and Save the Elephants (STE) to undertake a public awareness campaign in China, and is initiating one in Africa and Vietnam. The Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) continues as probably the longest-term supporter of rhino conservation in Africa. \u2022 The investigative research and ensuing publications by Dr Esmond Bradley-Martin for more than the last two dec- ades. His efforts, more than any other, helped curb the appe- tite for jambiya handles made from rhino horn. 2.4.2 Funds dedicated to rhino conservation \u2022 Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Fund (RTCF). As part of its Wildlife Without Borders programme, the US Fish and Wild- life Service (USFWS) administers the RTCF. This covers both Asian and African rhinos, the latter including recent grants to projects in Kenya and South Africa. \u2022 Species Protection Grant Fund. This is a trust fund raised and administered by the African Wildlife Foundation to protect a range of \u2018flagship\u2019 species including African rhinos, for which an associated action plan has been developed using an in-house methodology that identified ten key populations qualifying for priority support 51 . The African Wildlife Founda- tion (AWF) plan is based on information from a Rhino Emer- gency Summit, comprising representatives of rhino range states, the private sector, government officials and NGOs, which it hosted at its Nairobi headquarters in April 2012. The aim of this summit was to synthesise current thinking on what really needs to be done to save the rhino from the scourge of poaching and illegal horn demand, resulting in an inde- pendent global framework for action 52 .

This has resulted in surplus animals being translocated to set up new populations, both within and outside the species\u2019 former range. 2.4.4 Law enforcement As for elephants and all endangered species, there are three principal strategies to counter the illicit trade that is threatening their survival and which address the full rhino horn value chain, namely \u2018stopping the killing\u2019, \u2018stopping the trafficking\u2019 and \u2018stop- ping the demand\u2019. While some elements of each of these over- arching strategic objectives concern rhinos and are discussed here, a much fuller discussion of their application to the illicit trade and trafficking of wildlife products in general (not just rhino horn), and from which rhinos will benefit, is given in Sections 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 of this chapter. 2.4.4.1 Stopping the killing Effective field protection of rhino populations has been critical. Many remaining rhino are now concentrated in fenced sanctuar- ies, conservancies, rhino conservation areas and intensive pro- tection zones where law-enforcement efforts can be concentrated at effective levels using very well-trained and equipped anti- poaching forces. South African National Parks (SANParks) is now translocating rhinos from the important Kruger National Park population, not only on strategic grounds (to move some animals to safer locations further from Mozambique) but also to enhance metapopulation growth rates. There are also plans to set up an intensive protection zone in the south of the park where most of the rhinos live. Although this sort of approach has been favoured for over a decade, its efficacy is now being challenged as never before. Most range states have responded by boosting security even more but, apart from the difficulty of financing yet higher costs, many are already at the limit of what can be done and are finding that no amount of expenditure can give 100 % protection from highly motivated and equally well-equipped poachers. Other government actions being taken to help stop the killing involve promulgation of truly deterrent punishments for persons caught poaching rhinos (and other wildlife). Here some countries lag far behind, such as Mozambique, where until recently rhino poaching was still being treated more as a misdemeanour than a criminal act. Therefore it is to be welcomed that Mozambique, \u2303 Kenya Wildlife Service staff prepare to load a tranquillised male southern white rhinoceros into a cage for translocation from Lake Nakuru National Park to Ruma National Park, Kenya.

        "| 437 #5 Interregional section on rhinos ( 53 ) Under the Pelly Amendment to the US Fishermen\u2019s Protective Act, the President is authorised to impose trade sanctions against any countries seen to be undermining an international conservation agreement such as CITES. The threat of Pelly Amendment sanctions against South Korea and Taiwan prompted action to tackle the illegal rhino horn trade in those countries. ( 54 ) In 2011, a unit of eight agents from the USFWS and prosecutors from the US Justice Department launched Operation Crash , which has since undertaken a number of undercover investigations, resulting in the arrest of 18 people for trafficking, including owners of antique shops, a rodeo cowboy, a nail salon proprietor and a convicted drug dealer. In almost all cases, the smugglers were buying rhino horn through taxidermy websites, auction houses and through personal contacts in the USA, and shipping it to China and Vietnam. The US Government estimates the 18 smugglers trafficked rhino horn worth more than USD 10 million. in April 2014, finally approved new legislation criminalising rhino crimes with significantly increased penalties available. However, the extent to which this new legislation will be applied and the conviction rates and penalties handed down remains to be seen. Concern continues to be expressed about arrested suspects in Mozambique being released without trial, together with knowl- edge of the whereabouts of some firearms and rhino horns taken from poachers and handed in to authorities. Consequently the Environmental Investigation Agency and International Rhino Foundation have submitted a joint petition to the US authorities calling for Pelly Amendment sanctions against Mozambique for their failure to properly address the rhino poaching and horn trafficking in which its citizens are involved 53 . As from December 2013, Kenya too has changed its legislation to include very stiff penalties for rhino poaching, but concerns remain as to possible loopholes (see Chapter 2 on Eastern Africa, Section 3.2.1). The NGO and IGO approach to stopping the killing typically involves helping strengthen government operations at specific sites, usually PAs with important rhino populations. The escalating threat of poaching is also stimulating an increasing effort to integrate local communities into rhino conservation programmes. Strategically, both black and white rhinos are now managed by a range of different stakeholders (private sector, community and state) in a number of countries, with the involvement of the private sector in particular providing a critical boost to their over- all and long-term security. Over 5 500 white rhino are now man- aged by the private sector throughout Africa with the majority in South Africa. However as discussed above, incentives are declin- ing while protection costs and risks have increased, resulting in increased numbers of South African owners looking to get rid of their white rhino. In contrast to southern white rhino, most black rhino on privately owned land are managed on a custodianship basis for the state, where they benefit from generally very well- resourced and managed security measures. 2.4.4.2 Stopping the trafficking To help reduce illegal trade and to complement CITES inter- national trade bans, domestic anti-trade measures and legislation were implemented in the 1990s by a number of the major con- sumer states and law-enforcement efforts have been stepped up in many consumer countries. Following the threat of Pelly Amendment sanctions against Taiwan and potentially against South Korea and China, all three countries rapidly prohibited rhino horn use in traditional medicine in 1993 and took steps to enforce the ban and make it work. This led to a 15-year respite in serious rhino horn trading. Following protracted and unprecedented economic growth, the emergence of Vietnam as a major end-use market in the mid-2000s is the predominant factor giving rise to the current resurgence in rhino horn trade. The dimensions of the current rhino crisis all date from around 2005. Consequently, the illegal trade in rhinoceros horn continues to be one of the most structured criminal activities currently faced by CITES. There are clear indications that organised crime groups are involved in rhinoceros poaching and illegal rhinoceros horn trade. These groups operate in range states as well as Europe, where thefts of rhinoceros horns from museums, auction houses, antique shops and taxidermists have occurred. Seizures and arrests have also been made in Australia, Hong Kong, the Philippines and the USA 54 . Illegal rhinoceros horn trade has therefore become a major problem with an impact on several continents. Increased interna- tional cooperation and a well-coordinated law enforcement response are required to address this threat effectively. Current responses are based on the need to integrate and coor- dinate the work of different agencies involved all along the transit chain between the killing site at one end to the buyer of rhino horn at the other. Although catalysed primarily by the rhino horn and ivory trades, emerging anti-trafficking measures such as Wildlife Enforcement Networks (WENs) are relevant and applica- ble to any illegal natural product, and as such are discussed in a separate chapter of this report that deals with the trade in African wildlife generally (see Section 3.7 below). Anti-trafficking measures specific to rhino horn include the following: \u2022 Establishment by CITES in May 2011 of a Joint Ivory and Rhino- ceros Enforcement Task Force to undertake exchanges of intelligence regarding the smuggling of ivory and rhinoceros specimens, and to develop strategies for combating illegal trade. Besides the Secretariat, members include the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Wildlife Enforcement Net- work Programme Coordination Unit, Interpol, the Lusaka Agree- ment Task Force, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the World Customs Organisation and those parties in Africa and Asia that are currently most affected by the smuggling of ivory and rhinoceros specimens. \u2022 On 28 and 29 October 2013, representatives from 21 source, transit and destination countries came together under the banner of the CITES Rhinoceros Enforcement Task Force in ",

The Task Force meeting provided practical assis- tance to countries to implement enforcement-related CITES Decisions along with providing the opportunity for direct and focused interaction to support international cooperation and stronger enforcement actions on the ground. \u2022 Means of monitoring and tracking legal horns have been developed and are beginning to be implemented, most notably micro-chipping and forensic profiling. \u2022 Forensic investigation to determine the provenance of illegal seizures \u2013 the subject of detailed discussion in Section 2.4.5. \u2022 Deployment of sniffer dogs specifically trained to detect rhino horn in port and airport situations (e.g. in Kenya with support from the USFWS Rhino and Tiger Fund). 2.4.4.3 Stopping the demand This approach aims to reduce market demand for rhino horn by conducting targeted and effective awareness campaigns. The prin- cipal targets of these efforts are the current and potential buyers throughout East and South-east Asia, but principally China and Vietnam. Unfortunately persuading these consumers to desist is likely to prove more difficult than for ivory. This is because the value of rhino horn is influenced by the medicinal properties attrib- uted to it, both traditionally and by more recent claims. Be that as it may, efforts made to curb demand in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan during the Seventies, Eighties and early Nine- ties were a notable success, and give reason to believe the same can be achieved again 55 . The predominantly international con- servation NGOs engaged in current demand reduction efforts believe that the battle to conserve rhinos can only be won if Asian consumers can be \u2018educated\u2019 or otherwise convinced that the use of rhino horn is inappropriate because 1) it is unethical to poach rhinos, and 2) it cannot be scientifically proven to work as med- icine. WildAid is one such organisation that has had some success in using Asian celebrities to champion hard-hitting campaigns against the use of popular products such as shark-fin soup, while TRAFFIC is engaging with respected business leaders who are influential forces in society to promote a message that makes rhino horn usage socially unacceptable. Unfortunately the contention that rhino horn has no medicinal value is not a universally accepted fact: indeed the TRAFFIC study commissioned by CITES on this very matter was unable to dismiss the possibility entirely 56 , and in fact the one known proper double- blind clinical trial undertaken in Taiwan did find horn to have statistically significant fever-reducing properties, although it was not as effective as a cheaper western medicine. Certainly the belief in the horn\u2019s medicinal properties, including as an aphro- disiac, remains strong amongst Chinese consumers as revealed by an awareness and attitudinal survey carried out by WildAid and AWF in 2012 57 . ( 55 ) Although there is little hard evidence that it is, see article by S.I.

        "| 439 #5 Interregional section on rhinos Even if Western science were to establish that rhino horn has no healing properties, this would not easily negate the deeply held beliefs and customs of the rich ancestral Eastern cultures involved. A strong belief just in itself is enough to create efficacy through the mysterious but real placebo effect. Combine this with customs that make those responsible for the sick honour-bound to try every last option for a cure, irrespective of cost, or face disgrace, and the difficulty of removing rhino horn from tradi- tional Chinese medicine\u2019s (TCM) pharmacopeia becomes clearer 58 . Indeed, these influences probably contribute to the persistent demand for rhino horn, despite China having banned its use since 1993. At the same time one must bear in mind the fact that as base populations and their disposable incomes continue to grow, so too will the number of consumers to be \u2018re-educated\u2019, which will also work against demand reduction efforts achieving a sig- nificant impact. In any event, the motivation for rhino horn consumption has now gone beyond its putative medicinal value. Due to its rarity and high price it has acquired importance as a status symbol. In Asian cul- ture, people who have acquired status can demonstrate this \u2013 and thus gain face \u2013 by offering costly gifts to friends, relatives and business colleagues. In the case of rhino horn, this can mean host- ing banquets at which the horn is offered (usually ground and mixed with wine) or it can mean offering ornamental carvings made from rhino horn \u2013 libation cups being the most traditional. These challenges notwithstanding, CITES commissioned TRAFFIC to produce a demand reduction strategy that was annexed to the report presented by the Rhino Working Group at CoP16 in March 2013 59 . It is notable that the strategy includes no specific men- tion of trying either to debunk rhino horn\u2019s medicinal efficacy or to publicise the cruel nature of the killing. Rather it sensibly calls for more research before these and other approaches could be mounted with sufficient confidence to be sure of the desired impact. To this end TRAFFIC is, for example, profiling rhino horn buyers and users in Vietnam in a very detailed manner in order to identify and segment the target audiences for the campaign. 2.4.5 Forensic investigation to determine the provenance of seized rhino horn An ability to trace confiscated horn back to its natural point of origin through forensic analysis has long been recognised as a potentially powerful tool for understanding and dismantling the trade networks involved. The same methods can also be used to register legal stocks and aid their identification in the event of theft. In June 2012, the Governing Council of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) approved a project to strengthen wildlife forensic capabilities in South Africa to combat wildlife crimes. The USD 2.6 million project was developed in cooperation with the Department of Environmental Affairs of South Africa and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and with the support of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora, and assisted by a number ( 58 ) In a situation like this where consumers are unable or unwilling to accept and purchase substitutes, the price of the product in demand should be \u2018inelastic\u2019. Economic analyses have shown the price of rhino horn is indeed \u2018inelastic\u2019, and are able to explain why consumers will not be deterred by ever-higher prices (see http://www.rhino-economics.com). This of course is a cause for great concern. ( 59 ) TRAFFIC (2013).

The objective of the project is to strengthen the intelligence gathering and data analysis capacity of South Africa\u2019s overall wildlife sector through forensic-based technologies focused on the rhinoceros. The GEF funding was to be used by the Govern- ment of South Africa for a dedicated forensic laboratory facility to provide timely DNA analysis of forensic evidence for the pros- ecution of wildlife crimes, and enhance the existing coordination and information sharing among all actors involved in the law- enforcement and anti-poaching efforts in the country and the region. The Department of Environmental Affairs of South Africa was designated the Executing Agency for the project with UNEP as the Implementing Agency. Both greatly contributed to the elab- oration of the project. The Veterinary Genetics Laboratory (VGL) at the University of Pretoria has emerged as the country\u2019s, and indeed the continent\u2019s, leading forensics lab with regard to rhinos specifically. The AfRSG report that was presented to CoP16 via the CITES Secretariat in March 2013 discusses forensics but makes no mention of the GEF project 60 . It notes specifically, however, that the comprehen- sive reference database for rhino deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) developed and run from VGL (known as RhODIS 61 ), continues to expand, and DNA analyses are increasingly being used in crim- inal investigations and prosecutions. It notes also that a total of 12 000+ samples from 5 600 rhino have been collected and submitted to the VGL. Since April 2012, South Africa legally requires horn stockpiles and trophies to be DNA-sampled, as well as all animals that are immobilised in management operations. Special collection kits have been developed to ensure that the chain of evidence is maintained. As discussed in the other relevant sections of Chapter 5 on ele- phants, ivory and wildlife trade in general, forensic capabilities are relevant to the trade in many species, not just rhinos (see Section 3.7.5.4). Appropriately therefore, the CITES Secretariat is taking the lead in coordinating initiatives to develop and use relevant technologies. 2.4.6 Consumptive utilisation As with elephants and ivory there is, and has been for many years, a strong divergence of both perspective and opinion between South- ern and Eastern African range states as to the role of consumptive utilisation as a means of supporting rhino conservation through the significant additional resources that could be so generated to increase intelligence and anti-poaching efforts and reduce the cost benefits for poachers. The southern states with generally larger, better-protected populations are pro (see Chapter 1, Section 3.2.2.2), while the opposite applies in the eastern states. 2.4.6.1 Sport hunting White rhino (WR) sport hunting recommenced in 1968 when there were only an estimated 1 800 southern white rhino (SWR) left in the wild in one country, South Africa (SA). Today, WR may be hunted legally in Namibia as well as SA 62 , and while it is predom- inantly males that are hunted, the odd old female may occasionally be taken. In SA, the WR hunt is not controlled through an official quota, but by a licensing system. At current hunting levels, a quota is not deemed necessary as there are no concerns as to the sustaina- bility of the offtake; the numbers currently hunted are only just over 0.5 % of the population. All applications for a licence to hunt rhino must now go from the provincial authorities through to the responsible Minister as well (effectively through the Department of Environmental Affairs or DEA) as an extra check and balance. There is a system in place to try to ensure all hunts will further demographic and/or genetic conservation goals, with the SADC Rhino Management Group providing the DEA with an independent check on the evaluation and scoring of applications. Recent legal hunting data for WR in South Africa is shown in Table 6. An approved permit is valid for 12 months. Thus an appli- cation can be made and approved in one year, with the animal hunted in the next. There are fewer hunts than applications because some applications from nationals of countries such as Vietnam and Czech Republic are not being approved at the moment as a result of the major legislative changes introduced in 2012 to control pseudo-hunting (see Box 4).

( 61 ) The principle of RhODIS\u2122 (the Rhino DNA Identification System) database is based on the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) of human DNA profiles of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), hence the name. The main aim of this database is the forensic application of matching recovered horns to poached rhino carcasses. ( 62 ) Although Swaziland was granted a nominal hunt quota by CITES, they have not hunted any WR as yet. The reason for obtaining a quota was to keep management options open should they end up with an aggressive male that was killing other rhinos. Rather than export the problem animal elsewhere, its removal through a legal hunt would generate much needed revenue to support conservation efforts, or buy a replacement rhino to boost population vigour. ",
        "| 441 #5 Interregional section on rhinos The data in Table 6 shows the huge impact these changes had on both applications and the number of hunts. In 2010, 70 % of applications to hunt were from the Vietnamese; 2011 was the year of peak applications and hunts. Applications to hunt have declined considerably since the implementation of the measures introduced in 2012. While South Africa\u2019s WR are on CITES Appendix II, Namibia\u2019s are on Appendix I. Nonetheless, some WR can be and are hunted in Namibia. However, details of the process and how many hunts have been approved and taken place in recent years could not be obtained before going to press, but the offtake is far below that of SA. By the end of 2013, SA and Namibia conserved between them an estimated 19 460 or 95.3 % of the SWR in the wild. Despite the recent well-publicised problems with pseudo-hunting in SA, on balance hunting has played a net positive role in the expansion of WR numbers and range. Any bans on the importation of WR hunting trophies would likely have negative consequences for WR conservation in these two countries. In 2004, the CITES CoP13 approved very limited annual hunting quotas of up to five black rhinos (BR) in both SA and Namibia. The quota represents less than 0.3 % of the population; only male BRs are hunted. Decisions on rhinos to be hunted in Namibia are made by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, and the money raised (less expenses) goes into a ring-fenced account for rhino projects in Namibia\u2019s Game Products Trust Fund. In South Africa, a hunt has to meet specific criteria, showing that it will further demographic and/or genetic conservation goals in order to qualify for consid- eration. One cannot simply apply to hunt just to raise money. As an independent check, the SADC Rhino Management Group review applications to ensure they meet criteria and give feedback to the DEA, which makes the final application approval decisions each year. Since 2004, neither country has hunted all the BR they could, and BR ranges and numbers have increased further in both countries to an estimated 3 820 or 75.1 % of the African total. Counter- intuitively, hunting very small numbers of specific individual \u2018sur- plus\u2019 black rhino bulls can enhance the demographic and genetic conservation of the species. Apart from being sustainable, to date hunts of both species have also generated additional revenue to support and incentivise con- servation efforts in line with recommendations in CITES Resolu- tion 9.14 (Rev). The positive role of rhino hunting was recognised at the IUCN\u2019s last World Conservation Congress. 2.4.6.2 Horn farming and trading The South African Government has for some time been seriously exploring the contentious issue of getting the current trade ban lifted particularly \u2013 but not exclusively \u2013 so that private rhino owners could harvest and sell horn from live animals (state and community- owned horn would also be traded) 63 . Indeed, following a long public consultation, the South African cabinet recently approved that a proposal to trade be developed and submitted for consid- eration at the next CITES Conference of Parties in 2016 (CoP17). \u2303 A sedated eastern black rhinoceros has its horn reduced before being fitted with a radio transmission device at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Laikipia, Kenya. ( 63 ) In other words, advocates hope a legal trade would once again incentivise the private sector and community to conserve rhino and help reverse a worrying trend where increasing numbers of private sector owners are seeking to get rid of their rhino or have already done so. ",
        "442 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections Whether this goes ahead remains to be seen because a recent questionnaire survey of 104 rhino experts and owners recommended that South Africa should not lift the current national moratorium on the trade in rhino horn while an interna- tional ban was in place. The survey indicated that doing so might lead to greater laundering of horn onto the illegal market, tar- nishing South Africa\u2019s conservation and compliance image. After South Africa, Namibia conserves the next largest number of white and black rhinos (8.9 %), conserving slightly more rhino than in the rest of Africa (excluding South Africa) combined. Its latest approved National White Rhino Strategy also calls for the development of a legal trade in rhino horn. Thus the two most successful and most important African rhino range states that together conserve in excess of 91 % of the continent\u2019s rhinos have indicated a desire to trade horn in the future. It is interesting to note here that enterprises in China are advo- cating a similar horn-farming approach, and have already imported white rhinos for captive breeding, apparently with that ultimate end in mind 64, 65 . In this case however, China\u2019s own 1993 ban on the use of rhino horn would have to be lifted. In terms of scientific feasibility the approach appears sound, and many have argued that a very skilfully regulated legal trade, in which horn is harvested renewably from live animals, would offer financial incentives for rhino ownership and potentially deliver benefits to local communities and the state also 66,67 . Put simply however, those with a pure conservation agenda could only support a legal horn trade if there was incontrovertible evidence that it would significantly reduce the illegal killing of wild rhinos and/or the demand for their horns throughout Africa. It is very unlikely that either sustainable hunts or horn farming can do this because \u2013 while they may not threaten the species directly \u2013 they can and do open the door to illegal trade. The \u2018evidence\u2019 that legalised trade would generate a directly pos- itive impact on wild populations is largely theoretical, and assumes a degree of tight control that in reality would always be very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. The problems encountered in the management of pseudo-hunting are a reminder of such difficulties (see Box 4). Putting in place the controls necessary in both the supply country and the hunter\u2019s home country to prevent this scam generates associated man- agement costs that offset the revenue obtained. In any case, however diligent the enforcement machinery such controls can never pre-empt every scam. All in all there is a strong risk that legal trading would, in practice, have the opposite effect on wild populations to that intended. The institutional and market arrangements needed to manage a legal trade would \u2013 irrespective of their sophistication \u2013 not only be extremely costly but also, in view of the intractable and price-inelastic nature of the demand, be quite unable to close the black-market for illegal horn any more effectively than has the current total ban. These and other doubts have received a powerful boost from a very important study published as recently as June 2014, which dismisses the key economic assumptions and arguments advanced by leading pro-trade analysts as invalid 68 . The coun- ter-arguments are too complex to detail here, but the inescapable conclusion is that there is no branch of economic theory, let alone practice, that can result in a positive, stable outcome from a proposed market beset with real-world complexities, including: the vicissitudes of production from non-equilibrium wild herbivore populations; the surrounding human communities who live in extreme poverty; management authorities infused with a culture of corruption stemming from the highest levels of their govern- ance; and, most intractably, a growing and capricious demand from the Far East being served by a middleman trading system rife with criminality. A mechanism able to balance supply and demand in such a milieu appears increasingly illusory. Because of all these compelling reasons to question the viability of a regulated trade in rhino horn, it remains extremely unlikely that CoP17 will approve any related applications. The risk and cost of failure is too high. 2.4.7 Rhino impact bonds The AfRSG has been working closely with the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and other United for Wildlife (UfW) partners to investigate, develop and try a new innovative form of funding of field conservation action. The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry is interested in exploring the possible value of \u2018impact bonds\u2019 as a rhino conservation-fund- ing tool. The idea is that each project bond will have a set of measurable target deliverables (such as increasing rhino numbers by x or keeping poaching below y ). The concept is that philanthro- pists provide initial funding for such impact bonds and if the project is successful in delivering against the measurable objec- tives set out, the philanthropists will be reimbursed by other par- ticipating bodies, such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF) or governments. Unlike traditional grant projects, governments or donors only have to pay out on successes, and philanthropists ( 64 ) Yanyan D. and J. Qian (2008).

Following a February 2014 meeting coinciding with the London Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference, the concept and a draft document jointly prepared by ZSL, Social Finance and AfRSG were presented to potential funders. The idea was welcomed by the GEF, and an initial Project Identification Form for USD 2 million to develop and test out the concept was submitted to and approved by GEF. The various cooperating partners are assisting by developing a full GEF proposal and liaising with the Royal Foundation to seek support to boost the initial funding for the demonstration phase of the project up to a total of USD 5 million. If this funding model proves to work in practice, the hope is that it could be rolled out on a larger scale. In the initial stage it has been decided to focus on a few projects relating to a small num- ber of key black, white and greater one-horned rhino projects in Africa and Asia. At the time of writing, those involved are working to review and decide on possible sites to fund. 2.5 Actions recommended for EU suppo rt The basic strategy for rhinos going forward must be to have at least one or two viable populations of each subspecies survive the current onslaught. If that can be done, a recovery from the brink, as proved once before, always remains possible. The preceding review of issues and actions suggests that any Euro- pean Commission support to this objective would be best directed towards the following short and medium-term interventions. 2.5.1 Urgent and short-term measures 2.5.1.1 Forensic analysis of rhino horn in Eastern Africa The importance of being able to ascertain the provenance of seized rhino horn was noted in Section 2.4.5 above. As also noted there, capacity for this within Africa is well established at the VGL lab in Pretoria, and is under development at the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) lab in Nairobi (see Chapter 2, Section 3.2.2). Due to the fact that labs capable of analysing rhino horn also have the potential to determine the provenance of ivory, as well as the identity of any animal tissue sample, their development is an important part of the overall approach to curbing the traf- ficking of wildlife in general. Accordingly, recommendations on EU support for forensic labs are presented in the Trade section of this chapter (see Section 3.9.3.4). \u2303 DNA samples taken from a southern white rhino in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, in October 2014 prior to relocation to a low risk poaching area.

        "444 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections As regards rhinos specifically however, it can be noted here that further development of these laboratories would also be in line with the following resolutions: \u2022 A motion passed at the recent IUCN World Conservation Con- gress calling upon African range states to expand further the use of DNA profiling of horns (using RhODIS) as an innovative means of combating the illegal killing of rhinos and the traf- ficking of horn. \u2022 The recommendation put forward in the AfRSG\u2019s report to CoP16 that \u2018the use of standardised DNA profiling (using RhODIS protocols for African rhino horn and a similar initiative for Asian horn) needs be expanded to other States around the world with ex-situ rhinos and horn stocks (particularly zoos and museum specimens) to facilitate monitoring and investigations with regard to illegal trade in horn\u2019 69 . 2.5.1.2 Reducing the demand for rhino horn Rhinos are in real danger of extinction if current trends continue unabated. Given that the trade in horn is the primary cause of this situation, it follows that much effort must be put into dis- rupting that trade. Of the approaches available to do that, reduc- ing or even eliminating the basic consumer demand that drives the trade remains the most promising and must therefore be a priority for funding support. Not only will changing perspectives on effective action emerge from the ongoing work of TRAFFIC and the NGOs already working on the ground in Asia (see Section 2.4.1), but any attempt to change the attitudes of centuries and the behaviour of very many millions of people will require a massive effort to be sustained over many years, which will not be possible without strong sup- port from major donors like the EU. 2.5.2 Medium and long-term measures 2.5.2.1 Monitoring and coordination Without continual monitoring, the objective basis on which to decide what actions are needed where and how urgently will be lost. It is in this context that all stakeholders in rhino conservation need to recognise the invaluable services and inputs provided by the AfRSG in terms of general coordination, technical guidance and advice given to CITES and managers, maintenance of the population viability and importance ratings, and publication of the journal Pachyderm 70 . At the last three CITES CoPs, the AfRSG together with the AsRSG and TRAFFIC have submitted joint reports on behalf of range states which then form part of the CITES Sec- retariat\u2019s report to the parties on Rhinos: many of these reports\u2019 recommendations have become decisions approved by the parties. All this is typically done on a shoestring, and efforts to sustain the flow of money needed to hold and attend meetings, publish documents, etc. consume a disproportionate amount of the core staff\u2019s time. The present study would like to recommend not only that the European Commission should provide fully comprehensive core funding to the AfRSG over at least five years, but also to all other specialist groups with a remit in Africa. This is because they all make contributions equivalent to those of the AfRSG, and they all face similar funding challenges. A suitably well-endowed programme could be negotiated with IUCN. It should be noted that by helping to understand the con- servation needs of very many taxa, this single interven- tion has the potential to provide multiple benefits. As such it would be an extremely cost-effective use of conserva- tion funds. For similar reasons of coordination, it is recommended that the European Commission extends its support for the CITES Joint Ivory and Rhinoceros Enforcement Task Force, whether directly or through the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) (see also Section 3.9.3.1). 2.5.2.2 Direct support to key rhino populations In other parts of this report, arguments are presented to justify a need to focus EU resources on a selection of areas that are of such outstanding importance and value that basically a commit- ment should be made to protect them for posterity, and at all costs. It is further argued that if that perception of value is pri- marily one of the developed world, then it is the developed world that must be ready and willing to bear those costs, alone if abso- lutely necessary. There is no doubt that rhinos, along with certain other iconic species, should feature as a major criterion in the identification of these \u2018Key Landscapes for Conservation\u2019 (KLC), not simply because of their own charisma, but also because they provide a very good example of species whose last best hope may well lie in high, western perceptions of their value. Rhinos do indeed feature as one of the criteria used to identify KLCs (see Summary document \u2013 Synthesis, Section 5.1). ( 69 ) TRAFFIC (2013). A strategy for reducing the demand for rhino horn products of illegal origin, CITES CoP16 Doc. 54.1 (Rev. 1) Annex. ( 70 ) Pachyderm publishes papers and notes concerning all aspects of the African elephant, the African rhino and the Asian rhino with a focus on the conservation and management of these species in the wild. At the same time, the journal is an important platform for disseminating information concerning the activities of the AfRSG and the AsRSG. ",
        "| 445 #5 Interregional section on rhinos It is clear from the review above and other analyses of options that intensive in situ protection and biological management is the most effective conservation strategy, but that this comes at an extreme cost if it is be effective against the highly motivated and very well equipped poaching syndicates operating today. Consequently many if not most range states will find it very difficult to provide and sustain this level of protection to all, or even some, of their populations without external assistance. An indefinite commitment to KLCs that hold key rhino populations is probably the most effective way in which the EU can make a contribution to the species\u2019 survival in perpetuity. At the same time however, the species\u2019 extreme endangerment argues for action to protect all priority rhino populations, even if they are not in KLCs. As noted earlier, the IUCN\u2019s AfRSG maintains a list of key and important rated populations, as well as data on the current status of each. However, for security reasons (at the request of some range states), it does not generally release or publish these lists or data. Thus, if in due course the EU com- mits funds to supporting rhino conservation, it should contact the AfRSG Secretariat directly, which will then consider sharing this information on a confidential basis to help the EU select appro- priate sites for projects that are of continental significance for rhino conservation. As a possible feature of its support to rhino conservation, the EU should consider emulating the GEF as one of the institutional guarantors of rhino impact bonds, which would reimburse the initial philanthropist financiers in the event the envisaged impact target is realised (see Section 2.4.7). \u2303 Save the Rhino Trust trackers monitoring black rhinos at the Desert Rhino Camp, Damaraland, Namibia.

        "448 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections T he global legal trade in wildlife is valued at many billions of dollars per year. It includes live animals (for the pet trade, research labs, zoos and aquaria) and their parts and derivatives (for food, medicine, clothing, jewellery and ornaments) as well as plants. Although popularly associated with animals, the term wildlife also encompasses flora, and the trade in plants and trees (for medicine, fuel, timber, furniture and so on) is equally vast. While much of this commerce is legal, with, for example, CITES annually recording and regulating close to 1 mil- lion trade transactions in CITES-listed wildlife, a great deal is not, and the scale of the illegal, unregulated or unrecorded trade in wildlife and the corresponding pressure on the wild resource base is very high, with national and international enforcement agencies tasked with combating this struggling to keep up. The trade in wildlife has become increasingly attractive to trans- national organised crime networks and now resembles in char- acter and scale other types of global criminal activity, such as trafficking in drugs, human beings, firearms and counterfeit goods. Well-armed, well-equipped, and well-organised networks of poachers, criminals and corrupt officials exploit porous borders and weak institutions to profit from trading in illegally taken wildlife. With rebel militias and possibly terrorist groups also using it for funding purposes, wildlife trafficking poses a serious threat not only to biodiversity, but also to peace, security and livelihoods in affected territories. Africa is arguably affected more than any other continent because the conditions that encourage and facilitate the illegal trade in wildlife are generally more prevalent there than elsewhere. Not surprisingly, it is endangered species that are most seriously impacted. Whilst the ivory and rhino horn trades provide the most potent symbol of this problem, other species are affected as well. Taxa of concern include chimpanzee 72 , pangolins 73 , abalone 74 and African blackwood 75 . Of course the illegal trade in wildlife occurs both within and between national borders. Although it is international rather than domestic trade that most often poses both the greatest threat and the greatest enforcement challenge, there are in these two cases many common features regarding both the drivers involved and the response needed. These are reviewed below in general terms: specific analyses of the trades in ivory and rhino horn are given in the first two sections of this chapter on elephant (1) and rhino (2). >3 _ Wildlife illegal trade ( 71 ) WWF/Dalberg (2012).

The value of the illegal wildlife trade There are many different estimates of the financial value of illicit wildlife trafficking worldwide, but reliable estimates are hard to find, mainly because the trade is illegal. Unreported and unregulated fisheries trade alone has been estimated at between USD 4.2 billion and USD 9.5 billion per year, the value of the illegal timber trade as much as USD 7 billion per year, and the illicit wildlife trafficking (excluding fisheries and timber) as between USD 7.8 billion and USD 10 billion per year. Combining these numbers, illicit wildlife trafficking (including timber and fisheries) comprises the fourth largest global illegal trade after narcotics, humans and counterfeit products 71 . ",
        "#5 | 449 Wildlife illegal trade 3.1 Fundamental characteristics In wildlife trade, whether legal or illegal, there is always a value chain from the capture or harvesting of wildlife to its transpor- tation and marketing to consumers. Intermediate collation and/ or processing destinations are usually found along the chain. Organised criminal groups essentially form distribution networks across national boundaries linking source countries and consumer countries, often via important transit destinations. They com- monly use indirect routes to avoid detection. There are many different actors who facilitate the supply side of illicit wildlife trafficking. Illegal wildlife products are generated in a range of different ways \u2013 from local individual poachers who, facilitated by local middlemen, act out of opportunism or need; to criminal and rebel groups that seek to finance their illegal activities; and professional international hunters who use their experience for higher profit, often working for international cli- ents. Illegal wildlife products can also come from legally hunted trophies (principally in the case of rhino horn), privately held stocks not declared or registered with the authorities, or the theft of products from private and public owners and institutions. The well-organised and equipped criminal groups involved are attracted by the availability of huge profits at a comparatively low risk, thanks usually to the absence of credible enforcement, prosecution, penalties and other deterrents, and the presence of corrupt officials all along the value chain. Weak governance \u2013 meaning a weak rule of law and an associ- ated lack of institutional checks on power \u2013 is thus a major driver of wildlife crime as it fosters corruption. Poverty also plays a key role in motivating actors, particularly those at the very bottom of the supply chain. Poaching thus tends to thrive in places where corruption is rife, government enforcement is weak and there are few alternative economic opportunities. 3.2 International trade regulators and monitors 3.2.1 ICCWC The International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) is based upon the idea that five international organisa- tions with mandates and expertise related to the wildlife law- enforcement chain could, by aligning their efforts, provide a cat- alyst for significantly enhanced global cooperation and capacity to combat wildlife and forest crimes. ICCWC was formed in 2011 and is a collaboration between the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora\u2019s (CITES) Secretariat, Interpol, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the World Bank and the World Customs Organisation (WCO). A profile of each of these members of ICCWC is given in sections below. \u2303 A conservation official in Cape Town with a confiscated cargo of abalone.

        "450 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections The consortium is supported by a Letter of Understanding between the five organisations which, by working collaboratively, form a unique pool of technical and programming expertise that can support national law-enforcement agencies and regional enforcement networks, facilitate national multi-agency cooper- ation, assist countries to review their current responses to wildlife crime, and jointly develop capacity-building materials and tools to enhance the skills of national enforcement agencies in com- bating wildlife crime. Key aims include long-term capacity build- ing (including the use of modern investigative techniques, such as deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA analysis), and improving inter- national information and intelligence exchange for the better coordination of enforcement efforts. The ICCWC Strategic Mission 2014-2016 outlines five broad areas in which the ICCWC will focus its activities to ensure that the perpetrators of serious wildlife and forest crime (WLFC) face a formidable and coordinated law-enforcement response: \u2022 strengthening cooperation and coordination in combating WLFC; \u2022 facilitating analysis of national responses to WLFC; \u2022 building capacity to prevent and respond to WLFC; \u2022 raising awareness and support for measures to combat WLFC; \u2022 improving use of knowledge and innovation to inform con- temporary approaches to WLFC. The ICCWC Strategic Mission 2014-2016 is coordinated by the ICCWC Senior Experts Group (SEG) comprising technical specialists from all five organisations. The SEG is chaired by the CITES Sec- retariat and meets quarterly face-to-face to discuss ICCWC activ- ities and matters related to the ICCWC; it also holds monthly teleconferences. The Strategic Mission requires external funding, and the European Commission is among the ICCWC\u2019s main donors, having provided EUR 1.7 million over three years. An important ICCWC product is the Wildlife and Forest Crime Analytic Toolkit , built on the technical expertise of all ICCWC partners, as well as through extensive consultations with experts from across the globe from a variety of related fields. The toolkit is designed to facilitate national assessments of the main issues relating to wildlife and forest offences, and to identify the preven- tive and criminal justice responses needed at the national level. The ICCWC will support countries interested in conducting such a review during the entire process \u2013 including on mobilising funds, hiring experts, analysing the results, and designing and delivering technical assistance. However, the implementation of the toolkit is fully government-led (see also Section 3.7.3.1 below). ICCWC is also able to mobilise Wildlife Incident Support Teams (WISTs), composed of enforcement staff or relevant experts, to be dispatched at the request of countries that are affected by significant poaching of CITES specimens, or that have made large-scale seizures of such specimens, in order to assist, guide and facilitate appropriate follow-up actions in the immediate aftermath of an incident. In July 2013, Sri Lanka requested assis- tance from ICCWC, which subsequently deployed its first WIST, led by Interpol, to collect DNA samples from a large-scale ivory seizure for forensic analysis. \u2303 Illegally logged timber in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

        "| 451 Wildlife illegal trade 3.2.2 CITES Despite its dramatic expansion and change in character over recent years, trading wildlife products is of course millennia old. In the mid 20th century however, a growing realisation that unregulated trade was threatening certain species led to a land- mark international agreement between governments aimed at ensuring that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. Best known as CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Spe- cies of Wild Fauna and Flora was drafted as a result of a reso- lution adopted in 1963 at a meeting of members of the IUCN (the International Union for the Conservation of Nature). The text of the Convention was finally agreed at a meeting of represent- atives of 80 countries in Washington, D.C. on 3 March 1973, and on 1 July 1975 CITES entered in force. Levels of exploitation of some animal and plant species are high and the trade in them, together with other factors, such as habitat loss, is capable of heavily depleting their populations and even bringing some species close to extinction. Many wildlife species in trade are not endangered, but the existence of an agreement to ensure the sustainability of the trade is important in order to safeguard these resources for the future. CITES currently regulates international trade in about 35 000 spe- cies of wild plants and animals, and their parts and derivatives, with close to 1 million legal trade transactions per year being recorded on its publicly accessible database. The vast majority of CITES-listed species, about 96 %, are not necessarily threatened with extinction but they could become so if international trade was not strictly regulated. Trade in these species is allowed provided it is legal, sustainable and traceable; it is worth about USD 300 billion per year. However, some 3 % of CITES-listed species are threatened with extinction; these are listed on Appendix I of the Convention. Commercial trade in these species is generally prohibited, such as for most elephants and rhinos, as well as tigers and great apes, and certain timbers and marine life. Although CITES mainly prohibits or regulates international trade, it has also continued to expand its role in preventing illegal trade at the national level through the adoption of various \u2018decisions\u2019 and \u2018resolutions\u2019. This is critical to ensure illegal trade at national levels does not lead to international trade dynamics that undermine the conservation of species and the effectiveness of the Convention itself. The approach to each species group differs, but all include national measures to control not only international, but also inter- nal trade in the species\u2019 parts, derivatives and products 76 . CITES is financed primarily by its parties whose contributions are paid into the CITES Trust Fund. In addition to the subscriptions of its Member States (all of them parties), the European Commission has for a long time supported the Convention. Recently the Commission provided funding for an important number of activ- ities, including a project for strengthening the CITES implemen- tation capacity of developing countries for a total amount of EUR 2.5 million. Among other inputs, the Commission also funds the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the #5 ( 76 ) Two examples: for rhinos, it is recommended that internal trade be \u2018restricted\u2019 (Res Conf. 9.14 Rev.

In response to the ever-escalating challenges of trade-related wildlife crime, CITES played a lead role in the formation of the ICCWC, which it now chairs. Full details about the CITES Convention, its governance structure, modus operandi and parties can be found on its website: www.cites.org 3.2.3 Interpol Interpol (the International Crime Police Organisation) , which is a member of ICCWC, has an Environmental Security Sub-Directorate that runs an Environmental Crime Programme of global and regional operations to dismantle criminal networks behind environmental crime using intelligence-driven policing. The programme is shaped by the Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Committee, which brings together executive leaders and decision-makers from all 190 Interpol member countries to provide strategic advice on relevant issues and to harness global support. The 1st Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Committee Meeting and Events were held from 4 to 8 November 2013 in Nairobi, Kenya. To support the Committee in its function, three Working Groups lead projects in three specific crime areas, wildlife, pollution and fisheries. The Interpol Wildlife Crime Working Group brings together specialised criminal investigators from around the world to initiate and lead a number of projects to combat the poaching, trafficking or possession of legally protected flora and fauna at an international level. At a global level, Interpol has, since 2012, been promoting the formation of National Environment Security Task Forces (NESTs) and has produced a procedures manual on how to do so 77 . NESTs are designed to encourage multi-agency cooperation: the forma- tion of intelligence analysis and investigation units dedicated to tackling wildlife crime; deployment of Interpol Investigative Support Teams to provide assistance in evidence collection and analysis for elephant poaching and ivory seizures; and increased use of Interpol\u2019s notices system to enhance transnational law- enforcement cooperation in combating ivory trafficking. The ear- liest NEST initiatives in Africa have involved Mozambique in 2012, and Senegal and Togo in 2014. In most countries of the world there is an Interpol National Central Bureau. The staff resident in these bureaux offer an immediate source of advice and direct assistance to the work of NESTs or any other wildlife enforcement network, as well as being able to call in support teams and other forms of back-up. At a continental level, Interpol has led a number of operations to combat WLFC. As long ago as 2008, Interpol launched Project Wisdom to improve wildlife law-enforcement in Africa, specifically targeting the illegal trade in elephant ivory and rhino horn. To date, Interpol has coordinated at least seven operations targeting ivory and rhino horn traffickers \u2013 Baba, Costa, Mogatle, Ahmed, Worthy, Wendi and Wildcat, which collectively resulted in arrests, convictions and confiscations of ivory, rhino horn, other illegal wildlife products and firearms on a large scale. The most recent operations of this type in Africa are: \u2022 Operation Worthy (2012) \u2013 a centrally coordinated wildlife law-enforcement operation by 14 member countries in Africa, targeting the illegal trade in elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn. Seizures included nearly two tons of contraband ele- phant ivory, more than 20 kg of rhinoceros horn, various other wildlife products, and more than 30 illegal firearms. \u2022 Operation Wendi (2013) \u2013 combating the trafficking in ele- phant ivory in West and Central African countries. Nearly 4 000 ivory products and 50 elephant tusks were seized, along with 148 animal parts and derivatives, and 88 firearms. In addition, 222 live animals were released back into the wild. \u2022 Operation Wildcat (2014) \u2013 combating ivory trafficking and ille- gal logging across Southern and Eastern Africa, and supported by the Wildcat Foundation and the Norwegian Agency for Devel- opment Cooperation. Operation Wildcat resulted in the seizure of 240 kg of elephant ivory, 856 timber logs, 637 firearms, illicit drugs and 44 vehicles, and the arrest of 660 people. These operations have been carried out in collaboration with NGOs, such as the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), with whom Interpol signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in May 2013, to partner in evidence-based wildlife crime investigations and enforcement operations, the first ever MoU signed by Interpol\u2019s Environmental Crime Programme with an NGO (see also Section 3.7.1.2). On 7 October 2014, Interpol announced the formation of a ded- icated environmental crime team in Africa to further support its member countries in the fight against illegal ivory trafficking and other environmental issues. Located within the Interpol Regional Bureau for East Africa in Nairobi, the environmental crime team will act as an extension of Interpol\u2019s Environmental Security Sub-Directorate located at its General Secretariat headquarters in Lyon, France. As part of the Regional Bureau, the team will collaborate with national law-enforcement agencies and Interpol National Central Bureaux (NCBs) in the region to increase infor- mation exchange, support intelligence analysis, and assist national and regional investigations, with a particular focus on wildlife crime.

        "| 453 Wildlife illegal trade #5 With the illicit trade in ivory and rhino horn a major concern in East Africa, the team will work with countries and partner organ- izations to further the activities of Interpol\u2019s Project Wisdom (see above). This includes capacity building initiatives and creating a regional network for environmental protection. Very soon after its establishment, the team issued an international Red Notice for the arrest of Feisal Mohamed Ali, a Kenyan Asian wanted in connection with an ivory seizure in excess of 2 tonnes in Mombasa earlier in the year. Interpol has been closely involved in two recently published stud- ies of wildlife trade and crime, one global and one focused on East Africa (see Section 3.3.1). These important reports highlight the need for increased intelligence analysis in order to provide sound evidence for multiple-count indictments where the traf- ficking is linked to fraud, tax evasion and money laundering. 3.2.4 UNODC Wildlife and forest crime is an area that is highly relevant to the mandates of UNODC, particularly in relation to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC) and the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC). UNODC also has mandates to work in this area, which are deliv- ered through a number of resolutions from the Economic and Social Council and the Commission on Crime Prevention and Crim- inal Justice. In addition to contributing to the efforts of the ICCWC, UNODC plays an increasingly important role through the delivery of spe- cific technical assistance activities designed to strengthen the capacity of Member States to prevent, investigate, prosecute and adjudicate wildlife and forest crime (WLFC). In May 2014, UNODC launched in its Global Programme for Com- bating Wildlife and Forest Crime 78 , a four-year, USD 18 million programme to deliver assistance on a regional and national basis to support law-enforcement responses, put in place appropriate legislation to address this crime, and to strengthen investigative, prosecutorial and judiciary capacities, as well as to combat the related issues of money laundering and corruption. It embraces capacity strengthening activities in South-east Asia, South Asia, Eastern, Central and Southern Africa, and Latin America, and includes the promotion of ICCWC\u2019s Wildlife and Forest Crime Ana- lytic Toolkit in these regions. This Global Programme (GP) has six sub-programmes: 1. Countering transnational organised crime and illicit drug trafficking 2. Prevention, treatment and reintegration and alternative development 3. Countering corruption 4. Justice 5. Research and trend analysis 6. Policy support. The GP complements or extends a number of crime-specific ini- tiatives that UNODC is undertaking in Africa, addressing piracy, illicit trafficking, money laundering and wildlife crime as part of its ongoing regional programmes in Eastern, West and Southern Africa, and to that end closely coordinates with its various regional offices to avoid any duplication on the ground, including with the Transnational Organised Crime Units (TOCU) created through the West African Coast Initiative (WACI). UNODC has recently organised and supported a number of WLFC-related activities in Africa including: \u2022 In September 2013, UNODC released a report entitled Trans- national Organized Crime in Eastern Africa: A Threat Assess- ment . The report highlights the most pressing transnational organised crime threats facing the Eastern African region, including ivory trafficking. \u2022 A National Environmental Security Seminar in Togo, held in Lom\u00e9 on 20 May 2014. The multilateral cooperation tools pre- sented during the seminar included the Wildlife and Forest Crime Analytic Toolkit, the UNODC/WCO Container Control Programme (CCP), the UNODC/Interpol Airport Communication Programme (AIRCOP) and the West Africa Coast Initiative (WACI). \u2022 A workshop on Recovering the Proceeds from Wildlife and Timber Crimes \u2013 Asian & African experiences , hosted by the Government of Botswana, in Gaborone from 3-5 June 2014. A follow-up workshop was held in Bangkok from 20-22 January, which included participants from six African and ten Asian countries. \u2022 In response to the request of the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, UNODC undertook a UN Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC) Gap Assessment in Tanzania and Zanzibar. As part of the assessment, UNODC reviewed wildlife and forest crime-related legislation and law-enforcement structures. The findings of the analysis were presented and discussed at the UNTOC Gap Assessment Workshop , which took place from 16-18 June 2014 in Zanzibar. \u2022 UNODC participated in practical training on investigative tech- niques specific to wildlife and forest crime, held in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, from 24-26 June 2014 and organised by the Commission of Central African Forests (COMIFAC) in collaboration with TRAFFIC and WWF. Participants included representatives of ministries, law-enforcement officers and magistrates from six COMIFAC countries 79 . The training covered the use of informants, ( 78 ) For more detail about this programme visit: http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/wildlife-and-forest-crime/global-programme.html ( 79 ) Cameroon, Chad, Gabon, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo and Democratic Republic of Congo.

A similar workshop was held in Naivasha, Kenya from 24-28 November 2014 and another is planned for Uganda in early 2015. \u2022 UNODC leads the implementation of the ICCWC Wildlife and Forest Crime Analytical Toolkit in Botswana and Gabon, and has received requests for implementation from Angola, Madagascar and Tanzania. As of October 2014, UNODC has a number of WLFC activities planned in several country and regional offices. For example, in Eastern Africa, UNODC is designing a programme on strength- ening the criminal justice approach to address the illegal trade in ivory and rhino horn. Activities will include training for law- enforcement officials on crime investigation and forensics related to poaching, crime scene management, CITES-listed wildlife and fauna, and controlled deliveries. Furthermore, through the UNODC-WCO Container Control Pro- gramme, Container Control Units will be established in Mom basa, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, with a special focus on wildlife and timber trafficking. A similar linkage will also be explored in building such assessments and considerations into the work of an Anti-Corruption Adviser based in South Africa, covering both Southern and Eastern Africa. This will help to strengthen inter- agency cooperation between national and local law-enforcement agencies in the country and could also help improve the uniformity in which such cases are investigated in the region. Also notable is the November 2014 publication of Guidelines on methods and procedures for ivory sampling and laboratory anal- ysis that UNODC has developed on behalf of the ICCWC (see also Section 3.7.5.4). The guidelines aim to facilitate the use of wildlife forensics to the fullest extent possible in combating wildlife crime. An Expert Group Meeting on Timber Analysis was held in December 2014, the purpose of which was to bring together experts to begin the process of developing a similar guide for the analysis of timber. \u2303 Part of Hong Kong\u2019s 29-ton stockpile of African ivory in May 2014.

Hong Kong\u2019s legal retail ivory market is the biggest in the world, but undercover investigations have shown that traders regularly top off their legal stock with illegal ivory. ",
        "| 455 Wildlife illegal trade #5 In May 2014, UNODC launched a global research effort on wildlife crime, the results of which will be disseminated towards the end of 2015. This research draws heavily on data held by the ICCWC, the EU, NGOs and research institutes. The initial study will be rooted in data from existing reporting mechanisms, mainly the reports that parties have provided to the CITES Secretariat. Other sources include the WCO seizure database and seizure databases maintained by regional wildlife enforcement networks, such as EU-TWIX (Trade in Wildlife Information eXchange) and the Lusaka Agreement Task Force. A global wildlife seizures database is being assembled based on this data and other official sources. This data will be compared to the data gathered on the legal trade in CITES-listed species, with a focus on identifying weak- nesses in the supply chain that allow illegally acquired wildlife to enter the legal market. This quantitative effort will be compli- mented by a parallel stream of field research on the markets identified as most vulnerable to organised criminal involvement, and legal research on the adequacy of the international response. This work will provide an international frame of reference for future discussions on wildlife and forest crime, as well as a basis for law-enforcement policy in tackling the issue. UNODC has developed the SHERLOC portal \u2013 an initiative to facil- itate the dissemination of information regarding the implemen- tation of the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its three Protocols. It hosts a case law database and a database of legislation. The portal is being continually popu- lated with case law and legislation, including entries pertaining to wildlife and forest crimes (including fisheries crimes), and can be accessed through UNODC\u2019s website. UNODC was requested by the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) to provide support in the development of a regional anti-poaching strategy. UNODC confirmed its interest to support the development of the strategy and developed a MoU to cooperate with ECCAS on wildlife and forest crime, which was final- ised and approved by both ECCAS and UNODC in November 2014. UNODC worked with the Government of Gabon to develop a Prior- ities Action Plan on intelligence and investigations capacity-building of wildlife crime. It was approved by the Government of Gabon in November 2014. UNODC placed two French-national senior intel- ligence mentors to work with the National Parks Agency on intel- ligence and investigation of wildlife cases. This work to build a lasting national intelligence apparatus began in November 2014. To improve the delivery of technical assistance, the GP has aug- mented its field staff, placing wildlife and forest crime enforce- ment experts in Tanzania, Kenya and Senegal. 3.2.5 World Bank As a member of the consortium, the World Bank has contributed USD 1.8 million to ICCWC\u2019s operations. The December 2013 Expert Group Meeting on ivory forensics led by UNODC\u2019s Laboratory and Scientific Section is one component of a comprehensive ICCWC pro- ject entitled Forensic analysis in support of law enforcement oper- ations , funded by the World Bank\u2019s Development Grant Facility. The first component of the project covers the forensic analysis of ivory recovered during large ivory seizures to determine the origin of ivory with the aim of identifying the main poaching hotspots in Africa. This work is carried out by Dr Samuel Wasser\u2019s laboratory at the University of Washington and supports CITES CoP16 Decision asking countries to provide samples of large ivory seizures to forensic laboratories. The component serves as a pilot for the second component of the project, which is the develop- ment of international guidelines for forensic methods and proce- dures mentioned in Section 3.2.4 above. A third component will be to assess existing forensic facilities and the capacity-building of existing laboratories, by engaging with relevant experts for the validation of forensic methods of ivory sampling. The World Bank is also implementing a medium-sized Global Environment Facility (GEF) project (18-month, USD 3.8 million) entitled Fighting against wildlife poaching and illegal trade in Africa . Also it is preparing (presumably but not necessarily under the latter project), a major study of ivory trade economics with inputs from AfESG, CITES, MIKE (Monitoring Illegal Killing of Elephants) and TRAFFIC. The EU, together with the UK Government and the NGO Stop Ivory, also participated in early talks regarding this initiative that were held to avoid duplication of effort 80 . ( 80 ) The EU was variously represented by Gael De-Rotalier, Helene Perier, and Helga Elisabeth Zeitler. ",
        "456 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections 3.2.6 WCO The World Customs Organisation (WCO) joined the ICCWC in 2011 and ever since has strived to enhance cooperation with other intergovernmental organisations (IGOs), as well as NGOs, that share its commitment to protecting wildlife from criminal syndicates and other illegal activities. The Green Customs Initiative is another long-standing and ongo- ing cooperation programme that the WCO continues to support along with the CITES Secretariat. This initiative ensures that cus- toms and other border control officers are well-trained and have all the necessary tools at their disposal to fight wildlife and other environmental crimes. Strengthening relations with the NGO sector is also on the WCO\u2019s agenda. In October 2013, the WCO formalised its cooperative relationship with TRAFFIC, the global wildlife trade monitoring network, by signing an MoU in which the two parties agree to pool their capacity-building efforts and enhance information exchange. Located at borders, customs administrations play a vital role in ensuring that all goods being declared for entry or exit are legit- imate, while using a variety of enforcement techniques and their proven expertise to detect and intercept illegal wildlife, as well as other illicit goods. The WCO is very active in organising global enforcement operations and in supporting regional operations targeting wildlife criminals with the support of its many partners, such as the CITES Secretariat which acknowledges that customs is one of its key \u2018enforcement arms\u2019. One example of WCO success in this field is Project GAPIN, a capacity-building project in Africa that focused on building the enforcement capabilities of frontline customs officers to detect, intercept and seize illegal wildlife consignments, and on advocat- ing a culture of integrity. Another example is Operation COBRA II, supported by the WCO, which resulted in the seizure of 36 rhino horns, 3 metric tons of ele phant ivory, 10 000 turtles, 1 000 skins of protected species, and more than 100 metric tons of rosewood logs, dealing a huge blow to criminals involved in the highly lucrative trade in illegal wildlife. WCO is currently developing a multi-year programme that is seek- ing to build the capacity of customs officials in responding to wildlife crime that will incorporate a controlled delivery compo- nent (see Section 3.7.5.2). 3.2.7 TRAFFIC TRAFFIC is an international NGO specialising in wildlife trade monitoring that works to ensure that the trade in wild plants and animals is not a threat to the conservation of nature. Originally established as a specialist group of the IUCN Species Survival Commission in 1976, soon after CITES came into force, TRAFFIC has since developed into a global, research-driven and action- orientated network, committed to delivering innovative and prac- tical conservation solutions based on the latest trade information. Today TRAFFIC employs around 100 staff based in nearly 30 countries, and operates through a network of eight regional programmes, coordinated by the TRAFFIC International head- quarters in Cambridge, UK. TRAFFIC is governed by a Steering Committee composed of mem- bers of TRAFFIC\u2019s partner organisations, WWF and IUCN. A central aim of TRAFFIC\u2019s activities is to contribute to the wildlife trade- related priorities of these partners. TRAFFIC also works in close cooperation with CITES to which it is regularly asked to report. TRAFFIC has recently been successful in securing a three-year, USD 1.5 million grant from the US Agency for International Devel- opment (USAID) to implement the Wildlife Trafficking, Response, Assessment, Priority Settin g (Wildlife-TRAPS) initiative to tackle the illegal trade of terrestrial and marine wildlife between Africa and Asia. Wildlife TRAPS is likely to focus on achieving a high impact with a tightly focused group of species products (i.e. including ivory and rhino horn) traded between Central and Eastern and Southern Africa, and East and South-east Asia.

The United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) subsequently adopted this as Resolution 2013/40 of 25 July 2013. It encourages states to treat illicit trafficking in wild fauna and flora as a serious crime when organised criminal groups are involved, and to fully utilise the UN Conventions against Transnational Organised Crime and Corruption to implement appropriate measures to prevent and combat illicit trafficking in wild fauna and flora. The UN General Assembly, in its Resolution 68/193 of 18 December 2013 on the Strengthening the United Nations crime prevention and crim- inal justice programme , reaffirmed ECOSOC\u2019s Resolution 2013/40. At its 23rd Session in May 2014, the CCPCJ adopted a further resolution on Strengthening a targeted crime pre- vention and criminal justice response to combat illicit traf- ficking in timber and forest products. \u2022 In a May 2013 report to the United Nations Security Council, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon highlighted the potential link between poaching and other transnational organised criminal activities, including terrorism. \u2022 In June 2013, the Royce Amendment to the US National Defence Authorisation Act was passed to provide authority for the US military to advise and assist host nation game and wildlife, law enforcement and other appropriate agencies to suppress the illicit wildlife trade in Africa, this being a source of financing for transnational rebel and extremist groups. \u2022 In July 2013, President Obama issued an Executive Order on Combating Wildlife Trafficking to enhance coordination of US Government efforts to combat wildlife trafficking and assist foreign governments in building the capacity needed to com- bat wildlife trafficking and related organised crime. \u2022 The European Commission signed a Cooperation Arrange- ment between the Directorate-General for the Environment of the European Commission and the State Forestry Admin- istration of China on CITES-related measures in July 2013. Cooperation in wildlife trafficking featured prominently in the high-level China-EU Political Dialogue on Africa held in Bei- jing on 28 October 2014. \u2022 In August 2013, the Legislative Assembly of the East African Community passed a resolution urging partner states to take concerted action to end the massacre of elephants and traf- ficking of ivory. \u2022 In December 2013, delegates from the 30 countries and 27 IGOs and NGOs participating in the African Elephant Sum- mit in Gaborone dedicated themselves to providing political support at the highest level to ensure the implementation of 14 Urgent Measures to halt and reverse the trend in the illegal killing of elephants and the illegal trade in ivory (see Section 1.3 and Annex 1). \u2022 Also in December 2013, a \u2018roundtable\u2019 on The fight against poaching and trafficking in endangered species was held alongside the France-Africa Summit on Peace and Security in Africa held in Paris from 6-7 December. As a result, the ensuing Paris Declaration adopted by the 53 government and IGO delegations attending (including the EU) incorporated a commitment to \u2018act promptly and decisively\u2019 against poach- ing and smuggling of wildlife. \u2022 On 11 February 2014, the Obama Administration released a National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking , which was developed by an interagency Presidential Task Force, representing agencies from across the federal government, and with significant input from the Advisory Council on Wild- life Trafficking. The Task Force was formed following the President\u2019s July 2013 Executive Order on Combating Wildlife Trafficking. Following release of this Strategy, the Secretary of the Interior announced that the US Fish and Wildlife Service would implement a US ban imposing new restrictions on the import, export, and commercial sale of elephant ivory within the United States of America, with some limited exceptions. \u2022 In February 2014, the EU together with 41 countries made a joint political commitment to bring the illegal wildlife trade to an end in the form of a formal Declaration issued at the end of the London Conference on the Illegal Wildlife Trade, 12-13 February 2014. \u2022 The Bonn Convention on Migratory Species passed a Resolu- tion on Fighting of Wildlife Crime within and beyond Borders at its 11th Conference of the Parties held in Quito, Ecuador, 4-9 November 2014 (UNEP/CMS/COP11/CRP19).

In the same week, meet- ings of Interpol\u2019s specialist working groups on wildlife were held. UNEP is also working to help strengthen the judicial components of enforcement. \u2022 The European Commission recently set up an internal Inter- service Group on Wildlife Trafficking which held its first meet- ing in October 2013 in order to start work on a major EU position-paper or Consultative Communication on the sub- ject 83 . This was followed on 10 April 2014 by an Expert Con- ference on the EU Approach against Wildlife Trafficking . The conference, attended by over 170 representatives from 27 EU Member States, enforcement and judicial networks, international organisations, civil society and non-EU source, transit and destination countries, discussed measures and actions to be taken by the EU domestically and internationally to strengthen its approach against wildlife trafficking. A num- ber of recommendations were forthcoming 84 . \u2022 The United for Wildlife (UfW) partnership between interna- tional conservation organisations and the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry convened a conference of 250 delegates from 30 countries at the Zoological Society of London on 11-12 February 2014 to seek solutions to the international wildlife trade crisis. \u2022 The UK Government, building on a preliminary conference hosted by HRH Prince Charles in May 2013, hosted the high-level London Conference on Illegal Wildlife Trade, 12-13 February 2014, resulting in a formal Declaration for action by participants (see Section 3.3.2 above): the Govern- ment of Botswana has offered to host a follow-on conference in 2015 to review progress in its implementation. \u2022 The Expert Group Meeting on Guidelines for forensic methods and procedures of ivory sampling and analysis was organised by UNODC, under the umbrella of the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) in Vienna, 4-6 December 2013. The guidelines were subsequently published in November 2014. \u2022 The Tokyo Conference on combating wildlife crime took place on 3-5 March 2014, hosted by the UN University in Tokyo, Japan as an event for the first World Wildlife Day. The con- ference included a workshop on the Wildlife Enforcement Monitoring System (WEMS) database. \u2022 On 27 June 2014, the United Nations Environment Assembly of UNEP adopted a Resolution on the illegal trade in wildlife, in which the UNEA calls on the United Nations General Assem- bly (UNGA) to consider the issue of illegal wildlife trade. Since then the UN Group of Friends on Poaching and Illicit Wildlife Trafficking has complied a Draft UNGA Resolution on illicit wildlife trafficking, which was discussed by invited experts at a Group meeting in New York on 7 November 2014. 3.3.4 Programmatic and funding commitments A separate list of funds and programmes focused on conservation of the elephant, which also address the massive challenges posed by trade in its ivory, is given in Section 1.4.2. \u2022 In January 2014, the African Wildlife Foundation published a request for proposals to develop and implement an \u2018omni- channel, pan-African anti-poaching and wildlife trafficking\u2019 awareness campaign. It has also established a Species Pro- tection Grant Fund , focusing mainly on iconic species groups, but also offering non-specific support to law enforcement and demand-reduction measures. AWF\u2019s African Voices cam- paign is addressing demand in Africa by educating and involv- ing Africans. \u2022 The European Union has actively contributed to the fight against illegal wildlife trade, both domestically and globally, for many years through a wide range of measures. Beyond steps to combat wildlife trafficking within its own territories, the EU has also been leading efforts internationally and bilat- erally to enforce rules against illegal wildlife trade and to support biodiversity protection in general. These efforts are being undermined by the current poaching crisis. Regarding the regulation of international wildlife trade, the EU has focused on CITES; the EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan 85 ; EU policies against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing; and TWIX (Trade in Wildlife Information eXchange), a centralised database in seizures and offences within the EU. The effectiveness of these instruments naturally depends very much on the level of enforcement and cooperation by countries of origin. \u2022 The Global Environment Facility.

In 2013, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) commis- sioned a two-year, EUR 3.2 million Inter-sectoral Technical Cooperation Project for Combating Poaching and Wildlife Trade in Africa and Asia to support international efforts and partner countries along the entire illegal wildlife trade chain. Germany also supports law-enforcement work at the pro- tected area level. \u2022 The UK Government\u2019s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) leads a Partnership for Action against Wildlife Crime (PAW). Not only may this offer a useful model to other countries, but publications under this initiative may also be useful to others 86 . \u2022 The US Government has recently demonstrated its commit- ment to combating wildlife trafficking, related corruption and money laundering in numerous ways. Along with the National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking mentioned above, it was announced that the US would provide an additional USD 10 million to regional and bilateral training and technical assistance in Africa to combat wildlife trafficking. This included approximately USD 3 million in bilateral assistance to South Africa, USD 3 million in bilateral assistance to Kenya, and USD 4 million in regional assistance throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program, which was signed into law on January 2013, enables the Secretary of State to offer rewards for information leading to the arrest, conviction or identification of significant members of transnational criminal organisations who operate primarily outside the United States of America. The law also allows for rewards for information that dismantles such organisations or leads to the disruption of their financial mechanisms. \u2022 The US Agency for International Development (USAID) is expected to launch a new wildlife technology challenge, which will promote the use of innovative technologies like mobile phone applications and wildlife DNA analysis techniques to assist in combating wildlife trafficking. USAID also supports the TRAFFIC/TRAPS project mentioned above. \u2022 The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) supports the Inter- national Law Enforcement Academy in Gaborone, Botswana, which has trained 350 law-enforcement officers in wildlife crime investigations since 2002. In 2013, the USFWS pledged an additional USD 2 million annually in support of its Wildlife Without Borders capacity-building programme, which includes wildlife law-enforcement training. \u2022 WCS: as an adjunct to its involvement in the Clinton Global Initiative (see Section 1.4.2), the WCS launched at the same time a campaign called 96 Elephants , named for the estimated number of elephants being gunned down each day by poachers. The campaign addresses the fact that the US is the world\u2019s second largest importer of ivory, and focuses on securing effec- tive moratoriums on domestic ivory sales. The campaign has achieved this already in New York and New Jersey, and the USFWS is developing a federal ivory marketing ban (see Section 3.3.2). Other countries are being called on to do likewise. \u2022 WWF\u2019s Wildlife Crime Scorecard is a good example of a report- ing initiative to make demand and source countries account- able for their work and efforts. This report measures progress towards compliance with and enforcement of CITES commit- ments for the three species groups (elephants, rhinos and tigers) and aims to acknowledge those countries where illegal trade is actively being countered in contrast with those where the current efforts are entirely inadequate 87 .

        "| 461 Wildlife illegal trade #5 3.4 Strategic options for combating illicit trade National wildlife law enforcement agencies, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, face many challenges when it comes to com- bating the illicit wildlife trade. These include: inadequate legisla- tion; lack of equipment; limited training opportunities; difficulty accessing modern enforcement tools like intelligence-gathering, and analysis and forensic science support; poor governance; and a limited appreciation among prosecutors and the judiciary of the seriousness of wildlife crime. Special investigative techniques and powerful tools, such as \u2018follow the money\u2019 and \u2018controlled deliv- eries\u2019, are not mobilised to go after criminal organisations engag- ing in wildlife crime. Wildlife law-enforcement officers often lack parity with their counterparts in customs and police services, and are ill prepared to respond to the organised nature of those who seek to steal natural resources. Very many of the reports, events and initiatives detailed above have generated strategies and action plans for dealing with these and other problems related to the illegal wildlife trade as a matter of great international concern and urgency. All of the reports listed in Section 3.3.1 above include action plans or specific rec- ommendations on how to tackle the issue, as do the current multiannual and species-specific strategies of numerous IGOs and NGOs, to which can be added the action agendas incorpo- rated in Declarations such as Marrakech, Gaborone and London for example. Not surprisingly there is considerable overlap between them, with many of the same points arising repeatedly, if in a slightly dif- ferent language or with different emphasis. There is also a gen- eral recognition that the overall goal has to be addressed through at least four distinct strategic approaches, none of which is suf- ficient in itself, meaning that the grand strategy must be to pur- sue all of them simultaneously at international, regional and national levels. They are: \u2022 strengthening policies and laws; \u2022 stopping the killing; \u2022 stopping the trafficking; \u2022 stopping the demand. In the four sections that follow (Section 3.5-3.8), an attempt has been made to collate, for each of these approaches, the main points around which a significant degree of consensus is evident. Because of their relevance to this particular study, due attention has been paid to the recommendations arising from the EU\u2019s recent Expert Conference on the EU Approach against Wildlife Trafficking . 3.5 Strategy 1: Strengthening policies and laws To curb the illegal wildlife trade it is important to ensure that the criminals involved, in particular those \u2018kingpins\u2019 who control the trade, are prosecuted and penalised so as to provide an effective deterrent. To this end, the following policy and legal reforms should be adopted where necessary. 3.5.1 Enact poaching and wildlife trafficking as \u2018serious crimes\u2019 Legislation should be adopted (or amended) to criminalise poach- ing and wildlife trafficking by ensuring that domestic offences involving wildlife trafficking fall within the definition of \u2018serious crime\u2019 in Article 2 of the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC), to which all states should become party. This would establish a minimum sentence of four years for offences relating to poaching and illicit trafficking: UNTOC is any- way a valuable tool that can serve as the basis for international cooperation, including extradition, mutual legal assistance and asset recovery. 3.5.2 Adopt a zero-tolerance policy on corruption The serious problem of corruption must be addressed as an important factor facilitating poaching, wildlife trafficking and related offences by adopting (or amending) policies and legisla- tion that criminalise corruption and bribery, and by instituting measures to detect and punish offenders, especially in the WLFC sector. All governments should become parties to, and implement, the UN Convention against Corruption, which can be a valuable tool to prevent corruption and can foster international cooperation in corruption cases. 3.5.3 Ensure the judiciary imposes effective deterrent penalties The ability to achieve successful prosecutions and deterrent sanc- tions must be strengthened by raising awareness in the judicial sector about the seriousness, impact and potential profits of WLFC, and by working with prosecutors and judges to ensure that penalties handed down are commensurate with legal provisions for \u2018serious crime\u2019 and so act as effective deterrents. Dedicated training and increased capacity building are essential tools to achieve this goal, which can be delivered as part of the support to national Wildlife Enforcement Networks (WENs). ",
        "462 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections Kenya, for example, has not only revised its wildlife law inclusive of new heavy penalties, but also the Director of Public Prosecu- tions has strengthened prosecutions through a new specialised Wildlife Crime Unit comprising 35 prosecutors. In addition the Chief Justice, through the Judiciary Training Institute, has initiated national dialogue meetings on wildlife crime, and training courses for the judiciary and prosecutors on the new legislation. 3.5.4 Expand the agenda of National Security Committees Poaching and the illegal trade in wildlife, especially ivory and rhino horn, should be introduced as a standing agenda item of National Security Committees (or their equivalent) in countries where proceeds from these criminal activities are known or are likely to be used to fuel internal conflict, armed rebellion or external aggres- sion. The head of the national wildlife agency should be a member of the National Security Committee (or its equivalent) in these countries. This recommendation is consistent with the African Ele- phant Summit\u2019s (AES) Urgent Measure 4 (see Section 1, Annex 1). 3.6 Strategy 2: Stopping the killing This component of overall strategy is targeted mostly at building and/or supplementing the capacity of those responsible for pro- viding in situ protection to wildlife at the primary source level in the field, namely national wildlife and protected area (PA) authorities, as well as managers of community and private PAs. The various ways in which this can and is being done in the different regions is discussed in Chapters 1-4, while the principal measures available to support this strategy are summarised below. Improvements in anti-poaching are essential to complement transit disruption and demand reduction efforts further up the supply chain, but they cannot succeed if they are focused on tactics at the expense of community outreach and intelligence-led policing. 3.6.1 Strengthen protection forces The poaching pressures of the last few years have found all wildlife protection agencies throughout Africa wanting in terms of adequate manpower to confront and contain the threat. As described in the regional chapters, most national authorities are adding significant numbers to the strength of ranger forces in both the short and longer term. They are also creating and deploying elite strike forces that are highly mobile and capable of rapid-response operations, as well as specialised PA-based intelligence- cum -community relations units. At the same time, improving their equipment, training and welfare is enhancing the efficacy of all these personnel. \u2303 Instructors, with trainee dogs, simulate the arrest of rhino poachers at the Paramount Group\u2019s Anti-Poaching Skills and K9 (canine) Training Academy in Magaliesberg, South Africa. The academy addresses the ever-increasing need for training of wildlife conservation officers in anti-poaching activities, wildlife contraband detection and specialist canine solutions. ",
        "| 463 Wildlife illegal trade #5 The need to engage in intelligence-led operations and create, even at the PA level, intelligence analysis and investigation units dedicated to tackling wildlife crime is now widely acknowledged. Simply building up ranger forces to react to poaching may increase the rate of local arrests, but it will not eliminate poach- ing. Organised poaching networks can easily expend hunters at the bottom of the chain, while middlemen can quickly build up the supply of poachers by increasing profit distributions. Law- enforcement strategies should focus on mapping out local poach- ing networks to identify the most vulnerable points, enlisting the services of local informants to the greatest extent possible. Few protection agencies find it possible to meet all of the various needs involved, and so rely heavily on donors to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of their manpower. 3.6.1.1 Equipment Equipment needs include the following categories: personal (uni- forms, boots, capes, body armour); camping (tents, torches, etc.); navigation (GPS, maps); surveillance (binoculars, night-vision scopes, drones); communications (radios, phones); crime scene (cameras, sampling containers, handcuffs); weapons and ammu- nition; tracker dogs. While primary protection duties rely heavily on foot patrols, the insertion and extraction of rapid response teams in particular requires transport ranging from helicopters and aircraft to four- wheel-drive vehicles and motorcycles. The helicopters and aircraft are also needed for both routine surveillance and the guidance of certain ground operations. Adequate funds to meet mainte- nance and running costs are obviously essential. Other specialised equipment needed to protect particularly sensitive boundaries includes various types of wall and fence (including elec- tric), as well as fence-break and other intruder-detection systems, such as intrusion detection cables for key hotspots along borders. Whilst not normally thought of as \u2018equipment\u2019, increased man- power in the field requires an equivalent increase in the staff housing available. 3.6.1.2 Training Many countries run training courses for rangers and wardens at national facilities. Where these are not available, training can be and often is provided through IGO and NGO-funded projects. Skill and competence levels vary, but efforts are being made to stand- ardise basic law-enforcement strategy to which the few existing regional wildlife colleges can contribute. All training facilities, whether national or regional, need to update their law-enforcement course content, in particular to take in the crime scene investigation (CSI), forensic, adaptive monitoring and intelligence-led techniques that are now needed to help defeat the contemporary poaching challenge. A specific proposal for EU support to course development at the College of African Wildlife Management is presented in Chapter 2, Section 5.4.1. \u2303 A monitoring team checks images on a camera trap placed on the edge of a forest clearing (bai) in the Messok-Dja forest of northern Congo to record frequency of use by large mammals.

        "464 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections 3.6.1.3 Staff welfare Rangers in the front line of anti-poaching duty are at risk of injury or death: increasing numbers have lost their lives during the cur- rent crisis. Compensation schemes for bereaved families are required, plus memorial plaques and monuments to give public recognition to their sacrifice. Similarly, rangers resident in the field must have decent housing, and all law-enforcement person- nel must be paid a realistic and incentive working wage, as well as hardship and danger allowances as appropriate. Lack of attention to basic welfare issues such as these is a sig- nificant de-motivator, and is what predisposes staff to corruption and makes them vulnerable to approaches from poachers and middlemen to aid and abet them. 3.6.2 Best practices Starting in mid-2014, the Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS) car- ried out, with German \u2018polifonds\u2019 support, a six-month review aimed at developing standardised guidance for anti-poaching law-enforcement interventions in Africa, with an emphasis on identifying best practices and helping strengthen efforts to com- bat wildlife crime and the trafficking of wildlife products at both local site and national levels. The study built on existing literature and past studies, including: the International Consortium on Com- bating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) Toolkit, existing CITES National Ivory Action Plans prepared by several African countries, and recent reports on wildlife legislation, prosecution procedures and success factors in a number of African countries 88 . An analytical framework was developed as the basis for the assessment of law-enforcement approaches based on an online survey completed by over 100 professionals directly involved in implementing law-enforcement activities in Africa. The frame- work identifies three \u2018pillars\u2019 at the site level and three \u2018pillars\u2019 at the national level, which form critical components of effective wildlife law enforcement. These pillars are, at the site level: 1) law-enforcement patrols; 2) law-enforcement management; and 3) intelligence and investigations; and at the national level: 1) national intelligence and investigations; 2) legislation and pros- ecutions; and 3) inter-agency collaboration. In addition to the information from existing literature and the online survey, the assessment included site and country visits with the aim of elu- cidating best practices under each of these six pillars. Sites were visited across Southern, Eastern and Central Africa, and consultations were also held with law-enforcement officers at the national level in a number of countries, including Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Gabon and Togo. Survey inputs were obtained from people working in a large number of other countries as well, e.g. Congo, DRC, Tanzania and Ethiopia. The resulting assessment sets out key components for each of the six pillars that have worked well and have the potential to inform best practices across the continent. As such, the assess- ment provides detailed guidance for law-enforcement personnel working at all stages of the chain in wildlife law enforcement, and clarifies areas that law-enforcement practitioners see as a priority for additional support and funding. The study\u2019s law-enforcement framework and preliminary findings have already informed the development of a set of \u2018benchmarks\u2019 for assessing protected area law-enforcement capacity and for identifying support needs under the new EU-funded CITES Mini- mising the Illegal Killing of Elephants and other Endangered Species (MIKES) Project (see Box 6), as well as being used as the basis for the development of National Ivory Action Plans by the further nine countries of \u2018secondary concern\u2019 in relation to the illegal trade in ivory in Africa 89 (see also Section 1.3), as well as several countries in Asia. Box 6. The MIKES Law-Enforcement Capacity Assessment Benchmarks The MIKES Law Enforcement (LE) Capacity Assessment has been developed as part of the new CITES Minimising the Illegal Killing of Elephants and other Endangered Species (MIKES) Project (see also Section 1.4.3.1). An important component of the new MIKES project is the establishment of a set of law-enforcement capacity benchmarks designed to help participating range states and sites to better understand the status of their wildlife law-enforcement efforts, pinpoint key areas where investments and projects could potentially be targeted, and monitor progress in strengthening wildlife law-enforcement capacity. The MIKES National-level LE Capacity Assessment is designed to be undertaken as a self-assessment by staff working in the national wildlife management agency. Similarly, the MIKES Site-level LE Capacity Assessment is designed to be undertaken as a self-assessment by staff working at the participating MIKES site and/or at headquarters. Each assessment is organised around three law-enforcement pillars, with a set of benchmarks designed to measure law-enforcement capacity under each pillar. ( 88 ) Similar recent review studies have been undertaken also by WWF, the International Ranger Federation and the South African Wildlife College.

        "| 465 Wildlife illegal trade #5 Having already demonstrated their utility, these relatively easy to apply \u2018benchmarks\u2019 may also contribute directly to the devel- opment of the ICCWC Toolkit Light mentioned in Section 3.7.3.1 below. This and other possible activities to operationalise the forthcoming FZS Best Practices Guide were due for discussion at a workshop scheduled for late 2014/early 2015, to which German Government and EU officials would be invited in order to consider supporting a possible follow-up programme. 3.6.3 Monitor law-enforcement performance and effectiveness The monitoring of law enforcement and anti-poaching efforts in many protected areas remains costly, unsystematic and non-standardised; transparency is lacking and there is little guid- ance available to managers on how to improve current manage- ment practices. In order to address this, a global consortium of NGOs and con- servation agencies (WCS, WWF, ZSL, FZS, CITES-MIKE and North Carolina Zoo) has developed the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART; www.smartconservationtools.org). SMART is an easy- to-use software tool for tracking where park rangers go, what they see and what they do, and which makes this information transparently available to the guards themselves, their site-based managers, the national headquarters, donors and so on. At the local level, SMART can support anti-poaching by enabling the identification of poaching hotspots, the evaluation of ranger perfor- mance, and inform adaptive management for more efficient target- ing of enforcement efforts; at the national level, the information can strengthen institutional communication channels to better allocate financial and human resources to improve anti-poaching efforts; and globally, the information provides standardised, reliable and account- able measures of poaching and performance to prioritise funding streams and encourage better governance. SMART is being implemented in more than 100 protected areas worldwide through technical support provided by SMART partners in collaboration with host government agencies. In Africa, SMART is being used in protected areas in 14 countries 90 , with national- level adoption of the system already secured in Gabon and under- way in Uganda, Kenya and Democratic Republic of Congo. The SMART Partnership is also engaged with several global institu- tions and conventions in joint efforts, such as CITES-MIKE and the World Heritage Centre. Through these and other multi-lateral and international mecha- nisms, SMART has the potential to become the global standard for improved law-enforcement monitoring across protected areas. Although the current system is not without its critics, improve- ments are expected and assistance with the adoption of SMART should certainly qualify as an eligible activity for funding within EU support packages for key landscapes for conservation (KLCs).

        "466 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections 3.6.4 Form public-private security partnerships In countries where the capacity of responsible public institutions is far below that required to provide meaningful wildlife manage- ment and protection, and there is little if any prospect of govern- ment being able to rectify the situation, even in the mid to long term, then the contracting out of these functions to private enti- ties, usually on a PA-specific basis, can provide an effective solu- tion. To date, Central Africa has the longest standing experience with this conservation security partnership approach, as detailed in Chapter 3, Section 4.4. The African Parks Network is an NGO that provides such services exclusively, and currently has management contracts in seven parks in six countries 91 . Other NGOs have also taken this approach, notably WCS, which is providing robust partnerships in law enforce- ment in the Nouabal\u00e9-Ndoki NP (Congo), as well as several parks in South Sudan, and expects also to conclude similar arrangements in the near future for the Reserve de Faune Okapi in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 3.6.5 Promote community development Just as welfare issues can explain the corruption of law-enforce- ment personnel, poverty goes a long way in explaining the willing- ness of local people living with wildlife and near PAs to break the law and kill animals, whether for their own consumption or at the behest of middlemen in the illegal wildlife trade. It follows that efforts to improve and diversify the livelihoods of communities living with wildlife, particularly those neighbouring PAs, must fea- ture in any strategy to \u2018stop the killing\u2019. Such efforts should go hand- in-hand with awareness and education programmes. There is a need to increase capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities and eradicate poverty. This includes promoting innovative collaborative partnerships for the conservation and sustainable management of wildlife (includ- ing actions to reduce the illegal use of fauna and flora), such as community conservancies, public-private partnerships, sustaina- ble tourism, revenue-sharing agreements and other income sources such as sustainable agriculture. A successful example of the latter is the Community Markets for Conservation (COMACO) project in Zambia\u2019s Luangwa Valley, which through a farmer\u2019s cooperative has helped former poachers and subsistence farmers turn their efforts to new trades that are both more profitable and more environmentally friendly. 3.7 Strategy 3: Stopping the trafficking Of the four main strategies for combating the illicit trade in wild- life, that for stopping the trafficking is both the most complex and the least developed. As such, the government agencies pri- marily involved are in considerable need of financial and technical support from IGOs and NGOs. Given the nature of the value chain from source to consumer, attempts to apprehend all those involved and disrupt the trade depend on effective action by many different enforcement agen- cies. This could be thought of as a parallel \u2018enforcement chain\u2019 which, like any chain, will only be as strong as its weakest link. It follows that the procedures and competencies of all the law-en- forcement services involved should be aligned to ensure there is no weak link, including wildlife, forests, fisheries, police, customs, immigration, security, intelligence and judiciary. Until recently these various agencies tended to operate independently, one often undermining the work of another. Consequently, much attention is rightly now being paid to encour- age the creation of functional inter-agency coordination bodies to ensure they collaborate and function in a mutually supportive manner. Although names vary depending on level, these are gen- erally referred to as Wildlife Enforcement Networks (WENs), and a great deal of thought has recently gone into the methods and other mechanisms available to make such networks, and/or the individual agencies being coordinated, more effective. Many of these tools and techniques have been adapted from agencies combating other forms of illicit trade, such as drugs, arms and people. A brief overview of the principal measures available to support an anti-trafficking strategy is given below. 3.7.1 Promote international coordination in wildlife law enforcement One of the most important developments in recent years to advance international coordination in enforcing wildlife trade laws is the formation in 2011 of the ICCWC (see Section 3.2.1). Much of what is described below can be traced back to the influence of this consortium (and also at regional and national levels).

        "| 467 Wildlife illegal trade #5 3.7.1.1 Intercontinental initiatives The USA is a strong champion of the WEN approach and is work- ing with ICCWC and other interested partners to support the cre- ation of a global network of regional and national WENs to improve communication and strengthen response actions across enforcement agencies globally. In March 2013, with US funding, the ICCWC convened the First Global Meeting of the Wildlife Enforcement Networks in Bangkok, which brought together 131 participants from around the world, enabled wildlife law- enforcement officers and WEN representatives to share their experiences at combating wildlife crime, and to discuss ways of further enhancing cooperation to respond to the serious threat posed by transnational organised groups involved in wildlife crime. All existing networks \u2013 including those that have been recently established and those under consideration \u2013 participated in the event, as well as a number of interested countries, intergov- ernmental organisations and civil society organisations. During the meeting, participants reaffirmed the need to work together and suggested increased interaction amongst WENs to form a \u2018network of the wildlife enforcement networks\u2019, which could promote communication and cooperation links amongst them at regional, continental and global levels. As a precursor to this event, a month-long pilot exercise in such intercontinental cooperation was carried out in January 2013 with US support. Known as Operation Cobra , this involved police, cus- toms and wildlife officers in 22 Asian and African countries, and resulted in a large number of arrests and seizures. Exactly a year later, Operation Cobra II had similar success, involving 28 coun- tries and resulting in more than 400 arrests and 350 major sei- zures across Africa and Asia, including 36 rhino horns and over 3 metric tons of elephant ivory. Police, customs, and wildlife offi- cials from China, Africa, South-east and South Asia, as well as the United States of America, joined together with CITES, WCO, Interpol, the Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN)-WEN and the Lusaka Agreement Task Force (LATF) to stage the oper- ation out of coordination centres in Nairobi and Bangkok, with links to field operatives across Africa and Asia. The International Coordination Team for Cobra II exchanged real- time intelligence on a daily basis, targeting poachers and traf- fickers of endangered species. 3.7.1.2 NGO involvement The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and Interpol signed a MoU In May 2013 to partner in evidence-based wildlife crime investigations and enforcement operations, the first ever MoU signed by Interpol\u2019s Environmental Crime Programme with an NGO. To date, the two organisations have coordinated three multi-agency operations in all regions of Africa, each lasting several months, namely Operation Wendi in 2012, Operation Worthy in 2013 and Operation Wildcat in 2014. IFAW and another NGO, the Freeland Foundation, were also closely involved with the two Africa/Asia Cobra operations mentioned above. \u2303 A leopard skin confiscated in Ethiopia as part of Operation Cobra II which involved intercontinental cooperation between over 28 countries in Asia and Africa.

This led to formal inter- governmental negotiations under the auspices of UNEP, with the final Agreement eventually coming into force in December 1996. Currently, there are seven parties to the Agreement: The Republics of Congo (Brazzaville), Kenya, Liberia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and the Kingdom of Lesotho. The Republics of South Africa, Ethiopia and the Kingdom of Swaziland are signatories. The Agreement provides for a Governing Council, national bureaux and a permanent task force to implement its objectives of reducing and ultimately eliminating illegal trade in wild fauna and flora in Africa. The Lusaka Agreement Task Force (LATF) was established in June 1999 with headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya. It comprises seconded law-enforcement officers from party states and locally recruited support staff, and its mission is to work with the national bureaux in order to: \u2022 facilitate cooperative activities in undertaking law-enforce- ment operations; \u2022 investigate violations of national wildlife laws; \u2022 disseminate and exchange information on illegal trade activities; \u2022 build capacity for awareness promotion. Essentially these correspond to WEN functions, so the idea of a WEN for Africa is not new. However the LATF prototype has not been an unqualified success when the return on 15 years\u2019 heavy investment is assessed in terms of impact. It has been the subject of considerable criticism, and the almost random assemblage of countries involved does not fit well with any of the regional political groupings that have emerged since, and for which the formation of new WENs is now under active consideration (see below). Consequently the continued relevance of the LATF is uncertain, which is causing tension and distracting from the priority actions that need to be undertaken in Africa. It would be in the interests of all parties therefore if a review of the LATF was commissioned, possibly by the EU, in order to inform further funding and advo- cacy avenues if any. 3.7.2.2 Regional initiatives: emerging WENs USAID has invested USD 17 million since 2005 towards estab- lishing regional WENs, of which the Association of South-east Asian Nations is a notable example (ASEAN-WEN). Following such models, the US initiated the development of a Central African WEN in November 2011, with a workshop in Douala under the auspices of the Commission of Central African Forests (COMIFAC). The meeting brought together representatives from COMIFAC member countries 92 and produced a Regional Action Plan for Strengthening National Wildlife Law Implementation for the period 2012-2017, which would form the basis for a wildlife enforcement network in Central Africa, similar to those opera- tional or under development in Central America, Europe, South and South-east Asia. This was followed up by another US-funded workshop in Libreville in April 2012. The Regional Workshop on Wildlife Trafficking and Dismantling Transnational Illicit Networks brought together the same Central African countries as in Douala.

        "| 469 Wildlife illegal trade #5 well as representatives from NGOs and IGOs held three days of productive and practical dialogue in support of building a regional wildlife enforcement network (WEN) to combat wildlife trafficking. A draft resolution was proposed at the workshop with recommen- dations that were formulated by the Central Africans to support establishing and implementing a Central African WEN. The US is now initiating support for the creation of yet more networks in Asia, South America and Africa. In October 2013 it facilitated a Southern Africa Regional Wildlife Trafficking Work- shop in Gaborone. Officials of wildlife enforcement authorities from Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe resolved, but in principle only, to recommend the establishment of a network of national wildlife law-enforcement agencies to be known as the Wildlife Enforcement Network for Southern Africa (WENSA). It should be noted, however, that there is a risk that the proposed WENSA would duplicate work already being done by the SADC Regional Rhino & Elephant Security Group (RESG) / Interpol Envi- ronmental Crime Working Group (ECWG), which has been working since 1989. Another new African WEN is being promoted under a comprehen- sive programme entitled ARREST, standing for Africa\u2019s Regional Response to Endangered Species Trafficking , based on a concept jointly developed by AWF, the Freeland Foundation and IFAW. These organisations have prepared with US help a proposal that seeks funding for the recent initiative of eight African govern- ments to create a new Horn of Africa Wildlife Enforcement Net- work (HAWEN). HAWEN member countries currently consist of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda. These are the member states of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), which has already committed to provid- ing office space for the HAWEN Secretariat in its Djibouti head- quarters. While possible in principle, it is not clear whether and how in practice the three countries already involved in the LATF (see above) will be able to sustain membership in two WENs simultaneously 93 . The ARREST model is designed to be a holistic continent-wide programme that increases capacity and communication channels between the Horn of Africa and other parts of Africa, as well as the rest of the world. The ARREST partnership is already engaging other regions of Africa and expects these to benefit from the initial action in the Horn of Africa, which is intended to serve as a pilot that will inspire development of similar WENs, as has been mooted already for Southern Africa. As presented in the ARREST proposal, these WENs will serve as facilities to build the enforcement capacities of member states \u2013 at the national level \u2013 for the protection of key populations, wildlife crime investigation and evidence collection, the use of legal tools and prosecutorial procedures, and the identification of species tar- geted for illegal trade. As such their principal focus will be on the delivery of a variety of training courses, including: \u2022 operational and tactical enforcement conservation training for protected areas (PROTECT); \u2022 training on the detection of environmental crime (DETECT); \u2022 legal training for prosecutors and the judiciary; \u2022 training on species identification; \u2022 training on the care of confiscated wildlife. An important element of regional networking is to develop agree- ments to facilitate cross-border cooperation in order to pursue, arrest and extradite poachers and illegal traders. Ideally such measures should be mandated in formal regional protocols. 3.7.3 Form national inter-agency coordination bodies 3.7.3.1 NESTs, NCUs and WENs Recent trends in the wildlife trade, particularly those involving ivory and rhino horn, have not only attracted widespread inter- national attention, but have also galvanised responses at the national level. Most often these have been focused on trying to prevent commodities entering the value chain in the first place, through anti-poaching efforts to stop the killing. More and more countries, however, have realised that they need to tackle the rest of the chain within their territories and even beyond. To that end they have been setting up multi-agency task forces, committees, groups and units which equate to WENs at the national level, such as NESTs (National Environment Security Task Forces) promoted by Interpol (see Section 3.2.3), and the NCUs ( 93 ) Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda. \u2303 Intelligence operations, including secret recordings of conversations, were used to incriminate a well-known elephant poacher (center) boasting of the protection he receives from rogue elements of the Congolese army to poach elephants in and around the Lomami National Park, DRC.

        "470 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections (National Coordinating Units) of Central Africa mentioned in Chap- ter 3, Section 5.5. Two specific examples from a supply and con- sumer country respectively are South Africa\u2019s National Wildlife Crime Reaction Unit , and China\u2019s National Inter-agency CITES Enforcement Collaborative Group . Membership varies, but should encompass all natural resource management agencies 94 , as well as police, customs, intelligence, prosecutors, the judiciary and so on. A highly relevant product in this context is ICCWC\u2019s Wildlife and Forest Crime Analytic Toolkit , which is designed to assist government officials in forestry and wildlife administration, cus- toms and all other relevant enforcement agencies in conducting a comprehensive review and analysis of possible means and measures to protect wildlife and forest and monitor products thereof, thus identifying technical assistance needs. ICCWC will support countries wishing to use the Toolkit (see Section 3.2.1 above). Due to its very comprehensive nature, application of the existing Toolkit is a \u2018heavy\u2019 undertaking in that it is both time-con- suming and expensive. Accordingly, the development of an ICCWC Toolkit Light that can be implemented more easily, quickly and cheaply is being actively considered. There is a potentially very useful convergence between this initiative and the national and site-level self-assessments developed under the MIKES project (see Section 3.6.2 and Box 6). One of the very likely and desirable outcomes of any national review or assessment would be a recommendation to form a NEST or other national WEN-equivalent, or strengthen it where one already exists. Interpol has published guidelines to assist in this process (see Section 3.2.3), and also advocates the creation within NESTs of intelligence analysis and investigation units ded- icated to tackling wildlife crime. Many countries need help not only in organising a NEST or other national WEN-equivalent, but also in strengthening the capacity of the network\u2019s individual members and units. In some countries where the trade, especially in high-profile product like ivory and rhino horn, is a dominant issue, a problem of too many uncoor- dinated offers of help can arise. Tanzania provides a notable example of this. The US Government pledged over a year ago that it would assign a USFWS official to its Embassy in Dar es Salaam to support the Tanzanian Govern- ment\u2019s efforts to develop an overarching wildlife security strategy. In the continued absence of this official, the Tanzanian Govern- ment turned for help to the Germans, who already had a senior advisor embedded in the Wildlife Division. At least two other over- lapping initiatives have gone ahead at the same time. The local office of UNDP commissioned a dedicated consultancy to design a national wildlife security strategy, while the FZS prepared secu- rity plans for two premier protected areas 95 , which led to the development of a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 logic for inter-agency coordination and the sharing of intelligence information, without which field- level protection efforts would remain compromised. Despite all the foregoing the US may still post a security adviser to Dar es Salaam, which could in fact help consolidate these and other inputs into an effective single official strategy. 3.7.3.2 NGO involvement: the EAGLE approach As for protection operations at the field level, there are countries where the capacity and/or integrity of the responsible public insti- tutions are far below that required to provide meaningful enforce- ment of anti-trafficking laws. In such situations, some govern- ments will either accept or tolerate the involvement of an NGO in detecting wildlife crime, identifying those involved and bringing them to court. From the success of the first such project in Cameroon, a formula has now emerged based on the EAGLE (Eco Activists for Governance and Law Enforcement) network, created and led by an NGO called LAGA (The Last Great Ape Organisation). As for conservation security partnerships with NGOs at the PA-level, Central Africa has the longest standing experience with the \u2018EAGLE approach\u2019 (see Chapter 3, Section 5.5). Currently, WCS is a partner with the Aspinall Foundation in running an EAGLE project in the Republic of Congo, called PALF ( Projet d\u2019appui \u00e0 l\u2019application de la loi sur la faune sauvage 96 ), which runs investigations, assists in operations, does legal follow-up and has a communication department to publicise convictions and other successes. WCS is currently launching EAGLE replicates in the DRC and Nigeria. Unsurprisingly perhaps, WCS argues that the EAGLE approach should be applied throughout Africa. Among the bigger economies of Southern and Eastern Africa however, many governments will be unlikely to tolerate an NGO role in sensitive national-security- related matters. In such countries, one must strive to build capac- ity directly within Government, by supporting the development and effective functioning of NESTs or WENs for example: this is anyway the only approach with any real prospect of long-term sustainability. Exceptions within Eastern Africa where an interim EAGLE approach might be justified are South Sudan and Somalia, countries in which governance is as weak as some of those in Central and West Africa.

        "| 471 Wildlife illegal trade #5 3.7.4 Develop information management and monitoring systems Most anti-trafficking strategists stress the need for information from poachers, documentation obtained during seizures, inter- views with associated traffickers and other evidence all to be systematically gathered and analysed for a collective response. However the lack of reliable, comprehensive and consistent data on wildlife trafficking is a major problem at all levels, whether local, national, regional, continental or global. It is important that relevant data and statistics are collected, collated, analysed and disseminated amongst all relevant agencies to assist priority setting in the fight against organised crime at any level. Part of the problem is that enforcement services are inhibited by the resource demands of multiple reporting requirements and the different formats used by different organisations (Interpol, CITES, WCO, etc.). There are a number of candidate platforms on which a unified reporting format could be developed to enable a coordinated multinational response from law enforcement worldwide. These include: \u2022 Interpol\u2019s global databases and network; \u2022 WCO\u2019s secure Customs Enforcement Network Communication (CENcomm) applications, notably ENVIRONET, a communication tool that facilitates information exchange and cooperation in the area of environment and wildlife enforcement. The tool enables customs administrations, other competent national agencies, international organisations and their regional net- works to share real-time information as well as reference material, which are essential for successful enforcement; \u2022 IBM i2 Intelligent Law Enforcement software, which provides flexible intelligence analysis, law enforcement and investigation capabilities that help combat crime, terrorism and fraudulent activity. Notably for WENs it can deliver organisational efficien- cies to policing and partner agencies by improving oversight, collaboration and the speed with which information is shared, and by removing barriers to information access and sharing; \u2022 the Wildlife Enforcement Monitoring System (WEMS) which has been under development by the UN University for many years but the use of which still appears to be limited; \u2022 the relatively recent SMART system and software (see Section 3.6.3). Logically, ICCWC would provide a useful forum in which to discuss how to rationalise and/or reconcile these different tools \u2013 indeed its member organisation, UNODC, may achieve this under its Global Programme to Combat WLFC, which includes amongst its aims the \u2018Introduction of data collection and analysis systems to provide a detailed information/knowledge base on WLFC, together with better dissemination and use of that information\u2019. Functions that should feature in any law enforcement data sys- tem include the ability to compare actual performance against pre-set targets, whether these be number of man-days on patrol (an index of effort), or the number of arrests or seizures in a given period (an index of success). The ability to analyse one variable against any other is also required, such as number of arrests as a function of effort (an index of efficiency). Use of the Elephant Trade Information System\u2019s (ETIS) Law Enforcement Effort Ratio (LEER), which represents how effective law enforcement is in intercepting illegal trade in ivory in target countries, is also rele- vant here. ICCWC has embarked upon a process to develop a set of global wildlife crime-enforcement indicators, to which the EU can provide inputs through a wider package of support to UNODC, which is leading on this important effort (see Section 3.9.3.1). 3.7.5 Apply specialised tools 3.7.5.1 Container control programmes In the international maritime trade supply chain, approximately 500 million container movements are registered each year. With up to 90 % of world cargo movement occurring in shipping containers, the size and complexity of this transportation mode is staggering. According to research results, no more than 2 % of these containers are physically checked after arrival at a destination to verify the contents. The sheer volume of shipping container traffic, along with the sophisticated and often ingenious concealment methods and diverse routings adopted by smugglers of ivory and other wildlife products, makes successful interdiction difficult. In response to this challenge, Container Control Programmes similar to that proposed by UNODC and WCO for East Africa are needed. The main element of the programme is the creation of dedicated inter-agency container profiling units, known as Joint Port Control Units (JPCUs), comprising customs and other relevant law-enforcement officers. Not only should JPCUs be included in national WENs, but JPCUs should also include officers dedicated to detecting and identifying wildlife contraband as opposed to drugs or arms, etc. CCPs can train these officers in the identification and inspection of high-risk containers, based upon risk analysis and other modern profiling techniques. Additionally, they can deliver the specialised scanners and other technical equipment needed to identify and inspect high-risk freight containers with minimum disruption to legitimate trade and business. One well publicised type of \u2018technical equipment\u2019 being deployed to detect ivory and rhino horn, in particular as it transits ports and airports, is the trained detector or \u2018sniffer\u2019 dog. NGOs such as WCS in Gabon, Congo and soon Tanzania are providing such dogs for ivory detection, and training their handlers. ",
        "472 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections Apart from container ports, trained sniffer dogs are needed at all major trafficking hubs (airports and ports) and other \u2018choke points\u2019 such as border crossings. 3.7.5.2 Controlled deliveries 97 Investigations often do not extend beyond the point of detection or seizure. For this reason the increased use of controlled deliv- eries could have a significant impact on the activities of organised crime groups, as it targets the entire crime chain and facilitates law-enforcement action beyond the point of detection or seizure. At the time of writing, both Interpol and the WCO, in close con- sultation with each other, are developing two complementary projects to enhance the use of controlled deliveries to combat wildlife crime. Interpol is developing a 28-month-long project, co-funded by ICCWC, which will include training on the application of controlled deliveries and other tracking methods, followed by potential domestic, regional and international operations using these methods. WCO is developing a multi-year programme to build the capacity of customs officials in responding to wildlife crime, for which the CITES Secretariat has secured funding from the UK. Following discussions amongst ICCWC partners, it was agreed that this programme should incorporate a controlled delivery component. Countries in Africa and Asia that have the legal framework to conduct controlled deliveries with wildlife specimens will be iden- tified, training workshops will be provided and an international law-enforcement operation using controlled delivery techniques will be carried out, as part of the broader WCO programme. 3.7.5.3 Follow the money To address the serious problem of money-laundering as a facil- itator of wildlife trafficking and related offences, countries may need to adopt or amend policies and legislation aimed at the prevention and detection of this crime. The CITES Secretariat is currently in discussion with the World Bank regarding the development of an e-learning module on wildlife crime and anti-money-laundering. The United Kingdom and the European Commission have agreed to fund this initiative. On 25 March 2014, the International Sustainability Unit of the Prince of Wales Charitable Foundation hosted a meeting in London on Following the money from wildlife crime . The meeting brought together around 30 participants, representing a broad range of expertise from the financial sector, law enforcement and wildlife conservation, to discuss how banks and others might use existing tools to \u2018follow the money\u2019 from the illegal wildlife trade. Partici- pants welcomed the opportunity to meet with such a diverse group, and welcomed the convening of an Experts Group that could con- tinue to develop promising wildlife trade applications. 3.7.5.4 Forensics Forensic analyses of samples from seized specimens can signif- icantly contribute to ongoing investigations, the design of appro- priate law enforcement responses, and ensuring that the entire crime chain is addressed. For forensic data to be credible and admissible, relevant legislation must be complied with at all times, and appropriate methods and procedures must be used during crime-scene investigation, sample collection, shipping, analysis, interpretation of results and database maintenance.

        "| 473 Wildlife illegal trade #5 Law enforcement officers responsible for the investigation of cases involving large-scale ivory seizures are often confronted with the challenge of identifying the most appropriate way to collect and submit specimens to appropriate facilities for forensic analysis. On 13 November 2014, as a major contribution to address this and related problems, the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) released its Guidelines on methods and procedures for ivory sampling and laboratory analysis in support of the deployment of forensic technology to combat elephant poaching 98 . Led by UNODC, as a member of ICCWC, the guidelines are intended for worldwide use and are aimed at first responders, investigators, law-enforcement officials, forensic scientists, prosecutors and the judiciary. Their purpose is to facilitate the use of forensic science to the fullest extent possible in order to combat wildlife crime, and, in particular, to combat the trade in illegal ivory through the provision of guidance to support transna- tional criminal investigations and law enforcement operations. It includes detailed protocols on methods of sampling and analysis, which can be applied by law-enforcement officers and by labo- ratories with appropriate facilities. Forensic analysis techniques are also relevant to seizures of rhino horn and many other wildlife products. Developing the capacity to apply them is discussed more fully in Section 3.9.3.4. 3.7.5.5 Publicity NESTs and WENs should ensure that illicit wildlife trafficking is publicised as a serious crime under national law, notably showcas- ing successful prosecutions that resulted in significant penalties. 3.8 Strategy 4: Stopping the demand 3.8.1 Educate and influence consumers Effectively targeted action plans are needed to eradicate demand for illegal wildlife products, including but not limited to, raising awareness and changing behaviour. Governments should work in partnership with relevant stakeholders, including sectoral NGOs and experts, businesses and civil society. Actions should be sci- entific and clearly evidence-based, building research and surveys into consumer knowledge, attitudes and behaviour, to form part of coherent demand-reduction strategies designed on the scale and in a time frame needed to have meaningful impact, and delivering measurable behaviour change amongst consumers. The demand-reduction strategies of TRAFFIC and some other NGOs are described in this chapter\u2019s sections on elephant and rhino. WCS for instance is working on demand reduction in key markets, and recognises both the need for multiple approaches to address demand, and the importance of awareness-raising campaigns using both traditional and social media. As noted in the discussion on ivory demand however (Section 1.4.4.3), demand-reduction efforts need to be better grounded in more realistic and comprehensive contextual and factual under- standings of consumers and their motivations. This means it may be necessary to go beyond the conservation sector and involve current non-participants who may have important roles, for exam- ple the arts investment community, cultural preservation groups and religious groups.

More research into such substitutes is needed. 3.8.2.2 Destruction of stockpiles In addition to their important publicity and awareness-raising value, the destruction of stockpiles is recommended because they are costly to secure and maintain, they divert scarce resources away from front-line conservation, and their content may enter the illegal supply chain (through theft) and drive speculation. Consequently, governments \u2013 including those of EU Member States \u2013 that have stockpiles of illegal products, particularly of high-value items such as rhino horn or elephant ivory, should be encouraged to destroy them. Independent audits, or other means of ensuring transparent management, should be carried out prior to destruction, as should sampling for DNA analysis. 3.8.2.3 Impose legal moratoria and bans International trade bans are mediated via CITES. However there is nothing to stop either regional groupings or individual countries from promoting and enforcing legal moratoria and bans on any product within their jurisdictions. For example, calls to curb demand by closing all domestic ivory markets through involun- tary, legal mechanisms are gaining strength. Some US markets have been closed down recently (see Section 3.3.4), and all other countries with active domestic markets are under increasing pres- sure to follow suit, including those in the EU (see Section 1.5.1.5). It must be noted, however, that the USFWS\u2019s efforts to enforce a federal ban on the domestic ivory trade have met significant resistance from owners of antique ivory artefacts and of musical instruments, for example. Despite the legal challenges involved, the Service is confident of developing regulatory compromises that will not undermine the fundamental aim of protecting ele- phants; in which case the lessons learned by the US Administra- tion in enforcing a national ban will benefit other countries wishing to do the same. 3.8.2.4 Use high-profile diplomacy and advocacy The potential value and impact of this approach is inherent to the suggestion made at the High Level Event on Illicit Wildlife Traf- ficking hosted by Germany and Gabon in New York alongside the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in September 2013, which was to establish a Special Representative to the Secretary General to further the fight against illicit wildlife trafficking, and for the UNGA to request this in a formal Resolution. The UN Group of Friends on Poaching and Illicit Wildlife Trafficking based in New York offers a good vehicle to explore this suggestion further. For example, its added value compared to existing tools deserves closer analysis, particularly with regard to the mandate, profile, timeline and budget of the proposed special UN Repre- sentative/Envoy on Wildlife Trafficking. Also, the link with security as well as with other initiatives on natural resources and conflicts could be developed further. 3.9 Actions recommended for EU support It is obvious that efforts to curb the illegal trade in any wildlife commodity, be it ivory, apes or peacocks, will require essentially the same preventative and investigative procedures and involve the same range of enforcement agencies. It follows that any action taken to strengthen the capacity of the wildlife enforce- ment machinery stands to benefit very many species, and would therefore represent money very well spent. The question is, what would be the most effective contributions for the European Commission to make in this regard? As has been emphasised already, none of the strategic fronts on which the war against illegal wildlife trade can be fought is suf- ficient in itself, meaning action must be taken on them all, simul- taneously, at global, regional and national levels. According to the strategic reviews given above therefore, the following actions are recommended for EU support. With so much that needs doing, and with so many other actors also trying to help, these recommendations represent a conscious attempt to avoid an all-inclusive, over-ambitious programme, and instead to identify a realistic selection of interventions that have the potential to generate a very good return on investment in terms of ultimate impact. It should be noted here that the recommendations arising from the EU\u2019s own Expert Conference on the EU Approach against Wild- life Trafficking of 10 April 2014 have been duly considered. ",
        "| 475 Wildlife illegal trade #5 3.9.1 Action to strengthen policies and laws The EU and its Member States should act on all of the many relevant recommendations arising from its own Expert Confer- ence on the EU Approach against Wildlife Trafficking of 10 April 2014, whether domestic or international in nature. However, not all of the suggestions submitted by those consulted in the course of this exercise were adopted 99 . Ones that should be included are the need for EU countries to close domestic ivory markets and to destroy any stockpiles of ivory (see Section 1.5.1.5). Several of the actions recommended under the other strategic headings will indirectly support the strengthening of wildlife trade- relevant policies and laws, either internationally or nationally. 3.9.2 Action to stop the killing In other chapters of this report, a compelling case is made for the EU to concentrate a greater proportion of its support for wildlife conservation in Africa on a number of carefully selected Key Landscapes for Conservation or KLCs (for an overview see the Summary document \u2013 Synthesis, Section 5.1). The most effective contribution the EU could make to stopping the killing at field level would be to provide the necessary inputs (training, equipment, etc.) as part of its support packages to KLCs. Given the severity of the impacts that the ivory and rhino horn trades in particular are having in terms of poaching, it follows that of all KLCs, those harbouring key elephant and rhino popu- lations should receive priority funding. Approaches to alleviate rural poverty, which is a fundamental driver of poaching at the field level, can also be addressed within the context of support to KLCs (see Chapter 2 on Eastern Africa, Sections 2.2.3 and 3.7 for example). 3.9.3 Action to stop the trafficking Action is needed at both international and national levels. Options for the former are relatively straightforward, but at the national level direct support to anti-trafficking efforts can take one or both of two basic routes. One accommodates major NGO participation; the other goes directly in support of the government machinery involved. While the former can be of great value in particular situations, the latter is the one best suited to a major donor like the EU, itself representing governments. As noted elsewhere, working alongside or even within government anyway offers the best prospects for sustainable impacts in the long term (see Sec- tion 3.7.3.2). Accordingly, the national-level actions recommended here reflect a prioritisation of support for government agencies. 3.9.3.1 Continue and expand support for international trade regulation The EU should continue as an important financier of CITES-mandated actions and CITES\u2019 core functions 100 , and more especially should not only continue but also expand its support for all ICCWC operations, especially those of UNODC, which is taking the lead in so many relevant fields, ranging from forensics to controlled deliveries to indicators. This overall position with respect to CITES and ICCWC is exactly consistent with that recommended by the recent Expert Con- ference on the EU Approach against Wildlife Trafficking. UNODC\u2019s Global Programme for Combating Wildlife and Forest Crime is considered particularly worthy of support, as it elabo- rates on all these initiatives, and its anti-trafficking components are particularly well thought-out and constructed. At the time of writing (September 2014), this programme has secured only USD 3 million of the target USD 18 million required. Since this is a ready-to-go programme, much needed in a crisis situation, which ticks all the boxes with regard to appropriate action, and since it is organised regionally, the EU is very strongly recommended to fund its entire African component. Failing such an all-embracing approach, the EU should support the following more focused interventions, which are anyway con- sistent with UNODC\u2019s Global Programme. 3.9.3.2 Support the establishment of national WENs The WEN approach to establishing functional, well-coordinated multi-agency enforcement mechanisms offers a great deal of promise in the anti-trafficking context, but there is a dilemma as to how best go about this. One approach \u2013 evidently favoured by the USA \u2013 is to develop a regional WEN first, and use this to catalyse the formation (through initial \u2018country assessments\u2019), and then develop the capacity of the complementary national-level WENs required within each of its member countries. It is worth noting, however, that a regional structure in Southern Africa, the SADC Regional Rhino & Elephant Security Group (RESG)/Interpol Environmental Crime Working Group (ECWG), has been in operation since 1989 and does much of what a regional WEN would. The other approach \u2013 favoured by ICCWC \u2013 is to work at the national level first and then, only once each country has the appropriate \u2018machinery\u2019 in place, consider the possible need for a WEN at the next level up. ICCWC\u2019s Wildlife and Forest Crime Analytic Toolkit was developed specifically with this in mind and holds great potential.

        "476 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections There are several problems with developing a regional body first, especially if it creates a physical institution with its own expensive overheads. The ASEAN-WEN, which is often quoted as a success- ful model to follow, has struggled to sustain its operations once US funding support came to an end. Whilst the LATF has not been an unqualified success, the reason it has kept going for 15 years is due to the annual subscriptions of its member states. Without a continuous funding commitment from its member states, it is unlikely any regional WEN can be sustainable. Such a commit- ment might be forthcoming if members were convinced of its value, but the value-added by an institutional WEN at the regional level is widely questioned. It is not the value or need for supra-national networking per se that is being disputed, but rather the idea that without an actual institution with offices and staff it would never happen. On the contrary, if there are strong WENs at the national level, each with a \u2018focal person\u2019 for international relations, there is nothing to stop these persons interacting with each other or with international agencies directly: it is not as though this would be impossible with- out the assistance of an intermediary regional WEN 101 . They are not even an essential pre-requisite to coordinated interregional or intercontinental exercises, as Operations Wendi, Worthy and Wild- cat have proved. It is because of such considerations of sustaina- bility and value-added that the recent effort to push forward a WEN for Southern Africa (WENSA) received only lukewarm sup- port from the states involved, and led them only \u2018to recommend\u2019 its formation \u2018in principle\u2019, rather than \u2018agree\u2019 to it outright. It follows therefore that the EU should not finance the devel- opment of regional WENs as institutions in their own right. The European Commission can support them in principle, as does CITES and other bodies, not least because they might offer a potentially useful source of relevant training support. The substantive recommendation, however, is for the EU to give priority to supporting the establishment of national- level WENs, initially by funding the application of ICCWC\u2019s Wildlife and Forest Crime Analytic Toolkit in any and all countries that would benefit from this, and then by extend- ing support to facilitate implementation of the resultant National Action Plans. The latter requirement will be essential in most countries: any assumption on ICCWC\u2019s part that governments can be relied upon to drive and finance the necessary follow-up action is a weakness in the Toolkit\u2019s current application. One common criticism of the existing Toolkit is that it goes into far too much detail. It is further recommended that the EU adds value to its current and further investments in the MIKES Project and ICCWC gener- ally, by funding a process to merge MIKES\u2019s national-level capac- ity assessment methodology based on \u2018benchmarks\u2019, with the development of a \u2018Light\u2019 version of the ICCWC Toolkit. By being easier, quicker and cheaper, the latter should be much more widely applicable and so have greater impact (see Section 3.6.2 and Box 6). 3.9.3.3 Develop a cadre of international wildlife security advisers The structure of the organised groups involved in wildlife trade-related crimes has five different levels, from poacher to the end consumer: \u2022 Level 1: field (protected area, communal and private land): poachers (individuals or groups); \u2022 Level 2: local: receivers/couriers; \u2022 Level 3 : national: couriers/buyers/facilitators; \u2022 Level 4: national: exporters; \u2022 Level 5: international: forwarders/importers/traders/ consumers. Investigation complexity differs significantly between Levels 1 and 5. Current enforcement activities in source/supply states address criminal syndicate members from Levels 1 to 2 relatively effectively (although with varying degrees of success, of course). However, these individuals are often easily replaced, and the threat will continue to exist for as long as enforcement activities do not address the driving force behind them at Levels 3 to 5. Organised crime syndicate members on Level 5 are located in transit/consumer countries and beyond the reach of enforcement authorities in supply countries. It is for this reason that increased international cooperation and coordination are vital. Thus the main challenge for national enforcement agencies is at Levels 3 and 4. This is because identifying and catching the king- pins or \u2018big fish\u2019 involved needs inter-agency intelligence-led approaches that are both proactive and reactive, and which can penetrate the layers of secrecy and corruption that protect these people and facilitate their activities. Unfortunately these skills are not well developed, in a wildlife context at least, so it is in this area that national WENs can be expected to add most value, provided they are staffed by people skilled in intelligence analysis methods, including social network analysis. However, development of these skills is not straightforward. Prob- ably the best way to develop them is for selected WEN officers to work alongside a person already experienced in the relevant meth- ods, i.e. through on-the-job or experiential learning. This could be delivered by embedding \u2013 for two to three years \u2013 suitably qualified technical assistants (TAs), or wildlife security advisers, within national-level WENs or WEN-equivalents. It is interesting to note ( 101 ) The UNDP consultancy to develop a national wildlife security strategy for Tanzania came to similar conclusions: Harrison P. (2014).

It is recommended therefore that the EU develops an appropriate TA resource that could be supplied on request, and the obvious and ideal partner to lead this initiative is ICCWC 102 . This resource could consist of former police, military, customs and intelligence officers, etc. from EU Member States, especially those who have worked on other similar forms of organised crime (drugs, human- trafficking, arms, etc.). Under the proposed scheme, the EU would fund the salaries and expenses of the TAs so deployed, and also provide them with limited hardware, software 103 and operational support. There can be little doubt that the presence of such technical assistance would also help drive many routine aspects of WEN functionality, and optimise links to international agencies such as Interpol, Europol (the European Police Office), the proposed AFROPOL and WCO. Any resultant improvement in dealing with Levels 3 and 4 in the criminal hierarchy would bring dispropor- tionately massive returns on the investment in terms of saving wildlife. It follows that the deployment of national wildlife security advisers represents a very promising approach for the European Commission to adopt within its overall strategy. The first steps would be to win the ICCWC\u2019s agreement, and then commission a detailed feasibility study in which the African Union (AU), ACP and beneficiary states would be consulted as to the diplomatic, technical and practical modalities required to make the scheme work 104 . Initial discussions of the concept held in 2014 with senior government officials in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda during the preparation of the next EU Regional Indicative Programme generated entirely positive reactions. 3.9.3.4 Forensic laboratories for Africa The very urgent need for facilities capable of determining the provenance of ivory and rhino horn has been described in the relevant sections of this chapter (Sections 1.5.1.2 and 2.5.1.1). The need is arguably most pressing in Southern and Eastern Africa, these being the regions in which the majority of the con- tinent\u2019s elephants and rhinos are found today. Even so, a signif- icant amount of seized ivory originates in Central Africa meaning a facility is needed in that region as well. At present there are two facilities with the potential to provide regional forensic ser- vices for ivory and rhino horn, namely the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory (VGL) lab in Pretoria for Southern Africa, and the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) lab in Nairobi for Eastern Africa. A lab planned in Gabon has regional potential for Central Africa. \u2303 Royal Thai police display confiscated elephants tusks, and the Malaysian trafficker (seated) responsible for smuggling them from Africa, March 2015. ( 102 ) Not only is the EU already one of ICCWC\u2019s main financiers, but ICCWC is also offering similar TA-type support, e.g. the deployment of Wildlife Incident Support Teams (WISTs), see Section 3.2.1. ( 103 ) See Section 3.7.4. ( 104 ) Relevant to this would be lessons to be learned from an intelligence project currently under development in South Africa that aims to better disrupt syndicates higher up the criminal pyramids. A pre-requisite is the buy-in of all relevant branches of government (intelligence, police, environmental affairs, etc.) \u2013 in effect the formation of a national WEN.

        "478 | LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS | Inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa \u2013 Regional Analysis \u2013 Additional sections Subject to the inputs of other donors, it is recommended that the EU should provide complementary assistance towards the devel- opment and sustainable operations of these labs as a matter of priority and for the following reasons. Firstly, a substantial amount of investment has already gone into developing a real collabo- ration between the VGL and KWS labs, so it makes sense to support and expand the work that has already been done in that regard. Secondly, all such labs have the potential to determine the identity and provenance of very many types of wildlife prod- uct, not just ivory and rhino horn, thus contributing to the overall effort to address illicit wildlife trading in general. The VGL Laboratory, Pretoria, South Africa The Pretoria rhino-horn facility should be developed further to provide additional ivory analysis services for Southern Africa. As a proven performer of the highest international calibre that already possesses most if not all of the expensive equipment required, it should have relatively little difficulty expanding into this niche, subject only to it being fully and sustainably funded. The EU could help assure this. The KWS Laboratory, Nairobi, Kenya As noted in Chapter 2 (Section 3.2.2), this facility already has in place the security infrastructure and policies needed to maintain the admissibility in court of biological evidence for prosecutions, and with help from the VGL lab, capacity is already being devel- oped there to provide a regional service as regards rhino horn analysis. It was confirmed in the course of the present study that KWS envisages a state-of-the-art lab in forensics that will be of strong regional significance, and has developed a policy of mak- ing the lab available to East African neighbours on a not-for- profit/at-cost basis. Furthermore, East African scientists and technicians will be welcomed at the new lab for training and practical work. Given this pre-existing regional orientation, the KWS lab is the obvious place in which to develop a regional ana- lytical service for ivory as well, not least because the same equip- ment can be used whether the sample is rhino horn or ivory. As of May 2014, the lab was half built but lacked essential equip- ment. Cost estimates for fully equipping it varied: according to the WWF USD 380 000 was required (J. Okori, pers. comm.), while asso- ciates from the Smithsonian estimated up to USD 774 000 inclusive of a USD 240 000 DNA sequencer (D. Schindel, pers. comm.). These estimates did not cover the need for computer networking and data storage hardware and software that comply with stringent security protocols. Given the dynamics of this field, there would also be a need for continuous training estimated at USD 45 000 p.a. Yearly running costs, exclusive of training needs, were estimated at USD 150 000 p.a. for a full staff complement. This translates to an investment of between roughly EUR 500 000 (for equipment only) and EUR 1 million for a three-year support programme. As recently as September 2014 however, KWS announced that a portion of a USD 3 million grant from the US Government in support of anti-poaching activities in Kenya would be devoted to the development of its forensic lab. It is not known, however, whether that will be sufficient to cover all the estimated costs detailed above. In the event of a continuing shortfall, the EU is encouraged to offer any supplementary funding needed. However, unless a seri- ous design study was prepared prior to the US inputs, one should be undertaken before any funding commitment is made. The study would need to give careful consideration to trained manpower and sustainability issues in particular. The European Commission is already considering limited support to the KWS lab within its 2014-2020 Regional Indicative Pro- gramme (RIP) for Eastern and Southern Africa, but the earliest these funds could come on line is 2015. Given that CITES is the lead agency in coordinating ivory forensics, an alternative source of relatively quick funding might be the EU\u2019s Strategic Coopera- tion Agreement with UNEP, under which funding is available for support to multi-lateral conventions including CITES. The ANPN Laboratory, Gabon UNODC is very active in Gabon, where it is implementing the ICCWC Wildlife and Forest Crime Analytical Toolkit. It is also working with the Agence Nationale des Parcs Nationaux (ANPN) to develop a functional lab that can do DNA, fingerprints and so on, linked to an intelligence database. In this connection, UNODC is going to post two full-time staff to ANPN in the latter half of 2014. The ANPN anticipates the need for donor support in order to make this facility a reality. Provided it can be developed as a regional facility, working to all the relevant international standards rather than serving Gabon alone, EU support is strongly recommended. It should be noted that the measures recommended here will benefit not only rhinos and elephants, but also certain other spe- cies threatened by illegal trade, meaning that support to these three regional labs has the potential to help solve several very high priority issues at once, and as such would be an extremely cost-effective use of conservation funds.

        "| 479 Wildlife illegal trade #5 3.9.4 Action to stop the demand 3.9.4.1 Support selected demand-reduction efforts Support TRAFFIC and other selected NGOs\u2019 targeted research and awareness-raising activities to reduce demand espe- cially for rhino horn and ivory. TRAFFIC\u2019s work is seen as particularly worthy of support in that it is directly linked to the work of the African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG), the African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) and CITES. As a member of ICCWC, support for the demand-reduction components of UNODC\u2019s Global Programme for Combating Wild- life and Forest Crime would also fund related CITES efforts because they too will address the demand side of WLFC through awareness raising at global and national levels. The UNODC programme will build on its existing expertise in run- ning effective global awareness campaigns, such as the Blue Heart Campaign against Human Trafficking and its successful video campaign against transnational organised crime. Dedicated media outreach, both on traditional and new forms such as social media, will be deployed. To maximise impact, UNODC will learn lessons from other agencies, for instance the anti-trafficking campaign launched by UNWTO (United Nations World Tourism Organisation), UNODC and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) in March 2014 entitled Your Actions Count \u2013 Be a Responsible Traveller. Its demand-reduction aspects thus add further weight to the principal recommendation already made in Section 3.9.3.1 above to provide overall support to UNODC\u2019s Global Programme. 3.9.4.2 Deploy wildlife conservation envoys It is generally agreed that the scale and nature of the illegal wildlife trade calls for an effort to sensitise both supply and consumer governments at the highest possible level, in order to secure the greatest possible chance of influencing them to make a determined and effective response. Given the limited success of events like the African Elephant Summit in actually interacting with Heads of State, there is merit in the idea of the European Commission dis- patching official envoys to carry this message to them. Many other international organisations use instantly recognisable film, music and sports stars to promote their mission. The UN for example regularly enlists such persons to act as ambassadors for specific issues, and a serious proposal to appoint a UN Special Representative on Wildlife Trafficking is under consideration (see Section 3.8.2.4). There is no reason why the EU could not follow suit, and there are many celebrities of European nationalities who would be suitable. In terms of access to Heads of State (and influential First Ladies) however, envoys would need appropriate diplomatic credentials. This would not be an issue if the envoy was royalty for example, and it is notable here that several members of the British royal family are already very concerned and closely involved with wildlife conservation generally, and trade issues in particular. Many believe that a ban on the domestic ivory trade in China is the only way the global illicit trade can be closed down. Although this view does not take into account the existence of other domestic markets with significant amounts of illegal ivory \u2013 Thailand in particular \u2013 it is certainly the case that such a ban \u2013 or even a significant curtailment of the number of authorised outlets \u2013 would be likely to have an impact on poaching and the illegal trade, provided it is enforced. At present, it is a lack of enforcement of the current domestic market rules \u2013 rather than inherent weak- nesses in the rules themselves \u2013 that are causing the problem. In any event, changes in China\u2019s domestic ivory market rules and enforcement improvements are most likely to be achieved as a result of concerted advocacy at the level of the State Council, an apex body that could only be influenced by intense diplomatic pressure applied by envoys enjoying maximum respect and honour. Irrespective of their identity, an official EU wildlife conservation envoy could not only lobby Heads of State for action against the illicit wildlife trade, but could at the same time publicise and promote the major new funding initiative(s) that it is hoped the European Commission will eventually adopt as a result of the present study.

Of the 2 355 bird species in Africa, 245 are classified as globally threat- ened. Of these, 183 (75 %) are threatened by habitat clearance for agriculture. Other key threats include logging (affecting 49 % of threatened species), invasive species (47 %), and climate change and severe weather (38 %). What is especially clear is that many of Africa\u2019s rarest species are impacted by multiple, compounding threats. Farmland species show sharper declines than non-farmland species 105 . Europeans should note that almost all their migrant birds rely on healthy wintering grounds in Africa and during their migrations the Palaearctic-African migrant birds also depend on feeding grounds in the Sahel, which are being degraded by agricultural intensification. Almost all species concerned show declines. 4.1.1 Europe\u2019s vanishing migrant birds Over 25 % of Europe\u2019s bird species, at least 2 billion \u2018European\u2019 birds, spend more than 50 % of their year in Africa, south of the Sahara. These include a wide variety of birds: swallows, waders, other waterbirds, berry and insect-eating songbirds, and several raptors. A high proportion of these species are experiencing pre- cipitous population declines. This includes many species in need of special conservation measures, and are listed in Annex 1 of the EU Wild Birds Directive (79/409/EEC), as well as some of Europe\u2019s most widespread and popular migratory species such as the cuckoo, turtle dove and nightingale. Population declines in some species are as much 80 % in 30 years, and Europe\u2019s coun- tryside is much the poorer for their disappearance. This is a pain- ful loss for millions of EU citizens. Of 119 Afro-Palaearctic long-distance migrant species (those breeding in Europe and wintering in Sub-Saharan Africa), 48 (40 %) show marked declines in population. No similar pattern of decline is observed in resident and short-distance migrant species (Figure 2). Declines are associated with habitat loss and degrada- tion, particularly in the arid and humid zones of Sub-Saharan Africa, e.g. Sahel. This includes degradation of grasslands and savannah forests, damming of rivers and draining of wetlands (estimated to be lost at about 1 % per year) 106 , and clearance of tropical forests. These threats are therefore a concern that connects countries and peoples in a very real way on both continents. >4 _ Interregional section on birds Figure 2.

There is a large and poorly regulated international trade in grey parrots throughout Central Africa and the trade is clearly unsustainable. \u2303 Shoebill stork in the Mabamba swamps of Mabamba, Lake Victoria, Uganda. The EU financial mechanism LIFE+ is helping a great deal in Europe with the protection, site and habitat conservation for spe- cies covered by the EU Wild Birds Directive, but the EU is currently doing very little for the same species once they have left European territory (for up to eight months in a year). Such assistance could be extended by support to the BirdLife Inter- national project that is coordinating the protection of Afro-Palearctic migrants through its network of African partner organisations. Key activities to be undertaken under this programme include: \u2022 improved monitoring and tracking of migrant birds; \u2022 identification of mortality factors and causes; \u2022 identification and protection of key wintering and stopover sites; \u2022 ensuring that reforestation efforts in the Sahel under the Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative and forest zones are designed to be bird-friendly/bio-friendly; \u2022 strengthen protection of key wetland sites used by migrant waterbirds under the Ramsar Convention and Convention on Migratory Species\u2019 initiatives. 4.1.2 Declining vultures Vultures are singularly threatened. Over the past 20 years, six of the seven vultures that occur in Africa in significant numbers have become globally threatened; the threats that have led to these declines must be tackled. These threats include: poisoning, espe- cially in Southern and Eastern Africa, which is typically linked to large mammal poaching or human\u2013animal conflict 107 ; persecution for body parts used in traditional medicine, particularly in West Africa; large-scale habitat modification and declines in ungulate populations may play a role in some areas; and the use of veteri- nary diclofenac, which has caused catastrophic vulture declines in Asia (and to which there are viable, cost-effective alternatives). Actions to counteract these threats, perhaps as pilots to be followed swiftly by wider adoption, are needed over large areas of Africa. 4.1.3 Birds in wildlife traffic Illegal trade in birds, principally African grey parrot, shoebill, raptors, including vultures, cranes (e.g. Grey-crowned crane), should also be more clearly recognised in the EU strategic approach (see Sec- tion 3 of this chapter), reflecting the UN Environment Assembly decision 1/3 108 . In addition, many other species \u2013 particularly small colourful ones \u2013 are also threatened by illegal trade at varying scales, e.g. small seed-eating birds, lovebirds and turacos. In addition, the strategy should flag the need to identify whether legal but unregulated hunting of birds as bushmeat (see the Summary document \u2013 Synthesis, Section 4.7) is having a signif- icant impact on their populations. Where such hunting was pre- viously for subsistence and is now for trade, resulting in significant impacts on the population, more sustainable livelihood options should be explored (such as eco-tourism as a form of payment for ecosystem services (see the Summary document \u2013 Synthesis, Sections 4.3 and 5.4.4).

        "| 485 Interregional section on birds #5 \u2303 White-backed vultures feeding on the carcass of a zebra, Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. Of 11 vulture species found in Africa, seven (including five of the six species endemic to Africa) are listed as globally threatened as a result of significant declines over the past 20 years. 4.2 Current conservation efforts 4.2.1 Identification of EBAs and IBAs By mapping the range overlaps of restricted-range endemic birds, BirdLife International identified 26 Endemic Bird Areas (EBAs) in Sub-Saharan Africa. These sites in total provide a home for the majority of all bird species in Africa and correlate well with bio- diversity priority areas for other taxa. There are, however, impor- tant threatened species that are missed by this prioritisation process, so the EBA approach was followed up by the identifica- tion of several hundred Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) comprising specific habitat sites that contain one or more of all bird species designated as of global concern 109 . Most IBAs fall within existing national parks and game reserves and will be conserved by the Key Landscape for Conservation (KLC) approach advocated in this study; but the analysis reveals where there are gaps in protected area coverage for birds and guides an ongoing programme of BirdLife International and its network of African partner organisations to seek additional protection to give more complete coverage. The bird distribution data thus assembled has also fed into the process of identifying biodiversity \u2018hotspots\u2019 and also into the analyses of Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE). BirdLife International\u2019s IBAs are sites of particular significance for the conservation of the world\u2019s birds and because of the way much biodiversity is distributed, these sites also collectively hold many priority species of other animals and plants. Over the past 21 years, 1 238 IBAs have been identified, documented and mapped in Africa by the BirdLife Africa Partnership, using a set of standardised, globally applicable and scientifically defensible criteria (figure 4). IBAs represent by far the most comprehensive science-based effort to identify Africa\u2019s key sites for biodiversity conservation and span the continent\u2019s biomes and cultures. The IBA programme provides the growing BirdLife Partnership in Africa in 24 countries with a focus on conservation action, planning and advocacy. In Africa, BirdLife works for the conservation of IBAs through collaborations with government and financial institutions, civil society organisations, the private sector, research institutions, local groups and individuals. The programme provides a particular focus for the design and implementation of protected area networks, for safeguarding priority sites alongside investment by financial institutions and the private sector, and for monitoring the effectiveness of regional efforts to conserve biodiversity.

Over 25 % of Europe\u2019s bird species, at least two billion \u2018European\u2019 birds spend more than 50 % of their time in Africa, south of the Sahara. But many have an uncertain future, with some having already seen population declines of up to 80 % over the last thirty years. 4.2.2 EU concern for African birds EU Member States have long recognised that migratory birds do not recognise political boundaries and that there is a need for coordinated Community action. This led to the adoption of the EU Birds Directive, which gives particular attention to conservation measures for migratory birds, the implementation of which is now financed through LIFE+. Whilst LIFE+ has resourced the recovery of some of Europe\u2019s most threatened species, financing is almost entirely focused on actions in the EU. Once Europe\u2019s migratory birds leave European territory there is only very limited action that the EU is currently taking for their conservation in Africa. A majority of EU Member States, as well as the EU itself, are parties to a number of international conservation agreements that are of great importance for migratory birds in Africa. These include the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and its sister agreements: African-Eurasian Water- birds Agreement (AEWA), African-Eurasian Migratory Landbirds Action Plan (AEMLAP) and Raptors Memorandum of Understanding (Raptor MoU). AEMLAP was adopted at CMS\u2019 COP11 in November 2014 and provides a critical new tool in tackling the severe declines in many migratory Afro-Palearctic landbirds. The National Bio- diversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) signatory states should provide a mechanism to incorporate the objectives of these three avian instruments. Whilst Member States and the EU provide strong political support for these agreements, only very limited resources are committed for their effective implementation in Africa. Europe is blessed by many leading international non- governmental organisations (NGOs), which are working for the conservation of migratory birds in Africa. These include the BirdLife International Partnership, which brings together over 20 leading national organisations in the EU and Africa, Wetlands International and IUCN, as well as leading research institutions and many univer- sities. These organisations have made good progress in the iden- tification of key site and key habitats, including for example through BirdLife\u2019s IBA programme, and the identification of the critical site network for waterbirds under AEWA. European insti- tutions are in an excellent position to capitalise on the additional resources that are needed to reverse the declines in Europe\u2019s migratory birds. The EU and EU Member States are also a major donor to Sub-Saharan Africa and alongside development gains, there are likely to be opportunities to also secure benefits for migratory birds, such as in efforts to combat desertification. There is also the need to ensure that EU financial assistance to Africa is not to the significant detriment of Europe\u2019s migratory birds. ",

It is recommended that EU actions, inter alia , include the following aspects: 1. Increases support for the Ramsar and Migratory Species Con- ventions, and especially for the implementation of CMS pro- grammes for waterbirds (AEWA), raptors (birds of prey) (Raptor MoU) and landbirds, so that they are enabled to take more con- certed action for migratory bird conservation in Africa. 2. Gives particular impetus to the development and implemen- tation of the CMS Landbird Action Plan, since this is of particular relevance to those migratory species that are experiencing the steepest population declines. 3. Puts in place an equivalent financing mechanism to LIFE+ to resource urgent conservation actions for migratory species in Africa, and establishes framework agreements of cooperation and support to Europe\u2019s leading NGOs and research institutions working for migratory bird conservation. 4. Undertakes an audit of EU development assistance to Africa to identify where positive synergies might exist to advance devel- opment and conserve Europe\u2019s migratory birds, particular in rela- tion to efforts to combat desertification and woodland/forest degradation in the Sahel and Guinea Savannah zones. 5. Ensures safeguards are in place, and environmental audits are undertaken for major EU development assistance in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, to guard against EU funding having a major negative impact on Europe\u2019s migratory birds. 4.3.2 Key sites and habitats Specifically, the types of actions that might be supported in relation to key sites and for key habitats for migratory birds include: Drylands \u2022 sustainable small-scale agriculture and woodland manage- ment, zonation of grazing and alternative income generation, including habitat restoration, improving both human livelihoods and the quality of habitat for migratory landbird species; \u2022 reducing dependence on wood fuel, through policies and by sup- porting initiatives that promote, and make available, alternative renewable sources of energy for heating, lighting and cooking; \u2022 encouraging the use of indigenous trees or other plants that are of high value to migratory landbird species in appropriate afforestation or re-afforestation initiatives. \u2303 The Cape vulture is listed as Endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Interest in birds can facilitate the emergence of domestic conser- vation initiatives across Africa. For instance, BirdLife\u2019s LCG approach under the Local Empowerment Programme is seeking to conserve IBAs by empowering people and improving local livelihoods. Over 400 LCGs have been established in diverse communities in and around IBAs across Africa, fostering local participation in conser- vation, with benefits for birds, other biodiversity and the people who depend on the sites. Increased EU support would go a long way towards tackling one of the main drivers identified for declin- ing wildlife, namely a lack of awareness (see the Summary docu- ment \u2013 Synthesis, Section 2.4.4). Whilst the IBA programme has contributed significantly to the conservation of sites across the region, there remain considerable gaps in its local-to-regional-scale effectiveness. Only 749 (60 %) out of 1 230 IBAs in Africa have some form of legal protection. The rest are unprotected. BirdLife has been working with the CBD Secretariat to encourage national governments to consider IBAs as they seek to fulfil their obligations under the CBD\u2019s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, particularly Aichi Target 11 that calls for the expansion of the global protected area network to at least 17 % of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 % of coastal and marine areas. The importance of the regular monitoring of IBAs has been high- lighted by recent field observations. Analysis of monitoring data has revealed that many IBAs are in a poor state, with some seriously affected by damaging developments. As part of a global initiative called \u2018IBAs in Danger\u2019, the threat information from IBAs provided in early 2013 by the BirdLife Africa Partnership identified an initial list of 75 IBAs at extreme risk of losing their biodiversity value if the threats they face are not quickly addressed (Figure 5). \u2303 Martial eagle, Maasai Mara Game Reserve, Kenya. This species has been uplisted to Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List because it is suspected to have undergone rapid declines during the past three generations (56 years) owing to deliberate and incidental poisoning, habitat loss, reduction in available prey, pollution and collisions with power lines.
