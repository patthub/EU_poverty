This research is carried out under the umbrella of the Health Theme that is part of the specific programme \u2018Cooperation\u2019 ( 2 ) under the third Activity entitled \u2018Optimising the delivery of health care to European citizens\u2019 . This Activity aims at developing new research methods and generating the necessary scientific basis to underpin informed policy decisions on health systems, and more effective and efficient evidence-based strategies of health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis and therapy. The strategy of this part of the Health Theme is to put the citizen first where research on healthcare is concerned, aiming at bringing the results of health research to the benefit of European citizens in particular through benchmarking, comparisons and analysis of models, systems and data. Moreover, this Activity is compatible with the EU Health Strategy \u2018 Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013 \u2019 ( 3 ) and will contribute towards strengthening health policy-relevant research at the EU level. \u2018 Optimising the delivery of health care to European citizens \u2019 has three sub-areas: 1) clinical research into practice, 2) health systems research and 3) health promotion and disease prevention. International public health and health systems research is incorporated as a fourth area and addresses: health policy research, health systems and health service research, maternal and child health, reproductive health in the context of the Millennium Development Goals. Furthermore, research projects serving particular EU policy goals identified by European Commission services, such as the Directorate-General for Employ- ment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, EUROSTAT or the Directorate- General for Health and Consumers, are also included in this booklet. 1 Decision (1982/2006/EC) of the EP and the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013); OJ L412/1, 30.12.2006. 2 Council Decision (2006/971/EC) of 19 December 2006 concerning the Specific Programme \u201cCooperation\u201d implementing the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013); OJ L54/30, 22.2.2007. 3 European Commission \u201cTogether for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013\u201d, COM 630 (2007), 23.10.2007.

It is not known what practices have been adopted by European hospitals to prevent such events and whether they are effective. The aim of PROHIBIT is to understand existing guidelines and practices to prevent healthcare-associated infections in European hospitals, identify factors that enable and reduce compliance with best practices, and test the effectiveness of interventions of known efficacy. The information will be synthesised to develop recommendations for the EU, policymakers, managers and medical professionals. http://www.prohibit.unige.ch $#(cid:26)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:14)(cid:8) Quality and safety in European Union hospitals: A research-based guide for implementing best practice and a framework for assessing performance __________________________ This translational study will produce an evidence- based guide for hospitals for implementing quality and safety improvement and a framework for payers to assess the quality and safety of hospitals across the EU. The study will take place in five European countries: the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, and the UK.

We focus on the implementation of evidence-based health information (e.g. guidelines to enhance communication in cross-cultural consultations) and interventions (e.g. training initiatives on interculturalism and the use of paid interpreters) designed to address language and cultural barriers in primary care settings. We explore how these are translated (or not) into routine practice in primary care settings. We will investigate and support implementation processes for these using a unique combination of contemporary social theory, the Normalisation Process Theory and a participatory research methodology.

GH efficacy is undisputed in severe GH deficiency but is more limited in other situations. The possibility has been raised that GH use in childhood might increase the risk of cancer later in life but little data is available. SAGhE will evaluate the impact of GH treatment on height, psychosocial status as well as long-term mortality and cancer incidence in a large unbiased metacohort of patients. The data will then be integrated and disseminated to several levels of users.

Deliverables of the project are: scientific papers on the validity and effectiveness of specific tailoring methods and models, practical guidelines on tailoring for stakeholders, and specific evidence on improving medical care for the targeted chronic conditions. # (cid:2)(cid:20)(cid:14)(cid:27)(cid:8) Use of a Multidrug Pill In Reducing Cardiovascular Events _______________ People with established cardiovascular disease need secondary prevention that addresses multiple risk factors. Complexity and cost confer particularly difficult barriers to uptake of treatment; recovery from a stroke or heart attack typically necessitates multiple drugs for cholesterol, blood pressure and platelet function. A low-cost, fixed-dose, once-daily combination polypill, the Red Heart Pill, has been formulated by Dr Reddy\u2019s Laboratories. UMPIRE will evaluate whether provision of this polypill compared with usual medications improves adherence and clinical outcomes among high-risk patients in Europe and India.

The knowledge generated should empower the policy and decision maker to better manage and reform healthcare systems in view of common challenges and within the common framework of the European Union. It has been recognised by the Council in its Conclusions ( 2 ) that the health systems of the EU are a central part of Europe\u2019s high levels of social protection and contribute to social cohesion and social justice as well as to sustainable development. The health systems of the EU reflect the overarching values of universality, access to good healthcare, equity and solidarity, aiming to make provision that is patient-centred and responsive to individual need. The objective is to provide, in the light of new knowledge, scientifically validated tools to allow countries to learn from the experience of other health systems and their sustainability, taking into account the importance of national contexts and population characteristics (ageing, mobility, migration, education, socioeconomic status and the changing world of work etc.). The focus is on organisational, financial and regulatory aspects of health systems (assessing the cost, efficiency and benefits of different interventions including patient safety), their implementation and their outcomes in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and equity (including disadvantaged groups). Special attention is to be paid to investment issues and human resources, including homecare strategies.

The focus is intended to be on the wider determinants of health on both the individual and community levels. Such wider determinants of health include diet, physical activity, stress, tobacco, alcohol or other substance use, cultural context and socioeconomic, environmental and behavioural factors and how, on the basis of new knowledge, they interact at both these different levels. In particular, mental health is addressed in a life-course perspective. The objective is to advance the state-of-the-art in the field of health promotion and primary prevention research and to enhance cooperation between researchers in Europe and other geographic regions to promote integration and excellence of European research in the area. This research should provide the evidence base to empower both the individual to change and sustain healthy behaviour as well as the policy and decision makers at European, national and local levels to develop and implement effective public health interventions and incorporate health goals in the definition and implementation of all policies.

As there isn\u2019t sufficient knowledge of what actions are effective to reduce the socioeconomic gradient in health inequalities, GRADIENT addresses this knowledge gap by developing a consensus-based European evaluation framework, researching differen- tial impacts of health policies across the gradient; studying the influence of social capital as a protective factor and identifying which targeted and universal policy approaches are effective in tackling the gradi- ent in different policy contexts. The focus is on fami- lies and children, as this is where the greatest impact on reducing the health gradient can be achieved. http://www.health-gradient.eu Coordinator Ms Juliet Craig The University of Sheffield Sheffield, United Kingdom E-mail j.craig@shef.ac.uk EC contribution (cid:2) 1 751 791 Starting date 01/09/2009 Duration 24 months Coordinator Ms Aagje Ieven Eurohealthnet E-mail a.ieven@eurohealthnet. eu EC contribution (cid:2) 1 881 257 Starting date 01/04/2009 Duration 36 months ",

Public health approaches to prevent overweight are important as they can be employed independently from active participation of the target group. However, they may be powerless in an obesogenic environment that is characterised by huge amounts of food temptations. The TEMPEST project introduces the novel concept of self-regulatory competence for dealing with these temptations as the key factor in prevention of overweight. The main hypothesis of the project states that increasing self-regulatory competence allows youth to take better advantage of public health efforts. http://www.tempestproject.eu Coordinator Prof. Denise De Ridder Universiteit Utrecht - Department of Clinical and Health Psychology Utrecht, the Netherlands E-mail D.T.D.deridder@uu.nl EC contribution (cid:2) 2 404 118 Starting date 01/02/2009 Duration 48 months ",

To date, including the very successful special Call on Africa, some 35 research projects are currently supported or under negotiation in this area through \u2018 specific international cooperation actions \u2019 (SICAs) corresponding to approximately EUR 97 million. This area is of particular relevance in the light of the European Commission Communication ( 1 ) to enhance the EU\u2019s role in global health that was adopted in March 2010. The objective is to make Europe\u2019s contribution more effective so as to better accompany developing countries in getting back on track towards achieving health-related MDGs. Four approaches to improving global health were presented including improving coordination of EU research on global health and boosting access to new knowledge and treatments in developing countries. The Council, in its May 2010 Conclusions ( 2 ) on the EU role in global health, called on the EU and Member States to promote effective and fair financing of research that benefits the health of all. The objective of such actions in this domain is to support research in order to provide a scientific base for International Cooperation Partner Countries to improve their health service delivery, including aspects of accessibility, effectiveness, efficiency and quality of care and user friendliness. The mandate also covers public health concepts and interventions beyond health services through cross-sectorial and multidisciplinary research approaches. These actions on particular priorities, such as health systems, health policy, maternal and child care, reproductive health and neglected communicable diseases, aim to reinforce the research and cooperative capacities of candidate, neighbourhood, developing and emerging countries. Particular attention is paid to facilitating access to these actions for these countries, in particular developing countries.

We propose a surgical training intervention targeted at Clinical Officers (COs), who are trained non-medical professionals that form the backbone of Africa\u2019s district hospital services. It has never been rigorously evaluated, nor been subject to economic and popula- tion impact assessments. Two different two-year training models are proposed: district hospital in- service training in Malawi and centralised training in Zambia. Before-and-after and controlled trial evalu- ations are planned. Cost-effectiveness analyses and population impact assessments will be conducted.

However, the current evidence base regarding the impact of this policy is not well developed, in part because of evaluation designs that are not able to capture all the necessary information for policymakers to make informed decisions. This proposal aims to reduce this gap by developing research methodologies and tools that will lead to enhanced research on policy implementation, stronger evidence and improved dissemination.

As a result, many fail to seek care, get inadequate care or end up in financial difficulty. This project aims to identify both the causes and consequences of inequitable access to healthcare and lack of financial protection from health risks. A first strand of the project examines financial and other constraints on the utilisation of healthcare in Asia and how households cope with the economic consequences of illness. A second strand evaluates the distributional impact of health financing programmes in six countries (Cambodia, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam). http://www.hefpa.nl Coordinator THE UNIVERSITY COURT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN EC contribution approximately EUR 2.9 million Duration 36 months Under negotiation Coordinator Prof. Eddy Van Doorslaer Erasmus University Rotterdam Institute of Health Policy and Management Rotterdam, the Netherlands E-mail vandoorslaer@ese. eur.nl EC contribution (cid:2) 2 885 767 Starting date 01/06/2009 Duration 48 months ",

Previous research suggests that the stewardship and regulation capacity of governments is pivotal in this context. As maternal health is a key area for policy and healthcare delivery, the project uses maternal health as a case study for stewardship and regulation. The outputs will include policy guides for national and international health policymakers and recommendations for national standards of stewardship and regulation.

In China, the current surveillance system is based on confirmed case reports and only covers notifiable diseases. However, in rural areas it is not practical for doctors to confirm disease and people are more likely to get \u2018old\u2019 and emerge with infectious diseases. Syndromic surveillance which collects non-specific syndromes before diagnosis has great advantages in promoting the early detection of epidemics and reducing the necessities of disease confirmation. ISSC is designed to improve the early detection of epidemics in rural China by integrating syndromic surveillance with the current surveillance system. http://www.issc-eu.com (cid:26)(cid:29)(cid:20)(cid:25)!

This lack of motivation leads to an insufficient translation of knowledge into optimal utilisation of resources. The \u2018know-do\u2019 gap represents a challenge that must be addressed to strengthen health services performance towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. This is in particular true for maternity care. A computer-assisted clinical decision support system (CDSS) will be developed, imple- mented and tested aiming at 1) quality improvement of maternal and newborn care, and 2) assessment of provider\u2019s performance. Based on this tool a commonly agreed incentive scheme to increase motivation will be shaped and tested in three SSA coun- tries, namely Burkina Faso, Ghana and Tanzania. The incentive scheme might contain both non-monetary and monetary incentives and will be designed according to the human resource policy in the three countries. http://www.qualmat.net/ Coordinator Prof. Rainer Sauerborn Universitaetsklinikum Heidelberg Heidelberg, Germany E-mail rainer.sauerborn@med. uni-heidelberg.de EC contribution (cid:2) 2 915 228 Starting date 01/05/2009 Duration 60 months ",

SURE will develop and evaluate five strategies designed to strengthen access to and use of reliable and timely research syntheses in policymaking: user-friendly formats for research syntheses, clearing houses for policy-relevant research, mechanisms for responding rapidly to policymakers\u2019 needs for research evidence, methods for organising and managing deliberative forums involving policymakers, researchers and others, and methods for involving civil society and the public in policy development. SURE will develop capacity for evidence-informed healthcare policy and undertake a comparative evaluation of initiatives. http://www.evipnet.org/local/SURE%20 Website/home%20page.htm (cid:29)%(cid:14)(cid:27)(cid:17)(cid:8) Building research capacity of blood transfusion services in Africa _________ The purpose of this project is to build sustainable capacity for research in blood transfusion services in Africa. This project will coordinate EU and African collaborations to transfer research skills to the African partners. EU partners will benefit by enhancing their own blood transfusion research skills. To do this we will support three research training schemes (PhD, under/post graduates, in-service) in each of three African partner transfusion services.
