To identify a representative sample of Albanian farming systems, a three-step sample design was used. A group of 11 variables dealing with the socio-economic characteristics of farms was selected to build up the farming system typology. Two typologies are used: one for the whole sample (three regions) and a second one for each region. The differences between the two typologies are considered to be a proxy indicator of different characteristics of farming systems in each region. The farm types identified are (1) poly-culture, mainly for the market; (2) leisure farms; (3) arable crops; (4) fruit trees; (5) self-sufficient; and (6) livestock. The farm typology is slightly different for the regions of Berat and Lezh\u00eb. The farm types\u2019 strategies are constructed according to the land, infrastructure facilities and the investment availability of farms. Non-agricultural incomes (remittances, income from the construction, trade, pensions, etc.) appear to provide an important economic support for the farm household. Farming structures in rural areas are characterised by the use of more labour and lower inputs. The farm types that tend to specialise in one activity are not always those that make the best use of labour and land. Farming does not provide enough income to repay the work put in at the official minimum wage level. Non-agricultural work is better paid. Albanian farms provide at least a minimal income that is enough to keep the household members above the threshold of extreme poverty. The farm types that base their incomes on agricultural activities are poorer than those that base their income on non-agricultural activities. Income structures and the low incomes generated by work in agriculture suggests that rural migration towards urban areas and abroad is a phenomenon that will persist into the future. ",

        "P r e f a c e 9 Over the past 20 years, Albanian agriculture has undergone fundamental changes in terms of its structure, the organisation of the production units and the distribution of products and trading. As a consequence, analysis of the effects that these changes impose on the efficiency of the sector continues to be the subject of scientific research. Analysis of agricultural production systems is part of agricultural economy research, in which researchers must analyse information from one or more farms in order to draw comprehensive conclusions and form a clear picture of the agricultural structure of a country and its effects on the domestic economy. This analysis, whose conclusions are based on information pertaining not only to entities with different organisational structures but with very similar objectives, is probably the only way to understand the characteristics of production at the farm level, which is the most important unit in agricultural production in Albania today. The sub-sectors of the food chain beyond the farm, such as the agricultural inputs sector, collection systems and agro-processing, cannot be understood without a good knowledge of agricultural production characteristics and farm structure. At the same time, a significant proportion of the country\u2019s population lives in rural areas. Although the analysis of living conditions, welfare, educational opportunities and employment is very often conducted geographically, it is farms and farming families that constitute the basic socio- economic unit upon which is based any social initiative in rural areas. All these factors combine to make the farm the basic unit of analysis: the farm is most important subject addressed by our policies, and the one that we expect to benefit from the policies. Therefore, for us, it is very important to understand the characteristics of farms operating today in Albania and to gain an appreciation of their production capabilities, taking into account the limited natural resources at their disposal, the state of the agricultural infrastructure and the techniques and technologies in use. Furthermore, it is important for us to understand which markets are addressed by farms, and above all farmers, to help us support progressive farmers: those farmers who see their future in agriculture as a choice and not as an obligation and those who understand that the problems they face cannot be solved alone and that having the courage to join other farmers in collective action can promote the adoption of new, more productive, technologies in order to cultivate larger areas. This is the way towards a more prosperous future. The information need for such an analysis, which is so difficult to collect and process, enables a more detailed examination of production systems at the farm level. This is exactly the objective of the project \u2018Impact of policy instruments in Albanian agricultural systems\u2019. This project was initiated by the European Commission Joint Research Centre Institute for the Study of Technological Perspectives in collaboration with the Faculty of Economy and Agribusiness at the Agricultural University of Tiran\u00eb. Through the analysis of data collected in three regions representative of agricultural systems in the country, obtained from more than 1 000 questionnaires on the characteristics of farm production methods, costs and technologies in use, agriculture experts will be able to provide the information needed by policy makers to design and implement policies that will provide more effective support schemes for agriculture. The Albanian government is adopting a new strategy in terms of developing policies to support agriculture. It will no longer provide supporting instruments, with their associated positive and negative outcomes; instead, it is now time to move forward and to directly support agricultural products and to give farmers access to wholesale and retail markets, the food industry and, ultimately, the consumer. By doing so, farmers will be rewarded for their physical and financial investments, giving them an inventive to produce more and to bring their products to markets and consumers. It is the duty of public institutions to encourage those who already do this to do it even better and those who do not to begin to reflect on how they might move out of subsistence conditions. Of course, this product support scheme will not be complete unless it is accompanied by support for productive investments that aim to provide incentives not only to produce, but also to orient these products towards markets.

        "E x e c u t i v e s u m m a r y 11 Agriculture is one of the most important economic sectors in Albania. It contributes 13 % of the national gross domestic product (GDP) (INSTAT, 2011) and employs nearly half of the national workforce (2011). According to the European Commission, around 500 000 people work in agriculture, of whom 55 % work full time and 45 % part time (EC 2010). During the economic transition, Albania\u2019s agriculture sector changed significantly. This process continues in parallel with global trends, interspersed with periods of relative consolidation. According to MACFP (2011), agricultural land covers only 24 % (or nearly 700 000 ha) of the total land surface: 54 % of the area is covered by forests, meadows, pastures, etc., and the rest (22 %) is used for other purposes (e.g. urban areas). The figure for agricultural area per inhabitant in Albania is low (only 0.370 ha/inhabitant), such that the country ranks 120 out of 220 worldwide (FAO 2014). Most agricultural land is owned by rural households (80 % of total agricultural area or 562 000 ha) and the rest (134 000 ha) is owned by the state ( 1 ) (MAFCP 2011). The geography of Albania is more suitable for livestock production than for crop production. In 2012, the livestock sector accounted for 54 % of the total production value and crop production for 46 % (INSTAT 2012). Crop production is more important in the so-called Western plain (the regions of Durr\u00ebs, Tiran\u00eb and Fier) and the region of Kor\u00e7\u00eb, characterised by significant mountainous areas but also the second most important agricultural plain in the country. The other regions of the country are characterised by a higher proportion of livestock production. According to the figures released by Albanian Institute of Statistics, the number of farms has decreased from more than 350 000 to 325 000 (EC 2013) ( 2 ). Farms in Albania are characterised by limited arable land and a high level of fragmentation. In the last 10 years, the average farm size has increased by 15 % (from 1.04 ha in 2002 to 1.20 ha in 2012) (INSTAT 2012) but is still remain extremely small. The average plot size in 2012 was only 0.26 ha. On average, 1 The areas owned by the state (134 000 ha) are generally land of low fertility that were rejected by households during the de-collectivisation process. 2 The detailed set of indicators will provide further information about the type(s) of farms that are more involved in this reduction and whether or not farmers of other types of farm have taken over the agricultural activity. farms have more than four plots (4.5 plots (MAFCP 2011)), and sometimes these are several kilometres from each other. Direct support for production relies mainly on subsidies aiming to increase production and food-processing capacities. The strategic sectors are permanent crops (olives, nuts and other permanent crops), technology and infrastructure (greenhouses, irrigation on a small scale, new technologies, etc.) and food-processing sector standards and increased capacity. This report is based on information collected from a face-to- face survey of more than 1 000 farmers from three regions of Albania (namely Berat, Elbasan and Lezh\u00eb). The extensive questionnaire used in the survey elicited information on: \u2022 the household; \u2022 the agricultural work offered (family and hired labour distributed by month); \u2022 the farm (arable land, irrigation, plot characteristics, agricultural mechanics); \u2022 agricultural activities (crop by plot and livestock production, crop rotations for at least 3 years); \u2022 destination of agricultural products and agricultural incomes (self-consumption, sales, processing, stock, etc.); \u2022 technical data about each crop activity and each livestock production (list of detailed costs for each production); \u2022 agricultural support schemes; \u2022 credit; \u2022 distribution of expenses. To identify a representative sample of Albanian farming systems, a three-step sample design was used. Firstly, Albanian regions were stratified into three non-overlapping strata, each the size of four regions. Each stratum included regions that have similar agricultural characteristics according to several indicators. The selected indicators were used to rank the Albanian regions according to their share. From each stratum a region was selected by applying Executive summary ",
        "12 C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a indicators of farming systems diversification. To select the farmers in each region, a multi-stage sampling method was used, having as the main variable \u2018the area\u2019 (area sampling frame methodology). This methodology is widely used in agricultural surveys in Albania. A group of 11 variables dealing with the socio-economic characteristics of farms was selected to build up the farming system typology. Two typologies are used: one for the whole sample (three regions) and a second one for each region. The differences between the two typologies are considered to be a proxy indicator of different characteristics of farming systems in each region. The farm types identified are (1) poly- culture, mainly for the market; (2) leisure farms; (3) arable crops; (4) fruit trees; (5) self-sufficient; and (6) livestock. The farm typology is slightly different for the regions of Berat and Lezh\u00eb. The farm types\u2019 strategies are constructed according to the land, infrastructure facilities and the investment availability of farms. Non-agricultural incomes (remittances, income from the construction, trade, pensions, etc.) appear to provide an important economic support for the farm household. Farming structures in rural areas are characterised by the use of more labour and lower inputs. The farm types that tend to specialise in one activity are not always those that make the best use of labour and land. Farming does not provide enough income to repay the work put in at the official minimum wage level. Non-agricultural work is better paid. Albanian farms provide at least a minimal income that is enough to keep the household members above the threshold of extreme poverty. The farm types that base their incomes on agricultural activities are poorer than those that base their income on non-agricultural activities. Income structures and the low incomes generated by work in agriculture suggests that rural migration towards urban areas and abroad is a phenomenon that will persist into the future. ",
        "3 . I n t r o d u c c t i o n 13 Agriculture is one of the most important economic sectors in Albania. It contributes 13 % of the national GDP (INSTAT, 2011), and employs nearly half of the national workforce (2011). According to the European Commission (2010), around 500 000 people work in agriculture, of whom 55 % work full time and 45 % part time (EC 2010). Albania is a net food importer. According to INSTAT (2011), the Albanian import\u2013export ratio of foodstuffs is 8:1. The main export destinations and import origin countries are the EU Member States Italy, Germany, Greece and Austria for exports (71.4 %), and Italy, Greece, France and Poland for imports (50 %) (MBUMK 2012). The majority of Albanian foodstuff exports come from the agro-processing sector, which accounts for more than 55 % of total exports (2011), with 34 % from agriculture and the rest (10 %) from livestock (MBUMK 2012). The main exporting sectors are medicinal and aromatic herbs, tobacco, fresh vegetables, processed fish and animal hides. Food-processing sector imports comprise 61 % total agricultural imports, 26 % agricultural products and 11 % livestock. Despite the increase over the last 10 years in self-sufficiency in some products (eggs, some fresh vegetables, milk, fruit, etc.), Albania remains a net importer of foodstuffs. The Mediterranean climate of the country allows a wide range of farming activities. According to Cela et al. (2010) the majority of the utilised agricultural area (UAA) is planted with fodder crops (49 % of UAA), followed by cereals, accounting for 37 % of UAA; the rest is planted with vegetables, potatoes and other crops. Over the last 10 years, the area of fodder crops has become more and more important to the detriment of cereals (especially wheat), which are decreasing. This is due to the importance of the livestock sector (52 % of total agricultural production in 2010). The average yields of the main agricultural products have increased significantly over the last decade but, nevertheless, they remain below the EU average (Volk, Rednak et al. 2010). During the period 2000\u20132008 the average wheat yield increased 33 % and milk yield increased 2.5-fold. The same trend could be also observed for other agricultural activities (vegetables, apples, stone fruit, olives, cattle meat, etc.) (Cela, Marku et al. 2010). The de-collectivisation process has had a significant impact on Albanian agriculture, and this has led to considerable land fragmentation (3.8 parcels/farm) and an increase in small and very small subsistence and semi-subsistence farms (1.2 ha), which are impeding the development of the sector (Civici 2003; Guri, Civici et al. 2011). The farm structures and the level of fragmentation make it difficult to make use of a large-scale agricultural infrastructure, especially in hilly and mountainous areas. The land insecurity, the delay in compensating former landowners and the lack of appropriate policy instruments discourages farmers from increasing farm sizes (only 10 % in 5 years) (Civici 2003; MBUMK 2012). In addition to land fragmentation, Albanian agriculture suffers from some critical structural problems, such as (1) underdeveloped irrigation and drainage systems; (2) deficient infrastructure; (3) restricted access to markets; (4) an underdeveloped agri-food industry; (5) low levels of technology; (6) the weakness of farmers\u2019 organisations; and (7) limited access to credit (EC 2010). The overall objective of this report is to analyse the key characteristics of farming systems in Albania, their typology and their actual and potential role in the well-being of farming households. The focus should therefore be on the future prospects and challenges for Albanian agriculture by analysing the following specific aspects: (i) farming systems; (ii) food production, consumption and surpluses; (iii) economic drivers and the productivity of the different farm types. The main contribution of the report is the analysis of the farming systems in Albania and their viability in terms of farm net income (FNI) provided for the household family and to highlight the most efficient farming systems in terms of land and labour productivity. The report presents the analysis of farm viability in terms of reproduction threshold presented on farm type level.

Albania has a sub-tropical Mediterranean climate characterised by mild and rainy winters and hot, dry summers (MAFCP 2011). The rain (on average 1 485 mm/ year) falls mainly (70 %) during the cold months (October\u2013 March) (MAFCP 2011). Being a mountainous country (only 24 % of the surface is plain (MAFCP 2011)), the agricultural area has an elevated slope and only 44 % of the total arable area has a slope of 5 % or less (MAFCP 2011). The Box 1 shows the main indicators of the Albanian economy. 4. Characteristics of Albanian agriculture and methodological issues Box 1: Main indicators of the Albanian economy Albania is a middle-income country that has made enormous strides in establishing a credible multi-party democracy and market economy over the last two decades (WB 2013). The Albanian economy has been characterised by a macroeconomic stability and positive economic growth, even during the recent economic crisis. Between 2002 and 2008, poverty in the country fell by half (to about 12.4 %) and extreme poverty now affects less than 2 % of the population (WB 2013).

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 16 According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Albania will experience positive economic growth in 2014 of 2.4 % (IMF 2013). According to Cela et al. (2010), the agricultural area in Albania can be divided into three main types. The plain areas (24 % of the land area (MAFCP 2011)) are located at an altitude of less than 180 m. These areas are characterised by mild winters (average temperature in January 9.8 \u00b0C) and hot summers. The annual rainfall is 800\u20131 000 mm/year, but it is not equally distributed between the winter and summer months (only 10 % of rain falls in summer). Hilly areas are located at an altitude above 180 m but below 800 m (45 % of the land area). The average temperature is lower (by 3\u20134 \u00b0C on average) than in the plain and frosts are frequent in winter. This agricultural area is important for its potential production, especially in the south-eastern part of the country (the plain of Kor\u00e7a). The third type of agricultural area is the mountainous area (26 % of the land area), located above 800 m. In these areas, most of the land is covered by forests and permanent pastures. The arable area is limited. According to Sutton et al. (2013), the Albanian territory can be divided into four agro-ecological zones. Each zone has the same characteristics in terms of terrain, climate, soil type and water availability (Figure 1). The plain areas that are typical of the western part of the country falls into the intermediate agro-ecological zone that links the plain area and the mountainous area. In this area the characteristics of both areas can be found (lowlands and mountainous areas). The third agro-ecological zone covers the mountainous areas of northern and central Albania, and the fourth covers the mountainous areas of southern Albania. According to Shundi (2006), the main soil types in Albania are fertile alluvial soils in the coastal area, flysch and marls in the intermediate area and limestone, mainly in the mountainous areas. Owing to the slope of the hilly and, particularly, the mountainous areas, an important proportion of agricultural land is subject to erosion or is at high risk of erosion: 70 % of the agricultural land is eroded at a rate of 30 t/year, 20 % is eroded at a rate of 5t/year and only 10 % of agricultural land is not affected by this phenomenon (Shundi 2006).

C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f A l b a n i a n a g r i c u l t u r e a n d m e t h o d o l o g i c a l i s s u e s 17 4.1.2 The importance of the agriculture sector Agriculture remains one of the main economic sectors of the Albanian economy (IMF 2013). According to Cela et al. (2010), over the last 16 years, the contribution of agriculture to GDP has been decreasing, from 60.1 % in the 1950 to less than 20 % in the 2000s. In 2013, agriculture contributed only 10 % of GDP (INSTAT, 2014). Agriculture is characterised by growth rates that are more stable but less significant than those experienced by other economic sectors. Over the period 2000\u20132010, the average annual growth rate of the agriculture sector was 4 %, one third that of the construction sector The tertiary sector is the main economic sector in Albania (Figure 2). Services account for more than half of Albanian GDP. Over the last 15 years (1997\u20132011), services and construction have been the main contributors to growth in GDP, although the construction sector has experienced a recession since 2003, with negative economic growth rates since 2008. A significant proportion of the population lives in rural areas (45 % of total population). The rural population is dominated by the younger age groups and massive employment in agriculture (MAFCP 2011).

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 18 4.1.3 Farm structure According to the MACFP (2011), agricultural land covers only 24 % (or nearly 700 000 ha) of the land area; a further 54 % is covered by forests, meadows, pastures, etc., and the rest (22 %) is used for other purposes (e.g. urban areas). The size of the agricultural area per inhabitant in Albania is low (only 0.370 ha/inhabitant), such that the country ranks 120 out of 220 worldwide (FAOSTAT). The majority of agriculture land is owned by rural households (80 % of total agricultural area or 562 000 ha) and the rest (134 000 ha) is owned by the state ( 3 ) (MAFCP 2011). 3 The areas owned by the state (134 000 ha) are generally land of low fertility that were rejected by households during the de-collectivisation process. According to the first figures released by Albanian Institute of Statistics from the most recent agricultural census, carried out in 2012, the number of farms decreased from more than 350 000 to 325 000 over 10 years (2000-2010) (EC 2013) ( 4 ). Farms in Albania are characterised by a small area of arable land and a high level of fragmentation. In the last 10 years, the average farm size has increased by 15 % (from 1.04 ha/farm in 2002 to 1.20 ha/farm in 2012) (INSTAT 2012), but it remains extremely low. The average plot size in 2012 was only 0.26 ha. On average, farms have more than four plots (4.5 plots (MAFCP 2011)), and sometimes these are several kilometres from each other. 4 The detailed set of indicators will provide further information about the type(s) of farm involved in this reduction and whether or not farmers of other types of farm have taken over the agricultural activity.

The four most productive regions (Durr\u00ebs, Fier, Vlor\u00eb and Kor\u00e7\u00eb) account for more than half (55 %) of the agricultural production of the country but only 45 % of the arable area. This group of regions is responsible for more than 60 % of total crop sales. The less productive regions are those of the north-east (Kuk\u00ebs, Dib\u00ebr), the region of Lezh\u00eb in the centre of the country and the region of Gjirokast\u00ebr in the south of the country. These four regions produce only 14 % of the total national sales (crops and livestock) despite cultivating 21 % of the agricultural area. In terms of crop production, these regions account for less than 10 % of national crop sales. Mostly mountainous, these regions are characterised by steep slopes and low fertility of the agricultural land. The geography of Albania is more suitable for livestock production than for crop production. In 2012, the livestock sector accounted for 54 % of the total production value and crop production for 46 % (INSTAT 2012). Crop production is more important in the so-called western plain (the regions of Durr\u00ebs, Tiran\u00eb and Fier) and the region of Kor\u00e7\u00eb, characterised by significant mountainous areas but also the second most important agricultural plain in the country (see Figure 3). The other regions of the country are characterised by a higher proportion of livestock production. The structure of livestock production has stabilised over the last 10 years (Figure 4). Between 2000 and 2012, livestock production was characterised by important contributions to meat and milk production (nearly 90 % of the value of total livestock production). Other products (honey, eggs) have also increased their contribution (from 9 % to 13 %) but remain less important. Half of the arable area is cultivated with forage plants, thus increasing the importance of the livestock sector. The breakdown of the harvest for 2000 and 2012 (Figure 5) shows that in nearly 12 years fodder crops have replaced cereals, especially wheat. Wheat imports have steadily increased over the same period (INSTAT 2012; MBUMK 2012). The direct payment scheme applied to fruit trees, particularly olive trees and nuts, and significant private investments have in 10 years doubled the contribution of fruit trees to the value of agricultural production (from 22 % in 2000 to 40 % in 2012)(Figure 5). It seems that, in future, the contribution of fruit trees will increase when newly planted plantations enter into production.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 20 The transition in Albania is characterised by an improvement in the productivity of the main crops and livestock production, but productivity remains below the European Union average. The change in the yield of wheat over the last 12 years can be used as an example. Albanian wheat yield during this period (2002\u20132012) increased by more than one-third (34 %) but is still 20 % lower than the EU- 27 average (INSTAT 2012; EUROSTAT 2014); the picture is the same for the milk production. According to Cela et al. (2010), Albanian agriculture still faces significant problems in terms of productivity. The breakdown of the crops value is presented in Figure 6. Albania remains a net importer of food products (Figure 7). In 2012, Albania imported more than EUR 623 million of food products and exported more than EUR 92 million. Over the last 10 years, agricultural exports have accounted for, on average, only 11 % to 15 % of food imports. The ratio has improved for 2012 owing to an increase in exports and a stabilisation of imports. Crop and livestock exports over the period 2010\u20132012 increased by 51 % and 67 %, respectively, whereas imports for the same period increased by only 13 % and 4 %, respectively. The main Albanian agricultural exports are medicinal herbs and vegetables, tobacco, tinned fish and animal leather; the main imports are meat and meat products and fruit and vegetables. Albanian exports are niche products that require labour-intensive production methods (Cela, Marku et al. 2010). Albania is a world leader in production of some medicinal herbs (sage, thyme, etc.) (Cela, Marku et al. 2010). The traditional collection of wild sage is being replaced by cultivation of sage, creating new types of farming systems, especially in hilly and mountainous areas. The cultivation of sage has the potential to increase farm incomes in those areas where farms have a small area of low-quality land.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 22 4.1.5 Agricultural policy framework The main policy instruments of the Albanian government intervention to handle some of these problems are provided in the agriculture and food sector strategy 2007\u20132013 (EC 2010). According to (Cela, Marku et al. 2010), the main objectives of the above strategy are (1) the development of sustainable agriculture; (2) the improvement of the livelihood of rural households; (3) an improvement in the economic efficiency of agriculture and the food industry; and (4) the improvement of agricultural markets, etc. Direct support for production relies mainly on subsidies aiming to increase the production and food-processing capacities. The strategic sectors are permanent crops (olives, nuts and other permanent crops), technology and infrastructure (greenhouses, irrigation on a small scale, new technologies, etc.) and food-processing sector standards and increased capacity. The first support measures for agriculture in Albania are relatively new (2007), with direct support for permanent crop plantations and for livestock production (sheep and cattle). In recent years the range of activities supported by these schemes has included production of nuts (chestnuts, walnuts), greenhouse construction and almost all livestock production, as well as the agro-industry sector. As EC (2010) highlights, the \u2018direct payments ( 5 ) in Albania are not compatible with EU rules\u2019. They are not decoupled and they have no environmental requirements and/or other types of \u2018cross-compliance\u2019 standards. In 2014, the Albanian government added new policy instruments aiming to increase farmers\u2019 participation in the fresh fruit and vegetable markets. Farmers can apply for extra direct support of 15 % of the product value for fruit and vegetables if the quantity sold to the wholesale markets, processing units and fresh fruit and vegetable collection centres is greater than 3 tonnes for fruits and 5 tonnes for vegetables, up to a limit of 30 tonnes and 50 tonnes, respectively. 5 Direct payments are applied for milk and olive oil, as well as per head payments for sheep and goat production; recently, payments for chestnut production have been implemented. 4.2 Farm typology in Albania 4.2.1 Introduction This report is based on information collected from a face-to- face survey of more than 1 000 farmers from three regions of Albania (namely Berat, Elbasan and Lezh\u00eb). The extensive questionnaire (see Annex 1) used in the survey elicited information on: \u2022 the household; \u2022 the agricultural work offered (family and hired labour distributed by month); \u2022 the farm (arable land, irrigation, plot characteristics, agricultural mechanics); \u2022 agricultural activities (crop by plot and livestock production, crop rotations for at least 3 years); \u2022 destination of agricultural products and agricultural incomes (self-consumption, sales, processing, stock, etc.); \u2022 technical data sheet for each crop activity and each livestock production (list of detailed costs for each production); \u2022 agricultural support schemes; \u2022 credit; \u2022 distribution of expenses. The information gathered was processed in order to build up a farm system typology to understand the strategies of the farm systems, the impact of the agricultural policy instruments and the potential future evolution of Albanian agriculture. The de-collectivisation process that took place in Albania during the 1990s totally reorganised the farming structure. The farming systems created by this reform are small and fragmented (Civici 2001; Civici 2003; Miluka, Carletto et al. 2007; Guri 2008; Deininger, Savastano et al. 2012; Zhllima and Guri 2013; Sikor and M\u00fcller 2009). The agricultural land area of nearly 700 000 ha is divided among more than 300 000 farming households, resulting in small farms of less than 1.30 ha on average. Moreover, these tiny areas are divided into several plots of 0.3 ha on average (INSTAT 2012). Albania has experienced the highest de-collectivisation index among the transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe (Miluka, Carletto et al. 2007). The principal aim of the generalised farming system created by de-collectivisation was that farms should produce enough food to meet farming families\u2019 personal needs. This would require farmers to grow several crops (cereals, forage, ",
        "4 . C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f A l b a n i a n a g r i c u l t u r e a n d m e t h o d o l o g i c a l i s s u e s 23 vegetables and fruit trees) and keep several types of livestock (a combination of sheep and goats in the mountainous areas and generally cattle in the lowland areas). Empirical studies show clearly that family is the major source of labour on Albanian farms and that the agricultural labour market is very small (Miluka, Carletto et al. 2007). Twenty years on, the average land area per farm has improved slightly (by only 16.3 %, increasing from 1.04 ha at the beginning of 2000 to 1.21 ha in 2010) (MBUMK 2012), as has the average plot area (increased by only 1.2 %). Studies have shown that the land market is developed mainly for urbanisation purposes near urban and coastal areas (Guri and Jouve 2003; Guri 2008). 4.2.2 Is a typology really needed in Albania? The structure of farms in Albania and the way in which these farms were created after de-collectivisation may lead to the conclusion that a farm typology is obsolete in Albania. The de-collectivisation process that ocurred in Albania in 1991 produced farms with similar land areas, soil quality, agricultural techniques, etc. Generally, farms are very small and poorly equipped. The main objective of post-collective agricultural farms was subsistence ( 6 ) (Kodderitzsch 1999). The cropping and livestock pattern is based on cereals and vegetables, mainly for family consumption and sale of surpluses. This generalised situation left little room for, on the one hand, farmer-developed strategies and, on the other hand, adapted public policy instruments. Twenty years later, many factors (geographical, infrastructure, non-agricultural income, introduction of new techniques, agricultural investments, etc.) have made it possible for different farms types to emerge in Albania. In general, the average UAA is still in the same range as it was in 1991, but the cropping pattern and strategies are quite different. Many farms in the western part of the country (Fier Lushnj \u00eb Kavaja, etc.) now specialise in vegetable and fruit production for the markets, with a corresponding reduction in the proportion of total production that goes to self-consumption. Other farms are increasingly specialising in out-of-season production ( 7 ). In other regions of the country livestock farming systems predominate. A good example of changing farming systems is the growth of the areas under fruit tree plantations and greenhouses (in hectares) in the period 2006\u20132012 and 1996\u20132012, respectively (see Figure 8). 6 According to Kodderitzsch (1999), on average only 18 % of crop, 30 % of livestock and 2 % of on-farm processed production reaches the markets. 7 According to INSTAT (2012), the area under greenhouses has doubled in the last 12 years (2000\u20132012). Figure 8: The development of fruit tree production (1996\u20132012) and greenhouse area (2006\u20132012) by region Sources: MAFCP, 2011; INSTAT, 2012. ",
        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 24 The map of fruit tree distribution shows clearly that in regions where fruit tree production has traditionally been important (Fier, Berat, Kor\u00e7\u00eb) the area consumed by fruit tree production increased further over the 16-year period 1996\u20132012. The same is true of greenhouse production. In regions with significant areas under greenhouses (Fier, Berat), that area has increased even further over the 17- year period 1996\u20132013. At the same time, regions where a the production of fruit or vegetables in greenhouses was previously low have experienced only a small increase in area, or it may even have decreased (for example, the greenhouse area in the region of Gjirokast\u00ebr). These two examples show that Albanian agriculture is undergoing a process of specialisation. These general trends need to be analysed in a more detailed way by constructing a farm typology that groups farms with similar characteristics within a group and highlights important differences among groups (K\u00f6brich, Rehman et al. 2003; Iraizoz, Gorton et al. 2007). The creation of a farm system typology allows the specification of research questions, the elaboration of policy instruments and improvements in extension interventions in rural areas (Jouve 1986; Landais 1998). The role of the typology can be summarised as \u2018an efficient method to summarise diversity of farming systems, intrinsic to every rural area\u2019 (Righi, Dogliotti et al. 2011). In the case of Albania, constructing a representative farming system typology helps the policy maker to develop policy instruments to meet specific needs. Some scholars conclude that, even in small areas, the typology remains a pertinent instrument to understand farming systems and farmers\u2019 strategies Canali et al., 1998; Biba, 2001; Guri, 2002; \u00c7akalli 2012). Independently of their research objectives, they agree that typology is one of the few instruments that allows us to identify the differences between farms in Albanian rural areas. The majority of typologies developed until now have been expert-based ones for a limited number of farms and districts. Below we have presented a non-exhaustive list of typologies drawn up in Albania over the last 20 years.

Three are the main indicators recurrently used to group Albanian farming systems: Agricultural and non-agricultural income Agricultural income is one of the main research issues in Albania. The higher level of poverty in rural areas (Azzarri, Carletto et al. 2006) is a result of the lower productivity of work in agriculture, limited agricultural resources (especially land), obsolete technologies and the absence of specific support policies. The farm household strategy depends heavily on the quantity of non-farm income (Azzarri, Carletto et al. 2006). The literature shows that generally only a small part of non- agricultural income or remittances is invested in agricultural production or improvement of agricultural techniques; however, agricultural activity is shaped according to the availability of labour within the household (Miluka, Carletto et al. 2007). Land use strategies One of the main issues in Albanian agriculture is the limited area of agricultural land per farm (on average 1.20 ha/farm (INSTAT 2012)). Moreover, this tiny area is split into several plots of 0.26 ha on average (INSTAT 2012) sometimes located as much as 2 or 3 km away from the farmer\u2019s household. Despite this, the Albanian government has not introduced sufficient specific ways of reversing the situation and increasing the average area of farms. In this framework, the analysis of land use strategies seems to be one of the main research questions for Albanian scholars (Guri 2002; Civici 2003). In these cases the research is related to the specific region(s) of the country without giving any overview of the whole-country situation. The effect of policy instruments on agricultural income In 2007, the Albanian government introduced a set of agricultural investment support schemes, mainly applicable to fruit tree plantations, greenhouse construction, improving herd size, etc. The direct and indirect effects of these instruments on agricultural income/farms are poorly documented. This is partly because insufficient time has elapsed \u2014most investments by farmers are in fruit trees (olives), which are not yet in production. The studies done ( \u00c7akalli 2012 ) are partial and deal only with one type of fruit tree in a limited area (generally a sample in a district). A common feature of all farm typologies developed for Albanian agriculture during the last 20 years is the methodology used, which, generally, has been expert based. Typically the number of questionnaires administered low and the sample covers only a small number of districts. There is only a little information about sample designation and sample representativeness at a country or district level. Only the typology developed by the Albanian Institute of Statistics and presented by Ronza (2011) is capable of being statistically representative at country level, but no detailed information is provided in the paper.

The first part deals with the sample design and identification of regions, districts, communes and farms that are representative of the diversity of Albanian farming systems. The second part of the methodology explains the construction of the farm typology, and the third part presents the indicators used to assess the viability for each farm type. 5.1 The sample design The sample is designed to be representative of farming systems in Albania. The limited financial and administrative resources meant that the survey had to be restricted to three regions of the country selected for their diversity of farming systems. The farms taking part in the survey were selected randomly to be representative of the farming systems in the area. The methodology of sample selection is explained below. 5.1.1 Selection of three representative regions (prefec- tures) Albania is divided into 12 administrative counties called \u2018prefectures\u2019, \u2018qarks\u2019 or \u2018regions\u2019 (hereafter regions). To identify a representative sample of Albanian farming systems, a three-step sampling design was used. Firstly, Albanian regions were stratified into three non- overlapping strata, each the size of four regions. Each stratum included regions that have similar agricultural characteristics in terms of: Gross added value of agriculture in millions of Albanian lek \u2014as an indicator of the importance of regional agriculture for the national agriculture sector. Propensity to market (sales/total production (in value))\u2014 one of the most cited indicators in the identification of the different types of farming systems in Albania. The propensity to market is generally measured by proportion of total agricultural production accounted for by sales or the contribution of agricultural sales to total income. Agricultural work productivity (workers/million Albanian lek of production)\u2014an indicator of the intensification of farming systems in the region. Productivity of the land (million Albanian lek per hectare)\u2014 an indicator of the intensification of land in the region. The data used for agriculture gross added value and employment in agriculture came from by INSTAT (Albanian National Statistics Institute), and the data used for the agricultural production (in value), sales (in value) and arable area came from the Statistical Yearbook 2010 of the Ministry of Agriculture Rural Development and Water Management. The latest common year for the two sources is used. 5.1.1.1 Ranking The selected indicators are used to rank the Albanian regions according to their contribution to total production. Ranking is done by a user-defined function ( 8 ), with the main goal of ensuring the sustainability of sums. Assuming that each indicator is equally valid, the final ranking uses the average ranking of all indicators. Table 2 shows the classification of Albanian regions into three non-overlapping strata. 8 A function developed by Hans Pottel, commonly used for ranking in statistics, reviewing the Excel RANK function (the sum of ranks for a list of a given length changes depending on the number of ties), by assigning fractional ranks to ties to keep the sum consistent . 5.

M e t h o d o l o g y 29 The regions ranked from first to fourth place (Tiran\u00eb, Kor\u00e7\u00eb, Fier and Elbasan) are part of the first stratum, regions ranked from fifth to ninth place (Vlor\u00eb, Shkod\u00ebr, Dib\u00ebr and Berat) are part of the second stratum and the remaining regions (Durr\u00ebs, Gjikorast\u00ebr, Lezh\u00eb and Kuk\u00ebs) are constitute third stratum. The regional stratification is presented in Figure 9. Within each stratum the regions have similar characteristics of agricultural production. The first stratum includes the most advanced agricultural regions in the country. The combination of the four selected indicators ranks these regions in first place. This is not universally true for each region and for each indicator. For example, Elbasan is classified among the most advanced regions in terms of agricultural production but its farm propensity to market is not highly ranked. This indicator decreases the overall performance of the region but not so much that it is demoted to the lower group of regions. The agricultural added value of these regions is higher. Farming systems clustered in this group sell a higher proportion of their products than do farms in other regions of the country. Another factor influencing intensification is the presence of at least one important agricultural products market within the region\u2019s boundaries or in close proximity. Tiran\u00eb, Elbasan and Kor\u00e7 \u00eb are among the most populated cities in the country. Fier region is in between the capital and the second largest city of the country (Tiran\u00eb and Vlor \u00eb , respectively). This favourable geographical location reduces the transaction costs of farms in Fier compared with those in other regions of the country. Traditionally these regions have been important agricultural producers at a country level. Some of them specialise in particular products (fruit and vegetables, cereals, potatoes, etc.) or production techniques (greenhouses). The second stratum is composed of regions that are characterised by a lower proportion of agricultural production or lower productivity. It is difficult to give a general description of the whole stratum. The third group of regions is composed of mountainous regions, which are more rural and have a lower agricultural production. In this group livestock production is important, but it is difficult for farmers to get their produce to the main agricultural markets of the country.

To select the region within the stratum, indicators of farming systems diversification are applied. Following the same strategy as in the first step of sampling, but using indicators of cropping pattern (arable crops, orchards and livestock production in million Albanian lek), the regions of each stratum are ranked within the stratum (Table 3). In each stratum, the region whose average ranking is closer to the average of the stratum is selected to be the one surveyed. The selected regions are Elbasan among the most agriculturally advanced regions, Berat among the middle regions, and Lezh\u00eb among the least agriculturally advanced regions. The main rationale behind region section methodology is not only to have representative regions on a country level, but also to have the greatest representation possible of agricultural systems in each group of regions.

        "5 . M e t h o d o l o g y 31 5.1.2 Farm selection Albania does not have yet a national farm register (it is expected to be established after the finalisation of the agricultural census (anticipated in 2014)). To select the farmers in each region, a multi-stage sampling method was applied, having as the main variable \u2018the area\u2019 (area sampling frame methodology). This methodology is widely used in agricultural surveys in Albania. In this case we have selected a sub-sample of a large master sample: \u2018The large sample is intended to provide enough \u201cbanked\u201d sample cases to support multiple surveys over several years without having to interview the same respondents repeatedly\u2019 (U.N. 2005). To select the farms for the sample, there are several methodological steps: (1) stratification; (2) construction of primary sampling units (PSUs), their numeration and selection; (3) the construction of sample Units (SUs), called segments, their selection and identification; and (4) the selection of a fixed number of farmers with activity for each selected segment. (1) In the first step, the stratification of the regions is done according to the importance of agricultural activity in each area. The region\u2019s area is split into seven strata, of which only four have agricultural interest: (1) land cultivation intensity over 75 %; (2) land cultivation intensity from 25 % to 74.9 %; (3) land cultivation intensity under 25 %; and (4) land cultivation intensity 0 %. Three other strata do not cover agricultural land, namely (1) military areas; (2) principal cities; and (3) water, rivers and lakes. Survey farms are selected from the first four strata. Identification of strata for each prefecture is made firstly by designing prefecture boundaries on transparent paper from topographic maps (1:100 000) and laying them over satellite images, to identify the areas of different strata, objects and physical boundaries according to the map legend. Following that, the transparent paper is again placed over topographic maps, in order to register the information from satellite images. The stratum boundaries are then painted onto the maps in different colours. (2) The second step of sample design methodology is the definition of the PSUs. These are designed for each stratum based on the predefined size boundaries (Table 4). The process of the measurement and design of PSUs on the maps is the same as that used to define the strata at regional level. A segment is a confined area of land within a PSU with a definite size depending on the stratum and defined absolutely in space using real physical boundaries (Table 5). Table 4: Definition of the primary sampling units Stratum Minimum (ha) Desirable (ha) Maximum (ha) 1 800 1 000 1 200 2 800 1 000 1 200 3 1 600 2 000 2 400 4 1 600 2 000 2 400 Source: authors\u2019 calculations.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 32 The total number of segments identified in the country is 41 513. The allocation of PSUs to strata and regions is done by the proportional to size probability method (comparing the size of each stratum with the country\u2019s total area to identify the PSUs for each stratum, and comparing the size of each region with the stratum size to define the number of PSUs per region). One segment is selected for each selected PSU. The number of selected segments (selected PSUs) and their size is defined based on the sample variability, cost, problems related to identifiable boundaries, farm size, number of farms, etc. To improve the level of precision, to determine if the estimated number of segments was appropriate, estimations are made for different agricultural products in terms of comparing variance between segments with that inside the segments. The selection of segments is made by a systematic selection process with a random start. The interval is defined by dividing the total number of segments per PSU by the number of selected segments. The segments are identified and localised on maps, measured through the digitisation process and identified in the field using maps on a scale of 1:10 000 or 1:25 000. The list of farms with or without activity, together with the total land, for each segment is updated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Consumer Protection (MAFCP) in the regions on an annual basis. This sample can provide good results and representativeness at country and regional level with a limited budget and human resources. ,This method has the following advantages, among others: \u2022 The potential uses are unlimited\u2014it can be used to collect representative data on the area planted with crops and orchards and on livestock and agricultural production as well as socio-economic data. \u2022 It can ensure statistical validity\u2014the method used to design the frame takes into account all areas. Following the above method, the PSUs and the segments for the survey are selected. The number of selected segments for each selected region is 30 for Berat, 56 for Elbasan and 30 for the region of Lezh\u00eb (Table 6 and Figure 10). From each segment, 10 farms with agricultural activity are selected for surveying. The selection is casual starting point and systematic.

Two typologies are drawn up: one for the whole sample (three regions) and a second one for each region. The differences between the two typologies are considered to be a proxy indicator of the different characteristics of the farming systems in each region. The literature recommends selecting variables that explain farm characteristics, among others, in terms of farm size, capital, labour, production pattern, soil quality, managerial ability, etc. (K\u00f6brich, Rehman et al. 2003) (Riveiro, Marey et al. 2008). Other authors classify variables into three main groups: (1) biophysical resources (farm area, land use patterns, livestock resources, fruit trees, etc.); (2) socio- economic aspects (labour, capital, etc.); and (3) equipment (availability of tools, equipment, etc.) (Righi, Dogliotti et al. 2011). Castel et al. (2010) use seven groups of variables to build the typology of dairy farming systems in a province of Poland, i.e. (1) soil quality; (2) socio-economic conditions; (3) infrastructure; (4) structure of agricultural production; (5) inputs in agricultural production; (6) production income and profitability; and (7) index of agricultural profitability. Tittonell et al. (2010) built a typology of smallholder farms by adding variables ( 9 ) related to the propensity of farms to take part in agricultural produce markets. In the case of the Albanian farm typology, five groups of variables have been selected: (1) The physical characterises of the farm: (a) total area of the farm; (b) share of rented land; and (c) share of irrigated land. This group of variables helps us to cluster the farms according to their physical characteristics (total area), the agricultural infrastructure (irrigation) and the intensity of farming system that the household wants to apply on the farm (share of rented land). The farm structure in Albania arising from the de-collectivisation process is characterised by small and regionally equal agricultural areas/farm. All the inhabitants of Albania living in the rural areas at the beginning of 1990 acquired a small plot of land. This framework led us to conclude that renting land is not a survival strategy but an expansion strategy generally followed by farmers who want to intensify their farming system. (2) The cropping pattern: (a) the share of livestock production value over the total production value; and (b) the share of crop production value over the total agricultural production. This second variable is constructed from three main categories of crop production: (i) arable crops; and (ii) vegetables and potatoes and fruit trees. The cropping pattern is one of the main structural characteristics of farming systems that shape their strategies. (3) Capital structure: (a) agricultural capital/agricultural production; and (b) total expenses/agricultural production. These two variables can be used to differentiate farming systems according to their capital intensification. (4) The fourth group of variables tries to differentiate farming systems according to the propensity they have to participate in agricultural markets. Scholars differentiate three main types of agricultural farms in Albania (Biba 2001; Guri 2002): (a) self-sufficient farms producing mainly to fulfil the family\u2019s need for food and selling only some surplus to local markets; (b) mixed farms producing both to fulfil the family\u2019s need for food but selling also being an important part of their operation, mainly to local markets but also abroad. This strategy is followed by farms in areas that are well known for a specific type of agricultural production, farms that are located close to market infrastructures or farms that have invested in improving their production capacity; and (c) farms that produce exclusively for market. The share of these 9 Tittonell et al. (2010) use the following variables to build their typology: total area, UAA, area with cash crops, family size, family labour, age of household head, share of household income from off-/non-farm income, number of years of generating off- farm income, production orientation (share of production for market), total number of livestock, number of local cattle breeds, number of improved cattle breeds, and months of food self-sufficiency.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 34 farms is limited because it is rare for a farming household to sell all of its produce. The farms in this group are generally those that have extensive areas under greenhouses or fruit trees or large livestock herds. (5) The last variable is used to group farming systems by analysing the share of non-agricultural income in the total income. Income structure is among the most used variables in expert-based typologies in Albania (Biba 2001; Guri 2002) owing to the characteristics of the farming system in Albania. Non-farm incomes are one of the main sources of revenue in rural areas. These may come from non- agricultural employment or social transfers from members of the family who have emigrated (Kilic, Carletto et al. 2009), governmental social transfers known as poverty allocations or retirement pensions. Studies have concluded that non- farm employment in Albania is more a substitute for than a complement of agricultural employment and that the non-farm income is generally channelled to non-agricultural activities within the household. The exception is livestock production if the produce is destined for market (Kilic, Carletto et al. 2009). According to the studies mentioned, the higher proportion of non-agricultural income will result in farms with lower agricultural sales and diversified employment but outside of agriculture. 5.2.2 Clustering farms To construct the typology of farming systems in the regions all the variables mentioned above (see section 5.2.1) are used. Some of these variables are not sufficiently variable among the farms and so they are not considered in the typology. The variables of rented land, agricultural capital and hired workforce are not included for this reason. The final variables used to construct the typology of farming systems at the sample level are the following: (1) Farm structure: (a) total farm area; (b) cultivated area/ total area; (2) Agricultural crops: (a) proportion of livestock production; (b) structure of agricultural production: (i) arable crops; (ii) vegetables and potatoes; (iii) fruit trees. (3) Intensification strategies: (a) total expenses/value of agricultural production; (b) annual work units/value of agricultural production (1 AWU = 1 800 working hours = 225 days of work ( 10 )). (4) The farm\u2019s propensity to market: share of agricultural sales value over the value of total agricultural production. (5) Proportion of non-agricultural income. Three are the main steps in constructing the typology construction: (1) test the need for a factor analysis procedure; (2) hierarchical clustering to define the most appropriate number of clusters; and (3) non-hierarchical clustering to define the clusters of the sample and the characteristics of each type (K\u00f6brich, Rehman et al. 2003; Bidogeza, Berrensten et al. 2007). A factor analysis procedure is needed when the variables are correlated with each other. In order to eliminate the inter-relation among the variables, a principal components analysis (PCA) is performed with the aim of reducing the dimensions of the dataset but maintaining the variation. To identify the inter-relation among the variables we applied the Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkim (KMO) test (1970) to identify a correlation or partial correlation. If the value of the KMO test is higher than 0.5, a factor analysis is required. In our case the KMO test value was 0.603. The second test applied was Bartlett\u2019s sphericity test . The hypothesis tested is that the correlation matrix is an index matrix meaning that the variables are completely independent from each other. The null hypothesis is rejected (p < 0.001) meaning that a correlation exist among the variables taken into consideration. The results of these two tests (Table 7) demonstrate that, before clustering can be done, a factor analysis is required. 10 We used the EUROSTAT definition of AWU: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/ statistics_explained/index.php/Glossary:Annual_work_unit_(AWU) ",

In our case this is true for the first four components. Table 7 shows that the first four components account for more than 67 % of the initial variance of the variables retained. This result is in line with those reported in papers using the same techniques (Iraizoz, Gorton et al. 2007).

In the first step, a hierarchical cluster in method is applied using Ward\u2019s minimum variance. This method minimises the variance within the cluster and tends to find or create clusters of relatively equal size and shape as hyper-spheres (K\u00f6brich, Rehman et al. 2003). In the second phase, a non-hierarchical clustering method is applied, using the number of clusters established in the first step, trying to minimise the variance within the cluster as a measure of cluster homogeneity. The final result is taken by cutting the dendogram (Figure 11) at level 5 of the linkage distance, which is the lowest cut giving a reasonable number of clusters. In this case the cluster number is 6. The cluster selection is supported by the analysis of variance test ( F -values and P -values). 5.3 Methodology of farm viability analysis The main analysis of the project is to identify the most productive farm types in Albania in terms of FNI, the types that yield a higher income for each household family member, and the types that give a better return for the work of each AWU employed in agriculture as well as for the land. 5.3.1 Farm net income calculation In this report the methodology of FNI calculation (Box 2) and the analysis of viability among the farm types is based on the methodology followed in the JRC Scientific and Policy Report \u2018Rural poverty reduction and food security: the case of the smallholders in Sierra Leone\u2019 (Gomez y Paloma S., Acs et al. 2012).

M e t h o d o l o g y 37 Box 2: Farm household income calculation Source: (Gomez y Paloma S., Acs et al. 2012) The household income is measured by the sum of farm net income (FNI) and off-farm income: FNI = OV \u2013 IC where OV (output value) represents all agricultural production used for sale, self-consumption and stock. The value is calculated by multiplying the production by the market prices (declared by the household or, if it is not available (because the household does not sell the product), an average of prices declared by farms surveyed in the same commune). The OV formula is: ! ! = !\"!#$ !\"#$%& !\" !\"#$\"%&! !\"#$%& !\" !\"#\"$%\"& !\"#$\"%&! ! ! = !\"!#$ !\"#$%& !\" !\"#$% !\"#$%& !\" !\"#\"$%\"& !\"#$% ! ! = !\"#! !\"#$!\"# !\"#\u210e!\" !\u210e! !\"#$\"%& !\"!#$ !\"#$ !\"#! !\"#$%&'( !\"#$%&%#'( = ! ! \u00d7! ! \u00d7! ! !\" = (! ! ! \u00d7! ! ) + (! ! ! \u00d7! ! ) !\" = (!\"# !,! !,! \u00d7! ! + !\"\"#$ ! \u00d7! ! + ! ! \u00d7! !,! !\" = ! !\"#$ + !\"\"#$ ! \u00d7! ! + ! ! \u00d7! ! ! ! ! = !\" \u2212 !\" ! !\"# !\" = !\" \u2212 !\" !\" \u2212 !\" !\" !\"# !\"\u00d712\u00d7!\" !\"# !\"\u00d712\u00d74037!\"\" !\"# !\"\u00d712\u00d74891!\"\" !\"# = !\"# !\"\u00d712 + ! ! ! + !\" ! ! + !\" ! ! + ! ! ! !!\" !\"\u00d712 !\"# !\"\" !\"# ! !!\" WU where C i and p i are the production quantity and price, respectively, for each type of crop and L j and p j the quantity and price, respectively, for each type of livestock production.

Calculation of farm type viability is done using the reproduction threshold (RT), which is a benchmark for assessing the economic viability of different farming or production systems (Gomez y Paloma S., Acs et al. 2012). In this case two indicators are used to assess the viability of farming systems. The first is the minimum wage approach, which is the comparison of the FNI/WU with the minimum wage ( 11 ) for 2014. The second indicator is the comparison of FNI/ household member with the poverty line ( 12 ). The same level of minimum wage and poverty line indicators is applied to the whole sample. Table 8 shows the utilisation of these two indicators. The analysis is performed on farm type, and the discussion of the results is on the basis of farm type level, but a comparison of the results among different farms types of the region is also made. 11 For administrative reasons, the Albanian government fixes the level of the minimum wage. In 2014 the minimum monthly wage amounts to ALL 22 000 (EUR 156.6). 12 According to the Institute of Statistics of Albania (INSTAT), an inhabitant is in extreme poverty if his or her monthly income does not exceed ALL 4 037 (EUR 28.7) and is in complete poverty if the monthly income does not exceed ALL 4 891 (EUR 34.8). The importance of non-farm incomes in Albanian rural areas makes it necessary to perform the analysis not only for the FNI, but also for the total household income (THI). The THI is calculated as: ! ! = !\"!#$ !\"#$%& !\" !\"#$\"%&! !\"#$%& !\" !\"#\"$%\"& !\"#$\"%&! ! ! = !\"!#$ !\"#$%& !\" !\"#$% !\"#$%& !\" !\"#\"$%\"& !\"#$% ! ! = !\"#! !\"#$!\"# !\"#\u210e!\" !\u210e! !\"#$\"%& !\"!#$ !\"#$ !\"#! !\"#$%&'( !\"#$%&%#'( = ! ! \u00d7! ! \u00d7! ! !\" = (! ! ! \u00d7! ! ) + (! ! ! \u00d7! ! ) !\" = (!\"# !,! !,! \u00d7! ! + !\"\"#$ ! \u00d7! ! + ! ! \u00d7! !,! !\" = ! !\"#$ + !\"\"#$ ! \u00d7! ! + ! ! \u00d7! ! ! ! ! = !\" \u2212 !\" ! !\"# !\" = !\" \u2212 !\" !\" \u2212 !\" !\" !\"# !\"\u00d712\u00d7!\" !\"# !\"\u00d712\u00d74037!\"\" !\"# !\"\u00d712\u00d74891!\"\" !\"# = !\"# !\"\u00d712 + ! ! ! + !\" ! ! + !\" ! ! + ! ! ! !!\" !\"\u00d712 !\"# !\"\" !\"# ! !!\" WU where ! ! = !\"!#$ !\"#$%& !\" !\"#$\"%&! !\"#$%& !\" !\"#\"$%\"& !\"#$\"%&! ! ! = !\"!#$ !\"#$%& !\" !\"#$% !\"#$%& !\" !\"#\"$%\"& !\"#$% ! ! = !\"#! !\"#$!\"# !\"#\u210e!\" !\u210e! !\"#$\"%& !\"!#$ !\"#$ !\"#! !\"#$%&'( !\"#$%&%#'( = ! ! \u00d7! ! \u00d7! ! !\" = (! ! ! \u00d7! ! )+ (! ! ! \u00d7! ! ) !\" = (!\"# !,! !,! \u00d7! ! +!\"\"#$ ! \u00d7! ! +! ! \u00d7! !,! !\" = ! !\"#$ + !\"\"#$ ! \u00d7! ! + ! ! \u00d7! ! ! ! ! = !\" \u2212!\" ! !\"# !\" = !\" \u2212!\" !\" \u2212 !\" !\" !\"# !\"\u00d712\u00d7!\" !\"# !\"\u00d712\u00d74037!\"\" !\"# !\"\u00d712\u00d74891!\"\" !\"# = !\"# !\"\u00d712+ ! ! ! + !\" ! ! + !\" ! ! + ! ! ! !!\" !\"\u00d712 !\"# !\"\" !\"# ! !!\" WU is the monthly income for each household family member; is the monthly wage(s) of the household family members; is the monthly amount of retirement pension(s) of household family members; is the monthly amount of poverty payments; and is remittances or other incomes, expressed at the monthly level.

        "6 . T h e f a r m t y p o l o g y r e s u l t s 39 6.1 Sample analysis results Table 9 shows the values for each variable for the six groups of farms created after the cluster analysis. The farm type average indicators represent an overview of the farm type strategies. Cluster 1 is the group \u2018poly-culture mainly for the market\u2019 . This group is characterised by the highest proportion of sales (64 % of the total production value) as well as no clear specialisation in one type of agricultural production. Agricultural income is the main source of income in the household (only 8.28 % of non-agricultural income) and the production expenses are among the lowest, as a result of adopting a strategy of little mechanisation and a lot of manual labour. The farm structure is characterised by relatively larger areas (13.55 ha) but little potential to use irrigation (only 20 % of the total land). The farming mix is dominated by crops (77 % of total production). The distribution among cropping activities favours fruit tree production, but other crops such as arable crops (31 %) and vegetables (nearly 20 %) also make an important contribution. Cluster 2 comprises farms that can be called \u2018leisure farms\u2019 . The main part of their income comes from non- agricultural activities (nearly 70 % of total income). The farms in this group are characterised by the smallest land area among the farm types in our sample (0.7 ha) and a higher proportion of crop production than livestock farming. The crops cultivated are generally those that do not need any particular know-how (arable crops 74.4 %) with little cultivation of fruit trees (less than 5 %) and the rest in vegetables and potatoes. Almost the whole of the arable area is cultivated (97 %), employing the greatest amount of labour (nearly 7 AWU/million Albanian lek). These figures 6.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 40 allow us to conclude that the farming systems of this group are small and extensive. Cluster 3 can be called the \u2018arable crops type\u2019 . In this group, arable crop production is dominant (nearly 90 % of total crop production). The other types of crop production (fruit trees or vegetables) are cultivated only for family consumption. The proportion of sales remains important and the household also has considerable support from non-agricultural activities. It seems that the choice of crop production is the result of the lack of agricultural infrastructure for farms of this type. Only 11 % of the arable land is irrigated. There is clear competition for the workforce between agricultural activities and other activities. The farms in this group use only 3.8 AWU/million Albanian lek of agricultural production, which is the lowest amount of labour used among all the types identified. On the other hand, the farms in this group use a higher proportion of agricultural machinery and other expenses. The limited workforce and the reduced potential for irrigation lead farmers to follow a strategy of intensifying agricultural production by increasing the use of mechanisation. Production is divided between self-consumption and the market\u2014trying to produce not only food for the family also products that can be sold in markets without significant transaction costs (not direct sales). Cluster 4 is clearly the \u2018fruit trees\u2019 group. In fruit trees, we have included all types of fruit trees (pome fruits, stone fruits, nuts, sub-tropical fruits, citrus, olives and vines) The farms in this group have a clear specialisation in fruit tree production (77 % of crop production) and are market oriented (64 % of the production is sold). This specialisation is not enough to provide income for the family. The farms in this group have the highest level of non-agricultural (70.8 %) income among all the groups. The irrigated area is limited and the expenses for agricultural production are among the highest of those in the sample (0.48). Fruit tree production, if done in an intensive way, may incur higher expenses and may also need a bigger workforce. In this case, farms need on average 5.5 AWU to produce ALL 1 million. Livestock production and arable crops are not important and the produce is used only for home consumption. Cluster 5 farms have the characteristics of \u2018self-sufficient\u2019 farms, with less participation in the market than the previous group. The majority of production satisfies the household needs for food. Non-agricultural income is not important (less than 5 %). The farms in this group spend relatively less to produce, meaning that their main strategy is not intensification. The average amount spent on the workforce reinforces the idea that this group of farms is trapped in a type of agriculture with little potential for diversification or increasing the area of land (due to a bigger family) and only a low potential for intensifying (lack of funds, agricultural infrastructure (only 10 % of the land is irrigated) or both reasons). Cluster 6 farms are those that are more specialised in \u2018 livestock \u2019 production. This group of farms is characterised by lower sales (one-third of total production) but a significant proportion of livestock activity. It seems that this strategy is the result of limited arable land (on average less than 1 ha/farm) and reduced potential for employment in non- agricultural sectors. The proportion of cultivated land (99 % of total land) demonstrates the need for extra land are for the farms in this group. Crop production in this group is characterised by limited use of machinery or other agricultural expenses and a not excessive use of the workforce. Figure 12 shows the distribution of farms among the three regions considered. In the Lezh\u00eb region, the main types of farms are those of type 3 (arable crops) (75 farms) and of type 5 (self-sufficient subsistence) (66 farms). The third group of farms is located mainly on the lowland area of the region near the main road axes and urban areas. Farms located in these areas have strong linkages with the non-agricultural sector that heavily complement their agricultural income. All these areas have important irrigation and drainage systems (constructed mainly during the collective period). Being on the plain, the use of agricultural machinery is more frequent (explained by the higher spending on agricultural machinery). Their proximity to urban markets helps them to sell a significant part of their production. This group makes little by way of agricultural investments (e.g. fruit trees). The farms of type 5 in the Lezh\u00eb region are situated in hilly or mountainous areas. These farms are characterised by being Figure 12: Regional representation of farm typology Source: authors\u2019 compilation. ",
        "6 . T h e f a r m t y p o l o g y r e s u l t s 41 isolated and they have little potential for diversification. Mountainous areas in the region have little potential for irrigation, the climate is no longer Mediterranean, but continental, and the agricultural mix is composed mainly of cereals, with an important contribution from livestock production, generally goats. Production is extensive (with little use of agricultural machinery or improved seeds and fertilisers). In the region of Elbasan, the three main farm types are type 2 (leisure farms) (57 farms), type 5 (self-sufficient) (114 farms) and type 6 (livestock specialisation) (225 farms). The situation in Elbasan region is a little similar to the Lezh\u00eb region in the sense that in both regions the plain and the mountainous area are clearly identifiable. Type 2 farms are generally those located in the lowland areas, having strong connections with urban areas and non-agricultural activities and producing mainly for home consumption and selling only the surplus. Type 5 farms have the same characteristics as those in the region of Lezh\u00eb. The last important group (type 6) is characterised by the importance of livestock production. Apparently, the farms in this group are found not only in mountainous areas with herds of sheep and goats but also in lowland areas with herds of sheep. Farms in the second group are the main milk producers for the urban areas of the region, and milk is generally sold directly from household members. The farm types most present in the region of Berat are farms of type 1, \u2018poly-culture mainly for market\u2019 (69 farms), type 4 \u2018fruit trees\u2019 (66 farms) and type 5 \u2018self-sufficient (subsistence)\u2019 (56 farms). The region of Berat is nationally known as an important agricultural producer (fruit, vegetables and arable corps). This explains the greater presence of farms that are market oriented but without a specific type of production and farms that have a clear specialisation in fruit trees. In fact, among the three regions, Berat is over-represented in the \u2018farm trees\u2019 type (nearly 50 % of farms are of that type). At national level, Berat is well known for fruit tree and olive cultivation. Fruit tree production (and especially olive trees and nuts) is the type of production that has been the most supported over the last 5 years by public support schemes. But the new plantations set up under the framework of this support scheme have only partly come into production. 6.2 The cluster analyses on a regional level The literature concludes that national typologies are scarce and do not always contain the relevant information and detailed information (Capillon et al., 1975, cited in (Duvernoy 2000)) by variables for the specific study (Duvernoy 2000). Another regional typology is built up using the same variables as in the first case, this time by applying them for each region sample in separately. The sample is designed in such a way that it is representative of farm systems for each region. The typology built is therefore going to be representative of farms systems in the region, reducing the risk of having types not reflecting the characteristics of agriculture in the region. On the other hand, the comparison between the two typologies is going to highlight the \u2018regional factor\u2019 in agriculture. 6.2.1 Farm typology for the Berat region The region of Berat is characterised by a greater diversity of farming systems. Seven farms types are identified in this region (Table 10). Cluster 1, \u2018poly-culture for market\u2019 (55 farms), is characterised by farming systems based on several agricultural products but grown to feed the household and to sell in the local markets. These farms do not have any specialisation (the proportion of income from each product is comparable to the others) as a risk reduction strategy. This is more important owing to their limited non-agricultural income (only 11 % of the total income). Agriculture is the main economic activity (99.6 % of the UAA is cultivated), although the agricultural infrastructure is not very advantageous (only 20 % of UAA is irrigated). The farms need a limited workforce (2.7 AWU/ million Albanian lek of agricultural production) and try not to use excessive inputs (ALL 0.36 /million Albanian lek of production), which is average for the region\u2019s farm types.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 42 The second cluster identified in the Berat region is \u2018leisure type\u2019 (24 farms). This group is characterised by a significant non-agricultural income (75 % of total income) and good relations with agricultural markets (two-thirds of agricultural production is sold). The farming system is characterised by significant use of production inputs (more than half of each Albanian lek produced is spent on inputs) and a significant workforce (more than 9 AWU contribute to produce ALL 1 million). It seems that agriculture is the main economic activity for those members of the family who have not been able to find other employment outside agriculture. The third group of farms, \u2018arable crops (31 farms), is characterised by a duality between agricultural and non- agricultural activity. More than half (63 %) of the total income comes from the non-agriculture sector. The cropping pattern for this group is characterised by a clear dominance of arable crops. With a limited irrigated area, this does not allow much specialisation in a particular type of production, and agricultural expenses and the workforce employed are average. The fourth group of farms, \u2018fruit trees with important non- agriculture income\u2019 (60 farms), is characterised by significant fruit tree production (85 % of crop production value). The farms in this group have followed a specialisation strategy in that they produce only one or two types of crop, generally vines and/or olives, and sell the produce in the local markets. The non-farm income reduces the risk for the household. The farms in cluster 7 follow the same strategy but, not having another non-farm income supporting this strategy, the area under trees is reduced and the proportion of arable crops and livestock is more important. The farms in this group do use important resources in their production and the workforce used is limited. In this group, agriculture is in clear competition with the non-farm sector. Figure 13: Proportion of each farm type in Berat Source: authors\u2019 compilation. ",
        "6 . T h e f a r m t y p o l o g y r e s u l t s 43 The fifth group, \u2018self-sufficient\u2019 (34 farms), is characterised by small farms that have only a limited presence in the market (26 % of their production value), with little agricultural infrastructure (only 5 % of the arable area is irrigated). Their main objective is to secure food for the family by cultivating a wide range of crops, thus leaving little room for specialisation. Agriculture is their main activity (non-farm incomes are less than 5 %), and they use more inputs than the other groups (ALL 0.5 for every Albanian lek produced). The family workforce is considerable (9. 4 AWU/ million Albanian lek), demonstrating little use of agricultural machinery but reflecting too one of the main problems of Albanian agriculture \u2013 the hidden unemployment. On farms where agriculture is the only economic activity, the available workforce is not employed in an efficient way. The literature defines this group of farmers as \u2018stocked in agriculture\u2019. The sixth group of farms, \u2018livestock specialisation\u2019 (53 farms), is characterised by relatively higher livestock production (in value) (50 % of the total production) and a significant proportion of arable crops to provide feed for the animals. The significant proportion of arable crops demonstrates the importance of the cattle herd compared with other livestock herds (sheep and goats); on the other hand, the reduced cost of production (0.35 centimes for each Albanian lek of production) suggests an extensive method of production that is typical of fodder and forage crops in Albania. For this group of farms, agriculture is the main activity (the off-farm income is limited) and sales are the main source of cash in the household. The last group of farms, \u2018specialist in fruit trees\u2019 (14 farms), is a group of farms that for the first time does not appear in this region. It is characterised by farms that see their future in agriculture and specialising in agricultural production. In this case the main agricultural activity is fruit tree production, but they have not totally abandoned the system of poly- culture (the proportion of arable crops remains important). It seems that the specialisation is the result of their limited agricultural facilities (no irrigated land) and the method of cultivation\u2014an extensive one \u2014and limited financial resources. The absence of other employment possibilities drives all the household workforce to work on the land (1.3 AWU/million Albanian lek of agricultural production). The future of this group is uncertain regarding whether they are going to move forwards into type number 4, \u2018fruit trees with extra income\u2019; however, in this case, farms should diversify their income with off-farm income or they may end up falling into the self-sufficient group. 6.2.2 Farm typology for the Elbasan region The Elbasan region is a geographically large region with a considerable diversity of farming systems (lowland hilly or mountainous ones) and climate (Mediterranean or continental). This is why the sample for this region is nearly twice the size of that for the other regions (495 farms). The farm typology in the region is expected to be similar to that of the general sample. Indeed, in this region the sample farms are grouped into the same groups as in the general sample (Table 11 and Figure 14).

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 44 The first type of farm identified in the region of Elbasan is the group \u2018poly-culture for market\u2019 (47 farms), which, as in other cases (for the whole sample and for Berat), is characterised by a significant level of sales (nearly 70 % of total production) coming from different activities. Nevertheless, farm tree production contributes slightly more than the other sectors. Agriculture is the main sector in terms of production, and off-farm incomes are limited (3.9 % of total income). The farms in this group have limited agricultural facilities (nearly half of their arable area is irrigated) and use few agricultural inputs (only 29 centimes of each Albanian lek produced). It seems that the lack of inputs is compensated for by an abundant use of labour (5.1 AWU/million Albanian lek). The second group of farms is \u2018leisure farms\u2019 (35 farms). The main income of these farms comes from off-farm activities (68.5 % of total income). The off-farm income allows the farms in this group to use high-quantity agricultural inputs and machinery (they have the highest level of expenses for each Albanian lek produced). A larger average area shows that the family household is numerous and divided into two parts: those working out of agriculture and those working on the farm. The high level of AWU used per unit of value of agricultural production (5.4 AWU per million Albanian lek) is an indicator of this situation. The third group of farms is \u2018arable crop farms\u2019 (53 farms). Agriculture contributes only 36 % of total income, mainly from arable crop production, which accounts for two-thirds of crop production. Sales are limited at only 27 % of total production, and the main objective of agricultural production is to provide food for the family. The high number of AWU used for agricultural production demonstrates little off-farm activity, and it seems that the off-farm income comes from family members working outside the village. The limited expenditure on agricultural production shows that agriculture is not the priority of the household and they are not trying to intensify or specialise and that their future is totally related to the income derived from the non-farm sector. Figure 14: Distribution of farm types in Elbasan Source: authors\u2019 compilation. ",
        "6 . T h e f a r m t y p o l o g y r e s u l t s 45 As in the region of Berat, the farms grouped into the fourth cluster are specialised in \u2018fruit tree\u2019 production (19 farms). For the farms in this group, agricultural income is less than 30 % of the total income. Agriculture employs the highest number of AWU per unit of production value (12.1 AWU/ million Albanian lek) and has a higher level of agricultural expenses (52 centimes for each Albanian lek of production) than the other groups. These two indicators show a clear strategy of intensification (high level of expenses) but also using all the available workforce of the family in fruit tree production. These farms with limited arable area (0.735 ha), a limited proportion of which is irrigated (20 % of total area), and a large workforce follow an intensification strategy in an agricultural activity that does not need larger areas and that needs limited irrigation facilities (typical of the olive cultivation in this area) but does need a relatively large workforce, in particular for short periods (such as harvesting). This strategy of specialisation is made possible by high levels of off-farm income that reduces the risk of income fluctuation typical of specialised farms. The fifth group of farms, \u2018self-sufficient\u2019 (151 farms), is, as expected, one of the most important farming groups of the region. This group is characterised by limited proportion of off-farm income, a lower engagement of the workforce (3.8 AWU/million Albanian lek), a small irrigated area, and low agricultural expenses (33 centimes for each Albanian lek of production). Eighty per cent of the agricultural production comes from arable crops, meaning that specialisation in higher added value products, such as fruit trees or livestock, is not the strategy followed by this group. A relatively high proportion of sales (43 % of total production value) shows that the households in this group try to take part in the local markets but follow their main strategy of providing food for home consumption. The last group identified in the region of Elbasan is the group of \u2018livestock specialisation\u2019 (187 farms). This group of farms have limited potential for specialising (low arable area, low off-farm incomes, and low potential to intensify the agricultural production (low agricultural expenses). It seems that the main sales are of livestock products. 6.2.3 Farm typology for the Lezh\u00eb region The sample of Lezh\u00eb region is characterised by only five clusters. The types of clusters are slightly different from those in the general sample. The farm classification for this region uses mainly the same indicators as we have seen in the other cases but also some new variables that are statistically not important in the other regions. For the first time the proportion of vegetable production, and of hired labour, are important variables. The farm types of the region are shown in Table 12 and Figure 15.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 46 The first group of farms, \u2018poly-culture for the market\u2019 (47 farms), is a type of farm identified in the three regions. As in other regions, the farms of this type are characterised by a high proportion of sales (nearly 60 % of the total production) and no clear specialisation in one type of production. The farms have high off-farm incomes and use a significant proportion of hired labour (25 % of total AWU). They have a larger agricultural area than the other farm types (1.21 ha), but no significant agricultural facilities (only 7 % of the arable land is irrigated). The importance of hired labour shows the competition for labour among different economic activities. This is an important variable that shows the differences in agriculture between the regions in the central (Elbasan, Berat) part of the country and the western regions (Lezh\u00eb). The latter are economically more developed with a wider range of non-agricultural activities and a more vegetable production systems not only for home consumption ,but also for sale. The second group of farms (14 farms) is characterised by substantial off-farm incomes (82 %), a low level of sales (17 % of total agricultural production) and a limited arable area (0.6 ha/farm). The farmers in this group cultivate only half of the arable area. Figure 15: Distribution of farm types in the Lezh\u00eb region Source: authors\u2019 compilation. ",
        "6 . T h e f a r m t y p o l o g y r e s u l t s 47 The third group of farms, \u2018vegetables for market\u2019 (30 farms), appears for the first time in the Lezh\u00eb region. Farming systems based on vegetable produce are typical of the farms of the western part of Albania. These farms have a relatively better agricultural infrastructure (34 % of irrigated arable land). The limited proportion of off-farm activities explains the limited specialisation of farms in vegetable production. In this group, other agricultural activities are important (livestock and arable crops). The farmers in this group use only family labour. The fourth group of farms, \u2018self-sufficient\u2019 (67 farms), is characterised by an important proportion of off-farm incomes, and a relatively small proportion of agricultural sales. The arable land is limited (0.7 ha/farm) but irrigated. The distribution of the main agricultural activities is nearly equal between crop production and livestock, and, as expected, the proportion of the arable area is much higher than that under vegetable production. The last group of farms, \u2018livestock specialisation\u2019 (96 farms), is characterised by limited off-farm incomes (only 25 % of total incomes), and a quite significant proportion of sales (50 % of total production in value). The farms are larger (1.3 ha/farm) and almost the whole arable area is cultivated. The significant proportion of cultivated land the existence of hired labour can be indicators of lowland farming with cattle herds for milk and meat. 6.2.4 Comparison of sample-based and region-based farm typology The comparison between the typology constructed for the whole sample and the typology built up on a regional level shows that they are consistent, with some minor differences for Berat and Lezh\u00eb (Table 13).

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 48 Nearly all the variables with a greater level of variability for the whole sample are also important on a regional level. Indicators such as proportion of sales, proportion of irrigated area, proportion of livestock production and proportion of arable crops are important for the whole sample and for the three regions as well. But indicators such as proportion of fruit tree production, vegetables crops or hired workforce are important in the region of Lezh\u00eb but not in the other regions. This is the reason why the farm typology is performed twice (whole sample and regional level), in order have detailed and specific information on a regional level. The farm typology on a regional level revealed the existence of a farm type specialised in vegetable production. The western region of Albania is one of the few areas of lowland and more fertile agricultural area. On the other hand, this area also has the main urban areas of the country (the cities of Tiran\u00eb, Durr\u00ebs, Fier), which contain a significant proportion of the total urban population of Albania. The comparative advantages of this area (more fertile land, important urban markets, good weather conditions) makes the strategy of vegetable production natural for households with small areas of land and a significant proportion of family workforce unemployed. The analysis at a whole-sample level hides this important piece of information about farm strategies in Albania. The second important piece of information is the hired labour. It is generally agreed that the agricultural workforce in Albania is familial. The proportion of hired labour is generally small. In our sample in the region of Lezh\u00eb, the proportion of hired labout shows enough variability to be statistically significant in the farm typology construction. In this region the diversity of work is greater, and agriculture is the least remunerative activity. The family members that can work outside agriculture do so and unskilled workers are hired to work in agriculture. In these households, agriculture is not the main economic activity. The region farm type analysis demonstrated another farm type in the region of Berat\u2014one specialised in fruit tree production. This small group of farms (14 households or 5 % of the regional sample) has very limited off-farm economic resources and few other important agricultural activities apart from fruit tree production. Table 14 shows that the there are no significant differences between the farming systems at a regional level. Poly- culture mainly for market seems to be the most profitable farming system in Albanian rural areas. Twenty years after de-collectivisation, agriculture is still mainly based on self- sufficient strategies and farm specialisation is based on activity diversification as a strategy for economic protection. Being mostly hilly and mountainous, Albanian rural areas have strong links with livestock production (mainly milk), giving the farm household an income for most of the year.

This region, owing to its location in the central part of the country, enjoys good access to major national infrastructure but is estimated to have a low to medium level of urbanisation, most evident in the hilly and mountainous areas of the region (INSTAT, 2011). The district of Elbasan is the one with the highest population and also serves as the administrative centre of the region. It has an area of 1 290 km\u00b2. The population of Elbasan district is 224 689 and constitutes approximately 76 % of the regional population (INSTAT, 2012). From the point of view of administrative organisation, the region consists of three municipalities (Elbasan, Belsh and C\u00ebrrik) and 20 communes (Bradashesh, Fierz\u00eb, Funar\u00eb, Gostim\u00eb, Gracen, Grekan, Gjergjan, Gjinar, Kajan, Klos, Labinot-Fush\u00eb, Labinot- Mal, Mollas, Pap\u00ebr, Rras\u00eb, Shal\u00ebs, Shirgjan, Shushic\u00eb, Tregan and Zavalin\u00eb). Gramsh district consists of one municipality (Gramsh) and nine communes (Kodovjat, Kukur, Kushov\u00eb, Pishaj, Poro\u00e7an, Sh\u00ebnepremte, Sk\u00ebnderbegas, Sul and Tunj\u00eb). It has a population of 24 230 inhabitants. Librazhd district consists of two municipalities (Librazhd and P\u00ebrrenjas) as well as nine communes (Hotolisht, Lunik, Orenj\u00eb, Polis, Qend\u00ebr (Librazhd), Quk\u00ebs, Rajc\u00eb, Steblev\u00eb and Stravaj). The population of the region is 63 192 inhabitants. Peqin district consists of one municipality (Peqin) and five communes (Gjocaj, Karin\u00eb, Pajov\u00eb, P\u00ebrparim and Shez\u00eb). The population of the region is 31 004 inhabitants. The current administrative organisation of the region and the demographic movements of the last two decades have produced complex issues regarding the efficiency of the operation of local units and the quantity and quality of public goods they provide to citizens. Under this context, the necessity for reorganisation of the public administration of the region (and the country, too) is accepted by almost all important decision-making actors. 7.2 Description of the natural resources and geography 7.2.1 Land area The area of agricultural land in Elbasan region is 72 872 ha or 10.4 % of the agricultural land area at country level (Elbasan is ranked third regarding area of agricultural land in the country, after Fier and Kor\u00e7a). The non-agricultural land (forestry, pasture and other uses) is estimated to be about 253 992 ha (MoAFCP 2013). Despite the amount of agricultural land, it should be remembered that a good part of it lies in hilly and mountainous areas, especially in Librazhd and Gramsh districts, respectively. The area of irrigated agricultural land has increased significantly over the last decade from 8 100 ha in 2001 to about 21 493 ha in 2012, or 29.5 % of the agricultural land area, although it is still far from reaching its potential irrigated land area of about 60 % (MoAFCP 2013). 7.2.2 Natural resources Elbasan region is rich in water resources. Several rivers, such as the Shkumbin, Devoll and Seman, traverse the region. River valleys that cross the considerable length of this region create good opportunities for the development of agricultural activities throughout their length. The climate of this region is typically Mediterranean. The average annual temperature is 15.4 \u00baC. The annual average rainfall is 1 157 mm. As for the quality of the environment, Elbasan region has been found to be one of the areas where th level of pollution with sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide gases is above the national average. This is due to the concentration of heavy industries established in the region under the totalitarian system, some of which are still in partial operation. 7.2.3 Population As for the population, Elbasan region counts for about 11 % of the country\u2019s population and is ranked third in terms of this indicator, after Tiran\u00eb and Fier (INSTAT 2011).

These facts make the administrative fragmentation and the problems associated with it more visible (MoAFCP 2013). According to statistics for 2013, the population of Elbasan is 292 956.

This ratio has changed only 4 % in the last 10 years which indicates some movement towards the urban areas of the region and main regions of the country and some emigration. Although the population distribution has changed very little, the total population in the past decade has decreased by about 23 %, with residents displaced mostly to urban metropolises and smaller numbers emigrating. 7.3 Socio-economic situation 7.3.1 Economic development Annual income per capita in 2009, according to EUROSTAT statistics for the Elbasan region, was about ALL 287 000 (EUR 2 053 ( 15 )), about 20 % lower than the national average (WB 2012). Meanwhile, the level of poverty in two mountainous districts of the region (Librazhd and Gramsh) is 2 % higher than the national average (MoAFCP 2013). Besides construction and development services, there is a growing trend towards agricultural activity, especially in terms of olive and vegetable cultivation in open fields and greenhouses. About 32 439 farms operate in this region. 15 Exchange rate EUR 1 = ALL 139.38: http://ec.europa.eu/budget/contracts_grants/ info_contracts/inforeuro/inforeuro_en.cfm (accessed 15/06/2014). The average farm family is 4.9 persons, compared with the national average of 4.5 persons (MoAFCP 2013). As for the age structure of family farms, farming families are relatively young, with about 66 % of the population aged from 15 to 54 years. 7.3.2 Analysis of the regional farm typology This part of the study will focus on the assessment and analysis of detailed data that are collected through structured questionnaires on selected farms, according to the methodology described above. This analysis will enable us to draw conclusions on farm characteristics that can serve as a useful tool for evaluating the policies pursued, as well as the design of future policies for agriculture and rural development. A total of 497 face-to-face interviews with farmers were conducted throughout the region. This phase was preceded by piloting the questionnaires and adjusting them in accordance with the problems identified. The number of farms surveyed by district is shown in Table 15, while Table 16 presents the farm typology identified and the number of farms within each typology.

The average number of persons employed on the farm ranges from two to three. Thus, indicator values from one type to another reflect insignificant changes. Similarly, the data show that, according to almost all typologies, one to two family members are engaged in non-agricultural activities. This phenomenon is more evident in areas that are closer to urban markets and where the employment opportunities are greater. This is a clear expression of the farm\u2019s incapacity to fully employ the family workforce in agricultural activities. More detailed information about the structure of the family, as well as persons engaged in farm activities, is presented in Figure 19. 7.3.4 Education level One of the factors of particular importance in terms of the effectiveness of farm activities is the education level of farmers, and in particular the level of their agricultural education. Detailed data on the education level of farmers are presented in Figure 20.

It is clear that the basic level of education predominates in all typologies (Figure 21) This indicator is highlighted in clusters 3, 5 and 6: leisure farms, arable crop farm and self- sufficient farms, respectively, with a value of about 80 %. As for secondary education, it is most predominant among farmers producing fruit trees, at about 58 %, followed by farmers involved in poly-culture, at 38 %, and it is lower among farmers in other clusters. As for farmers with a higher level of education, the proportion is very low (the value of this index ranges from 0 to 2 %). The data show that a link can be established between level of education and the level of specialisation of farms. Farmers with a higher level of education, on average, seem to have a greater motivation to increase specialisation on the farm (i.e. fruit trees, livestock, poly-culture for market) and to improve labour productivity. The analysis of FNI shows that these type of farms (i.e. poly- culture for market, livestock) have the highest FNI among all farm types. Taking this into account, encouraging secondary vocational education in agriculture would seem to be an appropriate strategy to improve the economic performance of agriculture.

E l b a s a n r e g i o n : a g r i c u l t u r a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s 55 7.3.5 Type of farm labour Data collected for the region of Elbasan indicate that, in almost all typologies identified, farms with one or two workers (measured in AWU) predominate (from 38 to 58 % of the total). Farms with over three workforces account for a relatively low proportion of the sample, = less than 10 % of the total. If we analyse the structure of farms in terms of workforce capacity, disregarding their typologies, the results are as shown in Figure 22 below. About half of the farms in the sample have no more than two workforces. However, referring to the high population concentration in rural areas and the farm structure (i.e. small and fragmented area), we can conclude that there is clearly some level of under-employment of the labour force. This becomes more evident in the types of farms where labour is less important, such as on fruit tree farms. Nearly one-third of the family labour supply is fully employed in agriculture (Figure 23). The agricultural systems in the region of Elbasan is based on the co-existence of agricultural and non- agricultural activities. A higher proportion of non-agricultural work may lead to two different farm household strategies: (1) intensification and/or specialisation of agricultural activities (e.g. fruit tree farms) as a possible way of financing investment in agriculture; and (2) reducing farm activities, to be supported mainly by non-farm income (e.g. leisure farms). The main non-agricultural activities are in the construction, trade and service sectors in rural areas (varies from 21 to 40 %).

Figure 24 presents the average farm size in terms of owned and rented areas, as well as number of plots. Referring to indicators of farm size, arable crop farms are the smallest, with an average area of 0.6 ha, while leisure farms and self-sufficient farms have an average area of about 1.5 ha. Figure 24 does not provide us with further information about possible size improvements in the region. The size differences among the farm types are not linked to labour efficiency (e.g. leisure farms are the largest but not the most efficient) and they are still a function of family size. Another indicator that shows the small improvement made in farm size is the almost absent rent-in and rent-out areas. Similarly, the large number of plots for each farm continues to be a barrier to the development of the sector. Among the main reasons for this may be the high cost of renting land, the distance between plots and poor road infrastructure in rural areas. As a consequence, efforts to consolidate land are slow to yield results.

E l b a s a n r e g i o n : a g r i c u l t u r a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s 57 The land structure (Figure 26) among the farm types shows that the specialisation strategy is a result of the fact that it is impossible for farmers to acquire larger areas. So, among the most specialised farm types (fruit trees and livestock) there are more farms of fewer than 5 dyn and fewer farms with an average area of more than 20 dyn. In the cluster poly-culture for market , farms with 5\u201310 and 10\u201320 dyn constitute 72 % of the total farms (each of the two categories counts for 36 %). Up to 70 % of the total value of production is sold into the market. This market- oriented behaviour creates opportunities for farmers to rent and also raises the potential to buy more. In the livestock cluster, large farms of 5\u201310 dyn account for almost half of the total number of farms. The number of farms with an area of 20 dyn is considerably lower. The land structure in this cluster seems to be mainly dedicated to fodder for animals and some cash crops for home consumption. In the leisure farms cluster, large farms, over 20 dyn, have considerable weight compared with the other clusters, accounting for 29 % of the total. Moreover, in the fruit trees cluster, over 53 % of farms are less than 5 dyn, and farms with 10\u201320 dyn and more than 20 dyn of land each account for 5 % of the total farm number. Most fruit tree farms have a limited area of land, and income is generated mainly from fruit tree production, which needs a large amount of initial investment. This may be why areas planted with fruit trees are limited. On the other hand, the large number of family members (five) increases the necessity to have market- based activities instead of fruit trees. In the arable crop farm cluster, farms of up to 10 dyn dominate,with over 86 % of the total farms included in this cluster. Only 14 % of the farms comprise between 10 and 20 dyn of land. Finally, in the self-sufficient cluster, farms with 10\u201320 dyn dominate, and about 45 % of total farms belong to this cluster. However, 34 % of the farms have a size of 5\u201310 dyn, and 15 % have a farm size more than 20 dyn. 7.3.7 Irrigation Despite the significant investments made in the irrigation infrastructure over the last 20 years, the proportion of irrigated area is still limited (16.6 %) (Figure 26). The drive to intensification of production on all types of farm would not be meaningful without an overall support policy (not only water use but also its resources) and without farmers\u2019 ability to see irrigation and draining as a way of increasing their income. Irrigation is particularly important for Elbasan region, as it has a very wet winter and a dry and hot summer; thus, agriculture in the region has particular need of both irrigation and drainage systems. Despite the high irrigation potential, and taking into account the important infrastructure systems constructed during the Communist period, the uptake of irrigation by farmers is not very encouraging.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 58 By comparing the irrigated area according to farm type, it is apparent that livestock farms that breed animals and irrigate count for about 48 % of the total farms falling into this typology. The lowest level of this indicator is for fruit tree farms type owing to the fact that irrigation is not always necessary for fruit trees (especially olives). Self-sufficient farms come after livestock farms, with 20.9 % of farms using irrigation. 7.3.8 Equipment and tool inputs Just as important as irrigation in its impact on farm productivity is the use of agricultural machinery. The data collected indicate a low level of mechanisation. Out of 497 farms surveyed, only eight have their own tractor, and other equipment is almost absent. The highest percentage of farms using machinery turns out to be in cluster 6 (self- sufficient farms). This is in line with the indication that self-sufficient cluster farms deal mainly with arable crops (roughly 80 % of the total agricultural production). In fact, arable cropping, by definition, is the kind of activity that requires more mechanisation. 7.3.9 Farm agricultural production structure Figure 27 shows the farm production structure among farm types. Each cluster is characterised by a large number of agricultural productions. So, in the self-sufficient farm type, the highest contribution of 52.8 % is from cash crops, followed by 28.3 % from vegetables and the remainder (18.9 %) is from by fruit trees. In arable crop farms we find an equal proportion of cash crops and vegetables (46.4 % each) and a small proportion of fruit trees of 7.2 %. Obviously, the highest proportion of fruit trees (84.2 %) is in the fruit tree farms type. The largest proportion in the leisure farms, 78.8 %, is generated by cash crops followed by small proportions of fruit trees (13.7 %) and vegetables (7.5 %). In the livestock cluster we find the greatest proportion of vegetable production among all clusters of 48.7 %, followed by 40.7 % of cash crops and 10.6 % of fruit trees. The last cluster, poly-culture for market, occupies second place for fruit trees with 67.8 %, while 22.3 % is represented by vegetables and 9.9 % by cash crops.

It is very interesting that in the fruit tree farm type we find only poultry and not cows (traditionally in Albania each farm has at least a cow, as is shown in the other farm types). Cattle represent 46.7 % in the self-sufficient farm type, 44 % of arable crop farms, 43.9 % of leisure farms, 37.8 % in the livestock cluster and 41.8 % in the poly-culture cluster. Poultry represents 39.8 % in the self-sufficient cluster, 20 % of arable crop farms, 34.1 % in leisure farms, 25.3 % in the livestock cluster and 56.4 % in the poly-culture cluster. All other livestock types occupy a very small proportion in some of the farm types. Poultry rearing appears to be a compulsory activity on farms for a variety of reasons. Poultry is one of the few sources of animal protein (eggs and meat) for the farm family and also provides a cash income.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 60 Looking at livestock structure from a different point of view, among clusters we see that the livestock cluster represents the majority of farms in all types of production (Figure 29). 40.3 % of poultry is attributable to farms belonging to the livestock cluster, 45.2 % of goats, 40.7 % of sheep and 45.5 % of cattle. Self-sufficient farms also have quite a good presence in terms of livestock structure. These farms are ranked in second place, except for goat production. So, it can be seen that 35.9 % of poultry, 19 % of goats, 28.4 % of sheep and 32.1 % of cattle are attributable to self-sufficient farms. Quite a big proportion of small ruminant production is also seen in the arable crop farm type, represented by goat production (33.3 %), and sheep production (22.2 %). The other farm types have only small amounts of the different types of livestock production. Livestock production value is divided into two main groups: meat and livestock product\u2014milk, eggs and honey. For all farm types the main proportion of the livestock production value is represented by milk, eggs and honey production. The production value of milk, eggs and honey accounts for 57.3 % on self-sufficient farms, 64.4 % on arable crop farms, 64.2 % on leisure farms, 55.4 % on livestock farms and 79.1 % on poly-culture farms (Figure 30). On fruit tree farms, the livestock production value is entirely accounted for by milk, eggs and honey production, which is logical as long as the poultry production (Figure 30) represents 100 % of production structure. Meat is also an important part of livestock production and counts for 42.7 % on self-sufficient farms, 35.6 % on arable crop farms, 35.8 % on leisure farms, 44.6 % on livestock farms and 20.9 % on poly-culture farms.

E l b a s a n r e g i o n : a g r i c u l t u r a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s 61 7.3.11 Income and cost Income structure in the Elbasan region shows the highest proportion of off-farm income in terms of total household income (Figure 31). For all clusters, the off-farm income is higher than the FNI. This means that farming activity is not the main source of income for the household. As a matter of fact, the off-farm income over total household income, varies from 51 % for self-sufficient farms to 81 % for fruit tree farms. So, these types of farm rely more on off- farm employment than on agricultural activities. The main off-farm activities are construction, trade, pensions and remittances. Among the farm types that have the highest non-agricultural incomes (arable crops, fruit trees and leisure farms) we should identify two farming strategies: (1) farms on which the importance of agriculture decreases with time (arable crop farms and leisure farms); and (2) farms that use non- agricultural incomes to improve farm specialisation (fruit trees). In this case the income from non-agricultural activities is used to finance the agricultural activities. Expenditure on seeds accounts for the main proportion in the total expenditure structure of the family farm in Elbasan region. The arable crop farm type has the highest expenditure on seeds (ALL 39 428.9) followed by poly-culture for market and livestock farms. The other three clusters spend less on seeds than the first ones but are still the highest within their cluster. Farm expenditure on buying nitrogen fertilisers is in second place. These expenditures are higher in the livestock cluster, followed by arable crop and poly-culture, which spend the same amount on nitrogen fertiliser. Again, expenditure on nitrogen fertilisers remains in second place even within each cluster. Expenditure on ploughing and other land preparation processes comes third, while, among farm types, the highest expenditure on land preparation appear to be on farms belonging to the arable crop and poly-culture farm types. In fact, the last two farm types deal more with arable crops throughout the year (the value of arable crop/ total agriculture is 71 % and 80 % respectively)\u2014the type of activity that requires more land preparation. Financing farming expenditure is one of the main obstacles of farming systems (Figure 32). Based on the current financial situation, Figure 33 presents quite a pessimistic situation in terms of having access to the credit market. Opportunities for building capacity and making efficient use of farm inputs still remain very low in Elbasan region. Figure 31: Farm net income and off-farm net income and their proportion of the total household income 48.2 48.3 26.2 18.8 25.1 48.9 51.8 51.7 73.8 81.2 74.9 51.1 0.0 10.0 20.0 30.0 40.0 50.0 60.0 70.0 80.0 90.0 100.0 Poly-culture for market Livestock Leisure farms Fruit trees Arable crop farm Self Sufficiency Net agricultural income/farm Net non agricultural income/farm Source: calculations based on the survey.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 62 Figure 33 shows that all the clusters are financing their expenditure mainly through their own sources. Farming families do not have access to micro-credit institutions and banks, while only a few of them use other sources to finance their expenditure. Farms belonging to fruit trees and poly- culture for market farm types finance up to 100 % of their expenditure using their own sources. The livestock cluster is financed almost 100 % through its own sources. The leisure farm cluster shows a somehow different pattern in terms of finance, whereby a little more than 5 % of them use other sources to finance their expenditure. Other sources refer mainly to remittances brought in from family members working abroad. The absence of credit institutions in the farming systems of Elbasan region causes great difficulties for farming families in terms of financing new projects and growing their capacities. The fact that, for all clusters, off-farm activity is the main source of total household income may explain the indifference of farming families to having access to credit. But, on the other hand, low factor productivity, low farming capacity and a low level of market integration may mean that the farming systems of this region are not attractive to credit institutions.

E l b a s a n r e g i o n : a g r i c u l t u r a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s 63 7.4 Analysis of farm economic performance 7.4.1 Farm productivity Productivity is a broad concept but, within this study, by productivity we mean the farm net income (FNI) per annual work unit (AWU), per utilised agricultural area (UAA). By means of these three indicators, we aim to determine the productivity of Elbasan\u2019s agricultural units. Farm net income per annual work unit As shown in Figure 34, Elbasan\u2019s farm types perform differently in terms of FNI/AWU and repaying the workforce. Thus, farms that belong to the clusters poly-culture for market, self-sufficient and livestock are more productive in terms of repaying labour than the other clusters such as leisure, fruit tree and arable crop farms. Analysing the poly-culture for market, it is worth saying that this cluster gives the greatest repayment of labour of all clusters, and this is a consequence of having the highest percentage of sales (69\u201391 % of total production). Furthermore, this cluster includes orchards (57 % of the activities), where the need for labour is not too high, meaning that the level of workforce repayment is relatively higher. With regard to the self-sufficient cluster, it could be argued that this surprising level of performance in terms of FNI/AWU is justified by the fact that this cluster has the highest value of production in terms of field crop activities (ALL 16 093) and a lower value for orchard activities (1 133 ALL) than other farm types. In contrast to the poly-culture, livestock and self-sufficient clusters, the leisure, fruit tree and arable crop farm types are not as productive regarding repayment for labour. The fruit trees cluster has poorer performance in terms of productivity of FNI/AWU, mainly because the investments are made during the non-productive phase, in this way reflecting an inadequate level of repayment for labour compared with other clusters. Farm net income per utilised agricultural area Besides the FNI/AWU, productivity analysis requires considering how effective farms are in utilising their agricultural land area. Figure 35 shows that land use on livestock farms is more productive (FNI/UAA) than on other farm types. The main reasons behind these differences is linked to the limited average UAA surface of this farm types, and the comparatively higher price per unit of production of livestock products compared with crop products. These reasons, and the potential for some types of livestock (mainly ruminants), to use village-owned rangelands that are not included in the farm\u2019s UAA, considerably increase the productivity of the land in terms of FNI. The low productivity in terms of FNI/UAA for leisure and fruit tree farm types may be explained by the fact that these types of farms do not consider agriculture as the main economic activity of the household. The higher proportion of non-agricultural income of these groups (i.e.68.58 % and 73.36 %) support this explanation.

Furthermore, even the farm types that give the highest repayment for labour do not reach even 70 % of the minimum wage. These results demonstrate that the farm structure in Elbasan region does not produce enough income to reach the minimum wage threshold. Some of the obstacles contributing to this situation could be the high cost of agricultural inputs, lack of cooperation, lack of investment, high transaction costs, etc. Figure 35: Farm net income/utilised agricultural area (ALL) 44587 56986 13703 17189 47981 34081 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 60000 Poly-\u00ad\u2010culture for market Livestock Leisure farms Fruit trees Arable crop farm Self Sufficiency Source: calculations based on the survey.

E l b a s a n r e g i o n : a g r i c u l t u r a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s 65 One of the main characteristics of Albanian agriculture is the mutual support of farm incomes by non-farm incomes and vice versa. As the survey data show, agricultural income is only a part of the total household income. That is why our analysis of the poverty level in the region of Elbasan was made taking into consideration both indicators: FNI and THI, which includes both agricultural and non-agricultural household incomes. From Figure 37, we again conclude that the income from agriculture allows household members of poly-culture, livestock and self-sufficient farm types to reach the extreme poverty threshold incomes. In fact, this justifies the importance of agricultural businesses in terms of contributing to welfare and the standard of living in rural areas. In addition, even in terms of productivity (FNI/AWU and FNI/UAA) and minimum wage, these clusters were performing better compared with the other farm types. When we focus on the leisure and fruit tree clusters, we can conclude that agricultural activity is not sufficient to provide farming families with sufficient income to reach the extreme poverty threshold. These farm types cannot exist without an extra agricultural income (construction, trade, remittances from abroad, etc.) and it seems that their future does not have a strong connection with agriculture. The analysis in terms of THI instead of FNI shows for all clusters a clear increase in standard of living. Further improvement in the standard of living is seen for leisure, fruit tree and arable crop farms and, from this point of view, they are perform better than other clusters. This result because these three clusters have the highest off-farm income compared with the other clusters. This demonstrates that off-farm incomes make the most important contribution to farming families\u2019 standard of living. Figure 37 shows that the richest habitants in rural areas are not those that see agriculture as part of their future. The analysis of the complete poverty level gives a very similar picture to that of the extreme poverty level.

Agricultural activity offers only a small income. The analysis of farm structure shows that the process of farm enlargement is still in its early days and that the farm size is not yet proportional to the labour input and or the productivity of the land. The poverty line analysis shows that the more productive farm households in the region are the poorest in terms of both extreme and complete poverty level. Households are heavily supported by non-agricultural incomes (remittances from abroad, retirement pensions, non-agricultural employment and social financial aid), and some of them (self-sufficient and leisure farms) do not consider agriculture as the main economic activity of the household in future.

According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) classification (http://qarkuberat.gov.al/), it is part of the intermediate region, which, besides Berat, includes other regions such as Elbasan, Fier, Vlora and Shkodra. It is important to specify that the intermediate regions account for 45.8 % of the territory and 41.2 % of the whole population in Albania. 8.1 Geographical characteristics The region of Berat has an area of about 1 798 km\u00b2, it is located in the internal part of the country, it has no access to the coast, and it is not bordered by another country (Figure 38). In the northern part, it is bordered by Elbasan, in the west by Fier, in the southern part by Gjirokast\u00ebr region and in the east by Kor\u00e7\u00eb region. The region of Berat is divided into three districts: Berat, Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb and Skrapar. The district of Berat is the centre of the region. The climate in this area is typically Mediterranean, with an average annual temperature of 15.9 \u00b0C. The average temperature of the coldest months is 7.2 \u00b0C and of the hottest month is 28.2 \u00b0C. The average annual precipitation (mainly during the autumn, winter and spring months) is 928 mm (http://qarkuberat.gov.al/) 8.

It has a population of 141 944 inhabitants, of which 64 501 (45.4 %) live in urban areas, while 77 443 (54.6 %) live in rural areas (INSTAT 2011). In recent years, the population has declined by about 27 %. The biggest decrease in population has been in rural areas. The number of inhabitants in the region has declined as a result of rural migration. Rural migration has been an important phenomenon of the last 20 years. Three are the main migratory phenomena: - migratory movements within the region, from mountainous areas in the south-east to the urban areas of Berat, Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb and their surroundings; - migratory movements outside the region, to other regions such as Tiran\u00eb, Durr\u00ebs, Fier and Vlor\u00eb; - emigration abroad\u2014it should be highlighted that a considerable proportion of the population has emigrated abroad, mainly to Greece, Italy, etc. The population of Berat is older than the national average, and the territory is more populated than the national average (Berat region: 141 inhabitants/km 2 ; national average 105 inhabitants/km 2 ) (INSTAT 2011). Furthermore, the majority of the population lives in the lowlands (77 % of population lives in dwellings located at an altitude of less than 300 m). The total land area counts for 93 888 ha, of which 35 324 ha are agricultural land, most of which is distributed in small farms with an average area of 1.5 ha. 8.1.2 Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb district Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb district has a population of 25 600 inhabitants (INSTAT 2011) and 6 736 households. Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb district includes under its administration a municipality, two communes and 18 villages. The capital of the district is Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb, with an area of 85 km 2 . The district possesses 8 410 ha of land, of which 5 500 ha are agricultural, and the average farm size is 1.5 ha. Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb is distinguished for being an area rich in oil and natural gas. Currently, the oil industry remains the main source of income for the population, along with the retail trade, agricultural and livestock processing units and handicrafts (such as bags, shoes and iconography). 8.1.3 Skrapar district Skrapar district consists of two municipalities, eight communes and 103 villages. It has a population of 16 100 inhabitants and 4 236 households. The capital of Skrapar district is \u00c7orovod\u00eb, which is one of the areas with the lowest density of population in the region (45 inhabitants/km 2 ). The district are is 77 495 ha, of which 12 095 ha is agricultural land. The majority of the land is distributed among farms with an average area of 1.3 ha. The district of Skrapar has the lowest average farm size in Berat region. 8.2 Rural and urban infrastructure The region of Berat has a road network of 1 055.2 km (140 km of national roads, 112.6 km of regional roads and 802.6 km of local roads). 32 % of the national roads are tarred. The region is connected to the rest of the country through two national roads, but the roads are in poor shape and greatly increase the cost of transporting agricultural produce. Infrastructure and public services are insufficient throughout the region, especially in the mountainous areas, and this leads directly to many deficiencies in a series of vital sectors (economy, education, health). 8.2.1 Economy, infrastructure and geography Berat region has a total area of 179 793 ha, of which 29.4 % is agricultural land. Most of the landscape is hilly and mountainous. Table 17 gives detailed information about land use in the region of Berat. The region has a forestry area of 53 833 ha (nearly 30 % of the total area). It has been increased year on year as a result of participation in national initiatives and policies to encourage the forestation and reforestation of eroded areas. Meanwhile, meadows and pastures areas account for 17 % of the total area of Berat region. The distribution of these land use types is shown in Figure 39.

It is classified sixth in terms of GDP per capita for 2009, with a GDP of EUR 2 456 per capita/year, which is nearly 10 % less than the average for the country (EUR 2 814 per capita for the region and EUR 3 080 per capita for the country (INSTAT 2011). The closed economy and the weak infrastructure may result in poor productivity in agricultural and industrial activities. The main economic activity (in terms of employment and production) of the region is agriculture owing to the predominance of a rural population employed in farming. Economic activities are concentrated in the central\u2013western part of the region. It is important to point out that, besides agriculture, there is a tendency towards developing other economic sectors, such as a mineral industry, a textile industry (although textiles have a low added value ), a processing industry and tourism. In addition, Berat region has a lower poverty level than the country average; the depth and severity of poverty are lower than the country\u2019s average. However, it is important to mention that around 13 % of region\u2019s population is considered as poor (less than USD 2/day/inhabitant, according to (INSTAT 2011)). Table 18 presents poverty indicators for Berat region and Albania. 8.3 Agricultural development of the region Agriculture accounts for 32 % of regional GDP and has much greater importance compared with agriculture at the country level, which accounts for 18 % (INSTAT 2011). This region is rich in agricultural resources, and has a long tradition of agricultural production. The soil structure favours the development of farming activities, especially vegetables, olives and fruit trees. Berat is well known for its production of olives, figs, grapes, vines, fruits and vegetables, as well as herbs and spices. 8.3.1 Farms and production capacities After land privatisation (Law No 7501, 19 July 1991), growth of the agriculture sector in Berat region was quite slow, owing to the limited area per farm, the high level of fragmentation and the small plot size. Figure 41 presents the average farm size for each district of Berat region and their proportions.

This situation is in line with the average farm size on a national level, which does not exceed 1.4 ha. In Skrapar district the number of farms with less than 0.5 ha is lower than in other districts. Among districts, the level of development of the farming sector varies. Plains have differences in population in terms of economic well-being compared with mountainous areas (highlands). Mountainous areas are characterised by a larger number of farms of a size of less than 0.5 ha. 8.3.2 Farms and development of agricultural activities In Berat region, almost all kinds of plants typical of Albania can be grown and all types of livestock typical of Albania can be raised (cattle, sheep, goats, poultry, pigs, bees, etc.). The main agricultural productions of the region (in value) are cereals, vegetables (especially those grown under cover), forage, industrial plants (sunflower, etc.), permanent crops (fruit, citrus, olives) and livestock. Table 19 provides detailed information on agricultural production in 2012.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 72 The arable crop production value accounts for the highest revenue of the sector, with 42.7 % of the total, followed by livestock and orchards. Within arable crop production, vegetables contribute the highest level of income (40.6 %), followed by forage crops. Meanwhile, crops represent about 27 % of its revenue, while industrial plants are ranked at the bottom. Greenhouse vegetable production is particularly important in Berat and Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb districts. There has been an upwards trend in the construction of greenhouses over the last 10 years. Over this period, greenhouse cultivated areas increased three-fold (MoAFCP 2013). The districts of Berat and Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb, which are mainly located in lowland areas, are particularly affected by this trend. More fertile soils and proximity to the main markets (Lushnj\u00eb, Durr\u00ebs, Tiran\u00eb and Fier) serve as an incentive to increase the area of protected crops. Cereal production has increased considerably over the last 10 years, mainly as a result of improvements in yields (from 3.03 t/ha in 2001 to 4.39 t/ha in 2011), by nearly 45 %. Cereal production is mainly used for animal feeding. Livestock is the second most important agricultural activity (in terms of value of production) in the region. Within the total value of livestock production, meat production accounts for 46.8 %, milk production for 40.7 % and egg production for 10.2 %. The income from farming activities is mostly generated by rearing cattle, small ruminants (sheep and goats), pigs and poultry. Small ruminant livestock rearing is located mainly in hilly and mountainous areas, whereas cattle herds are concentrated mostly in the lowland areas of Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb and Berat. Most meat production is sold at the regional markets or is processed by three meat-processing units. Milk production is dominated by cow\u2019s milk, at 79 % (goat\u2019s milk accounts for 11 % and ewe\u2019s milk accounts for 10 %). The establishment of some agricultural processing units has boosted both the cultivated area and agricultural production. Berat has a long tradition of permanent crop production, and it is known for some native varieties of olives and figs. Over the last 8 years (2004\u20132012), area of the fruit trees has increased by 50 %, the area of vineyards has doubled and the area down to olive trees by nearly 20 %. 8.3.3 Family structure The number of questionnaires returned in each district of Berat region (276 questionnaires) was 169 for Berat, 58 for Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb and 49 for Skrapar. The results of the survey show that the family farm in Berat region is composed on average of four to five people and the employment rate is in line with the national level. Family structure in the Berat region appears to be much the same among clusters. When it comes to the number of people of working age, the overall picture varies from a minimum of 4.0 on the self-sufficient farm type to a maximum of 4.6 on arable crop farm types. Members of family farms working on the farm vary from 3.1 on the poly-culture for market farms type to a minimum of 2.3 on leisure farms. Poly-culture farms are more labour intensive than other clusters in Berat region. The overall situation shown in Figure 42 demonstrates that the family farm is relatively densely populated and that the available labour is divided between agricultural and non-agricultural employment. 1It seems that on-farm activities do not offer the potential for increasing the level of employment. This is the reason why household members of working age have to look for other employment possibilities.

B e r a t r e g i o n : a g r i c u l t u r a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s 73 8.3.4 Farm structure The average farm size for Berat region is about 1.4 ha, with the distribution among the clusters as shown in Figure 43. According to survey, the data show that farms belonging to the specialist fruit tree farm type are the largest (almost 16.3 dyn), followed by the arable crops for market with around 16.1 dyn, poly-culture for market with 15.4 dyn, and so on. Leisure farms are the smallest, at 9.8 dyn/farm. The limited average farm size and the number of plots by farm type is one of the main issues of Berat\u2019s agricultural sector. The level of fragmentation, which is important, is present in all farm types in the region. The arable crops for market farm type is the more fragmented one, at 16.1 dyn/ farm and 4.6 plots/farm. More information on farm size intervals according to clusters (less than 5 dyn , 5\u201310 dyn , 10\u201320 dyn and larger than 20 dyn ) is presented in Figure 44. The figure above shows a large range of average farm size among the different farm types, from 0.98 ha to 1.63 ha. On the other hand, average farm fragmentation level is quite high, from 2.9 to 4.6 plots per farm. The difference in the average farm size seen in poly-culture for market, arable crop for market and specialised fruit tree farms compared with the other types indicates increased opportunities for these types to expand and grow. In this framework, farm specialisation and intensification of agricultural techniques is one of the few strategies available to increase agricultural production in the region.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 74 8.3.5 Irrigation Irrigation continues to be one of the main factors that significantly affects the effectiveness and sustainability of agricultural production in the region. Agriculture requires both drainage in the winter and irrigation in the summer. The irrigation facilities in Berat are still poor. Farmers irrigate on average from 36 % of their area on livestock farms to 6 % of the area on self- sufficient farms (see Figure 45). The diagram above provides a clear picture of the percentage irrigation for each cluster. As can be seen, farms in the livestock cluster account for the largest irrigated area. It may seem like a paradox, but there is an explanation for this situation. Many farms are located in the lowland areas, where irrigation facilities are more accessible to farmers. The majority of animal feed, especially for cattle breeding is produced on the farms and irrigation has the potential to increase the proportion of feed produced on the farms. The large proportion of fodder plants cultivated by these farms supports this strategy. Figure 45: Use of irrigation according to cluster (%) Poly culture for market 18% Self -\u00ad\u2010sufficiency 6% Livestock 36% Fruit trees diversifies farms 16% Leisure farms 11% Arable crops market 13% Specialise fruit trees 0% Source: calculations based on the survey.

In a sample size of 271 farmers, the number of tractors available was 14 (0.05 tractors per farm). The tractors are not equipped with other agricultural machines necessary for land preparation, as they number only 14. The tractors are equipped with milling machines but not all of them with a plough. This indicates that ploughing is done not only by tractors. Consequently, it can be concluded that the provision of machinery in the region of Berat is inadequate. The above conclusion is supported by the fact that fruit tree diversified farms turns out to be the best equipped in terms of machinery (50 % of the total tractors). The use of machinery leaves a lot to be desired, and part of the farm work continues to be done by manpower and animals.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 76 8.3.7 Extra-farm activities Non-farm incomes remain an important source of income for rural households in Berat region. Non-agricultural incomes among the farm types are presented in Figure 46 and prove to be quite interesting. Farm households in the region follow a strategy of specialisation, some of them in agriculture (i.e. poly-culture for market, self-sufficient livestock and specialist fruit trees) and others in non-farm activities within or outside the rural area (leisure farms and arable crops for market). Fruit trees diversified falls in between these two strategies: the household has important non-agricultural incomes, and the investments in agriculture (financed mainly by non-agricultural incomes) reveal the aim of agricultural specialisation. Following the above analysis, it is worth focusing on the structure of non-agricultural incomes. The data analysis indicates that income from a pension is the most frequent source of extra-agriculture income for the majority of farms in all clusters in Berat region, ranging from 25 % for leisure farms up to 76.9 % for livestock farms. In second place are remittances from abroad registered in five clusters out of seven (not present in self-sufficient and specialised fruit tree farms). The proportion of income ranges from 16.7 % in poly-culture for market up to 47.1 % in arable crops for market farm types. Off-farm work in the public sector makes a considerable contribution to the off-farm income structure in the poly-culture for market cluster, fruit trees diversified and arable crops for market farm types, ranging from 12.5 % up to 25 %. Other alternatives to off-farm activities make a minor contribution to the structure of extra income for all farm types. The results of the study show that of farm family members working off the farm, 3.2 % of them work in agricultural activities outside their farm, 11 % in trade, 10.5 % in construction, 23 % in the public sector, 41.6 % are retired and 31.6 % have emigrated. The above situation in terms of employment is the reality for the Albanian rural population. This duality of employment shows the lack of capacity of the agriculture sector to absorb the labour supply in rural areas. This means that the number of people living in rural areas declines and there is the potential for an improvement in the productivity of labour.

        "8 . B e r a t r e g i o n : a g r i c u l t u r a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s 77 8.3.8 Crop production Crop production is the main agricultural activity for all cluster farms in the Berat region, except for livestock farms, in terms of the proportion of total agricultural production. There is a predominance of farms that cultivate arable crops in all clusters. The percentage of farms cultivating arable crops ranges from 29.4 % for fruit farms diversified up to 55.8 % for leisure farms. The highest percentage of farms growing arable crops being in the leisure farms cluster is in line with the fact that around 82 % of the value of agricultural production in this cluster comes from arable crops. Again, arable crops require less labour compared with other agricultural activities such as vegetables both in the open field and under cover, and fruit tree and leisure farms have the highest number of farms with less than one worker equivalent (compared with other clusters). Alongside arable crops, fruit trees are the other main activity of farms in all clusters. It seems that these two activities dominate in Berat region. The percentage of farms cultivating fruit trees ranges from 14.3 % for livestock farms up to 56 % for specialised fruit tree farms. Despite two fruit tree farm types demonstrating a high percentage of farms with fruit trees, self-sufficient and poly-culture for market farms also appear to be actively involved in fruit tree activities (40.9 %) within their cluster. Open field vegetable production dominates over greenhouse vegetable production in terms of farms dealing with these activities. Livestock farms, alongside arable crop farms, are dealing also with open field vegetable production (31.6 % of them), and are followed by leisure farms (23.3 %). Regarding greenhouse vegetable production, only the poly- culture for market cluster shows a noticeable percentage of farms dealing with that activity (10.25 %). The percentage of farms producing vegetables under shelter in other clusters appears to be very low or even zero (Figure 47). Regarding sales, the percentage of farms that sell produce in each cluster does not differ too much from the percentage of farms dealing with the aforementioned agricultural activities. Around 30 % of poly-culture for market farms sell in the markets, and almost all farms producing fruit trees and greenhouse vegetables are market oriented. In the self-sufficient cluster around 28 % of farms producing arable crops sell in the markets, while only half of farms producing open field vegetables and fruit trees sell in the markets. The picture is the same for livestock farms as in the self-sufficiency cluster in terms of the percentage of farms that sell for each group of crops. In the fruit trees diversified cluster the percentage of farms that sell versus farms that grow each group of crops varies from nearly 40 % (arable crop farms) up to 50 % (greenhouse-grown vegetable farms). For the remaining clusters, the percentage of farms that sells, considering each group of crops, is around 40 %, with the exception of farms growing open field vegetables within the leisure farms and arable crops for market clusters (23 % and 14 % of them, respectively, sell on the market). The structure of sales shows the importance of fruit trees in the region (Figure 48). The revenue from these products is the main source of income for each farm type in the region. The importance of fruit sales is particularly high in the poly- culture for market, fruit trees diversified and specialist fruit tree farm types. The abovementioned farms types are those that have the highest average sales incomes from crop cultivation. The relatively high proportion of crop sales from leisure farms is mainly because the majority of farm production is sold (77 % of agricultural production in value) and not for home consumption. On the other hand, the relatively higher proportion of home consumption (80 % of the agriculture production in value) in the other farm types can justify the limited sales.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 78 8.3.9 Livestock production Livestock production is less important in the region of Berat. Only one farm type (livestock) has a higher livestock production value than its agricultural production value (Figure 49) The geography (mainly lowland) and limited agricultural land have shaped farm strategies in this region. Livestock production in terms of value in the region of Berat is dominated by milk, eggs and honey for all farm types (Figure 49). Mixed livestock breeding (meat and milk) is a characteristic of the Albanian livestock sector and is not particular to the region of Berat. The limited land area and the abundant workforce in rural areas means that farms favour a mixed breeding strategy for nearly all types of livestock. On the other hand, livestock products (milk and eggs) are important sources of protein for rural households and provide a regular cash income for the household. Animal production within farm types in Berat region is quite diversified. Almost every cluster keeps all types of stock. Poultry is most widely kept type of livestock within farm types (ranging from 34.1 % for livestock farms up to 68.8 % for leisure farms). The picture for leisure farms is in line with the value that meat from poultry adds to the total value produced from livestock activities. Cattle breeding in Berat region seems to be the main livestock activity only for the poly-culture for market farm type, where about half of the farms have cattle. Farms that keep goats and sheep account for a relatively low percentage within each farm type compared with cattle, poultry and other animals. Figure 50 shows that there is no clear specialisation in livestock activity in the region of Berat. The strategy followed by farms aims to reduce the risk by diversification. The main livestock type present on many farm types\u2014poultry \u2013 is farmed mainly for household and home consumption in an extensive way.

Farms selling milk are represented in all farm types except leisure farms. Almost all farms breed milking animals (cattle, sheep and goats) and sell milk onto the market. Furthermore, most farms (with minor differences) in each farm type keep all three types of livestock\u2014cattle, sheep and goats. The highest proportion of farms selling milk is in the self- sufficient, livestock and arable crop farm types, more than 80 % of farms altogether. The lowest proportion appears to be in the specialised fruit trees farm type. There is an important discrepancy between the proportion of farms selling a certain type of milk and the income earned by the sales. Figure 51 presents the income from sales of each milk type (above) and the proportion of farms selling different milk types (within each farm type\u2014below). The second graph clearly shows that the majority of farms in each farm type sell cow\u2019s milk, but the income they earn is not proportional to the amount, compared with ewe\u2019s and goat\u2019s milk. From these two graphs, we can deduct that sheep and goat breeding activities are much more intensive and market oriented than keeping cows for milk. There are several explanation for this: firstly, a significant proportion of cow\u2019s milk is used for household consumption, whereas ewe\u2019s and goat\u2019s milk is mainly sold for cheese making; secondly, cattle farming is limited to small farm structures, whereas sheep and goat flocks use communal rangelands located in hilly and mountainous areas; and, thirdly, the hill and mountain farmers in Albania are specialists in sheep and goat breeding.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 80 It is clear that the main objective of animal production is not meat but milk, and therefore the proportion of sales for milk is much higher. Sheep and goat rearing is mainly for milk production, and this is very significant for the four clusters. It can be seen that the greatest quantity of milk sold is from sheep (70\u201389 %) and goats (50\u201393 %). Figure 52 below presents the number of farms selling meat within each cluster expressed as a percentage. The poly- culture for market type has the highest percentage of farms that breed animals for meat purposes. However, farms breeding cattle for meat are the highest percentage within each farm type, varying from 44 % to 87 %. On the other hand, 100 % of leisure farms produce and sell goat meat. What distinguishes the diversified meat production farms is the presence of farms within each classification that breed cattle, sheep and goats for meat. Arable crops for market farms are not shown in the graph because there are no farms in this farm type that sell meat on the market. So, they produce meat for home consumption.

For all farm types, the off-farm income is higher than the farm income. Therefore, farming activities (agricultural and livestock) and their contribution to THI comes second. The first three farm types, poly-culture for market, self-sufficient and livestock farms have almost equal proportions of farm and off-farm income in terms of THI. These three types of farm rely more than the other types on market-based agricultural activities. For the next four types of farm, the off-farm income is almost twice that of farm income for specialised fruit tree farms and is more than five times farm income for leisure farms (86.5 % vs 13.5 %). The main off-farm activities involve construction, trade, pensions and remittances from abroad, the same as in the other regions in this study.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 82 Expenditure on seeds accounts for the main proportion of total expenditure of the family farm in Berat region, with the exception of specialised fruit tree farms. Meanwhile, the poly-culture for market farm group has the highest expenditure on seeds, followed by the fruit trees diversified group. These higher expenditures on seeds are a consequence of the diversified production structure of those farms. The remaining farm types spend less on seeds than the previous farm types. Expenditure on nitrogen fertilisers appear to be in second place in terms of nominal values for all farm types except for the specialised fruit trees group, where these expenditures are in first place. Expenditure on ploughing is less than expenditure on seed and nitrogen fertilisers for all farm types in the Berat region. Considering all farm types, the differences in expenditure on nitrogen fertiliser and ploughing are minor, whereas these differences are bigger when it comes to expenditure on seed. So, the basic and necessary agricultural practices (ploughing and fertilisers) have almost equal costs, whereas the prices of seed explains its higher cost. The level of farm inputs is undoubtedly connected with having the necessary resources to finance them. To investigate this, information was requested on four potential sources of finance (from own (personal) sources, bank loans, micro- finance funding and from other sources). The results of the study showed that own sources represent over 95 %, while other sources make a minor contribution to financing farm expenditure. The absence of credit institutions (banks and micro-credit institutions) to finance farming systems in the Berat region shows the great difficulties that farming families are faced with when trying to finance new initiatives. The fact that, for all farm types, off-farm activity is the main source of THI might explain the reluctance of farming families to approach the credit institutions. Besides this, the low level of market integration may make the farming system in this region unattractive to credit institutions. Self-financing possibilities are very limited, taking into consideration the structure of household expenditure, and are shown in Figure 54. As can be seen, almost 65 % of family income goes on household spending. Considering that personal or self- financing sources represent over 95 % of all expenses, an improvement in agricultural performance will need an increase in agricultural expenditure that cannot be provided only by the household.

B e r a t r e g i o n : a g r i c u l t u r a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s 83 8.4 Analysis of farm economic performance: Berat region The income structure in Berat region si quite inequal. Rural household make up from agricultural activates from 16 up to 90% of their incomes (Table 21). It can be identified clearly two group of farm types those: i) farms type with a clear agricultural objective (poly culture for market, self- sufficient, livestock, specialist fruit trees), and ii) farms with diversified activities where agriculture is one of the activities and not necessarily the most important one. Farms in Berat region continue to be over-populated in terms of both household members and workforce. The main characteristic of the farms in this region is the domination of family labour. About 90 % of the farms satisfy their labour needs from family members. The small farm size offers little opportunity for full-time employment. 8.4.1 Farm productivity Farm net income per annual work unit As can be seen in Figure 55, the clusters of poly-culture for market, fruit trees diversified, arable crops for market and livestock farms are better performing in terms of FNI/AWU than the other clusters. Labour productivity is higher in these clusters, because it is known that one of the advantages of production diversification and livestock production is the full usage of labour. As can be seen, in Albanian agriculture, farms that are diversified are better performing than specialised farms in terms of FNI/AWU. Labour productivity is lower in self-sufficient and specialised clusters. Regarding self-sufficient farms, as a result of their main purpose of producing mainly for home consumption, they can justify their poor performance in terms of FNI/AWU. This is because these farms are not much interested in being economically effective in terms of FNI/AWU but more so in providing food for the family household. Concerning specialised farms, such as specialist fruit trees, with regard to investment they are not yet effective because of the production cycle of fruit trees. A single activity should be more profitable to justify unused labour and production resources during certain periods of the year.

This is because vegetables and livestock products have high added value. Land productivity is lower on subsistence farms, leisure farms and specialised fruit farms. Poly-culture for market and livestock farms will need financial support from government in the future in Berat region. It is a known fact that on part-time farms (leisure farms), farm income does not constitute the main source of income for the family. The low level of income on specialised fruit farms has is because in new orchards production is low in the early years of their economic life.

B e r a t r e g i o n : a g r i c u l t u r a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s 85 8.4.2 Farm viability Farm net income/annual work unit (AWU) compared with minimum wage: AWU repayment The effectiveness of the agricultural labour force in Berat region is very low. Work in agriculture is paid less than the minimum wage for all farm types (Figure 57). Only for poly-culture for market farms is labour paid nearly 94 % of the minimum wage. On livestock and arable crops for market farms, work is paid at 75 % of the minimum wage. The other farm types pay agricultural work at from half to two-thirds of the minimum wage. The limited repayment for labour, as well as the abundant workforce in the rural areas, lead us to the conclusion that the rural areas in Berat will be an important source of migration of the workforce to urban areas in the future. Farm net income/total household income per household member and extreme poverty Agricultural activity in the region of Berat manages to provide incomes above the extreme poverty threshold. The only exception is the specialist fruit tree farms, where the income level is low owing to the low productivity of fruit trees in the first years after planting. Analysis of the extreme poverty threshold allows us to draw similar conclusions as those drawn for the region of Elbasan. Firstly, the farm types that try to maintain and develop agricultural activity on farms are among the poorest in terms of THI by household member. It seems that the less the farm type contributes to agricultural development, the richer the household members are (leisure farms). Secondly, the high level of self-funding of agricultural investments has a direct impact on the household poverty level (specialist fruit trees). Thirdly, it seems that the poly-culture farms perform better than those trying to specialise in one crop. FNI/THI per household member in complete (full) poverty Regarding the standard of living of household members, in terms of complete poverty, with regard to the FNI, we can say that household members of farm types such as poly- culture for market, livestock, fruit trees and arable crops for market are living above the complete poverty level. In contrast, the household members of farm types such as self-sufficient, leisure and specialised fruit trees are living below the complete poverty level.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 86 8.5 Conclusions The economic performance of agricultural units in Berat region, in terms of productivity and viability, still does not justify their importance. Hence, as has been argued, some farms were repaying the workforce but not making most efficient use of their agricultural land. For example, clusters such as leisure and specialised fruit trees have a lower agricultural viability indicator (extreme and complete poverty) compared with other clusters. Furthermore, considering the viability of agricultural units in Berat region, except for the poly-culture for market and livestock clusters, all other clusters do not make a significant contribution to the standard of living of the household members. Therefore, when FNI per household member is analysed in terms of extreme poverty, its role is not significant in all clusters, with the exception of the poly- culture and livestock clusters because the coefficients are close to 1 (the line of extreme poverty). Considering the role of THI in terms of extreme poverty, all farm clusters make a significant contribution to the standard of living of household members. This means that the THI remains a very important source of income for farm household members in Berat region. Furthermore, even in terms of complete poverty, the role of THI remains significant for farm household members in Berat region. Poly-culture in agriculture can have several positive effects, but it is not likely to be a long-term strategy for agricultural development due to the low level of specialisation of this strategy. The development of livestock, particularly cattle and small ruminants, should be considered and evaluated as a long-term strategy for agriculture development in Berat region.

The total area of the region is 1 620 km 2 . Total population is 134 027 inhabitants, with an urban population of 72 131 (53.8 %) inhabitants and a rural population is of 61 896 (46.2 %) inhabitants. The average household is 4.13 persons. The population density is 139.94 inhabitants/km 2 (http://www.qarkulezhe.gov.al/index.php) The region of Lezh\u00eb is bordered by the region of Shkod\u00ebr in the north, Kuk\u00ebs in the east, Dibra in the south-east and partly in the east and Durr\u00ebsi in the south. Lezh\u00eb region is also bordered in the west by the Adriatic sea. The districts of the region have good access to the main national roads of the country, while the rural areas, especially the mountainous ones, have limited access to the road infrastructure. Lezh\u00eb district is the most important administrative unit (economically and geographically) of the region and serves as the administrative centre of the region. It has an area of 479 km\u00b2. The population is 77 184 and represents approximately 48.6 % of the region\u2019s population. Lezh\u00eb district has one municipality (Lezh\u00eb) and nine communes (Balldre, Blinisht, Daj\u00e7, Kallmet, Kolsh, Sh\u00ebngjin, Sh\u00ebnkoll, Ungrej and Zejmen)( http://www.qarkulezhe.gov.al/index.ph) Mirdit\u00eb district consists of two municipalities (municipality of Rreshen and Rubik) and five communes (Fan, Ka\u00e7inar, Kthell\u00eb, Oros and Selit\u00eb). It has a population of 26 668 and an area of 867 km\u00b2, thus representing approximately 53.5 % of the total area of the county. Kurbin district consists of two municipalities (La\u00e7 and Mamurras) and two communes (Milot and Fushekuq). The district population is 54 977 and has an area of 273 km\u00b2.

The area of forest in this region is among the largest in the country with an area of 2 510 ha, while that of pastures and meadows is 34 258 ha. The irrigated area is 5 382 ha, or 55 % of irrigation feasibility, and only 30 % of the potential irrigated area (http://www.qarkulezhe.gov.al/index.php) 9.2.2 Natural resources Lezh\u00eb region is rich in natural and water resources. It is traversed by some of the country\u2019s main rivers such as the Drin, Gjadri, Fan and Urak\u00eb. There are throughout the territory about 15 reservoirs, representing a very good water supply for irrigation purposes. River valleys that cross the region create good opportunities for the development of agriculture and commercial areas along their banks. As highlighted above, the region has a significant coastline bordering the Adriatic sea, thus creating opportunities for the development of aquaculture, exploitation of water resources and tourism activities, as well as for the rapid development of the business and tourism sector in general. 9.3 Population Relatively low accessibility, moderate urbanisation, location of settlements at high altitudes and on steep slopes, relatively high fragmentation of settlements, poor access to services and low environmental pollution are some of the major characteristics of Lezh\u00eb region. It is dominated by moderate economic development, and has relatively large structural problems. It is characterised by weak overall economic performance and a stable population (Figure 60). The population of the region has decreased and the proportion of the urban population has increased over the last decade in Lezh\u00eb region. This proportion was 31 % in 2001, showing that the population was very concentrated in rural areas, and had increased up to 57 % by 2013. These figures show a considerable demographic shift towards urban areas and developed markets and greater employment opportunities and changes in lifestyle. The statistics also show a decline in the total number of region\u2019s population over the last 10 years by about 16 %. These indicators make this region one of the most exposed to demographic change on a national level. Figure 60: Population trend: years 2001\u20132013 Source: (INSTAT 2014). ",

From the economic development point of view, there is a growing trend towards more and more engagement in the tourism sector. This is seen mainly in Lezh\u00eb and Kurbin districts. In the agriculture sector there are nearly 27 607 farms, while the number of farm families is 55 947 (more than two families per farm). The structure of farms by region is presented in Figure 61. The number of farms in the region of Lezh\u00eb is noticeably higher than in the other two regions, regardless of the fact that Mirdit\u00eb district is almost twice as big as Lezh\u00eb district. The number of families living on the same farm is higher than in the other regions (2.3 families per farm). This indicator is significantly higher than the than the national average. 9.5 Analysis of the regional farm typology The whole analysis of Lezh\u00eb farm typology is based on the information gathered by the survey run in 2013. Table 22 below presents the number of farms surveyed per district. The farm typology of Lezh\u00eb region highlights the main aspects of the farm according to the farm types identified. A detailed description of the family structure, the farm structure, crop production, livestock production and income and cost of production is presented below. The indicator family structure presents average number of people living on the farm, average number of people working on the farm, those who are working in off-farm activities and their levels of education. Farm structure is one of the main indicators of farming systems analysis in the region of Lezh\u00eb. The analysis concerns land structure, the average number of plots comprising a farm, and the average irrigated land area, as well as the characteristics of agricultural markets in the region. Crop production details \u2013 arable crops, vegetables, greenhouses and fruit trees \u2013 their main aspects and characteristics are also highlighted. The same applied to livestock production: the structure of livestock farming \u2013 cattle, sheep, pig and goat production\u2014and their main characteristics comprise the main body of this section. The last part of the analysis deals with income and the cost of farming activities. A number of indicators are discussed such as average household income, average FNI, and percentage of farming activities (crop and livestock production) in the income structure. The costs of production related to agricultural activities and their main aspects are also measured and discussed. Finally, the productivity of production factors is calculated.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 90 9.5.1 Family structure Family structure in Lezh\u00eb region appears to be similar among clusters, except for the last one (poly-culture for market) in terms of the number of people living on the farm. When it comes to the number of people of working age, the overall picture varies from a minimum of 3.7 on livestock farms to 4.4 on vegetable for market farms. There are minor differences among clusters in terms of members of family farms working on the farm. So, self-sufficient and leisure farms and farms producing vegetables for market have on average 2.1, 2 and 1.9 members working on the farm, respectively, with livestock and vegetables for market farms having the highest average number. In the case of Lezh\u00eb, these are the clusters typically oriented to market, thus the labour input is more intensive than that for other farm types. Indeed vegetable production and livestock production is more labour intensive compared with other farm types. The overall picture shown in Figure 62 demonstrates that the farm family is relatively highly populated but the number of people who are engaged in agricultural activities is relatively low. The analysis of the proportion in agricultural employment shows that the differences among the farm types are limited and do not fully justify the expected differences in agricultural output/AWU. The difference in the proportion in agricultural employment between the most agricultural farm type (livestock) and the least agricultural farm type (leisure farms) is only 13 %. This means that there is not a choice between the agricultural employment and non-agricultural employment; on the contrary, agriculture offers work to those who do not have the option of finding better employment. Level of education is an indicator that, when used appropriately, can explain the behaviour of the farmer (head of farm). In this study it was thought to be important to have a snapshot of the farming system regarding level of education. As it turns out, the picture looks to be almost the same as it is in the other regions. There is a predominance of farmers with elementary school education in almost all clusters (Figure 63). The livestock cluster has the highest preponderance, with 52 farms belonging to this cluster, followed by self-sufficient and poly-culture for market farms, with 43 and 23 farms, respectively. Farmers with high-school education are found more frequently in the livestock farm type followed by self-sufficient and poly-culture for market farms. Farmers with a university degree, although very low in number, are found in four clusters, with the exception of leisure farms. Regardless of level of agricultural education, again livestock farms encompass the greatest numbers of farmers.

L e z h \u00eb r e g i o n : a g r i c u l t u r a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s 91 The analysis of the proportion of farmers with agricultural education shows that there are no differences among the farm types. In each farm type at least 15 % of the farmers have an agricultural education. The self-sufficient group has the highest proportion of farmers with agricultural education (nearly 30 %). It is difficult draw conclusions regarding whether or not an agricultural education helps the farmer to diversify and adopt risk reduction strategies. The education system in rural areas during the collective period was based mainly on vocational high schools (agriculture), and for the majority of farmers that was the only possible education. The labour force is distributed quite unevenly among clusters in the Lezh\u00eb region (Figure 64). For three clusters, self-sufficient, livestock and poly-culture for market, most of the farms have less than the equivalent of one worker. The first two clusters have a large number of farms with two workers, whereas vegetables for market has an equal number of farms with two and three workers, and there are only a few farms with more than three workers. It seems that farmers of this farm type have selected this cropping pattern owing to the availability of a lot of labour on the farm. Among all farms types, only a few farms have more than three workers.

The time spent working on the farm represents the intensity of labour usage. On the other hand, off-farm activity is again an indicator that can help us to understand the importance of farming activity versus off- farm activity. At least one-third of the farm workforce for each farm type works in off-farm activities (Figure 65). This proportion is higher for leisure and poly-culture for market farm types, where more than one household workforce out of two works outside agriculture. The figures, which show the same trend as in the other regions of the country, highlight the main conclusion that the household farming system in rural areas has to adopt a strategy of double employment and that the farm does not provide enough work for the household members. From the relatively slow process of farm consolidation and improvements in size, we can conclude that the workforce distribution between agriculture and non-farming activities will be present in rural areas in Lezh\u00eb region and in general in Albania for a long time. Full employment in agriculture is less important (from 7 % to 32 % of the farm type workforce), and it is not a surprise that farmers that sell more agricultural produce employ a bigger workforce. 9.5.2 Farm structure Table 23 shows the data gathered from questionnaires in regard to farm structure. This section deals with land issues: the distribution of land, its quality (irrigated, not irrigated), the fragmentation level (average number of plots), and, finally, cropping structure and market access.

        "9 . L e z h \u00eb r e g i o n : a g r i c u l t u r a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s 93 Farms belonging to the leisure farms cluster own the lowest average area of land, followed by the farms in the self- sufficiency and vegetables for market clusters. Farms in the other two clusters own nearly the same average area of land. The average irrigated area appears to be very low among all clusters, with exception of the self-sufficiency cluster, in which 77 % of area is irrigated. This again underlines the intensity of land use by farms in this cluster, as the land is utilised almost year round by a succession of different crops. These farms also have a better distribution of family labour throughout the year for the same reason: many types of crops and livestock create a stable demand for labour. The average plot numbers represent a high level of farm fragmentation in Lezh\u00eb region, but this is true for the other regions in this study. Considering the average distance of the farm from market, and of the farm plots from the central plot (containing the house and outbuildings), the high level of fragmentation reduces the efficiency of agricultural work. The ratio of produce sold to total production is quite an interesting indicator. Vegetables for market and poly- culture for market farm types have greater access to markets compared with the other clusters. 60 % and 48 %, respectively, of their produce is sold in markets, whereas sold produce for the other clusters is less important. It seems that market participation is not related to the distance of plots from the market. Farm types that are located far away from market sell a higher proportion of their produce than those that are located close to markets. There can be two main reasons for this: (1) all farm types are relatively close to markets and the differences among several farm types are not important; and (2) in Albania market participation is not only a function of the distance to market but also of the quality of the road infrastructure, which can be a crucial factor in market participation. Relatively low use of markets for self-sufficient farms, livestock and, particularly, leisure farms indicates only small quantities of produce available to sell owing to limited availability of inputs, higher transport cost for these farms, and a significant proportion of produce for home consumption. Renting activity (land rented in and out) is not widespread among farms in all clusters. Leisure farms, as they are mostly focused in off-farm activities, rent out on average 1.3 dyn of land per farm. Poly-culture for market, vegetables for market and livestock farms engage in a little land renting activity in descending order, whereas self-sufficient farms do not rent land at all. The land structure in Lezh\u00eb region shows in general the same pattern as other regions (Elbasan and Berat). The land area is distributed unequally between farms within clusters and among clusters. The livestock and poly-culture for market clusters have the highest number of farms with an area between 10 and 20 dyn (Figure 66). Within each farm type the picture is quite diverse. Most farms in the self-sufficient cluster have less than 5 dyn, followed by farms with 10\u201320 dyn, then by farms with 5\u201310 dyn and lastly by farms with more than 20 dyn. The livestock cluster has a different pattern in this regard. Most of the farms have 10\u201320 dyn, and these are followed by those with 5\u201310 dyn, and, finally, the lowest number of farms have less than 5 and more than 20 dyn.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 94 The poly-culture for market cluster follows the same pattern as the livestock cluster. The difference is in the number of farms, which in the case of poly-culture farms is lower. Meanwhile, two other farm types, vegetables for market and leisure farms, have a predominance of farms with less than 5 dyn of land, fewer farms with 5\u201310 and 10\u201320 dyn of land, and only few of them (in the case of vegetables for market) with more than 20 dyn. In conclusion, land distribution among clusters and within clusters is quite different, and as consequence it is difficult to draw patterns among farm types. 9.5.3 Crop production The data shown in Figure 67 indicate that in the poly-culture, livestock and self-sufficient clusters arable crop production predominates with, 80.7 %, 81.1 % and 78.4 %, respectively. In the two other farm types, leisure and vegetables for market, the proportion of arable crops is quite low, at 10.3 % for leisure farms and 16.1 % for farms producing vegetables for market. In the poly-culture cluster vegetable production is very low, accounting for only 0.6 %. The structure of agricultural production reflects the regionalisation of production before 1990. Lezha region was mainly focused on arable crop activities and other crop production came in second place. Indeed, even livestock husbandry takes second place in terms of its proportion of overall value of agricultural production, despite the fact that hilly terrain favours this activity. Arable crop production as a proportion of the total value of agricultural production (including livestock) accounts for around 40 % at its lowest value (leisure farm type) up to 88 % at its highest value (livestock farm type). 9.5.4 Livestock production Regarding the value of livestock production, in most clusters in Lezh\u00eb region, the greatest part is represented by meat production (Figure 68). In the poly-culture for market farm type, milk, honey and eggs account for the largest proportion (50.3 %), while meat accounts for 49.7 % of the value of livestock production. The livestock farm type shows nearly the same pattern of contribution in value between meat, on the one hand, and milk, eggs and honey, on the other. In the vegetables for market cluster, meat production (83 %) predominates over milk, eggs and honey. A similar ratio (whereby the meat proportion is larger) is found in livestock and self-sufficient farm types.

Goats and sheep make the smallest contribution to livestock production in Lezh\u00eb region. On poly-culture for market and leisure farms, goats are not raised at all, while on vegetables for market, livestock and self-sufficient farms, they make a very small contribution: 4.5 %, 3.6 % and 4.6 %, respectively.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 96 The predominance of farms raising pigs over sheep and goat farms among all clusters is linked to the traditional consumption of pork in this region. The number of pig farms is nearly the same as those raising cattle among all clusters. Regarding pig breeding, the poly-culture for market cluster has the highest percentage of farms compared with the other clusters. From Figure 70 we can generate some interesting information on how different types of livestock production are divided between the clusters in Lezh\u00eb region. Poultry is more evident in the livestock cluster, with 41.2 % of the total poultry production, followed by the self-sufficient cluster with 25.5 %. It is interesting that the livestock cluster is the leading cluster in terms of all livestock production, accounting for 41.2 % of poultry, 44.4 % of pigs, 47.4 of goats, 37.5 % of sheep and 46.7 % of cattle. On the contrary, leisure farm are the least represented cluster in terms of livestock production, with 4.4 % of poultry, 3.5 % of pigs, 12 5 % of sheep, 11.2 % of cattle and no goat production at all. 9.5.5 Incomes and costs The income structure in Lezh\u00eb region shows predominance of off-farm income in the THI (Figure 71). For all farm types, off-farm income is greater than the farm income. This means that farming activities and their contribution to the financial means of the farmers are minor, except for the vegetables for market (where it is almost balanced at 48.5 % and 51.5 %), and livestock types where the difference between the two types of income is lower than for the other types of farms (40.2 % and 59.8 %). These two types of farms rely more than the others on market-based agricultural activities. Using a methodology based on existing data, the ratio of off-farm activity to THI is somewhat lower than the real data demonstrate. This ratio was around 82 % for leisure farms and 76 % for poly-culture for market farms, and much lower for the other types, declining to 2.22 % in the vegetables for market type of farms. The real situation shows about the same picture for leisure farms and a somewhat different picture for poly-culture for market farms and the rest of the farm types in this regard. The main off-farm sources of income are construction, trade, pensions and remittances from abroad. The last one accounts for a significant amount of off-farm income.

The vegetables for market cluster has the highest expenditure on seeds followed by leisure farms and self-sufficient farms. The other two farm types spend less on seeds, but within the cluster it remains the highest. Among farm types, expenditure for on nitrogen fertiliser remains in second place. These expenditures are higher in the self- sufficiency cluster, followed by vegetables for market and the other three clusters, which spend the same amount on nitrogen per dyn. Again, expenditure on nitrogen fertiliser remain in second place even within cluster. In third place, within clusters, stands expenditure on ploughing and other land preparation processes; among clusters the highest expenditure on land preparation appears to be among farms belonging to the livestock cluster. The other farms types show nearly the same amount spent on land preparation.

        "C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f f a r m i n g s y s t e m s i n A l b a n i a 98 Financing farming expenditure is one of the main obstacles for farmers when it comes to building capacity and taking up new ideas. Judging by the current finance situation, the picture looks quite pessimistic in terms of access to credit. Consequently, the potential for building capacity and increasing the efficiency of farm inputs still remains very low in Lezh\u00eb region. As the Figure 73 shows, almost all the farms among the clusters finance their expenditure from own sources. Farming families have no access to micro-credit institutions and banks, while few of them use other sources to finance their expenditure. Farms belonging to the vegetables for market cluster finance up to 100 % of their expenditure from their own sources. The leisure farm cluster shows a somehow different pattern in terms of finance, whereby a little more than 5 % of them use other sources to finance their expenditure. The self-sufficient cluster is the same. Other sources refer mainly to remittances brought in from family members working outside the country. The absence of credit institutions (banks and micro-credit institutions) in the farming systems in Lezh\u00eb region indicates that farming families face great difficulties in financing new projects and building capacity. The fact that, for all farm types, off-farm activity is the main source of THI might explain the indifference of farming families towards accessing credit institutions. On the other hand, low factor productivity, low farming capacity and a low level of market integration may make the farming system in this region unattractive to credit institutions.

L e z h \u00eb r e g i o n : a g r i c u l t u r a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s 99 9.6 Analysis of farm economic performance: Lezh\u00eb region This section deals with identifying the most productive farm types in Albania in terms of FNI, the types that yield a higher income for each household family member and the types that give better repayment for each AWU employed in agriculture, as well as for the land. The methodology for calculating FNI is the same as that used in the case of Elbasan region . 9.6.1 The farm type viability analysis The analysis of farming system types is organised into two parts: the economic performance of each farm type is evaluated by calculating their (1) viability and (2) the farm productivity. The calculation of farm type viability is made by using the reproduction threshold (RT), which is a benchmark for assessing the economic viability of different farming or production systems (Gomez y Paloma S., Acs et al. 2012). In this case there are two indicators used to assess the viability of farming systems. The minimum wage approach (Figure 74) is the comparison of the FNI/WU with the minimum wage ( 16 ) for 2014. The second indicator is the comparison of FNI/household member with the poverty line ( 17 ). The same level of minimum wage and poverty line indicators is applied for the whole sample. The following table shows the utilisation of these two indicators. 16 For administrative reasons, the Albanian government fixes the level of the minimum wage. In 2014 the minimum monthly wage amounts to ALL 22 000 (EUR 156.6). 17 According to the Institute of Statistics of Albania (INSTAT), an inhabitant is in extreme poverty if his or her monthly income does not exceed ALL 4 037 (EUR 28.7) and is in complete poverty if the monthly income does not exceed ALL 4891 (EUR 34.8). The analysis is performed on farm type, and the discussion of the results is done at the farm type level, as well as a comparison of results among the different farms types of the region. Work in agriculture is paid less than the minimum wage in all farms types in Lezh\u00eb region. The situation is slightly different only for livestock farms, where earnings from agriculture are about 57 % of the minimum wage, but in the other four types in this region payment for work in agriculture is much lower than the minimum wage. The extreme poverty line The importance of non-farm incomes in Albanian rural areas makes it necessary to perform the analysis not only for the FNI but also for the THI. If we refer to the incomes received from agriculture, we see that it is only on livestock farms that the members of the family live above the extreme poverty line (Figure 75). In all other farm types, family members live below the extreme poverty line or on the extreme poverty line, because the values are very close to 1. This is not the case for leisure farms: for these farms agriculture is not the main source of income. If we take the THI into the analysis, we can see that in all farm types, the family members live above the extreme poverty line, excluding farms growing vegetables for market. It would be true to say that the majority of the family income on farms in Lezh\u00eb region comes from off-farm activities.

Only on the livestock farms do members of the family live above the complete poverty line. If we take into consideration THI, family members from poly-culture for market, self-sufficient and livestock farms live pretty far above the complete poverty line. However, on vegetables for market farms the members of the family live below the complete poverty line, because the off-farm income as a proportion of total income on these farms is very small (2.22 %). Productivity analysis The second step in analysing farm type economic performance is to look at the farm type productivity. Productivity indicators of work ( FNI WU ) and land ( FNI UAA ) can be calculated for each farm type. A comparison of these indicators will show which farm type perform better in terms of work, land and capital. However, owing to a lack of data, the productivity of capital has not been calculated.

This is because one of the advantages of diversifying production and livestock activities is making full use of labour. Although the FNI per work unit on livestock farms is high, they do not repay the workforce at a level above the minimum wage. Figure 77 shows the productivity of the UAA for each farm type in Lezh\u00eb region. This is higher on livestock farms and vegetables for market farms because vegetables and livestock products are outputs with high added value. However, the productivity of the UAA on the poly-culture farms is very low.

        "1 0 . C o n c l u s i o n s 103 Twenty years since the start of de-collectivisation, agricultural farming systems in Albania still remain small, highly fragmented low-input systems that lack strong links to the market for agricultural products. Agriculture generally does not offer enough work for the workforce in rural areas. Non-agricultural employment seems to be an obligatory strategy in order to increase the efficiency of the household labour and to diversify the income sources. The farms that are specialised in agricultural activities (e.g. fruit tree farms) generally have a lower FNI than the other farm types that aim to have agriculture as their main economic activity (poly-culture for market). On the other hand, specialisation needs significant non- agricultural income that can be used for agricultural day- to-day expenses and household expenses. The lack of credit facilities drives farmers towards specialisation strategies that do not need significant investment, that supply a steady income throughout the whole year and that are diversified (not linked with only one type of crop or livestock). In this regard, farming strategies are not driving farming systems towards high-input agriculture in which the negative effects of small and highly fragmented agricultural structures can be reduced by significant use of inputs and greater land and labour productivity. The average repayment for farm-type labour in rural areas is lower than the minimum wage in Albania. Labour productivity is higher on poly-culture for market, fruit trees diversified, arable crops for market and livestock farms, although these farms also have a greater number of workers. It is known that one of the advantages of diversification of production and livestock activities is making full use of the available labour. Labour productivity is lower on subsistence farms and specialised farms. This lower labour productivity may lead to the conclusion that rural migration towards urban areas or abroad will continue into the future. The productivity of the land follows the trend for labour. It is higher in the poly-culture for market farm type and on livestock farms. This is the consequence of the fact that vegetables and livestock products are outputs with high added value. Land productivity is lower for subsistence farms, leisure farms and specialised fruit farms. Poly-culture for market and livestock farms will require financial support from government in future. On farms that have agriculture as the main source of income of the household, family members are living above the extreme poverty line (poly-culture for market, livestock and arable crops for market farm types) . This analysis leads to the conclusion that the more diversified a farm is, the more efficient it will be. Regarding the living standard of household members for each farm type, considering the FNI, it can be concluded that household members of farm types such as poly-culture for market, livestock, fruit trees and arable crops for market are living above the complete poverty line. In contrast to this, household members of farm types such as self-sufficient, leisure and specialised fruit trees are living below the complete poverty line. Calculating the poverty level based on THI shows that family members are living above complete poverty on all types of farms. In conclusion, non-agricultural incomes in Albanian rural areas are not only extra income for the family household but in some cases the main income that provides for the needs of the family. This co-existence of agricultural and non-agricultural incomes provides, on the one hand, greater resilience for farm households but, on the other hand, less interest in and potential for farmers to invest in agriculture and to improve existing farming systems. 10.

To identify a representative sample of Albanian farming systems, a three-step sample design was used. A group of 11 variables dealing with the socio-economic characteristics of farms was selected to build up the farming system typology. Two typologies are used: one for the whole sample (three regions) and a second one for each region. The differences between the two typologies are considered to be a proxy indicator of different characteristics of farming systems in each region. The farm types identified are (1) poly-culture, mainly for the market; (2) leisure farms; (3) arable crops; (4) fruit trees; (5) self-sufficient; and (6) livestock. The farm typology is slightly different for the regions of Berat and Lezh\u00eb. The farm types\u2019 strategies are constructed according to the land, infrastructure facilities and the investment availability of farms. Non-agricultural incomes (remittances, income from the construction, trade, pensions, etc.) appear to provide an important economic support for the farm household. Farming structures in rural areas are characterised by the use of more labour and lower inputs. The farm types that tend to specialise in one activity are not always those that make the best use of labour and land. Farming does not provide enough income to repay the work put in at the official minimum wage level. Non-agricultural work is better paid. Albanian farms provide at least a minimal income that is enough to keep the household members above the threshold of extreme poverty. The farm types that base their incomes on agricultural activities are poorer than those that base their income on non-agricultural activities. Income structures and the low incomes generated by work in agriculture suggests that rural migration towards urban areas and abroad is a phenomenon that will persist into the future. ",
