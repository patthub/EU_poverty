It also points to policy levers that can actively contribute to inclusiveness, quality and relevance. Where possible, its quantitative analysis is complemented by an assessment of structural and process indicators to reveal barriers in the EU\u2019s education and training systems. The Education and Training Monitor 2015 is a report in two vol- umes. Volume 1 takes the form of a cross-national, thematic analysis. Volume 2 comprises twenty-eight individual country reports. Highlights of the country analysis are included in the summary in Volume 1, while the country reports themselves can be found online. The report\u2019s webpage also links to contextual indicators \u2013 both quantitative and structural \u2013 from, respectively, the JRC\u2019s Centre for Research on Education and Lifelong Learning (CRELL) and the Eurydice network. Moreover, the webpage contains a visualisation tool to compare country performance vis-\u00e0-vis six ET 2020 benchmarks. The cross-national, thematic analysis (Volume 1) is divided into three parts. Part one directly links education to the Commission\u2019s priorities to boost jobs, growth and investment as well as the EU\u2019s social agenda. It stresses educational poverty as a key social challenge for Europe and the consecutive budget cuts in some Member States as harmful to both short- term recovery and long-term growth. Part two focuses on education attainment levels of young people across Europe today. The Europe 2020 headline target is the cornerstone of this assessment. Part three, fi nally, off ers concrete, tangible policy levers by looking directly at issues of inclusiveness, quality and rel- evance. This includes a focus on the teaching profession; innovative pedagogies and tools in school education and higher education institutions; and aligning education provi- sion more eff ectively with the needs of the labour market. The policy levers also touch upon high-quality, inclusive ECEC; work-based learning and apprenticeships; and barriers to continued learning ast er initial education. ec.europa.eu/education/monitor E d u c a t i o n a n d T r a i n i n g M o n i t o r 2 0 1 5 N C - A J - 15 - 001 - E N - C ISBN 978-92-79-50621-5 2015_TRAI-09-ETmonitor2015-Cover_A4_avec-rabats_00.indd 1 01/10/15 14:57 ",

The Education and Training Monitor 2015 was prepared by the Directorate-General for Education and Culture (DG EAC), with contributions from the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL). DG EAC was assisted by the Eurostat, the Eurydice Network and the JRC\u2019s Centre for Research on Education and Lifelong Learning (CRELL) and Institute of Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS).

Those are the two major priorities of this year's Education and Training Monitor and my personal vision for our field. How could it be otherwise? Millions of Europeans are at risk of poverty and social exclusion, inequalities continue to grow and unemployment remains unacceptably high, especially among young people. Moreover, the terrorist attacks in France and Denmark earlier this year raised difficult questions about our ability to maintain open, cohesive societies and about our capacity to instil common values, while the refugee crisis puts new pressure on the role of education as a vector for integration. Today, the challenge to create new jobs, re-build the foundations of sustainable growth and address social exclusion often overshadow broader political objectives. Jobs, growth and investment are at the core of the new Commission's programme, and the Education and Training Monitor shows clearly that these objectives can only be met if we invest properly in our people and put education at the heart of economic and social policy. Social inclusion and growth are two sides of the same coin. Improving education is urgent and vital, not only because it lifts productivity and prevents structural and long-term unemployment, but because education remains the engine behind social mobility and the safety net against social exclusion. These themes are at the core of the European strategic framework for cooperation in education and training (ET 2020), and are reflected in the new priorities of the Draft 2015 Joint Report, as proposed by the Commission in August. We must find new ways to encourage Member States to invest more and invest better. For example, the European Fund for Strategic Investment and the European Investment Bank's activities offer real opportunities to attract private capital. Education must be seen as investment rather than spending. And yet, in recent years, the vast majority of Member States have reduced their commitment to education while Europe's competitors are catching up quickly by investing strategically and vigorously. Social exclusion produces fractured societies. The 2015 Paris Declaration on promoting citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education calls for a European policy framework to help Member States ensure that inclusion begins in the classroom. The urgency to invest in education's quality, relevance and inclusiveness in turn demands mutual learning and evidence-based policy making. And this is where the Education and Training Monitor plays a central role. It has grown into an indispensable reference tool for the European education community, strengthening the evidence-base of ET 2020, and contributing to the broader Europe 2020 strategy and its headline target for education. I trust this year's Education and Training Monitor will enrich the policy debate on education at the national and European level, and support Member States as they modernise their education and training systems in the years to come.

        "Summary Highlights of the cross-national analysis Highlights of the country analysis 6 Summary Highlights of the cross-national analysis Highlights of the country analysis 7 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 Summary Highlights of the cross-national analysis This first edition of the Education and Training Monitor developed under the Juncker Commission is published when Europe's need for long-term solutions to a growing social crisis has once more been thrown into sharp relief. Education is the foundation of Europe's future economic vitality, driving the employability, productivity, innovativeness and entrepreneurial spirit of tomorrow's working population. But equipping people for employment is only part of the picture. Education has an equally important role in creating a better society. Well-educated people are less at risk of marginalisation and social exclusion. Effective education is about inclusiveness, ensuring every citizen has an opportunity to develop their talents and to feel part of a shared future. Building effective education and training systems requires a focus on inclusion as part and parcel of the broader quest for excellence, quality and relevance. These objectives are well reflected in the Europe 2020 education headline target. Yet the latest available data shows a worrying decrease in education investment for the third consecutive year, jeopardising the EU's progress towards these objectives. Member States that have seen a spending cut for at least three years in a row are NL, FI, PT, IT, ES, IE and UK \u2013 the latter four proving the most problematic from a demographic perspective. The Education and Training Monitor 2015 shows that, in view of improving spending effectiveness and efficiency, mutual learning and evidence-based policy making are of vital importance. Inclusiveness Educational poverty, or the share of young people failing to reach minimum standards in education, is one of the greatest challenges in Europe today. Although education should level the playing field for all, opportunities and outcomes are still very much determined by people's socio-economic and immigration background. As a result, no EU Member State has managed to bring underachievement amongst 15 year-olds with low socio-economic status below 15%. And in BG, CY, RO, EL, SK and HU, over half of those with low socio-economic status are unable to solve very basic maths problems. Leaving school without upper secondary education attainment is another indication of educational poverty. Just like underachievement in basic skills, the rate of early leavers from education and training \u2013 now at 11.1% in the EU \u2013 is influenced strongly by students' parental background. In addition, about 60% of early school leavers are subsequently either inactive or unemployed, illustrating how educational poverty has long-term and serious repercussions. Widening access in higher education is made more difficult by a lack of inclusiveness in the earlier years of schooling. The tertiary education attainment rate in the EU now stands at 37.9%, but the social dimension of higher education remains an issue. A range of factors influence access to tertiary level education among under-represented groups, including their success and engagement in earlier stages of education. At the same time, as the student population does become more diverse, higher education will have to adapt to help prevent more disadvantaged students dropping out of the system before they graduate. A powerful example of how education can level the playing field concerns progress towards the Europe 2020 headline target amongst students born abroad. Foreign-born young people who arrived in their new country of residence before the beginning of compulsory education show virtually identical rates of early school leaving and tertiary education attainment when compared to native-born individuals. However, foreign-born students arriving during compulsory education perform less well and require targeted support. Many adults who, after having failed to acquire a sufficient level of knowledge, skills, competences and dispositions during initial education, are stuck in low-quality jobs that offer either little opportunity for career growth, or motivation for undertaking further learning.

        "8 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 four adults in Europe is caught in a low-skills trap \u2013 one that limits access to the labour market while simultaneously closing avenues to further education or training. The Education and Training Monitor 2015 identifies three types of policy levers that could help improve the inclusiveness of Europe's education and training systems, thereby tackling educational poverty. It all starts with early childhood education and care (ECEC), which helps reduce the impact of socio-economic status on subsequent education achievement. Outreach and, in some cases, positive discrimination measures are important, for instance through language programmes, targeted support to disadvantaged areas, quantitative targets for disadvantaged groups and home-learning guidance. Secondly, teachers have a strong role to play in inclusive education. Their need for training in the domains of special education needs, multicultural environments and individualised learning will have to be met with an incentivised, barrier-free offer of continuing professional development (CPD). Initial teacher education should cover issues of educational poverty, including underachievement in basic skills and risk factors associated with early school leaving. Thirdly, the education and training system needs to allow for more flexible transitions, whether between levels of education, between vocational and general education, or between the labour market and adult learning. Disadvantaged learners in particular benefit from permeable pathways, non-traditional entry routes into higher education and second chance education. Continued learning is essential for the 66 million adults with at best lower secondary education attainment, but only 4.4% of them participate in adult learning. Quality Expanding access to education and training is a crucial aspect of inclusion. But developing effective, efficient and responsive education and training systems means going beyond attainment levels and focusing strongly on the quality of education programmes. Despite the growing use of qualification frameworks and emphasis on learning outcomes, international assessments continue to reveal major disparities in competency levels between countries. The Education and Training Monitor 2015 highlights four domains of policy levers. Firstly, quality needs to start early. While ECEC participation is near-universal in an increasing number of EU Member States, little is known about the quality of provision or the necessary interactions between children, staff, authorities and parents. Many member states (BE de, BG, CZ, FR, IT, Quantitative targets for under-represented groups in higher education Inclusion of early school leaving in teacher education and CPD CPD needs in lower secondary education by domain Students with special needs Individualised learning Career guidance and counselling Student behaviour and classroom management Multicultural or multilingual setting 9 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 CY, PL, PT, SK, UK-WLS and UK-NIR) do not provide educational guidelines for the entire ECEC phase. ECEC lacks coherent vision, particularly as regards its governance and funding needs. Secondly, quality means tackling underachievement in basic skills, and working to help students and students strengthen the competences they need in an increasingly international, competitive labour market. As one of many examples possible, the Education and Training Monitor 2015 looks at foreign language competences and the available infrastructures for language teaching and learning. An increasing percentage of students who at home speak a language different to the language of instruction demands Member States to develop new approaches to language teaching and learning, capitalising on existing diversity to increase awareness and metalinguistic skills. 18% of students in primary education and 10.3% of general upper secondary education students still do not learn any foreign languages. Such percentages need to be reduced and learning outcomes improved in order to overcome linguistic barriers to learning and working mobility. Thirdly, quality can be better exploited through innovation and digital technologies. In higher education, for example, this affects the delivery of learning, adoption of better assessment methods and new forms of accreditation. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) and other digital developments are challenging the role and structure of higher education institutions (HEIs). In turn, analysis of big data from digital learning experiences can be used to strengthen both processes and outcomes, and may help combat drop-out rates. Finally, all of these efforts to raise quality across Europe\u2019s education and training systems depend in large part on teachers\u2019 competences, and on setting high standards for their initial education, induction and CPD. This is the fourth domain of policy levers to improve quality as identified in the Education and Training Monitor 2015. It also concerns school leaders, who should allocate time and resources to encourage teachers to work together, diversifying their teaching and improving students\u2019 individualised learning and guidance throughout the education career.

        "10 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 and training (VET) strengthens labour market relevance. It ensures a continued feedback loop between the demands of employers and the design and evaluation of education curricula, professional standards and the examination of students. Apprenticeships are the most well- known example of such combined school- and work-based learning. The analysis shows, however, that both VET outcomes and access to quality VET vary significantly between Member States. Also, work-based learning is not equally prevalent across VET systems, despite its importance in improving relevance. For VET, quality and relevance are closely linked. But most Member States have significant room for improvement when it comes to VET, and better exploiting this potential is also likely to increase attractiveness. Secondly, in comparison with VET, graduates from higher education have better employment chances (80.5%) than young people with upper secondary degrees (70.8%). But while employment chances are slowly picking up for those with upper secondary qualifications, employment rates for tertiary graduates are stagnant. In addition, the limited cross-national data available suggests that occupational mismatch still persists for tertiary graduates, with 25% of them having jobs that would traditionally be viewed as not requiring a tertiary qualification. These findings question the labour market relevance of skills and qualifications. The challenge for Member States is to sensitise their higher education institutions (HEIs) to the needs of the labour market. Several ways of doing this remain underexploited across Europe. Again, mutual learning and evidence-based policy making prove to be of key value.

The country reports follow a structure similar to that of Volume 1, but complement the cross-national analysis with country-specific data and information on policy measures and the latest reforms. AT Austria's early school leaving rate is below the EU average. The country\u2019s vocational education and training (VET) system is well adapted to the labour market, a factor that has contributed to it having one of the lowest youth unemployment rates in the EU. Nonetheless, foreign-born students are three times as likely to leave school early as native-born students and educational performance continues to be very dependent on parents\u2019 socio-economic status. Higher education lacks consistent strategic orientation and is underfunded. The drop-out rate from higher education remains high, and there is starting to be a lack of maths, science and technology graduates. BE The Belgian education system is still performing well on average. Participation in early childhood education and care (ECEC) is almost universal for children over the age of three and the early school leaving rate is on a downward trend. The rate of public expenditure on education is among the highest in the EU and all three language communities are conducting major school reforms. There is, however, high educational inequality related to socio-economic and immigrant status and wide gaps in performance between schools. There are also marked differences in basic skills performance and in early school leaving rates between the communities and regions. The academic performance of students enrolled in VET is poor. The most disadvantaged schools lack experienced teachers and head teachers, and there are capacity and quality problems in the education infrastructure. The transition from school to work is very difficult for young people leaving education and training with lower secondary education qualifications at most. Implementing the reforms will require major efforts from a wide array of actors. BG Bulgaria has recently improved its performance as regards basic skills and tertiary education attainment. However, it still needs to improve the overall quality and efficiency of its school education system and the capacity of higher education to respond to labour market needs. Access to education for disadvantaged children, in particular Roma, is an ongoing challenge. The quality of VET in Bulgaria is insufficient, including in terms of its integration in the general education system. The rate of adult participation in learning is among the lowest of the EU. CY Early school leaving has declined steadily in Cyprus in recent years and the tertiary education attainment rate is one of the highest in the EU. However, this phenomenon masks a lack of efficiency in public spending and the relatively low quality of education outcomes. Cyprus faces one of the lowest employability rates of recent graduates in the EU and an unsatisfactory performance in basic skills by students and young adults alike. The country also features one of the lowest participation rates in VET in the EU, but recent reforms and new initiatives in this area include a gradually expanding the VET offer. CZ The overall education outcomes and employability of school and higher education graduates in the Czech Republic are good. The early school leaving rate remains low and progress in tertiary education attainment is rapid. A new comprehensive strategy for education was adopted in 2014 and emphasises the need to reduce inequalities, support teachers and improve the governance of the education and training system. Provision of ECEC is being strengthened. Increasing participation in mainstream education among disadvantaged children, in particular Roma, is a challenge. Teachers' salaries are low in comparison to other countries and the teacher population is ageing. Graduates from the VET strands do not always have the skills needed on the labour market. As more and more young people are now entering higher education, further measures will be necessary to ensure quality and labour market relevance. MEP ET Monitor 2015 vol 1.indd 10 27/10/15 15:01 ",

        "12 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 DE Education outcomes of students, including those with a disadvantaged background, continue to improve. Germany reached its national Europe 2020 target for early school leaving and participation in ECEC keeps increasing. An effective dual education and training system ensures provision of the skills needed on the labour market. Nevertheless, there are shortages of highly qualified people in certain sectors and regions, in part due to negative demographic trends. Against this background, improving education outcomes still further and loosening the strong link between education achievement and socio-economic status are crucial for sustaining a skills- intensive and export-oriented economy. This implies more and better quality ECEC, increasing the number and the quality of all-day school places, and promoting access to training for the low-skilled. Finally, integrating the high number of recently arrived migrants into the education system and preparing their transition to the labour market will be important challenges to tackle. DK Denmark is performing well in many education and training areas, including early school leaving, tertiary education attainment, participation in ECEC, participation of adults in learning, as well as employment rates of recent graduates. The level of public funding for education remains one of the highest in the EU. Denmark\u2019s main challenges are to decrease the high proportion of underachievement in basic skills among students with an immigrant background and also to reduce the rate of drop-out from VET. The reforms in the school and VET sectors launched in 2014 provide an opportunity to address these issues. EE Basic skills levels and the tertiary education attainment rate in Estonia are very high. The number of graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics has been growing considerably and represents over one-fourth of all higher education graduates. The employment rate of recent graduates has recovered quickly after the economic crisis. Funding levels for education remain relatively high and fairly stable. However, there are certain structural challenges related to adapting the Estonian education system to the rapidly declining demographic situation and to the future requirements of a technologically-intensive labour market. The attractiveness of VET and the provision of apprenticeships remain problematic. Stronger links are needed with the economy. Finally, the gender gap in education is an issue, especially for young males. EL Greece performs better than the EU average as regards early school leaving and around the average on tertiary education attainment. In recent years, the education and training sector has undergone strict fiscal consolidation and a number of important structural reforms took place under the economic adjustment programme. Greece has begun significant work to reorganise general education, to upgrade VET and to reform the governance and organisation of higher education. Recent legislation indicates the intention to revert to education policy from the pre-2010 period. The Greek education and training system requires further modernisation in terms of its performance and its ways of working, in particular with regard to providing basic skills, and its capacity to prepare young people for the transition to the labour market. ES Spain has one of the highest tertiary education attainment rates in Europe, and enrolment in VET has also increased with a particular expansion of the dual model of work-based training combined with vocational school training. Participation in ECEC is almost universal. Despite a steady fall in early school leaving over the past six years, Spain still has the highest rate in Europe, with significant differences between regions. There are also great disparities in the performance of school students in basic skills between cohorts, schools and regions, mostly linked to socio-economic status. Recent reform of the education and training system is expected to reduce the early school leaving rate still further while improving basic skills levels of low performers. The reform is being implemented at different paths across the autonomous communities. Employability of higher education graduates, particularly in certain disciplines, remains a major challenge, as well as the significant proportion of graduates employed in jobs that do not require a university degree. 13 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 FI Finland has an equitable education and training systems providing for very good learning outcomes. The early school leaving rate is stable and the level of basic skills remains high, despite somewhat less favourable results in recent international surveys. New challenges are emerging, especially for students with an immigrant background and in the light of a recent trend towards differentiation between schools in densely populated urban areas. While there is a high level of participation in VET and new apprenticeships have been created recently, the overall number of apprenticeship-type placements is comparably low. FR Participation in ECEC is almost universal for children from three years old. Public investment in education remains high and since 2013 the country has been engaged in ambitious reforms in all sectors and at all levels of education and training. However, results are average in comparison to other countries and educational inequalities linked to socio-economic status have been widening consistently. Despite an early school leaving rate below EU average, significant regional disparities remain. Moreover, too many young people, in particular among those with an immigrant background, still leave education with at most a lower secondary level qualification, while the labour market prospects for this group have significantly deteriorated. The number of apprenticeships increased at higher-level VET, but there are still not sufficient apprenticeships for the least qualified. Finally, the level of adult literacy and numeracy is among the lowest in the EU for those with a lower level qualification and for older age groups. HR The main strengths of Croatia's education and training system are a low early school leaving rate and a high proportion of secondary vocational school graduates continuing into higher education. Positive developments in the country include the adoption of a comprehensive strategy for education, science and technology, which will be the main driver of reform in the coming years. On the other hand, the Croatian education and training system faces a significant number of challenges, including improving education outcomes in mathematics in primary and secondary schools, modernising initial VET curricula in line with the needs of the labour market, and increasing access and completion rates in higher education. There are relatively low participation rates in both ECEC and adult learning. Croatia faces significant structural problems in the form of stretched capacities in pre-school centres and an under-regulated and under-funded system of adult learning. HU Hungary has adopted several national strategies in 2014-15 to improve the quality of its education and training system: on early school leaving, public education development, VET, higher education and lifelong learning. Moreover, ECEC is compulsory for all children from the age of three as of September 2015. The education and training system faces a number of issues: the proportion of underachievement in basic skills is increasing and the socio-economic gaps in performance are still among the highest in the EU. Increasing the participation of disadvantaged students, in particular Roma, in mainstream inclusive education and improving support through targeted teacher training is a challenge. Vocational schools are not attractive to young people, show high drop-out and do not provide flexible career opportunities. Many students drop out of higher education and adult participation in learning remains very low. General government expenditure on education as a share of GDP is among the lowest in the EU. IE Ireland\u2019s tertiary education attainment rate is one of the highest in the EU. Early school leaving has been falling and is well below the average. There have also been positive developments in basic skills proficiency. At the same time, re-skilling and up-skilling are a challenge for the education and training system. In a very difficult fiscal context with decreasing public spending on education, reforms have been put in place to achieve a system that is more responsive and relevant to labour market needs. Access to full-time childcare remains limited and expensive. IT Italy has made progress in improving its education and training system over the last few years. A school evaluation system is being implemented, basic skills proficiency has improved, the early school leaving rate is on a decreasing trend and participation in ECEC is almost universal for children aged four to six.

Finally, the level of adult literacy and numeracy is among the lowest in the EU for those with a lower level qualification and for older age groups. HR The main strengths of Croatia's education and training system are a low early school leaving rate and a high proportion of secondary vocational school graduates continuing into higher education. Positive developments in the country include the adoption of a comprehensive strategy for education, science and technology, which will be the main driver of reform in the coming years. On the other hand, the Croatian education and training system faces a significant number of challenges, including improving education outcomes in mathematics in primary and secondary schools, modernising initial VET curricula in line with the needs of the labour market, and increasing access and completion rates in higher education. There are relatively low participation rates in both ECEC and adult learning. Croatia faces significant structural problems in the form of stretched capacities in pre-school centres and an under-regulated and under-funded system of adult learning. HU Hungary has adopted several national strategies in 2014-15 to improve the quality of its education and training system: on early school leaving, public education development, VET, higher education and lifelong learning. Moreover, ECEC is compulsory for all children from the age of three as of September 2015. The education and training system faces a number of issues: the proportion of underachievement in basic skills is increasing and the socio-economic gaps in performance are still among the highest in the EU. Increasing the participation of disadvantaged students, in particular Roma, in mainstream inclusive education and improving support through targeted teacher training is a challenge. Vocational schools are not attractive to young people, show high drop-out and do not provide flexible career opportunities. Many students drop out of higher education and adult participation in learning remains very low. General government expenditure on education as a share of GDP is among the lowest in the EU. IE Ireland\u2019s tertiary education attainment rate is one of the highest in the EU. Early school leaving has been falling and is well below the average. There have also been positive developments in basic skills proficiency. At the same time, re-skilling and up-skilling are a challenge for the education and training system. In a very difficult fiscal context with decreasing public spending on education, reforms have been put in place to achieve a system that is more responsive and relevant to labour market needs. Access to full-time childcare remains limited and expensive. IT Italy has made progress in improving its education and training system over the last few years. A school evaluation system is being implemented, basic skills proficiency has improved, the early school leaving rate is on a decreasing trend and participation in ECEC is almost universal for children aged four to six. Moreover, the recent reform of MEP ET Monitor 2015 vol 1.indd 13 27/10/15 15:01 ",

Nonetheless, the early school leaving rate remains well above the EU average. Regional differences in basic skills proficiency are wide. The tertiary education attainment rate for young people is the lowest in the EU and many students still drop out of tertiary education. Work-based learning is not sufficiently developed and entry into the labour market is difficult for young people, including the high-skilled. General government expenditure on education as a share of GDP is among the lowest in the EU, especially at the tertiary level. LT With low early school leaving and high tertiary education attainment rates, Lithuania is performing well vis-\u00e0-vis the Europe 2020 headline target in education. Students\u2019 education outcomes may be boosted by recent policy measures, such as making ECEC compulsory for all from the age of five, the development of a nation-wide student competence measurement system, induction and more professional support to teachers. At the same time, skills acquired in secondary and tertiary education often do not meet the needs of the labour market. Underachievement in reading and maths is high and participation in initial VET is relatively low. Only a small percentage of adults participate in learning. Finally, the teaching workforce is ageing and there are difficulties in attracting young people to the profession. LU Luxembourg is a trilingual country and this plurality of languages is well reflected in the education and training system. Luxembourg provides significant resources to the system and has seen very high growth rates as regards tertiary education attainment. However, socio-economic status plays a significant role in influencing education outcomes. Students with an immigrant background generally achieve significantly worse results than non-immigrant students. Similarly, although Luxembourg scores well in early school leaving, the percentage of early school leavers is relatively high among students with an immigrant background. Performance in basic skills, furthermore, remains somewhat below the average in reading, mathematics and science. Luxembourg is also the country with the second highest retention rates in secondary education in the EU. Progress on the planned school reform will be key for further improvement. LV In recent years, Latvia has made remarkable progress in reducing its early school leaving rate, raising its tertiary education attainment rate and improving basic skills proficiency \u2013 outperforming the EU average in all these indicators. The provision of labour market relevant skills for the workforce is the main challenge for the VET system. In the higher education sector, there is significant scope to help raise the innovation potential of the Latvian economy. In particular, public funding for higher education has lacked a performance-oriented component. However, promising reforms in this area are on-going. The gender gap in education, finally, is a transversal challenge, with women significantly and persistently outperforming men both in terms of qualifications and basic skills proficiency. MT Malta has invested significantly in its education and training system in recent years. Transition from education to the labour market is easier than in most other EU countries. However, skill levels of the workforce will not improve in the long-term without addressing some bottlenecks of the education and training system. Firstly, despite recent progress, the early school leaving rate remains high. Secondly, basic skills proficiency is poor in international comparison. Lastly, the supply of skills from the VET system has not yet adjusted to labour market requirements. NL The Netherlands has a high tertiary education attainment rate and made good progress in reducing the number of early school leavers, which can in part be attributed to the implementation of a comprehensive early school leaving strategy. The share of secondary level students in VET, the employment rate of recent upper secondary graduates and adult participation in learning are significantly above the EU average. Education performance is good, but it has, in contrast to other countries, not improved in recent years. Action is taken in particular to improve numeracy skills in primary, secondary and vocational schools. Challenges also include the aging teaching population and a shortage of well-qualified teachers, in particular for teaching languages, maths, science and students with special needs. 15 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 PL Poland has one of the EU\u2019s lowest proportions of early school leavers and of students with underachievement in basic skills. There has also been rapid progress in tertiary education attainment and increased participation in ECEC. The Polish education and training system has undergone profound changes in terms of its structure, organisation, management and core curricula in the face of the population\u2019s increasingly high educational aspirations. However, a significant number of challenges remain. These include issues relating to access to quality ECEC, particularly for children under the age of three, the teaching of transversal skills, the attractiveness of VET, and the relevance of higher education to the labour market. In addition, the low level of adult participation in learning and poor skills levels among adults, particularly in ICT, remain a source of concern for the future. PT Portugal has significantly reduced its early school leaving rate, and tertiary education attainment has greatly improved. The government has continued to implement major reforms, with the aim of improving the level of basic skills in the population. Enrolment in VET has continued to increase and a first set of new short-cycle higher technical courses (TeSP) were launched. The high proportion of students re-sitting years and the extent to which socio-economic status determines education achievement demonstrate the extent to which ensuring equity in basic education remains a problem, despite the many new programmes and measures introduced over the last decade. Enrolment rates in higher education have shown some fluctuations over the past three years. RO Romania\u2019s tertiary education attainment rate has risen consistently in recent years, but remains the second lowest in the EU. The Romanian Government has adopted a strategy on tertiary education, which has two overarching aims: to make higher education more relevant by aligning it more closely with labour market needs; and to improve the accessibility of higher education for disadvantaged groups. It also adopted a strategy for reducing early school leaving in June 2015. The early school leaving rate remains well above the EU average. The availability and access of ECEC services is limited, especially in rural areas and for the Roma community. Adult participation in learning remains far below the EU average and general government expenditure on education as a share of GDP is the lowest in the EU. SE The Swedish education and training system performs well in many areas including ECEC, students' civic knowledge and linguistic competence in English as a foreign language, tertiary education attainment rates and adult participation in learning. Sweden has continued to invest heavily in education and training. However, school outcomes have deteriorated in terms of basic skills proficiency, and equity in schools has declined. The fact that younger age groups perform worse than their predecessors is of concern, as a high-skilled workforce is crucial to sustaining competitiveness, living standards and innovation capacity in the long run. Transition from school to work remains difficult for young people who leave school without having completed upper secondary education. Integrating in the education system the large number of newly arrived immigrant students is an important challenge. SI Slovenia has the second lowest early school leaving rate in the EU and tertiary education attainment is above the EU average. Average basic skills proficiency is satisfactory, especially in mathematics and science. The proportion of upper secondary students in VET remains above the EU average. However, the higher education system is marked by a disproportionately high number of study programmes, a high drop-out rate and problems with fictitious enrolment. In addition, it is under-funded, and as a result, the quality of teaching and resources is unsustainable. In upper secondary education, the reversing demographic trends and the drop in student numbers have caused schools across the country to function below their capacity. Finally, there are very marked regional differences in national examinations, indicating that socio- economic status has a strong effect on education achievement. SK In Slovakia, the early school leaving rate remains low, but a recent increase calls for targeted measures. Capacities for ECEC are being strengthened. A new VET act is set to improve graduates' preparedness for the labour market. However, inequalities remain and education outcomes have deteriorated over the last years.

        "18 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 Part 1. Educational poverty and spending cuts: challenges for the education sector Growth is slowly returning to Europe. But youth unemployment, poverty and marginalisation remain high; symptoms of the wider and lasting social impact of the crisis. High quality education and training systems that equip people with the skills to succeed are crucial for tackling the root causes of these social problems 1 . However, Europe is not moving in the right direction fast enough. Educational poverty remains stubbornly embedded, with far too many disadvantaged students, and government investment \u2013 crucial to quality education \u2013 reveals worrying signs of spending cuts. 1.1. The determinants of educational poverty Europe\u2019s on-going social crisis cannot meaningfully be tackled without addressing the issue of educational poverty 2 . Educational poverty is defined as the share of young people failing to reach minimum standards in education. These minimum standards can be related to their education attainment (Part 2 of this report), but also to education achievement. This section looks at the share of underachievement in reading (17.8% across the EU), maths (22.1%) and science (16.6%) among 15 year-olds, which remains above the ET 2020 benchmark of 15% and strongly connected to socio-economic status, immigration background and gender 3 . Effective education and training systems should maximise opportunities for every single student. Education and training systems cannot optimally strengthen productivity, competitiveness or innovation if potential talent is left by the wayside. Moreover, education and training systems can help tackling marginalisation and social exclusion, but only if they are consciously geared to do so. This often requires active policy intervention. In 2015, six Member States received country-specific recommendations concerning the need to scale up efforts aimed at integrating disadvantaged students into mainstream education (AT, BG, CZ, HU, RO, SK) 4 . Socio-economic status and educational poverty Differences in educational participation between socio-economic groups can be observed earlier than compulsory education. Children from lower socio-economic backgrounds are less likely to participate in early childhood education and care (ECEC). This initial disadvantage can become cumulative, whereby individuals or groups carry forward those early disadvantages through different stages of their lives 5 . 1 Education's contribution to long-term growth is much-needed, with the 2015 European Semester concluding that the EU's recovery from the financial and economic crisis is more fragile and short-term than hoped. See the 2015 Annual Growth Survey (COM(2014) 902 final) and the Commission Communication accompanying proposals for the 2015 country-specific recommendations (COM(2015) 250 final). 2 European Commission (2015), An ever closer union among the peoples of Europe? Rising inequalities in the EU and their social, economic and political impacts (http://ec.europa.eu/research/social- sciences/pdf/policy_reviews/kina26814enc.pdf). See also EENEE (2015), Reducing inequality in education and skills: Implications for economic growth (http://www.eenee.de/). 3 Following the ET 2020 benchmark, underachievement is measured as the share of 15 year-olds scoring below level 2 out of six proficiency levels in the OECD\u2019s PISA. Table A.1 in the annex summarises country performance vis-\u00e0-vis the ET 2020 benchmark on underachievement in reading, maths and science. For further information, see the 2014 edition of the Education and Training Monitor at ec.europa.eu/education/monitor. 4 In July 2015, the Council approved country-specific recommendations for each Member State. See http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/country-specific-recommendations/index_en.htm. 5 At age 15, PISA results show that across countries, students who attended pre-primary school for more than one year score considerably higher in mathematics than students without pre-primary education. See European Commission (2013), PISA 2012: EU performance and first inferences regarding education and training policies in Europe (http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/ strategic-framework/doc/pisa2012_en.pdf). Educational poverty is one of the greatest societal challenges in Europe 19 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 Already at a young age, a supportive home learning environment proves crucial in shaping children\u2019s proficiency in reading, maths and science 6 . The early development of basic skills is strengthened if parents often are often engaged in learning activities with their children, have more home resources for learning and demonstrate high expectations for their children 7 . Once students reach the age of 15, the effects of socio-economic status have become firmly rooted in Europe\u2019s education and training systems. PISA 2012 shows unambiguously that parental background is a key determinant of basic skills 8 . The share of students below the minimum standard of maths proficiency is also clearly related to low socio-economic status: among the bottom quarter of the socio-economic index, the share of underachievement is the highest. Figure 1.1.1. Share of underachievement in maths by socio-economic status Source : OECD (PISA, 2012). Note: Countries are ranked in descending order of the average share of underachievement amongst the bottom quarter of the PISA index for socio-economic status. In fact, looking only at the bottom socio-economic quarter of the population as measured by the OECD's index of socio-economic status, no Member State shows an underachievement rate in maths below 15% (Figure 1.1.1). Low maths skills are measured amongst more than half of the 15 year-olds at the bottom socio- economic quarter in BG, CY, RO, EL, SK and HU. The gap between the performance at the bottom socio-economic quarter and the average national performance is 15 percentage points or more in half of the Member States (BG, SK, HU, RO, CY, LU, FR, EL, PT, LT, CZ, ES, AT, BE). The persisting influence of socio-economic status, family background and the home learning environment means that education attainment levels are often transmitted from one generation to the next. This influence can be indirect, for instance by providing additional learning opportunities, setting expectations or putting pressure on schools. A strong inter-generational transmission of education attainment can be seen as a failure of the education and training system to effectively maximise students' opportunities across the board. 6 An interesting example of comparative data comes from the IEA Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2011 and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2011. New data have been collected in the spring of 2015 for TIMSS 2015. The international reports are scheduled for release in December 2016. PIRLS 2016 will be released one year later.

Figure 1.1.1. Share of underachievement in maths by socio-economic status Source : OECD (PISA, 2012). Note: Countries are ranked in descending order of the average share of underachievement amongst the bottom quarter of the PISA index for socio-economic status. In fact, looking only at the bottom socio-economic quarter of the population as measured by the OECD's index of socio-economic status, no Member State shows an underachievement rate in maths below 15% (Figure 1.1.1). Low maths skills are measured amongst more than half of the 15 year-olds at the bottom socio- economic quarter in BG, CY, RO, EL, SK and HU. The gap between the performance at the bottom socio-economic quarter and the average national performance is 15 percentage points or more in half of the Member States (BG, SK, HU, RO, CY, LU, FR, EL, PT, LT, CZ, ES, AT, BE). The persisting influence of socio-economic status, family background and the home learning environment means that education attainment levels are often transmitted from one generation to the next. This influence can be indirect, for instance by providing additional learning opportunities, setting expectations or putting pressure on schools. A strong inter-generational transmission of education attainment can be seen as a failure of the education and training system to effectively maximise students' opportunities across the board. 6 An interesting example of comparative data comes from the IEA Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2011 and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2011. New data have been collected in the spring of 2015 for TIMSS 2015. The international reports are scheduled for release in December 2016. PIRLS 2016 will be released one year later.

        "20 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 Immigration and educational poverty As a result of the refugee crisis, issues of educational provision for students with an immigrant background have come more strongly to the fore this year. Numerous studies point towards gaps between native-born and foreign-born students when it comes to educational poverty. In the EU, the share of underachievement amongst foreign-born students is almost twice as high as it is amongst the native-born, whether measuring reading skills (30.7% versus 16.2%), maths (36.3% versus 20.5%) or science (29.9% versus 15.1%) 9 . A second distinction is the difference in underachievement between first- and second-generation immigrant students 10 , which, for maths, is 7.7 percentage points across the EU on average (Figure 1.1.2). Of all first-generation students, 41.7% are underachievers, while this share is considerably lower (34.0%) amongst second-generation students. Unfortunately, the gap between second-generation students and non-immigrant students (i.e. native-born students with native-born parents) remains significant as well, with the share of underachievement amongst the latter only 19.5%. Figure 1.1.2. Underachievement in maths by migration status Source : OECD (PISA, 2012). Note: Second-generation students are those born in the country of assessment with both parents foreign-born; first-generation students are foreign-born students whose parents are also foreign-born. Only those countries are included for which all data are available; ordered by the performance of non-immigrant students. While first-generation students show very high rates of underachievement in almost all countries, there are some Member States where second-generation students have much lower shares of underachievement. This suggests that in these countries, the integration of students with an immigrant background is fairly successful, whereas in other countries there is little progress between first- and second- generation students. A similar observation can be made when looking at the students' age of arrival in the country of assessment. Years since arrival play an important role in immigrant achievement \u2013 newly or recently arrived 15 year-old immigrant students show poorer performance in all domains including maths skills than immigrant students who arrived in the receiving country at a younger age and had their full compulsory education in the receiving country 11 . 9 The difference between native-born and foreign-born 15 year-olds was documented in the Education and Training Monitor 2014. An online visualisation tool enables country comparisons as regards underachievement in reading, maths and science amongst native-born and foreign-born (http://ec.europa.eu/education/monitor). 10 A third distinction is to differentiate between EU foreign-born and non-EU foreign-born, as is done in Part 2 of the Education and Training Monitor.

First and foremost is socio-economic status, which often overlaps with immigrant background: immigrants to EU countries tend to have lower education and occupational status than the non-immigrant population and underachievement is found disproportionately amongst students with lower socio-economic backgrounds. Indeed, controlling for socio-economic status reduces the achievement gap between migrant and non-migrant students 12 . What remains of the disadvantage faced by immigrant students when accounting for socio- economic status can be explained by a number of other factors, such as language difficulties, cultural factors and issues of prejudice and perception that exist in the host country and its education and training system. All these factors require different policy actions, whether continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers, positive discrimination measures, language support for students or parental guidance. Gender and educational poverty Looking at gender differences in educational performance reveals that in reading literacy, girls greatly outperform boys in all Member States. Moreover, when it comes to educational poverty at age 15, boys are overrepresented: the share of boys across the EU who show underachievement in all three domains tested in PISA \u2013 reading, mathematics and science \u2013 is 61.1% higher than that of girls (Figure 1.1.3) 13 . Figure 1.1.3. Underachievement in reading, maths and science combined, by sex Source : OECD (PISA, 2012). Countries are ordered according to the share of underachievement amongst boys. Within the EU, there are considerable variations regarding the share of low achievement in all three domains combined, and the gender gap varies considerably. In line with overall high shares of low achievement, the share of boys who are low achievers in all three domains is a quarter or more in BG (34.8%), CY (33.0%) and RO (27.7%). Particularly low rates of boys who do not reach PISA level 2 in any of the three domains can be found in EE (4.2%), FI (7.2%) and PL (7.6%). 12 European Commission (2013), PISA 2012: EU performance and first inferences regarding education and training policies in Europe (http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/strategic-framework/doc/pisa2012_en.pdf). Further evidence shows, however, that children with an immigrant background tend to be more affected by low socioeconomic status than children with a non-immigrant background, the latter being more \"resilient\" to low socioeconomic status than the former. In other words, low socioeconomic status might be a bigger problem for first- and second-generation immigrant students than for non-immigrant students. See chapter 13 of OECD/European Commission (2015), Indicators of immigrant integration 2015: Settling in (http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/). 13 Taken separately, there are no significant average differences in the share of underachievement in maths and science between boys and girls, with minor advantages of boys in most countries.

        "22 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 In only two Member States are more than 20% of girls underachieving in all three domains: RO (20.1%) and BG (21.6%). On average in the EU, 59.2% of the low achievers are boys. This proportion is higher than two-thirds in four Member States (FI, HR, LT, EL) 14 . There are many reasons for the higher educational poverty among 15 year-old boys. Research suggests that boys are more strongly affected by low socio-economic status than girls, and that the gender gap is much smaller amongst those with high socio-economic status 15 . Evidence also shows that, compared to girls, boys spend less time doing homework and reading and more time playing video games, all of which show correlations with proficiency in the different domains tested in PISA 2012 16 . Part 2 of the Education and Training Monitor shows that these gender gaps echo into upper secondary and tertiary education. In 2014, women have reached both Europe 2020 headline targets in the field of education: an early school leaving rate below 10% and a tertiary education attainment rate above 40%. But women continue to be under-represented in the STEM fields of study and over-represented in teacher education, resulting in gender imbalances in the teaching profession as well (Section 3.2). Structural and institutional factors 17 This section has provided only a brief overview of how multidimensional educational poverty is, adding some context to the inequalities in education attainment levels that will be illustrated in Part 2 of the Education and Training Monitor. In order to gain a full picture of educational poverty, structural and institutional factors need to be considered as well. Out of the multitude of structural and institutional factors at play, the Education and Training Monitor singles out those that are most commonly associated with educational disadvantage in general, and those that could tackle underachievement in particular. Firstly, in terms of access to school education, parents are often constrained in their choice of school by admission policies. Access to schools and school choice are more limited in the case of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds and minority ethnic groups. This is sometimes due to admission policies used in over-subscribed schools that often give preference to families already living in the area. Widening access and preventing drop-out at all levels of education 18 requires flexible, permeable education pathways, stronger continuity to ease transitions, but also specific outreach strategies or positive discrimination measures in favour of under- represented groups. Monitoring frameworks, complemented by specific targets for under- represented groups, are an essential part of such policy measures. Secondly, there is abundant evidence on the effects of ability grouping ( tracking ) in schools. The approach taken and the timing of these activities differ between countries. The use of tracking has declined over the years but is now more highly concentrated in schools serving 14 For detailed analyses about gender differences, see OECD (2015), The ABC of gender equality in education: Aptitude, behaviour, confidence (http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/). 15 See page 42 of European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2014), Tackling early leaving from education and training in Europe: Strategies, policies and measures (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice). 16 Ibid.

The structural indicators pertain to 2014/15; see the country reports in Volume 2 of the Education and Training Monitor 2015 for the latest information on policy measures and reforms (http://ec.europa.eu/education/monitor). Early tracking increases inequality in achievement. When children are separated into different types of schools at an early age, some may end up in schools that do not enable access to higher education 19 . Lower socio-economic status and immigrant youth are more likely to attend a vocational track or a track that does not offer direct access to tertiary education. It has been shown that tracking can lead to self-fulfilling prophecies in which students live up (or down) to teacher and societal expectations 20 . Thirdly, some structural characteristics of EU education and training systems pertain specifically to underachievement in basic skills. As can be seen in Table 1.1.1, the majority of Member 19 Immigrant students, furthermore, tend to be concentrated in schools where there are high proportions of children with poorly educated parents. This results in a significant disadvantage for these immigrant students when compared to their peers in schools with few such children, suggesting that parental education is of greater influence than immigrant background. See OECD (2013), PISA 2012 Results Volume II: Excellence through Equity. Giving every student the chance to succeed ; and OECD/European Commission (2015), Indicators of immigrant integration 2015: Settling in (http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/). 20 Further evidence of the impact of tracking can be found in studies drawing on international surveys of student achievement. Early tracking has been found to have a negative effect on mean performance of students, especially regarding reading and science proficiency. In particular, the practice seems to have a negative effect on the academic performance of underachieving students, possibly due to negative peer and environmental effects.

As can be seen in Table 1.1.1, the majority of Member 19 Immigrant students, furthermore, tend to be concentrated in schools where there are high proportions of children with poorly educated parents. This results in a significant disadvantage for these immigrant students when compared to their peers in schools with few such children, suggesting that parental education is of greater influence than immigrant background. See OECD (2013), PISA 2012 Results Volume II: Excellence through Equity. Giving every student the chance to succeed ; and OECD/European Commission (2015), Indicators of immigrant integration 2015: Settling in (http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/). 20 Further evidence of the impact of tracking can be found in studies drawing on international surveys of student achievement. Early tracking has been found to have a negative effect on mean performance of students, especially regarding reading and science proficiency. In particular, the practice seems to have a negative effect on the academic performance of underachieving students, possibly due to negative peer and environmental effects.

        "24 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 States conduct national tests (except EL and BE de), have recently produced national reports on achievement (except for BG, DE and EL) and use performance data in external school evaluation (except for BG, EE, EL, HR, IT, CY, SI, SK, FI). Compared to national testing and reporting of the mother tongue and mathematics, somewhat less emphasis is placed on assessing science performance. Finally, various structural and institutional characteristics of the teaching profession are commonly associated with educational disadvantage in general and underachievement as a specific example. Just over a third of the Member States have central guidelines on underachievement as a topic in initial teacher education (Table 1.1.1) and, as Section 2.1 will show, only BE fr/nl, ES, LU, HU, PT and RO include the issue of early school leaving in initial teacher education and CPD. CPD is particularly underexploited in this regard; the share of teachers expressing the need for CPD is striking in domains such as special needs education (58%), individualised learning (49%) and career guidance (42%) 21 . Key findings and policy relevance Educational poverty is one of the greatest societal challenges in Europe. The unequal distribution of underachievement means potential talent amongst young people in Europe is being wasted, thus neglecting the economic growth it could generate, and contributing to persisting marginalisation and inequalities in society. The persisting determinants of underachievement are, inter alia, socio-economic status, immigrant background and gender. But structural and institutional characteristics also play their part, with access to quality education and ability grouping still penalising under-represented groups disproportionately. Subsequent sections of this report elaborate on the key measures to improve the inclusiveness of education and training. 1.2. Spending cuts: the financial commitment to education Public expenditure on education Investing in education is crucial to support both short-term recovery and long-term economic growth. In the EU as a whole, public expenditure on education started declining in real terms in 2011. With a third consecutive drop in 2013 (-0.5%), public expenditure on education has now recorded a 3.2% fall since 2010 (Table 1.2.1). A closer look at country performance reveals that the most recent drop of 2013 is due to expenditure decreases in eleven Member States (DK, EE, IE, ES, IT, NL, PL, PT, RO, FI, UK) 22 . The persistence of this negative trend is not due to one-off cuts all across Europe, but rather to consecutive reductions in the same group of Member States. In fact, IT has recorded a decrease of its education budget for six consecutive years (since 2008), ES for four years, IE, NL, FI, PT and UK for three and RO for two. On the other hand, positive trends are also persistent over time, as data for BE, LT, LU and MT show. When measured as a share of total public expenditure, the 2013 EU average education expenditure stands at 10.3%, a figure that has remained static in most of the Member States. This means that, in nominal terms, the budget for education and the total budget followed 21 See Section 3.2 of this report for further information. 22 Four of them (IE, ES, IT, RO) recorded a level of education expenditure below the EU average, when measured as a share of both GDP and total public expenditure, for all four years covered in Table 1.2.1. Italy, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Finland, Portugal and the UK have all decreased education expenditure for at least three consecutive years 25 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 similar dynamics, leaving the ratio between the two constant and suggesting that the cuts were not specifically targeted at education 23 .

The share of public expenditure devoted to education, as shown in Table 1.2.1, can also be considered as a means to quantify the commitment of governments toward the sector 24 . Indeed, education expenditure figures indicate the spending choice of public authorities on education in comparison to other policy areas, and, accordingly, the relative importance of education on the policy agenda. Interpreted as such, the commitment toward education varies significantly across the EU: from 7.6% recorded in EL to more than twice as much in CY, LV and LT. However, two caveats are worth highlighting in this descriptive, cross-national assessment of education spending. Firstly, spending cuts in some Member States reflect attempts at improving the sector's efficiency, aiming to generate the same outcomes while consuming fewer resources 25 . These kinds of efficiency gains are difficult to determine, as their measurement requires an agreed upon conceptual framework, defining all the multifaceted aspects of, inter alia , the outcomes of education, and when they are to manifest themselves. 23 In 2013, expenditure on education as share of GDP stagnated too, showing a very similar pattern to that of education expenditure as share the total public expenditure (see the first columns of Table 1.1.1). In fact, the two measures show a very high degree of correlation. 24 See, for instance, JRC-CRELL (2013), Public financing of education in EU countries: A cross-country systematic analysis (https://crell.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). 25 Possible ways to relate education outcomes to expenditures were investigated by the Indicator Expert Group on Education Investment , set up in the framework of the Standing Group on Indicators and Benchmarks (SGIB).

As shown in Figure 1.2.2, the bulk of the education budget is devoted to wages ( compensation of employees ) and intermediate consumption , which includes the purchase of goods and services needed to provide education services, such as electricity, stationary, paper, books, cleaning services, etc. In 2013, wages accounted for about 60% of total public expenditure in the EU and fluctuated between 44% in UK and 80% in EL. Intermediate consumption was the second largest budget item in most of the countries, and accounted for about 17% of the total in the EU. Figure 1.2.3.

As shown in Figure 1.2.2, the bulk of the education budget is devoted to wages ( compensation of employees ) and intermediate consumption , which includes the purchase of goods and services needed to provide education services, such as electricity, stationary, paper, books, cleaning services, etc. In 2013, wages accounted for about 60% of total public expenditure in the EU and fluctuated between 44% in UK and 80% in EL. Intermediate consumption was the second largest budget item in most of the countries, and accounted for about 17% of the total in the EU. Figure 1.2.3.

Typically, only a small share of the education budget is allocated to gross capital formation : about 8% in the EU, and in just four countries this share exceeds 15% (CZ, EE, LV, LU).

Public education expenditure can, finally, be broken down by level of education. This reveals that the budget trends shown at the beginning of this section are not the same across all education levels (Figure 1.2.3) 26 . At the EU level, whereas expenditure on primary and pre-primary education decreased in 2013, the secondary education budget barely changed, and expenditure on tertiary education actually increased. Despite these differences across education levels, no less than seven Member States cut their spending at all three levels (EE, IE, ES, IT, PL, RO, FI) 27 . Household expenditure and student expenses Household expenditure, which also plays a pivotal role in financing the education and training system, has increased in importance in recent years. Figure 1.2.4 shows the aggregate expenditure by households on education, as a proportion of public expenditure on education. This indicator covers spending on all levels of education, as well as expenditure that is not linked to a specific education level. The household share of education expenditure provides a rough measure of the burden borne by households as a whole, as opposed to the burden on the public sector, in financing the education and training system 28 . Figure 1.2.4. Household expenditure as share of public expenditure on education Source: DG EAC elaboration on Eurostat's general government finance and national accounts statistics. Online data code: gov_10a_exp and nama_10_co3_p3 . In 2013, the share of household spending in the EU was about 13% on average, and fluctuated considerably across the Member States: from 36% in EL to no more than 2% in SE. Besides EL, also IE, CY, ES, RO, LV and UK recorded high levels of household contributions (higher than 20%). On the other hand, in EE, BE, FI and SE, household contributions were below 5%. The change over time (2010-2013) is mostly less than one percentage point, except for a notable decrease in EL, and an increase above 5 percentage points in ES, CY and UK. The relatively stable share does not, however, imply that the consumption of education services remained stable. Not only did the public expenditure on education decrease, as illustrated above, but EU average prices of education services rose significantly over the same period 29 . This suggests that consumption of education services actually dropped, unless efficiency gains occurred. 26 The comparison between levels of education is complicated by the fact that some levels of education are compulsory (resulting in very high enrolment rates) and some are non-compulsory (with lower enrolment rates). 27 Note, however, that spending in PL and FI remains above the EU average and in EE significantly above the EU average (as a share of public expenditure). 28 The indicator is, however, to some extent biased, as data are not consolidated and include transfers between the public and private sectors. 29 See page 17 of the Education and Training Monitor 2014 (http://ec.europa.eu/education/monitor). 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% EL IE CY ES RO LV UK HU SK MT BG IT PT EU HR PL SI DE FR AT LU NL LT CZ DK EE BE FI SE 2013 2010 Estonia, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Poland, Romania and Finland cut their spending across all levels of education 29 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 In higher education, household expenditure generally means costs paid by students and their families. One element of these expenses is tuition and administrative fees, which are widespread in the EU. Only in UK-SCT, SE, FI and EL are no fees charged to domestic students 30 . But there is a large variation between higher education systems regarding the proportion of students paying fees, as well as the amount of fees they need to pay and the availability of specific loans to pay fees. Living costs are nearly always the main student expense. Countries rely on different combinations of forms of student support to help students cover living costs, and the proportion of students receiving such support varies widely. In general, Bachelor students tend to receive more public support than Master students 31 . Investments at the EU level A first analysis in Section 1.1 has shown that there is room for improving equitable access to and outcomes of education and training systems throughout Europe. To a certain extent, this requires an increase in the amount of resources invested in those systems. However, effective and efficient investment also implies getting the most out of the resources available. This is particularly important in Member States facing budgetary constraints, but it is naturally a crucial consideration in all education and training systems. The widespread reform of higher education funding systems to introduce a greater focus on outputs and performance is one illustration of how governments are increasingly focusing not simply on absolute levels of spending, but also on the efficiency of investment. While responsibility for the core funding for education and training systems remains firmly with Member States, the EU seeks to support investments at national level. The Investment Plan for Europe , launched by the European Commission in 2014 is a new mechanism for doing this. The mainstay of the plan is the creation of the European Fund for Strategic Investment , backed up by an EU guarantee. The fund aims to attract private capital to invest in projects that are worthwhile but \u2013 without the first-loss guarantee offered by the fund \u2013 would appear too risky. Education and training are among the main objectives of the fund, as the investment plan recognises its central role in ensuring future productivity growth. Activities that have a potential economic return and can therefore attract private investors stand to benefit from the fund 32 . The EU is already supporting the education and training systems of the Member States through the European Structural and Investment Funds and in particular through the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund, which finance a broad range of projects on education. In the programming cycle 2007-2013, these projects aimed at supporting reforms of the education and training systems, increasing participation in education, developing human potential in research and innovation, as well as improving education and childcare 30 See chapter 8 of EUROSTUDENT V (http://www.eurostudent.eu/results/reports); and chapter 4 of European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2015), The European Higher Education Area in 2015: Bologna Process Implementation Report (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/eurydice). 31 The design of student support and fee systems has implications for participation and completion of higher education (addressed in Section 2.2). 32 The investment plan includes other initiatives beyond the new fund: it intends to further simplify the business environment, in order to encourage private investors from the EU and outside to place their capital into European ventures; it promotes the preparation, development and financial structuring of projects susceptible to benefit from the new fund as well as from other existing forms of support (structural funds, EU programmes, other credit opportunities); and it allows governments with sound public finance strategies to invest more in growth-friendly policies, including education and training, without infringing the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. Education is among the main objectives of the new European Fund for Strategic Investment Examples of recent policy measures in Member States In IT, the 2015 Stability Law created a specific fund to finance the ongoing reform of the school system, endowed with EUR 1 billion in 2015 and EUR 3 billion from 2016. In LV, a new quality-targeting financing model of higher education is being developed. It will include three pillars: (1) base funding; (2) performance-oriented funding; and (3) targeted funding for innovation and development. NL foresees an annual investment of EUR 600 million for 2016- 2019 to be used in areas such as preventing students from repeating school years, appropriate teaching methods, better quality for technical VET and the internationalisation of higher education.

        "32 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 Part 2. Education attainment levels of young people across Europe Education is a growth-enhancing investment that nurtures competitiveness and innovation but also promotes social inclusion and engaged citizenship. These dual objectives of education are well reflected in the twofold headline target of the Europe 2020 strategy. One part sets a minimum threshold for education attainment; the other is concerned with expanding higher levels of education. They need to go hand in hand in order to steer forward reforms in the education sector that truly enable Europe to reap the best outcomes from the widest possible range of students. Part 2 of the Education and Training Monitor is about education attainment levels across Europe. It reveals that, despite an overall progress towards the headline targets, both early school leaving and tertiary education attainment are marked by inequalities and an inability of Member States to tackle these inequalities head-on. 2.1. Early leavers from education and training: raising the bar in school education The EU regards upper secondary education attainment as a prerequisite for better labour market integration, lowering chances of poverty and social exclusion, and at the same time setting a minimum guarantee for continued personal development and active citizenship. Those 18 to 24 year-olds who fail to reach this threshold are called early leavers from education and training 33 . Theirs is a complex, multi-faceted problem that often originated long before they leave the education and training system, and echoes on until long after 34 . Figure 2.1.1. Early school leaving and target levels Source: Eurostat (LFS, 2014). Online data code: t2020_40. The indicator covers the share of the population aged 18-24 having attained ISCED level 0 to 2 and not receiving any formal or non-formal education or training in the four weeks preceding the survey. National targets follow different definitions of the indicator in some countries (see Table 2.1.1). Data for HR have low reliability due to the small sample size. The latest available data (2014) show that the EU average early school leaving rate stands at 11.1%, down 0.8 percentage points from 2013. Nineteen Member States have reached the Europe 2020 headline target of an early school leaving rate below 10% (HR, SI, PL, CZ, LT, LU, SE, SK, CY, IE, AT, DK, LV, FR, NL, EL, FI, DE, BE), up from eighteen last year. BE joins this group mainly due to methodological changes. EL, furthermore, dropped below 10% for the first 33 The terms early school leavers and early leavers from education and training are used interchangeably in this report. 34 See the 2013 final report of the Thematic Working Group on early school leaving at: http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/strategic-framework/doc/esl-group-report_en.pdf. 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% ES MT RO PT IT BG UK EE HU EU BE DE FI EL NL FR LV DK AT IE CY SK SE LU LT CZ PL SI HR Early school leaving rate 2014 Europe 2020 headline target National target 33 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 time, whereas EE saw an increase in its early school leaving rate from 9.7% in 2013 to 11.4% in 2014. Fifteen Member States have now reached their respective national targets (HR, SI, CZ, LT, LU, SE, CY, IE, AT, DK, LV, FR, EL, DE, IT). New to this group are HR, IE, FR, EL and IT, although methodological breaks in time series account for part of this success, as well as widely different levels of ambition in setting the national targets (see Table 2.1.1). Country performance vis-\u00e0-vis the Europe 2020 headline target Figure 2.1.2 illustrates how the EU as a whole is on track to reach the Europe 2020 headline target of an early school leaving rate below 10%, nevertheless hiding significant discrepancies between Member States when it comes to the progress made between 2011 and 2014. Four groups of countries can meaningfully be distinguished: A. Group A features all the Member States that have reached the headline target while still making significant progress in reducing their early school leaving rates even further. The vast majority of countries in this group have also reached their respective national targets, as listed in the last column of Table 2.1.1. B. Group B comprises countries that still have some way to go to reaching the headline target but all of them have made significant progress between 2011 and 2014. IT owes this position to a solid progress during the period assessed, but it reached its national target for the first time in 2014 also because it has the least ambitious national target of all Member States (16%).

They need to go hand in hand in order to steer forward reforms in the education sector that truly enable Europe to reap the best outcomes from the widest possible range of students. Part 2 of the Education and Training Monitor is about education attainment levels across Europe. It reveals that, despite an overall progress towards the headline targets, both early school leaving and tertiary education attainment are marked by inequalities and an inability of Member States to tackle these inequalities head-on. 2.1. Early leavers from education and training: raising the bar in school education The EU regards upper secondary education attainment as a prerequisite for better labour market integration, lowering chances of poverty and social exclusion, and at the same time setting a minimum guarantee for continued personal development and active citizenship. Those 18 to 24 year-olds who fail to reach this threshold are called early leavers from education and training 33 . Theirs is a complex, multi-faceted problem that often originated long before they leave the education and training system, and echoes on until long after 34 . Figure 2.1.1. Early school leaving and target levels Source: Eurostat (LFS, 2014). Online data code: t2020_40. The indicator covers the share of the population aged 18-24 having attained ISCED level 0 to 2 and not receiving any formal or non-formal education or training in the four weeks preceding the survey. National targets follow different definitions of the indicator in some countries (see Table 2.1.1). Data for HR have low reliability due to the small sample size. The latest available data (2014) show that the EU average early school leaving rate stands at 11.1%, down 0.8 percentage points from 2013. Nineteen Member States have reached the Europe 2020 headline target of an early school leaving rate below 10% (HR, SI, PL, CZ, LT, LU, SE, SK, CY, IE, AT, DK, LV, FR, NL, EL, FI, DE, BE), up from eighteen last year. BE joins this group mainly due to methodological changes. EL, furthermore, dropped below 10% for the first 33 The terms early school leavers and early leavers from education and training are used interchangeably in this report. 34 See the 2013 final report of the Thematic Working Group on early school leaving at: http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/strategic-framework/doc/esl-group-report_en.pdf. 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% ES MT RO PT IT BG UK EE HU EU BE DE FI EL NL FR LV DK AT IE CY SK SE LU LT CZ PL SI HR Early school leaving rate 2014 Europe 2020 headline target National target 33 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 time, whereas EE saw an increase in its early school leaving rate from 9.7% in 2013 to 11.4% in 2014. Fifteen Member States have now reached their respective national targets (HR, SI, CZ, LT, LU, SE, CY, IE, AT, DK, LV, FR, EL, DE, IT). New to this group are HR, IE, FR, EL and IT, although methodological breaks in time series account for part of this success, as well as widely different levels of ambition in setting the national targets (see Table 2.1.1). Country performance vis-\u00e0-vis the Europe 2020 headline target Figure 2.1.2 illustrates how the EU as a whole is on track to reach the Europe 2020 headline target of an early school leaving rate below 10%, nevertheless hiding significant discrepancies between Member States when it comes to the progress made between 2011 and 2014. Four groups of countries can meaningfully be distinguished: A. Group A features all the Member States that have reached the headline target while still making significant progress in reducing their early school leaving rates even further. The vast majority of countries in this group have also reached their respective national targets, as listed in the last column of Table 2.1.1. B. Group B comprises countries that still have some way to go to reaching the headline target but all of them have made significant progress between 2011 and 2014. IT owes this position to a solid progress during the period assessed, but it reached its national target for the first time in 2014 also because it has the least ambitious national target of all Member States (16%).

Inequalities within Member States The strongest determinant of early school leaving rates is the intergenerational transmission of education attainment 36 . This links back to socio-economic status and the home learning environment, discussed in Section 1.1, affecting education opportunities and outcomes. Not 35 The number of early school leavers in SI is so low that the volatility of its change over time should be interpreted with caution. 36 For a more comprehensive, up to date overview of the determinants of early school leaving, see European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice and Cedefop (2014), Tackling early leaving from education and training in Europe: Strategies, policies and measures (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/). RO, BG, HU and EE will have to strengthen policy efforts to reduce early school leaving rates 35 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 surprisingly, early school leaving rates correlate strongly with equivalent education attainment rates of the parental cohort of these early school leavers 37 . Early school leaving rates are, furthermore, significantly higher amongst men than amongst women (Table 2.1.1). In fact, on average, women have already reached the Europe 2020 headline target of an early school leaving rate below 10%. Male early school leaving rates are at least twice as high as those of women in CY, LV, LU, SI, PL and EE. The average gender gap has narrowed slightly in recent years, although EE, FI, LU, BG, CY, RO, HU and PL all show increasing gender gaps to various extents. Data for foreign-born individuals have to be interpreted with some caution, as they are only available for a number of Member States, with many of them yielding sample sizes too small to be fully reliable. Nonetheless, those born abroad are on average twice as likely to leave the education and training system early when compared to native-born individuals 38 . Socio- economic status underlies a large part of this disadvantage, but issues associated specifically with immigration are at play too, such as language barriers and settling into a new context 39 . Figure 2.1.3. Foreign-born early school leaving by years since arrival in the country Source : Eurostat (LFS, 2014), based on a May 2015 extraction. Note: the indicator shows the EU average rate of early school leaving (18 to 24 year-olds). The first-generation migrant 18 to 24 year-olds are a diverse group of individuals. Some reached the compulsory schooling age before arriving in the country where they currently live, whereas others migrated before compulsory schooling even started. Figure 2.1.3 confirms that early school leaving rates amongst those who arrived in the country before the start of compulsory education are no different than the average early school leaving rate of the native- born population shown in Table 2.1.1. Having just arrived in the country of current residence only has a relatively small effect, as many of these 18 to 24 year-olds were able to finish their upper secondary education in the origin country. 37 Eurostat (LFS), online data code edat_lfs_9903 . For more on this contextual indicator, see https://crell.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ET2020Indicators/. Moreover, the social context of the school has an additional effect on student outcomes, over and above a student\u2019s background. Early school leaving rates tend to be higher in schools with a concentration of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. 38 The difference in early school leaving rates between those born in another EU country and those in a non-EU country (2.9 percentage points on average, see Table 2.1.1) is particularly significant for women: 3.8 percentage points compared to only 0.5 percentage points for men. 39 See Section 1.1, as well as a 2015 policy brief from the SIRIUS network: http://www.sirius- migrationeducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SIRIUS-EarlySchoolLeaving-FINAL.pdf. 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 E a r l y l e a v e r s f r o m e d u c a t i o n a n d t r a i n i n g Years since arrival 10.3% average Improvement is to be made in integrating foreign- born students arriving during or towards the end of their school education MEP ET Monitor 2015 vol 1.indd 34 27/10/15 15:01 ",

        "36 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 The foreign-born students requiring most attention are those who arrived towards the end of their compulsory schooling age or in the middle of their school education. Specific support is to be intensified for foreign-born students at risk of leaving an education and training system they have not been able to find their way in. This illustrates the heterogeneity of the foreign-born population, but also hints at education's role in immigrant integration, put under pressure by the recent refugee crisis 40 . Finally, although comparative data is scarce, the available evidence states unambiguously that students hampered by a disability 41 and students belonging to a minority ethnic group 42 are more likely to leave school before finishing upper secondary education. A closer look at participation, completion and work At 18, all young people across Europe have reached the end of their compulsory schooling age 43 . An average of 80.4% still participates in education and training, but this participation rate drops to 29.2% for 24 year-olds 44 . Moreover, despite the different structures of education and training systems across Europe 45 , 60.5% of 18 to 24 year-olds have attained upper secondary education or post-secondary education, and 12.7% have already attained a degree at the tertiary level. Still, as much as 26.8% of this age group has attained no more than lower secondary education. Figure 2.1.4. 18 to 24 year-olds with at most lower secondary education attainment Source : Eurostat (LFS, 2014). Online data codes: edat_lfs_9903 , edat_lfse_14 and edat_lfse_15 . Figure 2.1.4 shows the country-specific rates of at most lower secondary education attainment amongst 18 to 24 year-olds. In most Member States, a large share of these young people is in formal upper secondary education. This may be due to different phenomena, whether the structure of the education and training system, the prevalence of grade retention or the availability of second chance education as a compensation measure. It is nevertheless clear that non-formal learning is rarely used as such compensation measure, with an average of only 0.8% of 18 to 24 year-olds in non-formal learning after having left formal education without upper secondary education attainment. Figure 2.1.4 also raises the broader question of how efficiently students flow through upper secondary education. The OECD's Education at a Glance 2014 measures the share of students 40 See also OECD/European Commission (2015), Indicators of immigrant integration 2015: Settling in (www.oecd- ilibrary.org). In 2016, the JRC's Centre for Research on Education and Lifelong Learning (CRELL) will look further into the effect of years since arrival and age of arrival. 41 See Section 2.1 of the Education and Training Monitor 2014 at http://ec.europa.eu/education/monitor. 42 For instance, see the findings on Roma students from the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) at http://fra.europa.eu/en/survey/2012/roma-pilot-survey. 43 European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2014), Compulsory education in Europe 2014/15 \u2013 Eurydice Facts and Figures (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/). 44 Eurostat (UOE, 2013), online data code educ_uoe_enra05 . 45 European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2014), The structure of the European education systems 2014/15: Schematic diagrams \u2013 Eurydice Facts and Figures (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/). 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% DK LU ES DE PT IT RO NL EE FI LV HU EU SE PL SK MT BG LT CZ BE SI IE AT FR UK EL HR CY Formal education Non-formal education Not in education or training 37 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 entering upper secondary education for the first time and completing this level successfully after the theoretical duration of the programme 46 . The indicator can be regarded as a proxy for the capacity of upper secondary education to engage students to complete a programme within its theoretical duration. Of the eighteen Member States covered by the data, seven reveal completion rates below 70% (LU, FR, DK, ES, NL, IT, UK) and only four above 80% (HU, EL, SK, IE). The 18 to 24 year-olds that have left formal and non-formal education before obtaining an upper secondary degree are the early leavers from education and training. Their current labour market status is a telling illustration of the causes and consequences of early leaving. On the one hand, the unemployment rate amongst early school leavers was 40.8% in 2014 47 , compared to an overall youth unemployment rate of 20.9% 48 . On the other, the large share of inactivity suggests individual background characteristics that might have contributed to an early exit from the education and training system in the first place 49 . Examples of measures to tackle early school leaving The 2011 Council Recommendation on policies to reduce early school leaving features a detailed policy framework for evidence-based, comprehensive national strategies to tackle the issue 50 . Comprehensive strategies comprise a mix of policies, coordination across different policy sectors and the integration of measures supporting the reduction of early school leaving into all relevant policies aimed at children and young people. Crucially, these strategies should cover prevention, intervention and compensation elements, tailored to the contexts in each Member State. According to the latest country-specific analysis, the majority of Member States has implemented the Council Recommendation either through adopting explicit comprehensive strategies (BE nl, BG, FR, HU, MT, NL, AT, RO) or other national policies (CY, DE, DK, EE, ES, IE, IT, LT, LU, PL, FI, SE, UK). Other countries have only partly or not yet implemented comprehensive strategies or national policies.

        "36 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 The foreign-born students requiring most attention are those who arrived towards the end of their compulsory schooling age or in the middle of their school education. Specific support is to be intensified for foreign-born students at risk of leaving an education and training system they have not been able to find their way in. This illustrates the heterogeneity of the foreign-born population, but also hints at education's role in immigrant integration, put under pressure by the recent refugee crisis 40 . Finally, although comparative data is scarce, the available evidence states unambiguously that students hampered by a disability 41 and students belonging to a minority ethnic group 42 are more likely to leave school before finishing upper secondary education. A closer look at participation, completion and work At 18, all young people across Europe have reached the end of their compulsory schooling age 43 . An average of 80.4% still participates in education and training, but this participation rate drops to 29.2% for 24 year-olds 44 . Moreover, despite the different structures of education and training systems across Europe 45 , 60.5% of 18 to 24 year-olds have attained upper secondary education or post-secondary education, and 12.7% have already attained a degree at the tertiary level. Still, as much as 26.8% of this age group has attained no more than lower secondary education. Figure 2.1.4. 18 to 24 year-olds with at most lower secondary education attainment Source : Eurostat (LFS, 2014). Online data codes: edat_lfs_9903 , edat_lfse_14 and edat_lfse_15 . Figure 2.1.4 shows the country-specific rates of at most lower secondary education attainment amongst 18 to 24 year-olds. In most Member States, a large share of these young people is in formal upper secondary education. This may be due to different phenomena, whether the structure of the education and training system, the prevalence of grade retention or the availability of second chance education as a compensation measure. It is nevertheless clear that non-formal learning is rarely used as such compensation measure, with an average of only 0.8% of 18 to 24 year-olds in non-formal learning after having left formal education without upper secondary education attainment. Figure 2.1.4 also raises the broader question of how efficiently students flow through upper secondary education. The OECD's Education at a Glance 2014 measures the share of students 40 See also OECD/European Commission (2015), Indicators of immigrant integration 2015: Settling in (www.oecd- ilibrary.org). In 2016, the JRC's Centre for Research on Education and Lifelong Learning (CRELL) will look further into the effect of years since arrival and age of arrival. 41 See Section 2.1 of the Education and Training Monitor 2014 at http://ec.europa.eu/education/monitor. 42 For instance, see the findings on Roma students from the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) at http://fra.europa.eu/en/survey/2012/roma-pilot-survey. 43 European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2014), Compulsory education in Europe 2014/15 \u2013 Eurydice Facts and Figures (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/). 44 Eurostat (UOE, 2013), online data code educ_uoe_enra05 . 45 European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2014), The structure of the European education systems 2014/15: Schematic diagrams \u2013 Eurydice Facts and Figures (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/). 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% DK LU ES DE PT IT RO NL EE FI LV HU EU SE PL SK MT BG LT CZ BE SI IE AT FR UK EL HR CY Formal education Non-formal education Not in education or training 37 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 entering upper secondary education for the first time and completing this level successfully after the theoretical duration of the programme 46 . The indicator can be regarded as a proxy for the capacity of upper secondary education to engage students to complete a programme within its theoretical duration. Of the eighteen Member States covered by the data, seven reveal completion rates below 70% (LU, FR, DK, ES, NL, IT, UK) and only four above 80% (HU, EL, SK, IE). The 18 to 24 year-olds that have left formal and non-formal education before obtaining an upper secondary degree are the early leavers from education and training. Their current labour market status is a telling illustration of the causes and consequences of early leaving. On the one hand, the unemployment rate amongst early school leavers was 40.8% in 2014 47 , compared to an overall youth unemployment rate of 20.9% 48 . On the other, the large share of inactivity suggests individual background characteristics that might have contributed to an early exit from the education and training system in the first place 49 . Examples of measures to tackle early school leaving The 2011 Council Recommendation on policies to reduce early school leaving features a detailed policy framework for evidence-based, comprehensive national strategies to tackle the issue 50 . Comprehensive strategies comprise a mix of policies, coordination across different policy sectors and the integration of measures supporting the reduction of early school leaving into all relevant policies aimed at children and young people. Crucially, these strategies should cover prevention, intervention and compensation elements, tailored to the contexts in each Member State. According to the latest country-specific analysis, the majority of Member States has implemented the Council Recommendation either through adopting explicit comprehensive strategies (BE nl, BG, FR, HU, MT, NL, AT, RO) or other national policies (CY, DE, DK, EE, ES, IE, IT, LT, LU, PL, FI, SE, UK).

Note: * = UK-ENG, UK-NIR and UK-WLS; ** = both compulsory in the curriculum and provided by school guidance services in lower and upper secondary education. The structural indicators pertain to 2013/14; see the country reports in Volume 2 of the Education and Training Monitor 2015 for the latest information on policy measures and reforms (http://ec.europa.eu/education/monitor). Data based on student registers, with the potential of mapping even the most marginalised issues, are used in seventeen Member States for producing national statistics on early leavers, whereas six Member States (CZ, HR, CY, HU, RO, SK) plus BE de and UK-NIR collect no other data than those for the EU Labour Force Survey (LFS) 51 . The remaining countries (DE, ES, FR, SI, SE) use national surveys or other statistics for the better understanding of early school leavers. 51 For more recent information on policy measures and reforms in HU and RO, see the box on the previous page, plus the corresponding country reports at http://ec.europa.eu/education/monitor. 39 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 Table 2.1.2 also mentions other possible elements of a comprehensive strategy. All Member States have developed some policies to combat early leaving, especially in the area of flexible and permeable education pathways. But well-managed, flexible transitions between levels and types of education, and from school to work, require high-quality, up-to-date, and personalised guidance and counselling services. Only in about half of the EU is education and career guidance provided by in-school guidance services and part of the compulsory curriculum in both lower and upper secondary education. One of the crucial policy areas that needs further development across virtually all Member States is raising awareness among teachers of the problem of early leaving and encouraging the development of skills needed to prevent it. Covering the phenomenon in initial teacher education (ITE) and continuing professional development (CPD) also contributes to the quality of the education and career guidance that is so crucial to tackling early school leaving. Indeed, teachers report a need for professional development in the area, particularly in dealing with students at high risk of early school leaving 52 . A contributing factor to the high risk of early school leaving amongst students with an immigrant background is the fact that the language spoken at home does not correspond to the language of instruction. Apart from BG, IE, HR, HU, NL and UK, all countries have language support measures in place for students with a different mother tongue. But broader positive discrimination measures, which provide targeted support to students and schools in disadvantaged areas 53 , are less common across the EU, with little over half of the Member States having such active policy measures in place. Key findings and policy relevance Upper secondary education attainment sets the minimum standard for further learning or labour market integration, and helps individuals to become active citizens. Yet 11.1% of 18 to 24 year- olds have left education and training without completing an upper secondary programme. About 60% of these early school leavers now face either unemployment or inactivity. Further progress cannot go without a profound policy effort to tackle education inequalities and an active focus on those most at risk of early leaving. A qualitative assessment reveals that such targeted measures are often still missing in teachers' education and training, students' guidance and governments' support to disadvantaged areas. Additional efforts are also needed to enhance collaboration and the coordination of policies to raise the bar in school education. 2.2. Tertiary education attainment: widening access and reducing dropout The EU has seen a massive expansion of higher education in the last decade or so. The rate of tertiary education attainment amongst 30 to 34 year-olds stood at 23.6% in 2002 and, in twelve years' time, increased by no less than 14.3 percentage points to 37.9%. Across Europe, higher education policy increasingly focusses on the question of how to enhance quality and relevance (Section 3.3). But the expansion of higher education has not benefitted all, and the issue of widening access (bringing more people in) and reducing drop-out rates (ensuring people complete their studies) are still very much priorities. 52 European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2015), Eurydice Brief: Tackling Early Leaving from Education and Training in Europe (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/). 53 Early school leaving has a strong geographical dimension, with rates varying significantly between regions (Eurostat online data code: edat_lfse_16 ) and between cities and rural areas (Eurostat online data code: edat_lfse_30 ).

        "40 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 Looking at the latest data (Figure 2.2.1), sixteen Member States have tertiary education attainment rates above the Europe 2020 headline target of 40% (LT, LU, CY, IE, SE, UK, EE 54 , FI, NL, FR, DK, BE, ES, PL, SI, AT) 55 . Twelve Member States have reached their respective national target (LT, CY, SE, EE, FI, NL, DK, SI, AT, LV, EL, HU). AT has joined both groups for the first time formally, due to an improvement of the international classification of education attainment 56 . Figure 2.2.1. Tertiary education attainment and target levels Source : Eurostat (LFS, 2014). Online data code: t2020_41 . Note: The indicator covers the share of the population aged 30- 34 years having successfully completed ISCED level 5 to 8. National targets follow different definitions of the indicator in some countries (see Table 2.2.1). Country performance vis-\u00e0-vis the Europe 2020 headline target To better gauge progress in across the Member States, Figure 2.2.2 plots the average annual change in tertiary education attainment rates against the data shown in the bar chart above. Three groups of countries can be distinguished to facilitate the interpretation of the scatterplot: A. Group A features all the Member States that have reached the Europe 2020 headline target (or are very close to reaching it, in the case of LV), and have, moreover, still been making additional progress between 2011 and 2014 57 . The vast majority of these countries have also reached their national targets, or have national targets that are by far the most ambitious of the EU (LU, IE). B. The four countries in Group B have also reached the Europe 2020 headline target, but have not been making significant progress in recent years. BE, ES and FR improved only minimally, whereas FI saw a small average decrease in its tertiary education attainment rate between 2011 and 2014. FI is the only Member State of the four that has reached its national target of 42%. C.

        "40 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 Looking at the latest data (Figure 2.2.1), sixteen Member States have tertiary education attainment rates above the Europe 2020 headline target of 40% (LT, LU, CY, IE, SE, UK, EE 54 , FI, NL, FR, DK, BE, ES, PL, SI, AT) 55 . Twelve Member States have reached their respective national target (LT, CY, SE, EE, FI, NL, DK, SI, AT, LV, EL, HU). AT has joined both groups for the first time formally, due to an improvement of the international classification of education attainment 56 . Figure 2.2.1.

National targets follow different definitions of the indicator in some countries (see Table 2.2.1). Country performance vis-\u00e0-vis the Europe 2020 headline target To better gauge progress in across the Member States, Figure 2.2.2 plots the average annual change in tertiary education attainment rates against the data shown in the bar chart above. Three groups of countries can be distinguished to facilitate the interpretation of the scatterplot: A. Group A features all the Member States that have reached the Europe 2020 headline target (or are very close to reaching it, in the case of LV), and have, moreover, still been making additional progress between 2011 and 2014 57 . The vast majority of these countries have also reached their national targets, or have national targets that are by far the most ambitious of the EU (LU, IE). B. The four countries in Group B have also reached the Europe 2020 headline target, but have not been making significant progress in recent years. BE, ES and FR improved only minimally, whereas FI saw a small average decrease in its tertiary education attainment rate between 2011 and 2014. FI is the only Member State of the four that has reached its national target of 42%. C. Group C comprises countries that are well below the headline target, but all of which have been making significant progress throughout the period assessed.

The only Member State where women show lower tertiary education attainment rates than men is DE (a rate of 32.0% for men versus 30.8% for women) 61 . In LV, SI, PT, BG, EE, IT and HR, the female tertiary education attainment rate is more than 50% higher than the male rate. On average between 2011 and 2014, the gender gap has increased, due to women progressing more quickly than men. Only in FI, DK and NL did the gender gap narrow somewhat. The effect of an immigrant background on tertiary education attainment is not straightforward. This is due to differences in historical migration patterns between countries, combined with professional migration trends in some Member States. For example, in BE, CZ, DK, FR, LU, AT, PT, SE and UK 62 , those born in another EU country have higher tertiary education attainment 61 The average female disadvantage in DE is only visible amongst the 30 to 34 year-olds with a Bachelor's degree (13.4% of women versus 17.1% of men). When it comes to 30 to 34 year-olds with a Master's degree, also DE shows a female advantage (16.0% of women versus 13.3% of men). 62 HR and SI could be added to this list as well, but data lacks reliability due to small sample sizes. 43 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 rates than the native-born 63 . Tertiary education attainment rates amongst foreign-born 30 to 34 year-olds do not necessarily reflect the output of the education and training systems of the countries in which they are living and working. Figure 2.2.3 gives extra insight into tertiary education attainment rates among migrants, illustrating how diverse the group of foreign-born 30 to 34 year-olds really is. Professional migration is likely at play for those who left their country of birth only recently, with an average tertiary education attainment rate that is well beyond the Europe 2020 headline target. Moreover, the average attainment rate of those who arrived in the country well before the start of compulsory schooling is no different than the native-born attainment rate shown in Table 2.2.1. Those most in need of extra support are the ones who immigrated in the middle or towards the end of their compulsory schooling age. These individuals require non-traditional entry routes into higher education, recognising the skills they may have acquired outside of the type of upper secondary education that grants direct access to tertiary education. It illustrates the heterogeneity of the foreign-born population, but also hints at education's role in immigrant integration \u2013 all the more pertinent since the recent refugee crisis 64 . Figure 2.2.3. Foreign-born tertiary attainment by years since arrival in the country Source : Eurostat (LFS, 2014), based on a May 2015 extraction. Note: the indicator shows the EU average rate of tertiary education attainment (30 to 34 year-olds). Yet tackling inequalities in higher education goes beyond the issue of equitable access. In order for higher education not to reproduce existing patterns of disadvantage, governments and institutions need to acknowledge the growing diversity in their student populations. Any policy measure should be designed with this diversity in mind, so that particular groups are not disproportionately under-represented amongst those who complete higher education. Illustrating this diversity of the student population, recent evidence shows that countries differ quite significantly in e.g. the median age of students, the share of students with children, and the share of students perceiving health impairments as a big obstacle to their studies 65 . 63 The difference between EU foreign-born and non-EU foreign-born is most striking amongst women. Women born in another EU country show an average tertiary education attainment rate of 45.3%, 1.8 percentage points higher than native-born women and 10.5 percentage points higher than women born outside the EU. The latter difference between EU and non-EU foreign-born is only 4.4 percentage points for men. Men born outside the EU are, however, lagging behind most with an average tertiary education attainment rate of only 30.8%. 64 See also OECD/European Commission (2015), Indicators of immigrant integration 2015: Settling in (www.oecd- ilibrary.org).

When it comes to 30 to 34 year-olds with a Master's degree, also DE shows a female advantage (16.0% of women versus 13.3% of men). 62 HR and SI could be added to this list as well, but data lacks reliability due to small sample sizes. 43 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 rates than the native-born 63 . Tertiary education attainment rates amongst foreign-born 30 to 34 year-olds do not necessarily reflect the output of the education and training systems of the countries in which they are living and working. Figure 2.2.3 gives extra insight into tertiary education attainment rates among migrants, illustrating how diverse the group of foreign-born 30 to 34 year-olds really is. Professional migration is likely at play for those who left their country of birth only recently, with an average tertiary education attainment rate that is well beyond the Europe 2020 headline target. Moreover, the average attainment rate of those who arrived in the country well before the start of compulsory schooling is no different than the native-born attainment rate shown in Table 2.2.1. Those most in need of extra support are the ones who immigrated in the middle or towards the end of their compulsory schooling age. These individuals require non-traditional entry routes into higher education, recognising the skills they may have acquired outside of the type of upper secondary education that grants direct access to tertiary education. It illustrates the heterogeneity of the foreign-born population, but also hints at education's role in immigrant integration \u2013 all the more pertinent since the recent refugee crisis 64 . Figure 2.2.3. Foreign-born tertiary attainment by years since arrival in the country Source : Eurostat (LFS, 2014), based on a May 2015 extraction. Note: the indicator shows the EU average rate of tertiary education attainment (30 to 34 year-olds). Yet tackling inequalities in higher education goes beyond the issue of equitable access. In order for higher education not to reproduce existing patterns of disadvantage, governments and institutions need to acknowledge the growing diversity in their student populations. Any policy measure should be designed with this diversity in mind, so that particular groups are not disproportionately under-represented amongst those who complete higher education. Illustrating this diversity of the student population, recent evidence shows that countries differ quite significantly in e.g. the median age of students, the share of students with children, and the share of students perceiving health impairments as a big obstacle to their studies 65 . 63 The difference between EU foreign-born and non-EU foreign-born is most striking amongst women. Women born in another EU country show an average tertiary education attainment rate of 45.3%, 1.8 percentage points higher than native-born women and 10.5 percentage points higher than women born outside the EU. The latter difference between EU and non-EU foreign-born is only 4.4 percentage points for men. Men born outside the EU are, however, lagging behind most with an average tertiary education attainment rate of only 30.8%. 64 See also OECD/European Commission (2015), Indicators of immigrant integration 2015: Settling in (www.oecd- ilibrary.org).

        "44 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 A closer look at level and field of study The new international classification of education allows for a closer look at the current share (37.9%) of 30 to 34 year-olds with tertiary education attainment. Tertiary education attainment includes Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees, as well as short-cycle tertiary education and doctoral degrees. Figure 2.2.4 shows that the ratio between Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees varies considerably between Member States. In some countries, in the 30 to 34 year-old cohort, Master\u2019s graduates are much more prevalent than Bachelor\u2019s graduates (PL, PT, AT, SK), while in others it is the other way around (EL, LT, IE). Figure 2.2.4. Tertiary education attainment by higher education degree Source : Eurostat (LFS, 2014), based on a May 2015 extraction. Note: the indicator shows the highest degree attained amongst 30 to 34 year-olds. Sample size is too small for BG, DE, EL, IT, LT and PT to show reliable results for short-cycle tertiary education attainment. More women have short-cycle, Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees than men in virtually all Member States. This means the average female advantage is not due to an over-representation of women in just one category of higher education. Women are, however, under-represented in some fields of study. Figure 2.2.5 looks at all the male and female 30 to 34 year-olds with tertiary education attainment by the field they obtained their degree in 66 . Degrees in STEM fields are much more prevalent amongst men, whereas social sciences and humanities are much more common amongst women. Equally striking is the low share of men having attained a higher education degree in teaching. Figure 2.2.5.

The employment rate of recent graduates from tertiary education is considerably higher than the employment rate of recent upper secondary graduates. But as will be discussed in Section 3.4, the tertiary graduate employment rate has not picked up from its drop since 2008 as quickly as the upper secondary graduate employment rate. Although a complex set of factors are at play, this suggests there is room for aligning higher education provision more effectively with the needs of the labour market. Examples of measures to widen access and reduce drop-out Monitoring access and retention is the starting point for a solid understanding of the supply of highly educated individuals. Access and retention are not only a question of increasing numbers, but are also determinants of the social composition of the higher education population.

Areas that require most urgent attention are the non-traditional entry ways into higher education, the setting of targets for under-represented groups and the allocation of extra funding whenever these targets are being reached by higher education institutions. 67 These targets try to tackle gender imbalances or disadvantages for those with an immigrant background or low socio- economic status. Other examples of under-represented groups might include people with disabilities and minority ethnic groups. Examples of recent policy measures in Member States IE presented a package of measures to support a better transition from upper secondary to higher education in April 2015.

        "48 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 Part 3. Policy levers for inclusiveness, quality and relevance Especially in times of budgetary constraints, mutual learning and evidence-based policy making become crucial to detect areas most in need of investment. This goes beyond education attainment levels of young people across Europe. A focus on quality, relevance and inclusiveness is key to making education and training more effective and indeed efficient. This ranges from inclusive, high-quality pre-primary education to continued learning for the low- skilled in particular. Quality and relevance also means aligning education provision with current and future needs of the labour market, and taking full advantage of the potential of digital technologies. 3.1. Early childhood education and care Early childhood education and care (ECEC), which concerns children from birth to the start of compulsory primary schooling, is increasingly recognised as a constitutive part of the education and training system. ECEC not only adds to children's well-being now and in the long term, but also to the foundation of skills and competences that are essential to achieving high learning outcomes later in life 68 . Indeed, participation in ECEC has been associated with higher education outcomes, a reduced risk of early school leaving, the better integration of children of immigrants and the early development of transversal skills such as literacy competences, creative and critical thinking, social behaviour and emotional development 69 . ECEC is particularly beneficial to children from disadvantaged backgrounds, and contributes to tackling educational poverty as set out in Section 1.1. However, several Member States record great regional disparities in terms of ECEC participation, often reflecting socio-economic divides, or gaps between Roma and non-Roma children 70 . RO and SK received a 2015 country- specific recommendation on ECEC provision, both with the objective of targeting participation of disadvantaged groups in education and more specifically increasing participation rates of Roma children in ECEC 71 . Participation in ECEC The ET 2020 benchmark on ECEC focuses on children between the age of 4 and the starting age of compulsory primary education 72 . Although the EU as a whole is close to meeting the 95% target, with several Member States having already exceeded it (BE, DK, DE, IE, ES, FR, IT, LU, MT, NL, SE, UK), the latest data (2013) shows no significant change in ECEC participation across the EU (93.9% in both 2012 and 2013). Overall stagnation in ECEC progress hints at the difficulty of further improving near-universal participation rates in some of the (larger) Member States. But it is mainly due to the fact that, 68 OECD (2015), Skills for Social Progress: The Power of Social and Emotional Skills . 69 See OJ 2011/C 175/03; OJ 2013/112/EU; European Commission (2014), Study on the effective use of early childhood education and care in preventing early school leaving (http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/school/early- childhood_en.htm); and OECD (2014), International Migration Outlook 2014 (http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/). 70 See the contextual indicators at https://crell.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ET2020Indicators; European Commission (2014), Inequality in the use of childcare: Research note no 8/2014 ; and FRA/UNDP (2012), The Situation on Roma in 11 EU Member States: Survey results at a glance (http://fra.europa.eu/). 71 In July 2015, the Council approved country-specific recommendations for each Member State. See http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/country-specific-recommendations/index_en.htm. 72 The starting age for primary education varies across Member States, as can be seen in the last column of Table 3.1.1. Examples of recent policy measures in Member States At the end of 2014, CZ adopted legislation to enable employers to provide childcare services for their employees' children from the age of 1. In 2014, BE nl for the first time adopted a pedagogical framework for working with children under 2 \u00bd years.

        "48 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 Part 3. Policy levers for inclusiveness, quality and relevance Especially in times of budgetary constraints, mutual learning and evidence-based policy making become crucial to detect areas most in need of investment. This goes beyond education attainment levels of young people across Europe. A focus on quality, relevance and inclusiveness is key to making education and training more effective and indeed efficient. This ranges from inclusive, high-quality pre-primary education to continued learning for the low- skilled in particular. Quality and relevance also means aligning education provision with current and future needs of the labour market, and taking full advantage of the potential of digital technologies. 3.1. Early childhood education and care Early childhood education and care (ECEC), which concerns children from birth to the start of compulsory primary schooling, is increasingly recognised as a constitutive part of the education and training system. ECEC not only adds to children's well-being now and in the long term, but also to the foundation of skills and competences that are essential to achieving high learning outcomes later in life 68 . Indeed, participation in ECEC has been associated with higher education outcomes, a reduced risk of early school leaving, the better integration of children of immigrants and the early development of transversal skills such as literacy competences, creative and critical thinking, social behaviour and emotional development 69 . ECEC is particularly beneficial to children from disadvantaged backgrounds, and contributes to tackling educational poverty as set out in Section 1.1. However, several Member States record great regional disparities in terms of ECEC participation, often reflecting socio-economic divides, or gaps between Roma and non-Roma children 70 . RO and SK received a 2015 country- specific recommendation on ECEC provision, both with the objective of targeting participation of disadvantaged groups in education and more specifically increasing participation rates of Roma children in ECEC 71 . Participation in ECEC The ET 2020 benchmark on ECEC focuses on children between the age of 4 and the starting age of compulsory primary education 72 . Although the EU as a whole is close to meeting the 95% target, with several Member States having already exceeded it (BE, DK, DE, IE, ES, FR, IT, LU, MT, NL, SE, UK), the latest data (2013) shows no significant change in ECEC participation across the EU (93.9% in both 2012 and 2013). Overall stagnation in ECEC progress hints at the difficulty of further improving near-universal participation rates in some of the (larger) Member States. But it is mainly due to the fact that, 68 OECD (2015), Skills for Social Progress: The Power of Social and Emotional Skills . 69 See OJ 2011/C 175/03; OJ 2013/112/EU; European Commission (2014), Study on the effective use of early childhood education and care in preventing early school leaving (http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/school/early- childhood_en.htm); and OECD (2014), International Migration Outlook 2014 (http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/). 70 See the contextual indicators at https://crell.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ET2020Indicators; European Commission (2014), Inequality in the use of childcare: Research note no 8/2014 ; and FRA/UNDP (2012), The Situation on Roma in 11 EU Member States: Survey results at a glance (http://fra.europa.eu/). 71 In July 2015, the Council approved country-specific recommendations for each Member State. See http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/country-specific-recommendations/index_en.htm. 72 The starting age for primary education varies across Member States, as can be seen in the last column of Table 3.1.1. Examples of recent policy measures in Member States At the end of 2014, CZ adopted legislation to enable employers to provide childcare services for their employees' children from the age of 1. In 2014, BE nl for the first time adopted a pedagogical framework for working with children under 2 \u00bd years. As of August 2015, FI introduces compulsory ECEC for one year prior to starting school. For further information and more examples of recent policy measures and reforms, see the country reports in Volume 2 of the Education and Training Monitor 2015 (http://ec.europa.eu/education/monitor). 49 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 between 2012 and 2013, ten Member States saw a decrease in ECEC participation, out of which four are still well below the ET 2020 benchmark of 95% (CZ, HR, PL, SI).

In sum, starting ECEC provision shortly before compulsory schooling does not translate into high performance vis-\u00e0-vis the ET 2020 benchmark. A focus on the younger children, even those outside the benchmark's age bracket, would be a meaningful priority for underperforming Member States. For younger children, aged 0-2 years, the Commission aims to reach the Barcelona objective of an ECEC participation rate of at least 33% 73 . In 2013, the EU average was still below the target, with 28% of children aged 0-2 attending formal childcare (Figure 3.1.1). Nine Member States reached the Barcelona objective (DK, SE, LU, NL, BE, SI, FR, PT, ES). By contrast, the rate of attendance in childcare services for children aged below 3 years is very low in CZ (3%), SK (5%) and PL (6%). Figure 3.1.1. Participation in formal childcare of 0 to 2 year-olds Source: Eurostat (SILC, 2013), online data code: ilc_caindformal . In the 0-2 age group, about 50% of European children are cared for only by their parents 74 . This not only shows the disparity of approaches, affordability and availability in the early years; it also captures well the implications for parental labour market participation. Five EU countries (AT, CZ, EE, IE, UK) received a country-specific recommendation in 2015 on the need to improve childcare provision as a way to increase labour market participation. Quality provision of ECEC Two types of ECEC systems are found in the EU. In countries applying a split system of ECEC provision, the responsibility for ECEC governance, regulation and funding is divided between different authorities. The two parts of a split system often differ in terms of educational guidelines and staff qualifications. Conversely, in a unitary system, ECEC provision is organised in a single phase \u2013 most commonly under the responsibility of the Ministry for Education. A unitary system is now applied in thirteen Member States, pointing to a growing understanding of ECEC as an integral part of the education continuum (BG, DK, DE, EE, ES, HR, LT, LV, AT, SI, FI, SE, UK) 75 . This, in turn, influences policies concerning access, participation, workforce education and curriculum design. 73 Data on 0-2 year-olds comes from Eurostat (SILC), online data code ilc_caindformal (2013).

The benefits of ECEC are dependent on its structural , process and outcome quality 76 . While structural quality is often monitored and evaluated, Member States' monitoring of process and outcome quality is considerably less systematic. In 2014, the ET 2020 Working Group on ECEC delivered a Proposal for key principles of a Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care . The document focused on the implementation and monitoring of process quality, namely on the relations that are established in and around ECEC \u2013 between children, staff, authorities and parents 77 . Table 3.1.2 shows recent Member States performance with regard to some of the principal structural dimensions of ECEC quality. Minimal education qualifications and continuing professional development (CPD) requirements may apply to the entire ECEC phase, or only staff engaged with the 3+ age group, generally depending on whether the country adopts a split or unitary ECEC system.

The structural indicators pertain to 2014/15; see the country reports in Volume 2 of the Education and Training Monitor 2015 for the latest information on policy measures and reforms (http://ec.europa.eu/education/monitor). The benefits of ECEC are dependent on its structural , process and outcome quality 76 . While structural quality is often monitored and evaluated, Member States' monitoring of process and outcome quality is considerably less systematic. In 2014, the ET 2020 Working Group on ECEC delivered a Proposal for key principles of a Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care . The document focused on the implementation and monitoring of process quality, namely on the relations that are established in and around ECEC \u2013 between children, staff, authorities and parents 77 . Table 3.1.2 shows recent Member States performance with regard to some of the principal structural dimensions of ECEC quality. Minimal education qualifications and continuing professional development (CPD) requirements may apply to the entire ECEC phase, or only staff engaged with the 3+ age group, generally depending on whether the country adopts a split or unitary ECEC system. CZ, IE, LV, MT, AT, SK and UK-SCT stand out for not setting tertiary 76 Structural quality looks at how the ECEC system is designed and organised; process quality looks at relations within and around ECEC settings; outcome quality looks at the benefits for children, families, communities and society. 77 European Commission (2014), Proposal for key principles of a quality framework for early childhood education and care (http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/strategic-framework/archive/documents/ecec-quality-framework_en.pdf).

In BG, DK, IE, NL and SE, CPD is neither a professional duty nor necessary for promotion 78 . Appropriate pedagogies, learning activities based on well-defined objectives, good communication between children and staff and follow-up of progress towards the desired learning outcomes all contribute to high quality ECEC provision. Member States can influence the quality of teaching and learning by issuing detailed ECEC educational guidelines and outlining the pedagogic principles underpinning them. Although all Member states have curricula in place for 3+ ECEC, only about three fourths have devised such frameworks for the entire ECEC phase. Finally, measures tailored to the needs of disadvantaged children and families can dramatically strengthen the role of ECEC in reducing educational poverty (see Section 1.1). Whereas the majority of Member States run targeted schemes of linguistic support for children in ECEC whose home language differs from that of the ECEC centre's instruction (as well as children suffering language difficulties), national regulations and guidelines in most of these countries often do not include out-reach strategies such as home-learning guidance and parenting programmes. Only thirteen Member States recommend such support throughout the ECEC phase. Key findings and policy relevance Although early childhood education and care (ECEC) is organised very differently across the EU, participation rates above age 4 are higher than 80% in all Member States except from HR (71.4%), EL (76.4%) and SK (77.5%). But 50% of 0 to 2 year-olds are cared for only by their parents, raising questions about the availability of affordable, high-quality childcare. Research shows that participation rates amongst the most disadvantaged are generally low, which means the potential of ECEC to tackle inequalities early remains underexploited. In this context, parental support measures can particularly be strengthened across Europe, with almost half of the Member States not offering home learning guidance or parenting programmes. Finally, due to its fragmented nature, a coherent vision on the entire ECEC phase, particularly on its governance and funding, needs to come to the fore so as to deliver high-quality ECEC for all children. 3.2. The modernisation of school education Raising the bar in school education goes beyond underachievement, funding and early school leaving. The debate on the modernisation of school education includes a comprehensive policy discourse on teaching and learning, focused in large part on the education, selection and continuous development of teachers. Quality and relevance in school education can also be pursued by exploring the potential of digital technologies, which have been bringing about profound changes to pedagogical practices, subject contents, and learning processes. Finally, the modernisation of school education is also about teaching and learning transversal skills such as language proficiency. The teaching profession Previous sections have stated unambiguously that tangible policy levers for Member States cannot overlook the teaching profession. After all, over 60% of education expenditure across the EU is devoted to salaries of education professionals, and teachers are at the core of individualised learning and career guidance. At the same time, the European teaching force is 78 See also Eurofound (2015), Working conditions, training of early childhood care workers and quality of services: A systematic review (http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/). 53 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 characterised by a striking gender gap 79 , and shows significant demographic ageing in many countries 80 . School systems in several European countries face, or will soon be facing, massive retirement waves and problems of teacher shortages. In order to anticipate and manage shortages, fifteen European countries 81 have introduced forward planning of teaching staff requirements (Table 3.2.1). The remaining Member States rely on general labour market monitoring for an insight into general workforce trends, apart from HR and CY, which have none of these monitoring measures in place. Current and expected shortages call for comprehensive and coherent strategies to raise the attractiveness of the teaching profession 82 , a challenge addressed in two 2015 country-specific recommendations (CZ, SK) 83 . Careers in teaching should be based on clear and attractive career prospects, good working conditions, high-quality initial teacher education, early career support (induction) and professional development opportunities. Selecting and educating new teachers In order to be effective, competence frameworks should be based on a shared vision, developed through broad consultation and dialogue, and should prove flexible enough to be updated whenever needed. They can be used as tools to guide selection, recruitment, development of initial teacher education (ITE) programmes, provision of continuing professional development (CPD) activities, and also for teachers\u2019 continuous self-evaluation. A large majority of European countries have some sort of competence framework for teachers in place (Table 3.2.1). In fifteen countries (CZ, DE, EE, ES, FR, HR, IT, LU, HU, PL, PT, SI, SK, FI, SE), the minimum qualification of ITE to teach in lower secondary education is at Master's level. Education at Bachelor's level or equivalent is considered sufficient in another eleven (BE, BG, DK, IE, EL, CY, LV, LT, MT, RO, UK). As of 2013, 91.2% of European teachers have completed pre-service ITE preparation programmes 84 . The main purpose of ITE is to offer future teachers high quality preparation for the job. According to the OECD's Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) 2013, teachers who went through ITE combining subject knowledge, pedagogical skills and teaching practice for all the subjects they teach feel, on average, better prepared than their colleagues who did not. Through a balance of all three elements, ITE should equip novice teachers with a wide range of teaching and assessment practices. ITE is only the first (pre-service) stage of teacher education. Qualitative assessments 85 have confirmed that one of its key functions is to lay the foundations for teachers to work as reflective practitioners, to collaborate with colleagues and other educational partners and to update their competences throughout their career. When entering the profession, a structured induction programme and a mentoring system are meant to offer every qualified beginning teacher early career support during the first, crucial years, ideally involving trained specialists. However, many countries do not have central 79 Eurostat (UOE, 2013), online data code educ_uoe_perp02 .

Note: * = UK-ENG, UK-NIR and UK-WLS. The structural indicators pertain to lower secondary education (ISCED 2) for 2014/15; see the country reports in Volume 2 of the Education and Training Monitor 2015 for the latest information on policy measures and reforms (http://ec.europa.eu/education/monitor). Continuing professional development (CPD) In order to update their theoretical and practical knowledge, teachers should participate in continuing professional development (CPD) activities throughout their entire careers. In over two thirds of European education and training systems, having a CPD plan is compulsory for lower secondary schools. Yet, to truly maximise effectiveness, incentives should be introduced to encourage CPD uptake and CPD schemes should respond to the real needs of teachers. Preceding sections have emphasised that, in order for education and training systems not to reproduce existing patterns of disadvantage, governments and institutions need to acknowledge the growing diversity in their student populations. Individualised learning and career guidance and counselling are pedagogical domains in which at least 40% of lower secondary teachers Only in ten Member States are induction, mentoring and CPD compulsory for teachers 55 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 across the EU express a moderate or high need for professional training (Figure 3.2.1). At the top of the list stands CPD in the field of special education needs , required by no less than 58% of teachers. Finally, classroom management and multicultural settings require CPD according to 41% and 38% of teachers respectively. Figure 3.2.1. The share of teachers expressing the need for CPD by domain Source : Eurydice analysis based on OECD's TALIS 2013 data in European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2015), The Teaching Profession in Europe: Practices, Perceptions and Policies (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice). Note: the indicator combines moderate and high needs as indicated by teachers in lower secondary education. The domains are a thematic selection from a total of fourteen areas rated by teachers. Teachers have an important role to play in countering marginalisation 86 ; a role that seems acknowledged by the teachers themselves when looking at the domains identified as most in need of CPD. This holds an important message in particular for the six Member States having received 2015 country-specific recommendations concerning the need to step up efforts aimed at integrating disadvantaged students into mainstream education (AT, BG, CZ, HU, RO, SK). Teaching practices Education and training systems across Europe show a great variety of instructional practices, both between and within Member States 87 . In primary education, over 70% of students have teachers using an assortment of different teaching activities to engage them in learning on a daily basis. However, country variations exist, with RO and LT having more than 90% of the students exposed to a diversity of practices in all lessons, versus less than half of the students in FI, DE and SE. Effective teaching goes beyond the individual teacher; it needs to be collaborative and collegial. Collaborative didactic practices have emerged as effective tools to increase teachers' sense of self-efficacy and job satisfaction. Yet, across Europe, only about 36% of primary school teachers report frequent collaborative engagement with peers on the improvement of instructional practices. Again, countries vary in this respect, with teachers in HR, HU, PT, SK, RO and SI engaged more often in collaborative practices; and teachers in IE, MT, and CZ less so. 86 See OECD (2014), Equity, excellence and inclusiveness in education: Policy lessons from around the world (http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/). 87 JRC-CRELL (2015), Teaching practices in primary and secondary schools in Europe: Insights from large-scale assessments in education (https://crell.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). 58% 49% 42% 41% 38% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% Students with special needs Individualised learning Career guidance and counselling Student behaviour and classroom management Multicultural or multilingual setting Countries can do more to ensure teachers have access to relevant professional development opportunities Examples of recent policy measures in Member States With the support of EU funds, CZ is developing a new career system for teachers aimed at enhancing participation in CPD and establishing a link between performance and remuneration. Taking into account the changing nature of school leadership, UK-ENG introduced new National Standards of Excellence for Head Teachers in January 2015. MT is setting up in 2015 a dedicated institute for CPD of teachers.

Note: * = UK-ENG, UK-NIR and UK-WLS. The structural indicators pertain to lower secondary education (ISCED 2) for 2014/15; see the country reports in Volume 2 of the Education and Training Monitor 2015 for the latest information on policy measures and reforms (http://ec.europa.eu/education/monitor). Continuing professional development (CPD) In order to update their theoretical and practical knowledge, teachers should participate in continuing professional development (CPD) activities throughout their entire careers. In over two thirds of European education and training systems, having a CPD plan is compulsory for lower secondary schools. Yet, to truly maximise effectiveness, incentives should be introduced to encourage CPD uptake and CPD schemes should respond to the real needs of teachers. Preceding sections have emphasised that, in order for education and training systems not to reproduce existing patterns of disadvantage, governments and institutions need to acknowledge the growing diversity in their student populations. Individualised learning and career guidance and counselling are pedagogical domains in which at least 40% of lower secondary teachers Only in ten Member States are induction, mentoring and CPD compulsory for teachers 55 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 across the EU express a moderate or high need for professional training (Figure 3.2.1). At the top of the list stands CPD in the field of special education needs , required by no less than 58% of teachers. Finally, classroom management and multicultural settings require CPD according to 41% and 38% of teachers respectively. Figure 3.2.1. The share of teachers expressing the need for CPD by domain Source : Eurydice analysis based on OECD's TALIS 2013 data in European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2015), The Teaching Profession in Europe: Practices, Perceptions and Policies (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice). Note: the indicator combines moderate and high needs as indicated by teachers in lower secondary education. The domains are a thematic selection from a total of fourteen areas rated by teachers. Teachers have an important role to play in countering marginalisation 86 ; a role that seems acknowledged by the teachers themselves when looking at the domains identified as most in need of CPD. This holds an important message in particular for the six Member States having received 2015 country-specific recommendations concerning the need to step up efforts aimed at integrating disadvantaged students into mainstream education (AT, BG, CZ, HU, RO, SK). Teaching practices Education and training systems across Europe show a great variety of instructional practices, both between and within Member States 87 . In primary education, over 70% of students have teachers using an assortment of different teaching activities to engage them in learning on a daily basis. However, country variations exist, with RO and LT having more than 90% of the students exposed to a diversity of practices in all lessons, versus less than half of the students in FI, DE and SE. Effective teaching goes beyond the individual teacher; it needs to be collaborative and collegial. Collaborative didactic practices have emerged as effective tools to increase teachers' sense of self-efficacy and job satisfaction. Yet, across Europe, only about 36% of primary school teachers report frequent collaborative engagement with peers on the improvement of instructional practices. Again, countries vary in this respect, with teachers in HR, HU, PT, SK, RO and SI engaged more often in collaborative practices; and teachers in IE, MT, and CZ less so. 86 See OECD (2014), Equity, excellence and inclusiveness in education: Policy lessons from around the world (http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/). 87 JRC-CRELL (2015), Teaching practices in primary and secondary schools in Europe: Insights from large-scale assessments in education (https://crell.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). 58% 49% 42% 41% 38% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% Students with special needs Individualised learning Career guidance and counselling Student behaviour and classroom management Multicultural or multilingual setting Countries can do more to ensure teachers have access to relevant professional development opportunities Examples of recent policy measures in Member States With the support of EU funds, CZ is developing a new career system for teachers aimed at enhancing participation in CPD and establishing a link between performance and remuneration. Taking into account the changing nature of school leadership, UK-ENG introduced new National Standards of Excellence for Head Teachers in January 2015. MT is setting up in 2015 a dedicated institute for CPD of teachers.

        "56 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 One further relevant feature is the capacity of education institutions to make the adequate provision for staff to quickly upgrade and innovate their teaching methods. Systems that rely on collegiality and peer interaction stand out for their effectiveness in ensuring exchanges of theoretical and practical knowledge between teachers. The development of new organisational frameworks that facilitate such collaborative practices has now become imperative for European education and training systems 88 . Key findings and policy relevance Looming teacher shortages and the knowledge that educators are key to inclusiveness, quality and relevance have put the spotlight on the teaching profession. Countries are taking measures to raise the quality of teaching by introducing competence frameworks and enhancing initial teacher education. However, improvements can be made when it comes to forward planning of staff requirements; the availability of early career support (induction) and mentoring; and the uptake of continuing professional development (CPD). Only in ten Member States are induction, mentoring and CPD compulsory: ES, HR, IT, HU, MT, AT, PT, RO, SK and UK (except UK-SCT). CPD relevance can be improved by responding to teachers' needs, particularly in domains of inclusive education. Finally, introducing more collaboration and collegiality can address both quality and the attractiveness of the profession. Innovation and the use of digital technologies in school education The integration of digital technology in formal education has been a major theme throughout the last decades, and has become increasingly recognised as one of the foremost directions for reform in European education and training systems. The use of digital technology in education, however, does not automatically trigger innovation. New analysis based on PISA 2012 89 underlines that merely increasing access to digital technologies in schools does not yield higher learning outcomes, although specific and targeted use with clear pedagogical aims might. In pedagogical terms, digital technologies should ideally yield profound changes in learning contents and pedagogical practices, and lead to more immersive, connected and natural learning processes. Digital technologies also hold the potential for raising efficiency, data consistency and inter-institutional connectedness. A system-wide approach to integrating digital technologies into formal education is crucial to enable innovation to take root across an entire education and training system. Such an approach would have to incorporate developments in a number of different educational domains: from subject content, teacher training and curriculum design, to organisational and administrative structures 90 . In some instances, national or regional policies concerning initial teacher education (ITE), teachers' continuing professional development (CPD) and curricula will have to be revisited. At the local/school level, factors as different as school ownership and leadership, investment priorities, staff allocation procedures, existence of technical and pedagogical support, can be crucial in determining whether a digital upgrade project is successful and sustainable. 88 A recent EENEE report underscores the role of competition and incentives for increasing the innovative capacity in education systems. See EENEE (2015), Innovations in education for better skills and higher employability (http://www.eenee.de). 89 OECD (2015), Students, computers and learning: Making the connection (http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/). 90 See also JRC-IPTS (2012), Innovating learning: Key elements for developing creative classrooms in Europe (http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC72278.pdf). The holistic model proposed by JRC-IPTS is based on eight key dimensions and a set of twenty-eight reference parameters (\u2018building blocks\u2019). For further information, see: http://is.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pages/EAP/SCALECCR.html. A coherent, integrated approach to digital technology in school education is needed 57 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 Such drivers should be aligned in order to allow individual teachers to incorporate digital technology into their daily instructional practice. Indeed, the main issues for innovation and digital technology in schools are coherence, system-wide integration, sustainability and scalability 91 . However, in many cases, one or more of the above-mentioned drivers are missing, or not aligned with the goal of digital upgrade \u2013 causing innovation to remain confined to the pedagogical activities of a minority of particularly devoted teachers. School organisation The IEA's International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2013 reveals that, across the nine participating Member States 92 , most school leaders prioritise the implementation of measures aimed at facilitating the use of ICT in teaching and learning. The largest discrepancies between countries are recorded in respect to the allocation of time for teachers to plan and prepare to use ICT to deliver lessons. In SI, SK, LT and HR, around 90% of the school leaders had given medium or high priority to allocating time for such preparatory work, compared to only 26% and 28% in NL and DK respectively. These findings are mirrored in the Survey of Schools: ICT in Education , which finds that 59% of grade 8 students attend schools that promote collaboration amongst teachers on the use of ICT, and 49% go to schools that schedule time for teachers to collaborate on ICT related issues 93 . 35% of the students attend schools where both strategies were implemented. Differences are striking between countries: in RO, around 59% of students go to a school where there is a specific strategy to support teachers' collaboration as well as time allocated to it, but in AT, only 13% of students are in a similar situation. A different matter altogether is the actual time that teachers are allowed to allocate to CPD activities on how to use ICT pedagogically. Adopting the number of relevant school-based initiatives as an indicator, school leaders from LT, SI, and HR emerge as the most proactive in organising ICT-related CPD courses. Conversely, low levels of engagement are recorded in both DK and NL. A number of Member States are taking measures to include the European Digital Competence Framework 94 in teacher CPD; this is the case, for example, in ES, EE, LT and HR, while other Member States implement their own digital competence frameworks.

        "58 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 However, an analysis of TALIS data showed that the share of teachers in need of CPD on ICT skills for teaching and on new technologies in the workplace is as high as 57% and 53% respectively. These particular CPD demands strongly increase with age (Figure 3.2.2), adding a different dimension to the issue of demographic ageing mentioned at the beginning of the section. Digital infrastructure The provision of digital infrastructure in schools comprises hardware (e.g. PCs, interactive whiteboards, digital projectors, tablet computers, digital sensors, backend servers and other network infrastructure) and, of increasing importance, software, digital content and apps. In order to spur teaching innovation in classrooms, attention should be paid to understanding which digital tools best serve the pedagogical purposes of different instructional contexts. Table 3.2.2 summarises available digital resources in lower secondary schools in the nine Member States that participated in ICILS. Table 3.2.2.

Note: the indicators show the percentage of students at schools with available internet-, software- and computer-related resources for teacher and/or learning. Most schools in the Member States participating in ICILS provide interactive digital learning and email resources to teachers. High availability of digital learning games (reflecting a new trend of game-based learning) is also visible 95 . Discrepancies are found between Member States in the degree of the STEM-related monitoring tools and simulation software availability, with NL and LT providing high to almost universal access, whereas CZ does not seem to prioritise such tools. There are also large differences in the provision of tablet devices and in the student-computer ratio. There are quite a number of initiatives in Europe equipping students of a given school, class or age group with portable, one-to-one devices (e.g. laptops, netbooks, tablets or smartphones) for learning purposes. A study by JRC-IPTS in collaboration with European Schoolnet has identified which factors affect the successful implementation of one-to-one devices in the school environment. The analysis, however, also uncovered a range of major challenges related to the sustainability, impact, costs, renewal and mainstreaming of such initiatives, in a context of budgetary constraints 96 . 95 The EUN iTEC project (2010-2014) highlighted the following technologies as most promising for school education: (1) game-based learning and gamification; (2) augmented reality; (3) learning analytics; (4) cloud computing; (5) programming and apps; and (6) neuroscience. See: http://itec.eun.org/. 96 JRC-IPTS/European Schoolnet (2013), Overview and analysis of 1:1 learning initiatives in Europe (http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC81903.pdf). 59 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 Learning content and subject matter ICT is taught as an independent subject in compulsory education in many Member States. Some of them have prescribed a minimum number of hours either to be taught during a year (BG, DE, EL, CY, LV, HU, MT, PT, and RO), or to be allocated over the course of multiple years (CZ, IE, LI, PL and SK). In other EU countries (BE de, NL, UK), schools and teachers have the flexibility to allocate total instruction time across curriculum subjects (including ICT) as they deem fit. A final group of countries incorporates ICT in other subjects' instruction time (IE, ES, FR, IT, AT, SI and UK-NIR) 97 . Secondly, technology is taught as an independent subject in nineteen Member States (BE fr/nl BG, CZ, DE, EE, EL, ES, FR, HR, IT, CY, LT, HU, NL, PL, PT, RO, SI and UK). The most curricular hours spent on technology are found in SI. BE de, IE, MT, AT and SE have all integrated technology into other parts of the curriculum. Some countries (BE nl, BG, FR and LT) offer a mix of the two models. In DK and SK, technology is an optional subject for students or schools. Thirdly, coding 98 can either be delivered as an independent subject (as in UK-ENG) or integrated into other subject domains. A recent survey by EUN 99 reveals that in twelve out of twenty participating education and training systems (BG, CY, CZ, DK, EE, EL, IE, IT, LT, PL, PT, UK- ENG), computer programming and coding are already part of the curriculum, while six others (BE nl, ES, FI, FR, LU, NL) are planning to integrate it. In general, multiple rationales are given for the integration of coding, amongst them the fostering of logical thinking and problem-solving skills. Improvement of the ICT sector and increasing the number of students in computer science is also a priority for ten of the surveyed countries. Furthermore, in the European Digital Competence Framework , programming is one of the twenty-one competences considered 100 . Teaching practices and use of social media Teachers can use digital tools to innovate instructional practices. Yet Table 3.2.3 shows that, in ICILS participating countries, ICT is mostly used as a remedial tool and as a means for the enrichment of existing learning content, presentations and discussions in the classroom. Few teachers report using ICT for communication in which students are involved, leaving untapped the potential for ICT to connect students together within the frame of subject learning 101 . Social media, finally, is quite commonly used for private and leisure activities by both children and adults. Across the EU, 38% of 9 to 12 year-olds and 77% of 13 to 16 year-olds keep a personal profile on a social network 102 . Although ICILS shows that only a small fraction of teachers use social media for teaching purposes, these tools hold the potential to become a new, relevant channel for collaborative learning practices 103 . 97 In DK and EE, ICT is an optional subject for students or schools, and a non-compulsory subject in HR. For further information, see European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2015), Recommended annual instruction time in full-time compulsory education in Europe 2014/15 (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice). 98 \"Coding\" in the school context is a common term for all subject matters that integrate some sort of programming or similar activities (i.e. computational thinking) during instructional time. 99 European Schoolnet (2014), Computing our future: Computer programming and coding - priorities, school curricula and initiatives across Europe (http://www.eun.org/). 100 See http://ipts.jrc.ec.europa.eu/publications/pub.cfm?id=6359. 101 An existing framework and integrated solution for such exchanges is offered through the e-twinning portal (see http://www.etwinning.net/). 102 By June 2014. See EU Kids online (http://lsedesignunit.com/EUKidsOnline/). 103 SI is the one notable exception, where 18% of the teachers reported to use social media in most lessons. Coding in school curricula boosts transversal competences and supports subsequent STEM fields of study Teachers are more likely to use technology to supplement traditional instruction than to let students collaborate or to put them in touch with others during lessons MEP ET Monitor 2015 vol 1.indd 58 27/10/15 15:01 ",
        "58 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 However, an analysis of TALIS data showed that the share of teachers in need of CPD on ICT skills for teaching and on new technologies in the workplace is as high as 57% and 53% respectively. These particular CPD demands strongly increase with age (Figure 3.2.2), adding a different dimension to the issue of demographic ageing mentioned at the beginning of the section.

Table 3.2.2 summarises available digital resources in lower secondary schools in the nine Member States that participated in ICILS. Table 3.2.2.

Note: the indicators show the percentage of students at schools with available internet-, software- and computer-related resources for teacher and/or learning. Most schools in the Member States participating in ICILS provide interactive digital learning and email resources to teachers. High availability of digital learning games (reflecting a new trend of game-based learning) is also visible 95 . Discrepancies are found between Member States in the degree of the STEM-related monitoring tools and simulation software availability, with NL and LT providing high to almost universal access, whereas CZ does not seem to prioritise such tools. There are also large differences in the provision of tablet devices and in the student-computer ratio. There are quite a number of initiatives in Europe equipping students of a given school, class or age group with portable, one-to-one devices (e.g. laptops, netbooks, tablets or smartphones) for learning purposes. A study by JRC-IPTS in collaboration with European Schoolnet has identified which factors affect the successful implementation of one-to-one devices in the school environment. The analysis, however, also uncovered a range of major challenges related to the sustainability, impact, costs, renewal and mainstreaming of such initiatives, in a context of budgetary constraints 96 . 95 The EUN iTEC project (2010-2014) highlighted the following technologies as most promising for school education: (1) game-based learning and gamification; (2) augmented reality; (3) learning analytics; (4) cloud computing; (5) programming and apps; and (6) neuroscience. See: http://itec.eun.org/. 96 JRC-IPTS/European Schoolnet (2013), Overview and analysis of 1:1 learning initiatives in Europe (http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC81903.pdf). 59 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 Learning content and subject matter ICT is taught as an independent subject in compulsory education in many Member States. Some of them have prescribed a minimum number of hours either to be taught during a year (BG, DE, EL, CY, LV, HU, MT, PT, and RO), or to be allocated over the course of multiple years (CZ, IE, LI, PL and SK). In other EU countries (BE de, NL, UK), schools and teachers have the flexibility to allocate total instruction time across curriculum subjects (including ICT) as they deem fit. A final group of countries incorporates ICT in other subjects' instruction time (IE, ES, FR, IT, AT, SI and UK-NIR) 97 . Secondly, technology is taught as an independent subject in nineteen Member States (BE fr/nl BG, CZ, DE, EE, EL, ES, FR, HR, IT, CY, LT, HU, NL, PL, PT, RO, SI and UK). The most curricular hours spent on technology are found in SI. BE de, IE, MT, AT and SE have all integrated technology into other parts of the curriculum. Some countries (BE nl, BG, FR and LT) offer a mix of the two models. In DK and SK, technology is an optional subject for students or schools. Thirdly, coding 98 can either be delivered as an independent subject (as in UK-ENG) or integrated into other subject domains. A recent survey by EUN 99 reveals that in twelve out of twenty participating education and training systems (BG, CY, CZ, DK, EE, EL, IE, IT, LT, PL, PT, UK- ENG), computer programming and coding are already part of the curriculum, while six others (BE nl, ES, FI, FR, LU, NL) are planning to integrate it. In general, multiple rationales are given for the integration of coding, amongst them the fostering of logical thinking and problem-solving skills. Improvement of the ICT sector and increasing the number of students in computer science is also a priority for ten of the surveyed countries. Furthermore, in the European Digital Competence Framework , programming is one of the twenty-one competences considered 100 . Teaching practices and use of social media Teachers can use digital tools to innovate instructional practices. Yet Table 3.2.3 shows that, in ICILS participating countries, ICT is mostly used as a remedial tool and as a means for the enrichment of existing learning content, presentations and discussions in the classroom. Few teachers report using ICT for communication in which students are involved, leaving untapped the potential for ICT to connect students together within the frame of subject learning 101 . Social media, finally, is quite commonly used for private and leisure activities by both children and adults. Across the EU, 38% of 9 to 12 year-olds and 77% of 13 to 16 year-olds keep a personal profile on a social network 102 . Although ICILS shows that only a small fraction of teachers use social media for teaching purposes, these tools hold the potential to become a new, relevant channel for collaborative learning practices 103 . 97 In DK and EE, ICT is an optional subject for students or schools, and a non-compulsory subject in HR. For further information, see European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2015), Recommended annual instruction time in full-time compulsory education in Europe 2014/15 (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice). 98 \"Coding\" in the school context is a common term for all subject matters that integrate some sort of programming or similar activities (i.e. computational thinking) during instructional time. 99 European Schoolnet (2014), Computing our future: Computer programming and coding - priorities, school curricula and initiatives across Europe (http://www.eun.org/). 100 See http://ipts.jrc.ec.europa.eu/publications/pub.cfm?id=6359. 101 An existing framework and integrated solution for such exchanges is offered through the e-twinning portal (see http://www.etwinning.net/). 102 By June 2014. See EU Kids online (http://lsedesignunit.com/EUKidsOnline/). 103 SI is the one notable exception, where 18% of the teachers reported to use social media in most lessons. Coding in school curricula boosts transversal competences and supports subsequent STEM fields of study Teachers are more likely to use technology to supplement traditional instruction than to let students collaborate or to put them in touch with others during lessons MEP ET Monitor 2015 vol 1.indd 59 27/10/15 15:01 ",

On the other hand, the evidence also shows that most teachers are quite confident in their operational digital skills. Key findings and policy relevance School education should help students gain the knowledge, skills and competences to use digital technologies in a critical, collaborative and creative way. Properly trained teachers have in many cases the opportunity to innovate their practice through new pedagogical methods supported by digital technologies, including the use of social media for collaborative learning. Strong CPD in this domain is a crucial requirement for the successful implementation of digital technologies in formal education, together with the readiness on the side of school leaders to encourage the development of collaborative peer-learning practices amongst teachers. Strengthening the prerequisites for innovative use of digital tools in school is an important part of the general modernisation of school education, promoting both differentiation of pedagogies and excellence in teaching and learning. Languages in school education The EU hosts a wealth of languages 105 . Language competences are important for social cohesion and prosperity, for developing understanding and openness in a multicultural society, for improving employability and ensuring competitiveness for European businesses. Generally, language competences contribute to the mobility, employability and personal development of European citizens at all ages 106 . Communication skills are crucial on the labour market and poor 104 The Survey of Schools: ICT in Education , published in 2013 (http://essie.eun.org/). 105 In addition to the twenty-four official languages of the EU, there are some sixty autochthonous languages (regional or minority languages, or even national languages, as in the case of Luxembourgish), plus the many languages spoken by migrants coming from outside the EU. 106 JRC-CRELL (2015), Languages and Employability (https://crell.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). 61 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 language skills are a major obstacle to free movement of workers as well as the social and economic integration of migrants 107 . The role of primary and secondary education: language learning at school The foundation for foreign language learning is laid in school. In all Member States, schools teach foreign languages, so that language learning has become a central element of every child's school experience across Europe. In recent years, the introduction of foreign language learning has moved to earlier years 108 , when students are younger. Still, as can be seen in Figure 3.2.3, on average, 18% of students across the EU are not engaged in foreign language learning during their primary education (down from 23.1% in 2010). This includes students starting foreign language learning later than during their first grade. Figure 3.2.3.

Data presented here are for BE as a whole; however, there are striking differences between the Dutch and French speaking regions, with the Dutch speaking regions having much higher levels of students learning two or more foreign languages. In lower secondary education, the share of students learning no foreign language is only 1.7% across the EU (Figure 3.2.4) and almost two thirds of students are learning two or more foreign languages. In some cases (AT, HU, IE), the percentage of students learning two or more foreign languages in lower secondary education remains below 10%, partly due to specific linguistic situations. About one in ten students in general upper secondary education (10.3%) does not learn any foreign languages. The share of students learning two or more foreign languages in general upper secondary education is stable (50.8% in 2013 compared to 50.1% in 2010). The dominance of English as a foreign language is evident in general upper secondary education, where more than 78% of students study English, versus 20.6% studying 107 Several Member States have introduced reforms to improve language teaching in education and training. See European Commission (2014), Languages in education and training: Final country comparative analysis (http://ec.europa.eu/languages/library/studies/lang-eat_en.pdf).

Data presented here are for BE as a whole; however, there are striking differences between the Dutch and French speaking regions, with the Dutch speaking regions having much higher levels of students learning two or more foreign languages. Language competences Actual proficiency levels in foreign languages are not easy to capture. Not only school systems, but also curricular development, approaches to teacher education and language teaching vary significantly between Member States, and within them. As such, a comparison of what students actually learn cannot easily be achieved. Unlike the domains regularly tested in international assessments such as the OECD's PISA, there is no regular internationally comparative testing for foreign language proficiency. This is why the Commission set up an extensive evaluation of foreign language competences in Europe, the European Survey on Language Competences , which was carried out in 2011 and in which sixteen education and training systems participated. The tests of proficiency in listening, reading and writing in first and second foreign languages were linked to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and the results were published in 2012 110 . Following the publication of the results, the Council concluded that Member States are to improve measures aimed at promoting multilingualism, enhancing the quality and efficiency of language learning and teaching and developing measures for assessing language proficiency of secondary school students 111 . Subsequent activities by the Commission included an inventory of existing national tests of language competences in lower and upper secondary education 112 and a study on the comparability of existing national tests 113 , which were both conducted with support of the members of an Indicator Expert Group on Multilingualism. In addition, the JRC-CRELL published a report on the relationship between languages and employability 114 . 109 These data do not take into account the education systems where the language is used as the main language of instruction (UK and IE for English, FR and BE fr for French, AT and DE for German). 110 See http://ec.europa.eu/languages/library/studies/executive-summary-eslc_en.pdf. 111 OJ 2014/C 183/06. 112 Eurydice (2015), National tests in languages in Europe 2014/2015 (https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/index.php/Publications:Languages_in_Secondary_Education:_A n_Overview_of_National_Tests_in_Europe_%E2%80%93_2014/15). 113 Cambridge English Language Assessment: Study on comparability of language testing in Europe.

Such an approach will help strengthening the linguistic confidence of every learner and thereby combat underachievement and even reduce the risk of early school leaving and social exclusion. Key findings and policy relevance The increasing number of students speaking languages at home that differ from the main language of instruction, as well as the globalisation of the economy, are radically changing some key factors of language acquisition. As a consequence, the growing awareness of the importance of language competences is pushing Member States to bring forward the start of language learning. Still, Member States vary widely when it comes to the share of students learning foreign languages in primary and secondary education. Strengthening the modernisation efforts in language teaching and learning contributes to broader aims, such as tackling underachievement and early school leaving, but also employability and learning mobility. 3.3. The modernisation of vocational education and training The demand for more and higher quality vocational education and training (VET) 115 in the EU is reiterated in the Draft Joint Report on the implementation of ET 2020 116 . The modernisation of VET is a key measure to address high youth unemployment, improve basic skills of adults, up- skill the workforce, react to technological changes and ensure a better skills match for economic growth and job creation. Closer ties between VET and enterprises are recognised as a prime way to ensure that VET provides skills that are relevant for the labour market. Work-based learning and apprenticeship schemes ensure the closest links between education and the world of work. The Commission, particularly through the Youth Employment Initiative 117 and the European Alliance for Apprenticeships 118 , has been encouraging and supporting Member States in their efforts to increase the quality, supply and attractiveness of work-based learning, thereby improving the labour market relevance of VET. Outcomes from initial vocational education and training The employment rate of young adults whose highest education qualification is at the upper secondary and post-secondary level is slowly improving after a consecutive decline since 2008. Figure 3.3.1 distinguishes between general and vocational degrees within the group of young adults with their highest qualifications at the upper secondary and post-secondary levels. This confirms that vocational programmes lead to better employment chances than general programmes in most of the Member States, except for CY, EL, PT and UK 119 . 115 VET is defined as education and training that aims to equip people with knowledge, know-how, skills and/or competencies required in particular occupations or more broadly on the labour market. Many aspects of school and tertiary education have a vocational or professionally oriented dimension. However, the focus in Section 3.3 is on initial VET at the upper secondary and non-tertiary levels. Continuing VET is also covered in Section 3.5. 116 COM(2015) 408 final and SWD(2015) 161 final. 117 See http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&catId=89&newsId=1829. 118 See http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/vocational-policy/alliance_en.htm. 119 JRC-CRELL (2015), Education and youth labour market outcomes: the added value of VET (https://crell.jrc.ec.europa.eu/).

Data presented here are for BE as a whole; however, there are striking differences between the Dutch and French speaking regions, with the Dutch speaking regions having much higher levels of students learning two or more foreign languages. Language competences Actual proficiency levels in foreign languages are not easy to capture. Not only school systems, but also curricular development, approaches to teacher education and language teaching vary significantly between Member States, and within them. As such, a comparison of what students actually learn cannot easily be achieved. Unlike the domains regularly tested in international assessments such as the OECD's PISA, there is no regular internationally comparative testing for foreign language proficiency. This is why the Commission set up an extensive evaluation of foreign language competences in Europe, the European Survey on Language Competences , which was carried out in 2011 and in which sixteen education and training systems participated. The tests of proficiency in listening, reading and writing in first and second foreign languages were linked to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and the results were published in 2012 110 . Following the publication of the results, the Council concluded that Member States are to improve measures aimed at promoting multilingualism, enhancing the quality and efficiency of language learning and teaching and developing measures for assessing language proficiency of secondary school students 111 . Subsequent activities by the Commission included an inventory of existing national tests of language competences in lower and upper secondary education 112 and a study on the comparability of existing national tests 113 , which were both conducted with support of the members of an Indicator Expert Group on Multilingualism. In addition, the JRC-CRELL published a report on the relationship between languages and employability 114 . 109 These data do not take into account the education systems where the language is used as the main language of instruction (UK and IE for English, FR and BE fr for French, AT and DE for German). 110 See http://ec.europa.eu/languages/library/studies/executive-summary-eslc_en.pdf. 111 OJ 2014/C 183/06. 112 Eurydice (2015), National tests in languages in Europe 2014/2015 (https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/index.php/Publications:Languages_in_Secondary_Education:_A n_Overview_of_National_Tests_in_Europe_%E2%80%93_2014/15). 113 Cambridge English Language Assessment: Study on comparability of language testing in Europe.

Such an approach will help strengthening the linguistic confidence of every learner and thereby combat underachievement and even reduce the risk of early school leaving and social exclusion. Key findings and policy relevance The increasing number of students speaking languages at home that differ from the main language of instruction, as well as the globalisation of the economy, are radically changing some key factors of language acquisition. As a consequence, the growing awareness of the importance of language competences is pushing Member States to bring forward the start of language learning. Still, Member States vary widely when it comes to the share of students learning foreign languages in primary and secondary education. Strengthening the modernisation efforts in language teaching and learning contributes to broader aims, such as tackling underachievement and early school leaving, but also employability and learning mobility. 3.3. The modernisation of vocational education and training The demand for more and higher quality vocational education and training (VET) 115 in the EU is reiterated in the Draft Joint Report on the implementation of ET 2020 116 . The modernisation of VET is a key measure to address high youth unemployment, improve basic skills of adults, up- skill the workforce, react to technological changes and ensure a better skills match for economic growth and job creation. Closer ties between VET and enterprises are recognised as a prime way to ensure that VET provides skills that are relevant for the labour market. Work-based learning and apprenticeship schemes ensure the closest links between education and the world of work. The Commission, particularly through the Youth Employment Initiative 117 and the European Alliance for Apprenticeships 118 , has been encouraging and supporting Member States in their efforts to increase the quality, supply and attractiveness of work-based learning, thereby improving the labour market relevance of VET. Outcomes from initial vocational education and training The employment rate of young adults whose highest education qualification is at the upper secondary and post-secondary level is slowly improving after a consecutive decline since 2008. Figure 3.3.1 distinguishes between general and vocational degrees within the group of young adults with their highest qualifications at the upper secondary and post-secondary levels. This confirms that vocational programmes lead to better employment chances than general programmes in most of the Member States, except for CY, EL, PT and UK 119 . 115 VET is defined as education and training that aims to equip people with knowledge, know-how, skills and/or competencies required in particular occupations or more broadly on the labour market. Many aspects of school and tertiary education have a vocational or professionally oriented dimension. However, the focus in Section 3.3 is on initial VET at the upper secondary and non-tertiary levels. Continuing VET is also covered in Section 3.5. 116 COM(2015) 408 final and SWD(2015) 161 final. 117 See http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&catId=89&newsId=1829. 118 See http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/vocational-policy/alliance_en.htm. 119 JRC-CRELL (2015), Education and youth labour market outcomes: the added value of VET (https://crell.jrc.ec.europa.eu/).

Countries are ranked in ascending order by the total employment rate (ISCED 3 and ISCED 4). Overall, this evidence indicates that VET is, in general, a good choice for those young people who do not intend to continue into higher education programmes. Still, average outcomes hide some disparity between different countries, leaving scope to improve VET quality in those countries where VET outcomes lag behind the EU average. Participation in initial vocational education and training An important aspect when assessing the attractiveness of vocational pathways is the share of upper secondary students who participate in initial VET. As shown in Figure 3.3.2, there is a high degree of variation between countries in terms of the size of their upper secondary VET systems. In MT and CY, just over 10% of students are in VET programmes, compared to more than 70% in HR, CZ, BE and AT 120 . When comparing the data on enrolment in initial VET with employment outcomes, clear tendencies can be identified for several countries. For example, in MT, there are indications of under-provision of initial VET, as very few students take initial VET courses while the employment premium is the largest across the EU. Conversely, in CZ, initial VET enrolment is one of the highest, while the premium in terms of labour market outcomes is negative 121 . Figure 3.3.2.

A large proportion of such young people would suggest that there is room for providing them with opportunities for a vocational qualification \u2013 either at secondary, post-secondary or tertiary level. As shown in Figure 3.3.3, in a number of countries there is a large proportion of young adults who do not have a labour market relevant qualification (i.e. a qualification below the level of upper secondary or an upper secondary qualification of general orientation). Given that the overall employment prospects of young people who do not complete secondary education or obtain only a general upper secondary education diploma are likely to be more challenging, there is scope for increasing the provision of labour market relevant secondary, post-secondary non-tertiary or tertiary education and training. Such arguments would be stronger for those countries, where there is (1) a higher employment premium of VET qualifications over general secondary qualifications; and (2) a relatively low share of enrolment in VET (whether upper secondary, post-secondary or tertiary). Figure 3.3.3. Highest level of education attained amongst 30 to 34 year-olds Source : Eurostat (LFS, 2014), based on a May 2015 extraction. Note: countries are ranked in descending order according to the share of 30 to 34 year-olds that lacks a labour market relevant qualification (medium vocational or tertiary). Enlarging the attractiveness and provision of upper secondary VET is particularly useful for countries with large shares of early school leavers. In such countries, VET could substantially contribute in raising education attainment. For Member States that already have large shares of tertiary graduates but aim to further up-skill their secondary graduates who do not continue into higher education, enlarging the provision of post-secondary non-tertiary VET could be a useful option 122 . Work-based learning and apprenticeships The added value of VET is the relevance of skills and competences for the labour market. There are different instruments ensuring that vocational schools and training centres are providing relevant, up-to-date training for particular professions. Such instruments include the involvement of the private sector in the design and evaluation of education curricula, professional standards and the examination of students. Moreover, one of the most straightforward ways to ensure that skills acquired by students are relevant for the labour 122 In order to address persistent youth unemployment, Member States should also provide adult learning opportunities, facilitating the return to education and training for those young people who have already left initial education. For example, a more targeted use of the European Social Fund (ESF) could be one of the avenues to address the challenge, particularly as training for the unemployed was found to be one of the most effective intervention areas of the ESF in the period 2007-2013.

Apprenticeships are the best known example to organise VET provision in this way. They are defined as a formal VET programme that includes alternation between company-based training (periods of practical work experience at a workplace) and school-based education (periods of theoretical/practical education followed in a school or training centre), or a combination of the two. Such training, upon successful completion, should lead to a nationally recognised qualification. Often there is a contractual relationship between the employer and the apprentice, with the apprentice receiving a salary in exchange for the work undertaken. Figure 3.3.4. Initial VET students in combined work- and school-based training Source : Cedefop calculations based on Eurostat (UOE) data for 2012 (ISCED 1997 level 3). See Cedefop (2013), On the way to 2020: data for vocational education and training policies (http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/). Apprenticeships are not the only possible scheme for work-based learning provision. There are other, less intensive work-based learning approaches. These include, for example, school-based VET combined with on-the-job training elements, where these elements typically represent less than 50% of the training programme duration. There are also ways to deliver work-based learning at school, notably by providing school-based programmes with on-site labs, workshops, kitchens, restaurants, practice firms, simulations or real business project assignments 123 .

Still, from available data (Figure 3.3.4) it is evident that combined work- and school-based programmes are most common in DK, DE and HU 125 . Responding to the challenges outlined throughout this section, the Commission, together with the Member States and social partners in the context of the Bruges Communiqu\u00e9 126 and the overall Copenhagen process 127 , is working to further develop and modernise VET systems in Europe. Notably, in June 2015, a set of medium-term deliverables have been endorsed for the period 2015-2020 (Table 3.3.1), reinforcing the vision of developing high quality, attractive, accessible and inclusive VET. Key findings and policy relevance Evidence suggests that initial vocational education and training facilitates the transition from education to the labour market for young people. However, in some Member States, very few young people have access to high-quality initial VET programmes and returns to VET qualifications differ across countries. At the same time, in a few Member States there is a large proportion of young people who completed general upper secondary education but neither continue into higher education nor attempt to receive labour market relevant qualifications through VET. Developing good links between VET and the labour market is essential to improve the quality and attractiveness of VET programmes. Introducing more work-based learning, and particularly apprenticeships, is one of the most straightforward ways to ensure such links between the needs of employers and the education and training provided by VET systems across Europe. 3.4. The modernisation of higher education It is clear that the expansion of higher education discussed earlier has to go hand in hand with active policy measures to ensure quality and relevance. This section deals with the priority of improving the quality of higher education and making it more relevant. Firstly, it looks at how higher education can be better sensitised to the needs of the labour market, whether through government-supported, system-wide planning and steering, or through policies and practices at institutional level to adapt learning programmes to prepare students better for working life. Then, given the EU's role in supporting the internationalisation of higher education, it looks at the specific contribution of learning mobility to graduate employability. The section ends with an overview of how innovation in higher education is bringing about new pedagogies, use of technology and reshaped curricula. Employment amongst graduates from higher education The employment rate of recent graduates from at least upper secondary education increased in 2014 for the first time since 2008. The corresponding ET 2020 target is to return to the 2008 value of 82% by the year 2020, but, in the wake of the crisis, graduate employment had been decreasing ever since. The employment rate of 20-34 year-olds now stands at 76.1%, up 0.6 percentage point from the previous year. However, looking more closely at the data reveals that this positive development is due entirely to an improvement in employment outcomes of upper secondary 125 Note that this analysis includes all work-based learning programmes, whether or not including a training element at a company. 126 See http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/vocational-policy/doc/brugescom_en.pdf. 127 See http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/vocational-policy/doc/copenhagen-declaration_en.pdf.

Figure 3.4.1. Employment rate of recent tertiary education graduates Source : Eurostat (LFS, 2008-2014), online data code: edat_lfse_24 . Note: the indicator shows the employment rate of graduates (ISCED 5-8) aged 20-34 who graduated 1 to 3 years before the reference year and who are not currently enrolled in any further formal or non-formal education or training. Between 2008 and 2014, convergence in recent graduate employment rates between Member States disappeared, with bottom-performing countries seeing much larger falls in employment rates than top-performing countries (Figure 3.4.1), as they were hit hardest by the cyclical labour market effects of the crisis. Rates in EL, RO, IT, ES, CY, HR, BG and SI decreased by more than 10 percentage points. More recently (2013-2014), the change in employment rates of higher education graduates has been much more diverse across the EU. Some bottom- performing Member States have improved (e.g. EL) whereas others have worsened (e.g. IT). Some top-performing Member States registered a small decline (e.g. DE) whereas others managed to further improve (e.g. MT). Figure 3.4.2. Employed higher education graduates overqualified in their current job Source : Eurostat (LFS, 2011-2014), based on a May 2015 extraction. Note: the indicator shows the share of 25 to 34 year- olds with tertiary education attainment that has an occupation not traditionally requiring a tertiary education qualification. This comprises clerical support workers; service and sales workers; skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers; craft and related workers; plant and machine operators and assemblers; and elementary occupations. The issue of employability goes beyond average employment rates. There are also concerns that a number of higher education graduates are working in jobs that would not typically require a tertiary qualification: with the risk that they are not fully exploiting their skills. Across the EU, 128 Table A.2 in the annex provides the full overview regarding Member States\u2019 progress towards the ET 2020 target for the employment rate of recent graduates (ISCED 3-8, ISCED 3-4 and ISCED 5-8). Longer time series can be consulted by using the Eurostat online data code edat_lfse_24 . Between 2013 and 2014, the employment rate for those with ISCED 3-4 qualifications grew from 69.5% to 70.8%, while the employment rate for young people with ISCED 5-8 continued its consecutive drop from 80.9% to 80.5%. 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% EL IT ES HR CY PT RO SI BG SK FR EU CZ FI IE PL HU LV BE UK DK LU EE LT AT NL SE DE MT 2014 2008 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% CY EL BG IE ES PL UK RO SK IT EU SI EE NL AT LV FR HU LT HR FI BE PT CZ SE DE MT DK LU 2014 2011 In CY and BG, occupational mismatch has increased with more than 10 percentage points in just three years 69 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 25% of employed graduates from tertiary education find an occupation that would traditionally be viewed as not requiring a tertiary qualification (see Figure 3.4.2) 129 . The occupational mismatch is particularly strong in CY, EL and BG. While the data used to generate these proportions are not perfect, they highlight potential problems in the functioning of the labour markets. Individuals working in jobs below their qualifications may become less satisfied with their jobs, may earn less, be more prone to change jobs and in the long-run will be more likely to lose skills by not using them 130 . The full picture of occupational mismatch is difficult to capture for a number of reasons. Firstly, the OECD's Survey on Adult Skills (PIAAC) showed that there is a substantial difference between qualification and skill mismatch 131 . Secondly, labour market characteristics affect these mismatches and require their own policy intervention 132 . And thirdly, both supply and demand differ also within countries, between sectors and occupations, and across time, which makes it difficult to anticipate trends. Going beyond the rudimentary measures possible at EU level 133 , Member States are increasingly improving their own forecasts with more refined data. Sensitising higher education to the needs of the labour market So what can Member States and institutions do to better sensitise their higher education institutions (HEIs) to the needs of the labour market? With a plethora of choices and often- difficult transitions between education types and levels or between education and work, individualised career guidance is imperative throughout the whole student lifecycle. Table 3.4.1 shows that career guidance services are indeed available to all students in the large majority of Member States. However, this career guidance is rarely informed by regular labour market forecasting or graduate tracking surveys 134 . By providing evidence-based assessments of the changes expected in the structure of the labour market and skills requirements, labour market forecasts help to build a picture of the world for which current and future higher education students are being prepared. Yet only around half of the countries conducting regular labour market forecasts make efforts to take their results into account in higher education planning at the central level (BE fr, IE, FR, IT, LV, LT, FI, SE, UK) 135 . Graduate tracking \u2013 i.e. collecting quantitative information on the employment situation and career development of graduates from specific programmes \u2013 is increasingly common in HEIs 136 . But again, the actual use of information stemming from graduate tracking, whether for career guidance or the adjustment of study programmes, remains limited.

The structural indicators pertain to 2014/15; see the country reports in Volume 2 of the Education and Training Monitor 2015 for the latest information on policy measures and reforms (http://ec.europa.eu/education/monitor). Another way to increase the relevance of programmes is to embed work-based learning, such a common component of vocational education and training (VET), across higher education. Evidence shows that students who participated in practical training before graduation are more likely to find jobs than their counterparts without relevant work experience 138 . 137 Except for BE de, which conducts regular surveys at the regional level but does not subsequently use the information systemically. 138 JRC-CRELL (2012), The employability of young graduates in Europe (https://crell.jrc.ec.europa.eu). Work-placements in higher education can be incentivised more across Europe 71 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 Only seven EU education and training systems provide incentives to their HEIs to include work placements in all education programmes (BE de, EE, ES, FR, IT, LT, RO). Traditionally emphasised only in professionally oriented higher education institutions, work placements would strengthen the relevance of academically oriented higher education institutions as well. Finally, Member States acknowledge the need for strengthened dialogue between their HEIs and labour market actors (employers and other social partners). Such a two-way communication is needed in order to improve mutual understanding of, respectively, the types of knowledge, skills and competences required in the real economy and the capacity and mission of higher education 139 . In the majority of Member States, there are formal requirements regarding the involvement of employers in external QA, the main mechanism through which education authorities can encourage HEIs to enhance the employability of their graduates. Learning mobility in higher education Particularly in times of skills shortages and bottlenecks, learning mobility can offer students the invaluable opportunity of experiencing another education and training system and establishing an international professional network. Evidence has been accumulating in recent years on how learning mobility positively affects personal development, as well as employment prospects 140 . The 2014 Erasmus impact study 141 shows that university graduates who participated in the Erasmus programme enjoy both better labour market and career developments prospects. The study also reports that an important benefit from studying abroad is the improvement of transversal skills such as communication, problem-solving and entrepreneurship. Similar effects are reported by studies provided by the national Erasmus+ agencies. As the evidence on the benefits of learning mobility is improving, so are the quantitative data on the actual share of students and graduates participating in an international learning mobility scheme 142 . On top of that, qualitative data reveal to what extent students are prepared for mobility and whether the institutional settings provide incentives or barriers 143 . Table 3.4.2 shows the share of inbound mobile students and graduates per country, out of their total student and graduate population. On average, 7.5% of the EU student population is mobile (amounting to more than 1.4 million students), up from 6.4% in 2005. Likewise, the number of Erasmus students has gone up from around 1.0% in 2005 (more than 150,000 students) to 1.3% in 2013 (more than 250,000 students) 144 . 139 While it is important for higher education institutions to respond to labour market needs, it is equally important for employers to recognise the wider function of higher education, which is to provide students with a well-rounded education for the long-term (and not just immediate business needs). 140 EUROSTUDENT V (http://www.eurostudent.eu/results/reports); JRC-CRELL (2013), Does Student Mobility During Higher Education Pay? Evidence From 16 European Countries (https://crell.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). 141 European Commission (2014), The Erasmus impact study: Effects of mobility on the skills and employability of students and the internationalisation of higher education institutions (http://ec.europa.eu/education/library/study/ 2014/erasmus-impact_en.pdf). 142 As requested by the 2011 Council recommendation that also defined the ET 2020 benchmark of at least 20% higher education graduates having had a period of study or training abroad (OJ 2011/C 372/08). 143 EUROSTUDENT V (http://www.eurostudent.eu/results/reports); European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2015), The European Higher Education Area in 2015: Bologna Process Implementation Report (http://ec.europa.eu/eurydice). 144 It should be noted that Erasmus mobility increasingly takes the form of traineeships; in 2013 they amounted to 21% of the total. Learning mobility can improve students' employment prospects Examples of recent policy measures in Member States To better match higher education programmes with labour market needs, DK is reviewing its higher education programmes and foresees cuts in public funding in fields where graduate unemployment has been significant in the last ten years. NL adopted a law on higher education offering prospective students, including talented ones, more differentiation between courses. HR is implementing the Croatian Qualifications Framework with a view to modernising higher education curricula according to the labour market needs and reducing the horizontal skills mismatch.

Evidence From 16 European Countries (https://crell.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). 141 European Commission (2014), The Erasmus impact study: Effects of mobility on the skills and employability of students and the internationalisation of higher education institutions (http://ec.europa.eu/education/library/study/ 2014/erasmus-impact_en.pdf). 142 As requested by the 2011 Council recommendation that also defined the ET 2020 benchmark of at least 20% higher education graduates having had a period of study or training abroad (OJ 2011/C 372/08). 143 EUROSTUDENT V (http://www.eurostudent.eu/results/reports); European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2015), The European Higher Education Area in 2015: Bologna Process Implementation Report (http://ec.europa.eu/eurydice). 144 It should be noted that Erasmus mobility increasingly takes the form of traineeships; in 2013 they amounted to 21% of the total. Learning mobility can improve students' employment prospects Examples of recent policy measures in Member States To better match higher education programmes with labour market needs, DK is reviewing its higher education programmes and foresees cuts in public funding in fields where graduate unemployment has been significant in the last ten years. NL adopted a law on higher education offering prospective students, including talented ones, more differentiation between courses. HR is implementing the Croatian Qualifications Framework with a view to modernising higher education curricula according to the labour market needs and reducing the horizontal skills mismatch.

Erasmus mobility is a study or training period abroad but where students graduate in their home country (where they started their study). Most countries in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe host relatively few mobile degree students, whereas LU, UK, AT and CY reveal shares close to 15% or larger 145 . The variation between countries is much smaller for Erasmus enrolments and the pattern is slightly different, with South European and Nordic countries hosting a relatively larger share of Erasmus students. Mobility stays take place in particular at the doctorate level, when students are specialising at a high level in a specific topic. The mobility rates are lower amongst students enrolled in Master's and Bachelor's programmes. Some noticeable differences across EU countries should, however, be acknowledged. UK stands out with nearly half of its Master's degree graduates being inbound mobile students. SE, NL, DK, AT and BE have between 15% and 25% inbound degree mobility at Master level and up to 40% at doctorate level. This contrasts the shares in Eastern and Southern Member States, which are often below 5% at the Bachelor, Master and in some cases even doctorate level 146 . There are several institutional factors that can facilitate outbound learning mobility or support the integration of inbound mobile students. A first example links back to Section 3.2 and the 145 LU is an outlier due to its geographical position and its small but internationally mixed population. 146 Country choice is likely to be related to the attractiveness of HEIs, clearly leaning towards the Western and Northern parts of Europe.

The next three structural indicators in Table 3.4.3 have to do with active obstacles to learning mobility. Few Member States formally allow portability of grants and loans for studying abroad without restrictions. Only nine Member States (plus BE de) facilitate mobility by providing grants for students studying abroad; a couple more allow for student loans to be used for studying abroad 149 . Consistent evidence shows that the biggest obstacle to studying abroad is the financial burden perceived by students 150 . Another active obstacle referred to in Table 3.4.3 concerns the use of the European credit transfer and accumulation system (ECTS), which is one of the most important instruments designed to facilitate recognition and enhance mobility in higher education. The use of the ECTS is, however, not followed up by external quality assurance in DE, EL, FR, HR, IT, CY, LV, LU, HU, SK, FI, SE and UK (ENG/WLS/NIR). Finally, ensuring that quality services are provided to support incoming foreign students is an important aspect of supporting positive conditions for learning mobility. While the quality of services cannot be compared across countries, the practice of external quality assurance is a reliable proxy. Only very few Member States feature quality assurance systems that take into account the integration of mobile learners from other countries (BE fr/de, DE, FR, HU, SI, UK (ENG/WLS/NIR)). Key findings and policy relevance With the employment rate of higher education graduates having been hit by the crisis and signs of occupational mismatch remaining apparent, Member States and higher education institutions (HEIs) need to ensure they take appropriate measures to strengthen the quality and relevance of tertiary education provision. Improvements can be achieved through the systematic use of information coming from labour market forecasting or graduate tracking surveys, and by embedding work-based learning across higher education. In addition, learning mobility can offer students the invaluable opportunity of improving employment prospects. Obstacles to learning mobility do remain, however, particularly when it comes to the recognition of learning credits and the portability of grants and loans. Innovation in higher education: new ways of teaching and learning Successfully modernising higher education implies fully exploiting the potential of technological advances and new models for delivery, including adapting assessment and accreditation of learning as necessary. Flexible higher education is not a new phenomenon, but the opportunities for HEIs to offer open and distance learning have changed dramatically in recent years due to evolving technological capacities. Most notable are the now almost ubiquitous provision of fast mobile and wireless networks, portable devices and the impact of the Internet and social media in particular. 149 Of course, Member States have to offer grants and loans in the first place in order for these to be portable. See European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2015), Structural indicators for monitoring education and training systems in Europe 2015 (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice). 150 The Commission has created an EU-wide loan facility for mobility (http://ec.europa.eu/education/funding- search_en.htm#_themes=higher_education). The outcomes of the 2015 EHEA ministerial conference commit to promoting portability of grants and loans (http://www.ehea.info/Uploads/SubmitedFiles/5_2015/112705.pdf). Across the EU, major obstacles to learning mobility are a failure to recognise learning credits and the non-portability of grants and loans 75 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 In addition, digital content is increasingly reproducible at low or almost no cost, particularly when institutions producing educational tools, such as recorded lectures, apply open licenses 151 . Open materials enable free sharing, reuse, translation and updating. To some extent, a new institutional model for higher education is emerging, spurred by the move towards open and accessible education, where stronger ties to business communities and civil society are also becoming increasingly important. A profound change in higher education is seen in the new options for delivery, either by expanding traditional distance learning with digital technology, or by offering alternatives like Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Open Educational Resources (OER) 152 . The technological development that has made education opportunities at the level of tertiary education more accessible, allowing for the provision of university-like courses by other organisations, is challenging the role and structure of HEIs. Distance and blended learning Most education and training systems in Europe are currently undertaking efforts aimed at providing distance learning, commonly delivered via e-learning platforms. Table 3.4.4 shows that CY, DE, EL, ES, IE, IT, MT, PT, SI and UK have specialised institutions for providing distance education. In AT, BE fr, CZ, DK, EE, EL, FI, FR, IE, IT, LV, LT, PL, RO, SE, and UK, distance learning, e-learning or blended learning are provided in most of the traditional higher education institutions (HEIs). Central level authorities in BE de, BG, CZ, IE, EE, FR, LT, LV, PL, and UK have also provided specific support (policies, projects, funding) for developing distance learning. Table 3.4.4.

A combination of in-person and technological modes of instruction seems to cater well to different audiences. One example is continuing professional development (CPD) provided by conventional educational actors through blended models (i.e. based on both independent online work and physical meetings). The vast majority of institutions offer blended learning and online learning courses (91% and 82% respectively) 154 . Less frequent, but also on the rise, are other forms of provision such as joint inter-institutional collaboration and online degree courses. MOOCs MOOCS have been heavily debated since they gained widespread attention in 2011.

Innovation in higher education: new ways of teaching and learning Successfully modernising higher education implies fully exploiting the potential of technological advances and new models for delivery, including adapting assessment and accreditation of learning as necessary. Flexible higher education is not a new phenomenon, but the opportunities for HEIs to offer open and distance learning have changed dramatically in recent years due to evolving technological capacities. Most notable are the now almost ubiquitous provision of fast mobile and wireless networks, portable devices and the impact of the Internet and social media in particular. 149 Of course, Member States have to offer grants and loans in the first place in order for these to be portable. See European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2015), Structural indicators for monitoring education and training systems in Europe 2015 (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice). 150 The Commission has created an EU-wide loan facility for mobility (http://ec.europa.eu/education/funding- search_en.htm#_themes=higher_education). The outcomes of the 2015 EHEA ministerial conference commit to promoting portability of grants and loans (http://www.ehea.info/Uploads/SubmitedFiles/5_2015/112705.pdf). Across the EU, major obstacles to learning mobility are a failure to recognise learning credits and the non-portability of grants and loans 75 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 In addition, digital content is increasingly reproducible at low or almost no cost, particularly when institutions producing educational tools, such as recorded lectures, apply open licenses 151 . Open materials enable free sharing, reuse, translation and updating. To some extent, a new institutional model for higher education is emerging, spurred by the move towards open and accessible education, where stronger ties to business communities and civil society are also becoming increasingly important. A profound change in higher education is seen in the new options for delivery, either by expanding traditional distance learning with digital technology, or by offering alternatives like Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Open Educational Resources (OER) 152 . The technological development that has made education opportunities at the level of tertiary education more accessible, allowing for the provision of university-like courses by other organisations, is challenging the role and structure of HEIs. Distance and blended learning Most education and training systems in Europe are currently undertaking efforts aimed at providing distance learning, commonly delivered via e-learning platforms. Table 3.4.4 shows that CY, DE, EL, ES, IE, IT, MT, PT, SI and UK have specialised institutions for providing distance education. In AT, BE fr, CZ, DK, EE, EL, FI, FR, IE, IT, LV, LT, PL, RO, SE, and UK, distance learning, e-learning or blended learning are provided in most of the traditional higher education institutions (HEIs). Central level authorities in BE de, BG, CZ, IE, EE, FR, LT, LV, PL, and UK have also provided specific support (policies, projects, funding) for developing distance learning. Table 3.4.4.

The structural indicators pertain to 2012/13; see the country reports in Volume 2 of the Education and Training Monitor 2015 for the latest information on policy measures and reforms (http://ec.europa.eu/education/monitor). A combination of in-person and technological modes of instruction seems to cater well to different audiences. One example is continuing professional development (CPD) provided by conventional educational actors through blended models (i.e. based on both independent online work and physical meetings). The vast majority of institutions offer blended learning and online learning courses (91% and 82% respectively) 154 . Less frequent, but also on the rise, are other forms of provision such as joint inter-institutional collaboration and online degree courses. MOOCs MOOCS have been heavily debated since they gained widespread attention in 2011. The Commission\u2019s High Level Group on the Modernisation of Higher Education considers MOOCs as 151 See, for instance, Creative Commons at http://creativecommons.org. 152 COM(2013) 654 final. 153 BE nl and AT have formalised agreements with institutions in other countries.

A vast array of additional digital platforms and portals are coming online, providing easy access to educational resources and course materials from institutions across the globe. However, unless MOOCs have a specific social or professional target, they are usually similar in style and content to higher education courses and attract a similar audience. Accordingly, the vast majority of participants are higher education students, former students, or upper secondary school students likely to enter higher education 156 . MOOCs are also likely to be followed by young professionals, not too removed from the world of learning, who see this as a possibility either to gain additional knowledge and skills for their professional practice, or use it as a break from their daily work routine 157 . MOOCs have not yet fulfilled all the promises that were associated with their rise, but they seem to have prompted change and innovation in higher education. As the number of new MOOCs continues to increase, business models are developed based on MOOCs and new variations on the MOOC concept. Figure 3.4.3.

A survey of practices, beliefs and strategies in five European countries (https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/ipts). Note: data collected April-June 2015. A recent survey of HEIs explored the offer of MOOCs in five Member States, showing clear disparities between them (Figure 3.4.3). In FR, ES and UK, the proportion of universities that are offering MOOCs is similar and relatively high (around 35%), compared to DE and PL at 12.0% and 7.5% respectively. However, both FR and PL stand out where the planning of future MOOCs is concerned; respectively 26.0% and 24.6% of HEIs plan to offer MOOCs in the near future. Analysis and accreditation of learning The report of the High Level Group on Modernisation of Higher Education states that advances in big data and learning analytics can help HEIs customise teaching tools and develop more 155 European Commission (2013), Improving the quality of teaching and learning in Europe's higher education institutions (http://ec.europa.eu/education/library/reports/modernisation_en.pdf). The European MOOC Scoreboard, produced within the Commission's OpenEducationEuropa initiative, counts to date more than 3,000 MOOCs globally, of which more than 1,500 stem from a European HEI or other organisation. For further information, see http://www.openeducationeuropa.eu/en/european_scoreboard_moocs. 156 European University Association (2014), MOOCs: Massive Open Online Courses (http://www.eua.be/). 157 Preliminary results from the on-going JRC-IPTS MOOCKnowledge study show the same tendency of MOOC participants being well educated and either working or studying. Most participants in the study show a relatively high degree of information literacy and interaction skills, and most of them know how to structure their own learning environment in order follow the MOOC properly. 34,8% 12,0% 7,5% 34,3% 35,0% 26,0% 12,0% 24,6% 14,3% 12,5% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% France Germany Poland Spain United Kingdom MOOCs offered MOOCs planned The potential for MOOCs to attract new groups of learners remains underexploited 77 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 personalised learning pathways based on student data 158 . Analysis and assessment of collected data can be used to improve assessment and the choice of learning materials, or as an intervention tool by instructors to identify at-risk students at an early stage. This use of analyses of big data could thus contribute to reduce drop-out and strengthening completion rates (Section 2.2). Further discussion is needed on how learning credits from stand- alone MOOCs can be recognised and whether they could be related to the instruments of the EHEA 159 . Assessment is key if MOOCs are to confer formal credits. Formal recognition of non-formal open learning can fast-track learners through traditional education programmes and enables them to demonstrate their skills and knowledge to employers. However, recognition requires careful consideration of the type of assessment used 160 . Key findings and policy relevance Exploiting the full potential of technology to improve learning is a growing priority in Member States and HEIs, and is often promoted at national or regional level, in particular where HEIs are publicly funded and perceived to have public interest. However, MOOCs are still not widespread and seem to mainly attract participants that are in some way affiliated with higher education already. In addition, MOOCs face difficulties in adapting to recognised systems for accreditation of learning, which could be an obstacle to their wider uptake. Still, MOOCs and similar models for online learning continue to increase in numbers, to change structure, to develop pedagogies and to shift target audiences. 3.5. Tackling the adult learning challenge The final domain of policy levers to be discussed in this report is learning after initial education, usually referred to as adult learning, which includes anything from on-the-job training to continuing VET or a return to formal education to obtain a doctoral degree 161 . The increasingly rapid changes in social, economic and labour market circumstances require individual citizens to be able to adapt quickly to their environment. This can be achieved by acquiring new knowledge, by learning new skills, and by further developing competences, whether cognitive or non-cognitive. More worryingly, there are many adults who, after having failed to acquire a sufficient level of knowledge, skills, competences and dispositions (i.e. positive attitudes towards learning) during initial education, find themselves unable to take full advantage of adult learning opportunities. Many of these adults are stuck in low-quality jobs that offer little opportunity either for career growth, or motivation for undertaking further learning. As the OECD's Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) 162 shows, one in four adults in Europe is caught in a low-skills trap \u2013 one that limits access to the labour market while simultaneously closing avenues to further education or training. The Commission supports Member States in their 158 However, the collection, analysis and use of learning data raise privacy concerns, and should only occur with the explicit consent of the student. 159 Such as the ECTS.

        "78 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 efforts to develop systems for adult learning, to ensure a sufficient supply of quality opportunities for relevant learning for all adults, as well as to provide compensatory routes to learning (e.g. second chance ) for those adults who cannot access such opportunities. The benefits of learning throughout life Promoting and increasing participation in adult learning brings numerous benefits to individuals, but also to companies, society, and the economy at large. There is a growing amount of research assessing those benefits. A 2015 literature review of empirical studies and meta- reviews 163 looks into recent research findings on the outcomes of adult learning, as well as the policy interventions that result in more learning (discussed further below). The review reveals a substantial evidence-base supporting a correlation between adult participation in learning and a wide range of positive externalities. Evidence available on the benefits to employers of investing in employees' training is the strongest. In particular, there are clear links between participation in learning and higher company productivity and profitability. In addition, there is clear indication of training\u2019s positive effect on workforce motivation and on the level of innovation in companies. There is also solid evidence on the positive economic outcomes of training for individuals. Existing data suggest a positive link between participation of adults in learning activities and their employability. An evaluation of the 2007-2013 European Social Fund (ESF) 164 confirms investment in training for unemployed people as one of the most effective sets of ESF measures for developing human capital. In addition to economic benefits, there is evidence on the positive social and wellbeing outcomes of adult participation in education or training. Finally, the literature review points to a further positive correlation between adult participation in learning and broader social or economic benefits. Positive macro-economic links between participation in learning and GDP growth have been recorded, as well as between participation in learning and lower unemployment levels, higher civic participation, improved public health, environmental literacy and lower re-offending rates. Adult participation in learning Bearing in mind the potential benefits that increased adult participation in learning could bring about, Member States agreed that by 2020 at least 15% of 25 to 64 year-olds in the EU should have a recent learning experience (gained during the previous 4 weeks). However, since 2009 there has been only limited progress towards this ET 2020 benchmark. The share of adult participation in learning now stands at 10.7%, with only six Member States above the target level of 15% (DK, SE, FI, FR, NL, UK). Strong effects of education attainment levels and age can be observed in all countries (Table 3.5.1). Across the EU on average, no more than 4.4% of the 66 million adults with at most lower secondary education attainment participate in continued learning. The age effect is equally significant, with very few adults participating in any formal or non- formal learning at a later age. This limited progress can be explained by a number of circumstantial factors, including the fall in employment rates due to the economic and financial crisis, an insufficient provision of training and other activation policies targeted at the unemployed and cost-saving decisions by private 163 European Commission (forthcoming), An in-depth analysis of adult learning policies and their effectiveness in Europe (http://ec.europa.eu/social/home.jsp). 164 European Commission (forthcoming), ESF 2007-2013 ex-post evaluation: Investing in human capital - final report (http://ec.europa.eu/social/home.jsp).

Recent analysis has confirmed that, whereas many Member States have indeed issued legislation promoting access to education for vulnerable groups, very few have simultaneously adopted indicators to assess progress towards such stated objectives, for instance monitoring the number of unemployed adults who should take up these opportunities each year 165 .

Strong effects of education attainment levels and age can be observed in all countries (Table 3.5.1). Across the EU on average, no more than 4.4% of the 66 million adults with at most lower secondary education attainment participate in continued learning. The age effect is equally significant, with very few adults participating in any formal or non- formal learning at a later age. This limited progress can be explained by a number of circumstantial factors, including the fall in employment rates due to the economic and financial crisis, an insufficient provision of training and other activation policies targeted at the unemployed and cost-saving decisions by private 163 European Commission (forthcoming), An in-depth analysis of adult learning policies and their effectiveness in Europe (http://ec.europa.eu/social/home.jsp). 164 European Commission (forthcoming), ESF 2007-2013 ex-post evaluation: Investing in human capital - final report (http://ec.europa.eu/social/home.jsp). Adult learning brings numerous economic and social benefits to individuals, employers and society at large No more than 4.4% of the 66 million adults with low education attainment participate in learning activities 79 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 companies as well as public institutions.

Recent analysis has confirmed that, whereas many Member States have indeed issued legislation promoting access to education for vulnerable groups, very few have simultaneously adopted indicators to assess progress towards such stated objectives, for instance monitoring the number of unemployed adults who should take up these opportunities each year 165 . The lack of concrete, measurable commitments by the Member States in their policy documents, combined with an overall adult learning rate that has been stagnant during the last decade, raises the question as to what extent Member States\u2019 policies are making an actual impact on adults\u2019 access to and participation in education and training. 165 European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice (2015), Adult education and training in Europe: Widening access to learning opportunities (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice).

However, the number of policy measures that have been evaluated and confirmed as likely to make a positive impact is much smaller.

Among the set of policy levers likely to impact adults' disposition towards further learning, the provision of targeted guidance stands out as one of the most effective. Stronger still, among the policy actions linked to employer investment in learning, is the effect of co-financing of employers\u2019 investment on the amount of work-related training. 166 European Commission (forthcoming), An in-depth analysis of adult learning policies and their effectiveness in Europe (http://ec.europa.eu/social/home.jsp). 81 Education and Training Monitor 2015 November 2015 Among the policy levers to improve access to learning for disadvantaged groups, the most meaningful intervention is the actual financing (or direct provision) of learning opportunities. Other effective measures include targeted guidance, recognition of prior learning, embedding basic skills development in adult education programmes, and the assistance of intermediary organisations (e.g. NGOs and social services) in engaging socio-economic groups that are harder to reach 167 . Such a comprehensive overview of the evidence-base on policy interventions allows for the construction of a framework for analysing and monitoring current European strategies in this domain, at both national and regional levels. A European monitoring framework is currently being pilot-tested by the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States. Key findings and policy relevance Research points to the existence of clear social and economic benefits to engaging adults into continued learning activities. Across Europe, however, the participation rate in adult learning programmes has been stagnant throughout the last decade, despite political commitments at both European and national levels. No more than 4.4% of the 66 million adults with low education attainment participate in learning activities. It is crucial to improve both the design and the implementation of current adult learning schemes. Such a re-think should include a more careful selection of policy levers, explicit targets and more rigorous frameworks for policy evaluation. Strong examples of policy levers are co-financing schemes to support employers\u2019 investment in adult learning provision, financing of learning programmes for disadvantaged groups, and the alignment of training provision with the identified future skills needs of employers. 167 This literature review carried out for the Commission provides a comprehensive overview of adult learning policy interventions for which evidence exists showing a positive impact in increasing adults\u2019 participation in learning. However it does not provide information on the level of impact or the efficiency (cost-benefit assessment) of those policy actions. Examples of recent policy measures in Member States In 2014, EE adopted a Lifelong Learning Strategy , which specifically addresses the most important challenges in the area of lifelong learning, including aligning lifelong learning opportunities with the needs of the labour market and increasing participation. HU is implementing a new law on adult training, which provides for improving the organisation of training courses, enhancing the quality of their content and reinforcing their supervision.

It also points to policy levers that can actively contribute to inclusiveness, quality and relevance. Where possible, its quantitative analysis is complemented by an assessment of structural and process indicators to reveal barriers in the EU\u2019s education and training systems. The Education and Training Monitor 2015 is a report in two vol- umes. Volume 1 takes the form of a cross-national, thematic analysis. Volume 2 comprises twenty-eight individual country reports. Highlights of the country analysis are included in the summary in Volume 1, while the country reports themselves can be found online. The report\u2019s webpage also links to contextual indicators \u2013 both quantitative and structural \u2013 from, respectively, the JRC\u2019s Centre for Research on Education and Lifelong Learning (CRELL) and the Eurydice network. Moreover, the webpage contains a visualisation tool to compare country performance vis-\u00e0-vis six ET 2020 benchmarks. The cross-national, thematic analysis (Volume 1) is divided into three parts. Part one directly links education to the Commission\u2019s priorities to boost jobs, growth and investment as well as the EU\u2019s social agenda. It stresses educational poverty as a key social challenge for Europe and the consecutive budget cuts in some Member States as harmful to both short- term recovery and long-term growth. Part two focuses on education attainment levels of young people across Europe today. The Europe 2020 headline target is the cornerstone of this assessment. Part three, fi nally, off ers concrete, tangible policy levers by looking directly at issues of inclusiveness, quality and rel- evance. This includes a focus on the teaching profession; innovative pedagogies and tools in school education and higher education institutions; and aligning education provi- sion more eff ectively with the needs of the labour market. The policy levers also touch upon high-quality, inclusive ECEC; work-based learning and apprenticeships; and barriers to continued learning ast er initial education. ec.europa.eu/education/monitor E d u c a t i o n a n d T r a i n i n g M o n i t o r 2 0 1 5 N C - A J - 15 - 001 - E N - N ISBN 978-92-79-50620-8 2015_TRAI-09-ETmonitor2015-Cover_A4_avec-rabats_00.indd 1 01/10/15 14:57 "
