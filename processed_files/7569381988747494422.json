        "Amendment 1 Proposal for a decision Recital 1 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (1) Member States and the Union are to work towards developing a coordinated strategy for employment and particularly for promoting a skilled, trained and adap- table workforce, as well as labour markets that are responsive to economic change, with a view to achieving the objectives of full employment and social progress, balanced growth and a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment set out in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union . Member States shall regard promoting employment as a matter of common concern and shall coordinate their action in this respect within the Council, taking into account national practices related to the responsibilities of management and labour. (1) Member States and the Union are to develop and implement an effective and coordinated strategy for employment and particularly for promoting a skilled, trained workforce, as well as labour markets that are dynamic, future-oriented and responsive to economic change, with a view to achieving the objectives of full employment and social progress, inclusiveness, econom- ic, social and territorial cohesion, and a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment. Member States shall regard promoting quality employment based on equal opportunities and social justice as a matter of common concern and shall coordinate their action in this respect within the Council, respecting national practices and the autonomy of the social partners. The current situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which will have a serious and long-lasting impact on Union labour markets, social justice and working conditions, calls for unprecedented level of action in order to support employment, stimulate the economy, and strengthen the industrial fabric . Decisive action is necessary to protect under- takings and workers against immediate employment and income losses, and to help contain the economic and social shock of the crisis and to prevent massive job losses and a deep recession. 15.9.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 371/135 Friday 10 July 2020 ",
        "Amendment 2 Proposal for a decision Recital 2 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (2) The Union is to combat social exclusion and discrimin- ation and promote social justice and protection, as well as equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and the protection of the rights of the child. In defining and implementing its policies and activities, the Union is to take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection , the fight against poverty and social exclusion and a high level of education and training as set out in Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (2) In order to fully achieve its founding principles \u2014 social cohesion and peace -, to an even greater extent in a moment of deep crisis where those principles are challenged, the Union should have at the top of its political priorities the fight against poverty, social exclusion and discrimination and should promote social justice and protection, as well as equality between women and men, solidarity between generations , the inclusion of persons with disabilities, and the protection of the rights of the child and other highly disadvantaged groups . In defining and implementing its policies and activities, the Union is to take into account requirements linked to the promotion of the protection of human health, inclusive quality labour markets and full employment, the existence of accessible and affordable quality public services, decent salaries, decent standards of living and social protection for all, as well as a high level of education and training throughout people\u2019s lives as set out in Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) .

        "Amendment 3 Proposal for a decision Recital 3 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (3) In accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Union has developed and implemented policy coordination instruments for economic and employment policies. As part of these instruments, the present Guidelines for the Employment Policies of the Member States, together with the Broad Guidelines for the Economic Policies of the Member States and of the Union set out in Council Recommendation (EU) 2015/1184 ( 5 ), form the Inte- grated Guidelines. They are to guide policy implementation in the Member States and in the Union, reflecting the interdepen- dence between the Member States. The resulting set of coordinated European and national policies and reforms are to constitute an appropriate overall sustainable economic and employment policy mix, which should achieve positive spill-over effects.

(3) In accordance with the TFEU the Union has developed and implemented policy coordination instruments for economic and employment policies. As part of these instruments, the present Guidelines for the Employment Policies of the Member States, together with the Broad Guidelines for the Economic Policies of the Member States and of the Union set out in Council Recommendation (EU) 2015/1184 ( 5 ), form the Inte- grated Guidelines. They must support the European Green Deal, the European Pillar of Social Rights (Pillar), the revised European Social Charter, the Paris Agreement and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and guide policy implementation in the Member States and in the Union, reflecting the interdependence between the Member States. The resulting set of coordinated European and national policies and reforms are to constitute an appropriate overall sustainable economic and employment policy mix, which should achieve positive spill-over effects , while reversing the decline in collective bargaining coverage .

Following the Council decision of 23 March 2020 to activate the so-called \u2018General escape clause\u2019, Member States can exercise fiscal flexibility to promote and protect quality jobs and working conditions and to finance public health and social services. The duration of the application of the \u2018General escape clause\u2019 has to reflect the dimension and duration of the COVID-19 crisis. On the basis of the Commission\u2019s public consultation it should be examined which possible directions the development of Union fiscal rules could take. ( 6 ) OJ C 120, 26.4.2013, p. 1.

        "Amendment 5 Proposal for a decision Recital 5 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (5) The European Semester combines the different instru- ments in an overarching framework for integrated multilateral coordination and surveillance of economic and employment policies. While pursuing environmental sustainability, productivity, fairness and stability, the European Semester integrates the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights , including strong engagement with social partners, civil society and other stakeholders . It supports the delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals ( 13 ). The Union and Member States\u2019 employment and economic policies should go hand in hand with Europe\u2019s transition to a climate neutral, environmentally sustainable and digital economy, while improving competitiveness, fostering innovation, pro- moting social justice and equal opportunities as well as tackling inequalities and regional disparities. ( 13 ) UN Resolution A/RES/70/1 (5) The European Semester combines the different instru- ments in an overarching framework for integrated multilateral coordination and surveillance of economic, employment , social and environmental policies . The European Semester needs to put sustainability, social inclusion and people\u2019s wellbeing at the heart of the Union\u2019s economic policy-making, ensuring that social, environmental and economic objectives have equal priority . While pursuing environmental sustainability, productivity, fairness and stability, the European Semester should further integrate the principles of the Pillar, including stronger engagement with the social partners, civil society and other stakeholders and support the delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals ( 13 ) , including gender equality. The gender equality index could serve as one of the Semester\u2019s tool for monitoring progress towards employment and social targets and to measure the gender effects of employment and social policies . The Union and Member States\u2019 employment and economic policies should go hand in hand with Europe\u2019s response to the crisis, and should also, in view of the particularly serious effects of this crisis on certain European industrial and business sectors, support the transition to a climate neutral, environmentally sustain- able , socially inclusive and digital economy, ensuring upward social convergence while improving competi- tiveness , supporting SMEs , fostering innovation, pro- moting social justice and equal opportunities and investing in youth, as well as tackling inequalities and regional disparities.

        "Amendment 6 Proposal for a decision Recital 6 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (6) Climate change and environmental related challenges, globalisation, digitalisation and demographic change will transform European economies and societies. The Union and its Member States should work together to effectively address these structural factors and adapt existing systems as needed , recognising the close interdependence of the Member States' economies and labour markets and related policies. This requires a coordinated, ambitious and effective policy action at both Union and national levels , in accordance with the TFEU and the Union\u2019s provisions on economic governance . Such policy action should encompass a boost in sustainable investment, a renewed commitment to appropriately sequenced struc- tural reforms that improve productivity, economic growth , social and territorial cohesion, upward conver- gence, resilience and the exercise of fiscal responsibility . It should combine supply- and demand side measures, while taking into account their environmental, employ- ment and social impact. (6) Climate change and environmental related challenges, globalisation, digitalisation and demographic change are deeply transforming European economies and societies. The Union and its Member States should work together to respond to this unprecedented situation by embedding social rights and working towards a reduction of poverty and inequality and adapt existing systems to strengthen resilience and sustainability , recognising the close interdependence of the Member States' economies and labour markets , social and environmental policies. This requires a coordinated, ambitious and effective policy action at both Union and national levels. Such policy action should encompass a boost in social and environmental investment, efficient long-term measures needed to mitigate the impact of the crisis, and financial assistance to businesses , non-profit and charitable organisations, as well as households, in particular those at risk of poverty and social exclusion . It should combine supply and demand side measures , paying due attention also to the labour market demand and supply needs, and involving the use of new technologies , while taking into account their environmental, employment and social impact. Member States and the Union should adopt long-term instruments in this regard and the work of the Commission on a European permanent unemploy- ment reinsurance scheme is welcome.

        "Amendment 37 Proposal for a decision Recital 7 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (7) The European Parliament, the Council and the Commis- sion signed an inter-institutional proclamation for a European Pillar of Social Rights ( 14 ). The Pillar sets out twenty principles and rights to support well- functioning and fair labour markets and welfare systems, structured around three categories: equal opportunities and access to the labour market, fair working conditions and social protection and inclusion. The principles and rights give direction to our strategy making sure that the transitions to climate-neutrality and environmental sustainability, digitalisation and demographic change are socially fair and just. The Pillar constitutes a reference framework to monitor the employment and social performance of Member States, to drive reforms at national, regional and local level and to reconcile the \u2018social\u2019 and the \u2018market\u2019 in today\u2019s modern economy , including by promoting the social economy . ( 14 ) OJ C 428, 13.12.2017, p. 10. (7) The European Parliament, the Council and the Commis- sion signed an Inter-institutional Proclamation on the Pillar ( 14 ). The Pillar sets out twenty principles and rights to support well-functioning and fair labour markets and welfare systems, structured around three categories: equal opportunities and access to the labour market, fair working conditions and social protection and inclusion. The principles and rights give direction to our strategy and must be acted upon so as to make sure that the transition to climate-neutrality, environmental sustain- ability and digitalisation is socially fair and just and takes demographic changes and challenges into account . Considering that the Pillar and its principles constitute a reference framework to monitor the employment and social performance of Member States, the Employment Guidelines can be an important tool for Member States in developing and implementing policies and measures for a more resilient and inclusive society and economy whilst promoting labour rights and pursuing the objective of upward convergence, in order to further develop the European Social model. ( 14 ) OJ C 428, 13.12.2017, p. 10. Amendment 8 Proposal for a decision Recital 8 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (8) Reforms to the labour market, including the national wage-setting mechanisms, should follow national prac- tices of social dialogue and allow the necessary opportunity for a broad consideration of socioeconomic issues, including improvements in sustainability, compe- titiveness, innovation, job creation, lifelong learning and training policies, working conditions, education and skills, public health and inclusion and real incomes. (8) With due respect to the principle of subsidiarity as defined in the TFEU, reforms to the labour market, including the national wage-setting mechanisms, should promote a swift recovery and allow the necessary opportunity for a broad consideration of socioeconomic issues, including improvements in sustainability, compe- titiveness, growth, innovation, creation of quality employment, inclusion of persons with disabilities and otherwise disadvantaged groups , lifelong learning and training policies, working conditions, education and skills, public health and inclusion and real incomes. Member States should therefore respect and strengthen the social partners and extend collective bargaining coverage, and take measures to promote high trade union and employers\u2019 organisation density in order to ensure a democratic, inclusive and socially just recovery. 15.9.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 371/141 Friday 10 July 2020 ",
        "Amendment 9 Proposal for a decision Recital 9 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (9) Member States and the Union should ensure that the transformations are fair and socially just, strengthening the drive towards an inclusive and resilient society in which people are protected and empowered to anticipate and manage change, and in which they can actively participate in society and the economy. Discrimination in all its forms should be tackled. Access and opportunities for all should be ensured and poverty and social exclusion (including that of children) should be reduced, in particular by ensuring an effective functioning of labour markets and of social protection systems and by removing barriers to education, training and labour-market participation, including through invest- ments in early childhood education and care. Timely and equal access to affordable healthcare services, including prevention and health promotion are particularly relevant in a context of ageing societies . The potential of people with disabilities to contribute to economic growth and social development should be further realised. As new economic and business models take hold in Union workplaces, employment relationships are also changing. Member States should ensure that employ- ment relationships stemming from new forms of work maintain and strengthen Europe\u2019s social model. (9) Particularly at a moment when, both at economic and social levels, immense changes challenge the Union, Member States should ensure that those changes are fair, and socially just, strengthening the drive towards a more inclusive and resilient society in which people are protected and empowered to anticipate and manage change, and in which they can fully participate in society and the economy. Discrimination in all its forms should be eliminated. Everyone should be given the ability to contribute fully in society. Equal opportunities for all should be ensured and poverty , discrimination and social exclusion (including that of children , persons with disabilities and other disadvantaged groups ) should be eradicated. To that end the Union should implement measures such as the European Child Guarantee . The potential of persons with disabilities to contribute to economic and social development should be fully realised. As new economic and business models take hold in Union workplaces, employment relationships are also changing. As the COVID-19 crisis highlights, many low skilled workers are indispensable for the basic functioning of the economy. Too often, they are low paid and work in precarious conditions. Member States should further strengthen Europe\u2019s social model by ensuring that all workers have the same rights, decent working conditions, including health and safety at work and decent wages. Moreover, Member States should tackle all forms of precarious work and bogus self- employment, and ensure that employment relationships stemming from new forms of work are in line with Europe\u2019s social model.

        "Amendment 10 Proposal for a decision Recital 10 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (10) The Integrated Guidelines should form the basis for country-specific recommendations that the Council may address to the Member States. Member States should make full use of the European Social Fund Plus and other Union funds, including the Just Transition Fund and InvestEU, to foster employment, social investments, social inclusion , accessibility, promote up- and reskilling opportunities of the workforce, lifelong learning and high quality education and training for all, including digital literacy and skills. While the Integrated Guidelines are addressed to Member States and the Union, they should be implemented in partnership with all national, regional and local authorities, closely involving parlia- ments, as well as the social partners and representatives of civil society. (10) The Integrated Guidelines should form the basis for country-specific recommendations that the Council may address to the Member States. Member States should make full use of the European Social Fund Plus , the European Structural and Investment Funds and other Union funds, including the Just Transition Fund and InvestEU, to foster quality employment and social investments, as well as fighting poverty and social exclusion , to foster accessibility, accompany the transi- tion to a green, digital economy and promote upskilling and reskilling opportunities of the workforce, lifelong learning and high quality education and training for all, including digital literacy and skills. The use of those funds should also play a strong role in the reinforced investment on public services, particularly in the areas of education, health and housing. While the Integrated Guidelines are addressed to Member States and the Union and they should be implemented in partnership with all national, regional and local authorities, closely and actively involving , in their implementation, monitoring and evaluation, parliaments, as well as the social partners and representatives of civil society. Amendment 11 Proposal for a decision Article 2 \u2014 paragraph 1 a (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment The guidelines set out in the Annex shall be revised no later than one year after their adoption to take into account the COVID-19 crisis and its social and employment consequences, and to better respond to similar future crises. In order to strengthen democratic decision-making, the European Parlia- ment shall be involved in defining the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs on an equal footing with the Council. 15.9.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 371/143 Friday 10 July 2020 ",
        "Amendment 12 Proposal for a decision Annex I \u2014 Guideline 5 \u2014 paragraph 1 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment Member States should actively promote a sustainable social market economy and facilitate and support investment in the creation of quality jobs. To this end , they should reduce the barriers that businesses face in hiring people, foster responsible entrepreneurship and genuine self-employment and, in particu- lar, support the creation and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to finance. Member States should actively promote the development of the social economy, foster social innovation, social enterprises, and encourage those innovative forms of work , creating quality job opportunities and generating social benefits at local level. Member States should actively promote full, quality employ- ment based on a strong economy . Recognising that State investment plays a crucial role in job creation , Member States should lead a major public investment drive and smart and ambitious employment policies to create jobs. Member States should adapt their employment policies and coordinate, at Union level, the implementation of best practices with regard to temporary measures that protect all workers and labour markets. Such measures should include wage subsidies; income support and extension of unemployment benefit schemes; the extension of paid sick leave and carers\u2019 leave and remote teleworking arrangements. Member States should support the transformation of European enterprises towards ensuring self-sufficiency , in particular in protective equipment and medical devices. Member States should step up their support to businesses that are struggling as a result of the crisis provided that those businesses retain all their staff. Member States should also consider suspending dismissals during the crisis period. Member States should ensure the involvement of the social partners in the planning and implementation of such measures. Those measures should be sustained over time until a full economic recovery has been reached, after which they should be phased out. Particular attention should be paid to guaranteeing the rights and jobs of mobile and frontier workers that have been hit hard by border closures. Member States should foster responsible entrepreneurship including among women and young people, and genuine self-employment and, in particular, support the creation and growth of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to finance. Member States should actively promote the develop- ment of the circular and social economy, foster social innovation, social enterprises and strengthen their sustain- ability , and encourage those forms of work which create quality job opportunities and generate social benefits at local level , particularly in strategic sectors with strong potential for growth, such as the digital and green economy sectors . In that regard, policies supporting the creation of employment should also be implemented, in particular in public or private services of general interest, in particular childcare, healthcare and housing.

        "Amendment 13 Proposal for a decision Annex I \u2014 Guideline 5 \u2014 paragraph 2 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment The tax burden should be shifted away from labour to other sources more supportive to employment and inclusive growth and at the same time aligned with climate and environmental objectives, taking account of the redistributive effect of the tax system, while protecting revenue for adequate social protection and growth-enhancing expenditure . Taxation should be shifted away from labour towards other sources where it will have a less detrimental effect on inclusive growth and at the same time ensure the full alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the climate and environmental objectives, as defined in the European Green Deal, increasing the redistributive impact of the tax system, while protecting revenue for adequate social protection and public investment . Amendment 14 Proposal for a decision Annex I \u2014 Guideline 5 \u2014 paragraph 3 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment Member States having in place national mechanisms for the setting of statutory minimum wages should ensure an effective involvement of social partners in a transparent and predictable manner allowing for an adequate responsiveness of wages to productivity developments and providing fair wages for a decent standard of living , paying particular attention to lower and middle income groups with a view to upward convergence. These mechanisms should take into account economic performance across regions and sectors. Member States should promote social dialogue and collective bargaining with a view to wage setting . Respecting national practices, Member States and social partners should ensure that all workers are entitled to adequate and fair wages through collective agreements or adequate statutory minimum wages, taking into account their impact on competitiveness, job creation and in-work poverty. Policies to ensure that fair wages allow a decent standard of living remain important to create employment and decrease poverty in the Union as do those to ensure the compatibility of paid work and entitlement to State allowances compensating for the barriers faced marginalised groups. Member States having in place national mechanisms of statutory minimum wages should ensure the effective involvement of social partners in the related wage setting procedure in a transparent and predictable manner . The development of minimum wages should take into account productivity developments to fight against precariousness and in-work poverty , paying particular attention to lower and middle-income groups with a view to upward convergence. These mechanisms should take into account poverty indicators specific to each Member State and economic performance across regions and sectors. Member States should strengthen social dialogue and take measures to extend collective bargaining coverage . Respecting national practices and the autonomy of the social partners , Member States and the social partners should eliminate wage discrimin- ation on the ground of age or gender and ensure that all workers are entitled to adequate and fair wages through collective agreements or adequate statutory minimum wages, taking into account their positive impact on competitiveness, job creation and in-work poverty. 15.9.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 371/145 Friday 10 July 2020 ",
        "Amendment 15 Proposal for a decision Annex I \u2014 Guideline 5 \u2014 paragraph 3 a (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment Member States will be able to call on the assistance of the Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency solidarity instrument (SURE). Member States should ensure that financial assistance in this regard is only provided to undertakings that respect the applicable collective agreements. Member States should ensure that recipient undertakings refrain from making share buy backs or paying dividends to shareholders and bonuses to executives, and that these undertakings are not registered in tax havens.

        "Amendment 16 Proposal for a decision Annex I \u2014 Guideline 6 \u2014 paragraph 1 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment In the context of technological and environmental transitions, as well as demographic change, Member States should promote sustainability, productivity, employability and human capital , fostering relevant knowledge, skills and competences throughout people's lives, responding to current and future labour market needs. Member States should also adapt and invest in their education and training systems to provide high quality and inclusive education, including vocational education and training. Member States should work together with the social partners, education and training providers, enterprises and other stakeholders to address structural weaknesses in education and training systems and improve their quality and labour market relevance, also with a view to enabling the environmental transition. Particular attention should be paid to challenges of the teaching profession. Education and training systems should equip all learners with key competences, including basic and digital skills as well as transversal competences to lay the foundations for adaptability later in life. Member States should seek to ensure the transfer of training entitlements during professional career changes, including , where appropriate, through individual learning accounts. They should enable everyone to anticipate and better adapt to labour market needs notably through continuous reskilling and upskilling, with a view to supporting fair and just transitions for all, strengthening social outcomes, addressing labour market shortages and improving the overall resilience of the economy to shocks. In the context of the continuous technological and environ- mental transitions, the demographic change and the present challenges , Member States should promote social rights, sustainability, productivity, employability and human capabil- ities , fostering relevant knowledge, skills and competences throughout people's lives, responding to current unemployment crisis addressing present and future labour market needs. Member States \u2019 needs of reskilling and upskilling their workforce in order to respond to the crisis should be reinforced by investment in their public education and training systems to provide high quality and inclusive education, including voca- tional and training and formal and informal lifelong learning . Member States should work together with the social partners, education and training providers, enterprises , social non-go- vernmental organisations and other relevant stakeholders to address structural and new weaknesses in education and training systems and improve their quality and labour market relevance . Member States should address the needs of sectors with a chronic skills shortage , also with a view to enabling the simultaneous environmental transition as well as technological and digital changes which go towards solutions based on artificial intelligence . Particular attention should be paid to challenges of the teaching profession. Education and training systems should equip all learners with key competences, including basic and digital skills as well as transversal competences to lay the foundations for adaptability later in life and should prepare the teachers for being able to provide these competencies to their learners . Member States should seek to ensure the transfer of training entitlements during professional career changes, including through individual learning accounts. They should guarantee at the same time that this approach does not put in jeopardy the humanistic nature of education as well as the aspirations of individuals. It is crucial that Member States undertake early action to avoid the negative effect for individuals and societies of being outside the labour market needs notably through continuous reskilling and upskilling, with a view to supporting fair and just transitions for all, with a sufficient coverage and level of unemployment benefits, strengthen social outcomes, addressing labour market shortages and improving the overall resilience of the economy to shocks. 15.9.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 371/147 Friday 10 July 2020 ",
        "Amendment 17 Proposal for a decision Annex I \u2014 Guideline 6 \u2014 paragraph 2 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment Member States should foster equal opportunities for all by addressing inequalities in education and training systems, including by providing access to good quality early childhood education.
