        "Editorial Europe\u2019s cities are where it happens. Whether it is growth, traf- fic or urban development, the pace of life is somewhat accel- erated. Today, some 75% of Europeans live in urban areas and around 85% of the EU\u2019s GDP is generated in cities. But there is more to city life. For Europe\u2019s cities to be more livable, they need to provide basic urban infrastructure but also to offer more to remain attractive, such as adequate housing, green spaces, cultural facilities and quality education that will help ensure competitiveness in the future. In other words, they must allow people to work where they want to live. The need for investment is enormous. In 2010 alone the EIB provided finance totalling more than EUR 8bn for urban pro- jects. In this edition we shall be highlighting different projects that can help cities shape a more sustainable future. The faster pace of life in urban areas accentuates the challenges we are facing. Europe\u2019s cities account for 80% of our energy use, and 80% of greenhouse gas emissions originate in cities. This means that cities also need to provide answers to some of to- day\u2019s key challenges, such as pollution, emissions and making sure that the infrastructure keeps up with urban development. Often cities prove to be part of the answer. Innovative solu- tions found in cities are often later applied across the board. Energy-efficient buildings, low-carbon transport or resource- efficient recycling techniques are just a few examples. In this way, cities can act as catalysts for sustainable development.

        "Board of Governors praises EIB achievements and supports future strategy \u201c There is no doubt that the EU now needs to be set firmly on an up- ward path of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and job creation. To this end the EU has launched its Europe 2020 strategy and the implementation of this strategy is, along with climate action and supporting the EU\u2019s external policy, one of the three main dimensions of the Bank\u2019s activities for the years ahead\u201d, EIB President Philippe Maystadt said, address- ing Finance Ministers at the meeting in Brussels. Composed of the 27 EU Finance Ministers and assisted by the European Commission, the EIB Board of Governors meets once a year to agree on the Bank\u2019s strategic direction. The EIB President also gave an overview of the Bank\u2019s activities and main orientations for the years ahead. In response, the Finance Ministers gave broad support to the Bank\u2019s plan to reduce lending volumes to EUR 63bn for 2011, thus edging closer to pre-crisis levels, and at the same time encouraged the EIB to carefully choose instruments with which to support Europe\u2019s competitiveness and climate action. \u201cThis reflects our plan to gradually reduce lending volumes to pre-crisis levels, as our crisis response package was always de- signed as a targeted and temporary meas- ure for 2009 and 2010\u201d, President Maystadt explained. German Finance State Secretary J\u00f6rg Asmussen welcomed the reduction in lending volumes, saying \u201cThis means the EIB will be able to select and provide genuine added value\u201d. At the EIB\u2019s annual meeting on 17 May in Brussels, the 27 EU Finance Ministers (who make up the EIB\u2019s Board of Governors) praised the Bank for its results for 2010 and backed its contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy and its emphasis on climate action and support for the EU\u2019s external policy goals. \"There is no doubt that the EU now needs to be set firmly on an upward path of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and job creation.\" the Bank should continue to finance infra- structure, notably through equity funds and project bonds. The Ministers also appreciated the increase in loan signatures for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. In 2010, the EIB invested some EUR 6.2bn in renewable energy, mainly wind and solar power, and EUR 2.3bn in energy efficiency, a figure that is set to increase in the years ahead as there is still enormous potential for en- ergy savings, especially in public buildings and housing. The Board expressed a clear view that the bulk of the EIB\u2019s activities should remain within the EU and that outside the Union \u2013 currently representing 12.5% of all lend- ing \u2013 the Bank should continue to focus efforts on pre-accession and Neighbour- hood countries. Ministers voiced support for the EUR 1bn lending increase for the Mediterranean region for the period 2011- 2013 envisaged in the Bank\u2019s revised ex- ternal mandate, which is currently under negotiation between the European Parlia- ment and Council. p The 27 Ministers gave their full backing to the EIB\u2019s efforts to address, together with the European Commission, the financing gap currently existing for infrastructure, and for research, innovation and develop- ment projects. \u201cA good policy mix is some- thing you need to maintain,\u201d said Austria\u2019s new Finance Minister Maria Fekter, adding that \u201cResearch, innovation and develop- ment are three areas absolutely central to creating a modern economy\u201d.

        "Consultation discusses future of EIB transport lending Where does the EIB\u2019s transport sector financing have the biggest impact? How can it best contribute to making transport meet tomorrow\u2019s mobility needs? What are the solutions for truly sustainable transport systems and infrastruc- ture in the EU? These were some of the key questions asked at a public con- sultation meeting that the Bank organised last month in Brussels. \u201cEIB financing for clean and efficient transport can make a difference to meeting Europe\u2019s ambitious environmental targets.\u201d T ransport has traditionally been a key sector for EIB lending. Over the pe- riod 2006-2010, almost 30% of the EUR 266bn of loans provided by the Bank within the EU went to the transport sector. But the needs are huge. The European Commission expects the EU\u2019s infrastruc- ture investment requirement to reach some EUR 1.5 trillion for the period 2010-2030. Another EUR 1 trillion for vehicles, equip- ment and charging infrastructure will be needed to meet the EU\u2019s ambitious emis- sions reduction targets. By 2050, green- house gas emissions in the transport sec- tor have to be reduced by 60% compared to 1990 levels and conventionally fuelled cars should be completely phased out in cities. To get answers, ideas and perspectives on these questions, the EIB brought together 65 participants from business and indus- try organisations from all transport sec- tors, representatives from European, na- tional and regional authorities as well as \u201cWe need to make an extra effort to meet the EU\u2019s emission reduction targets,\u201d stated a representative from an environmental organisation. Stepping up lending in re- search, development and the deployment of infrastructure was seen as a key factor for the development of cleaner vehicles. The consultation meeting provided valua- ble food for thought, as well as some hands- on recommendations that will feed into the review of the EIB\u2019s transport lending policy. The Bank expects to adopt a revised lend- ing policy by the end of the year. p environmental organisations, stakehold- ers and experts from the transport sector to discuss these issues with EIB experts in Brussels on 6 June. The meeting was part of a wider consul- tation process on the EIB\u2019s transport lend- ing policy launched last year to review the Bank\u2019s policy that dates back to 2007. EIB activity is driven primarily by EU policy, but it also follows specific guiding principles and project selection criteria. \u201cEIB financing for clean and efficient trans- port can make a difference to meeting Eu- rope\u2019s ambitious environmental targets,\u201d said representatives across all transport sectors. One of the main challenges is find- ing the optimal mix of modes of transport that satisfies both environmental and mo- bility requirements. Better connections between major airports and high-speed rail, for example, are just as important as providing smart transport solutions in urban areas. EIB IN FOCUS 4 EIB INFO 2 \u2013 2011 ",

International finan- cial institutions are to provide some USD 20bn (EUR 14bn) by 2013, with EUR 3.5bn earmarked as loans from the EIB. The Bank welcomed the so- called Deauville Partnership, which will back both democratic and eco- nomic transition in the region. \u201cWe particularly recognise the importance of immediate support and will accel- erate projects that foster inclusive growth,\u201d said EIB President Philippe Maystadt. On 10 June the EIB signed its first project in Tajikistan. The EUR 7m loan will help to rehabilitate the low and medium-voltage distribution networks in the Sugd region. The project will reduce distribution net- work losses and increase energy efficiency. The loan was signed on the occasion of the visit of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan, Emomali Rahmon, to the EIB. EIB talks PPP in Casablanca More than 300 participants came to follow discussions on infrastructure challeng- es and the potential of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the Mediterranean. The Conference held in Casablanca on 30 May was jointly organised by the EIB, the Moroccan Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Association of Mediterra- nean Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ASCAME). At a time when investment of over EUR 300bn will be required by 2030 to modernise infrastructure and pub- lic services, the Conference helped to publicise current projects, encourage part- ner countries and support a common PPP initiative in the Mediterranean on the basis of the EIB\u2019s experience in the region. The event also saw the publication of a new regional study on legal and financial frameworks for PPPs in the Mediterra- nean partner countries.

It is home to a number of leading technology and natural resource companies and a vi- tal hub for intercontinental air traffic. But the Finnish capital is located on the Baltic Sea, which is frozen for many months of the year, and some parts of the city are built on islands with limited road links. In other words, urban transport is a challeng- ing proposition. This is why two major rail projects have been launched, with strong support from the European Investment Bank. The EIB is lending up to EUR 450m for the Westmetro link and EUR 45m for the Helsinki airport Ring Rail Line. Convenient, efficient and environmentally friendly \u201cThe EIB is pleased to support these signifi- cant projects, which will greatly improve urban transport links in the Greater Helsinki region,\u201d said EIB Vice-President Eva Srejber. \u201cSecuring long-term financing from inter- national financial institutions, like the EIB, is key to the realisation of the metro pro- ject\u201d, according to Matti Kokkinen, Manag- ing Director of L\u00e4nsimetro Oy, the project company that is overseeing the building of the new metro line. \u201cThe metro is conveni- ent, efficient and environmentally friendly. This will attract people to use it\u201d, Mr Kok- kinen added. Ensuring connectivity More than 100 000 passengers a day are expected to use the new Westmetro line, where automated trains will run at two- and-a-half-minute intervals at peak times, with an option to shorten this to 90 sec- onds later. Westmetro comprises a dou- ble track and seven new stations and will connect to the existing network in Cen- tral and Eastern Helsinki. It integrates the capital with the rapidly growing subur- ban city of Espoo, replacing existing bus services and encouraging commuters to switch from road transport. Westmetro is being constructed by L\u00e4nsimetro, a project company owned by the cities of Helsinki (population 573 000) and Espoo (240 000). The Ring Rail Line will connect the capital and suburbs to Helsinki airport and the Aviapolis business park. A leading transfer hub for East-West intercontinental flights, Helsinki is the only airport in the EU ena- bling airlines to operate roundtrip flights between Europe and Asia within the same 24-hour cycle. Direct routes also link Hel- sinki to the United States and many Euro- pean destinations. The new rail link includes four new sta- tions and 18 km of track. Trains will run at 10-minute intervals and speeds of up to 120 km/hour, offering an attractive alter- native to today\u2019s road links, which are often congested.

This innovative fund, totalling some GBP 100m, is part of the Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas (JESSICA) initiative, developed by the European Commission and the EIB. It brings together resources from the Eu- ropean Regional Development Fund, the London Development Authority, and the London Waste and Recycling Board. The funding of projects is expected to create around 600 jobs in London and save at least 168 000 tonnes of carbon emissions a year. Investments will target two key areas: low-carbon waste and recycling infrastruc- ture, and energy efficiency projects. Waste as an opportunity London produces 2.6m tonnes of organ- ic waste each year, which could gener- ate revenues of GBP 170m if diverted to composting and energy generation. Most of the estimated 280 000 tonnes of plas- tic produced each year usually ends up in landfill. But many forms of plastic are of high commercial value \u2013 potentially worth GBP 140m a year. Taking advantage of this unique opportunity, the London Green Fund will invest in infrastructure, such as power plants to convert waste biomass to clean energy and facilities for recycling waste products such as food and plastics. A number of projects have already been identified and will receive finance shortly. \u201cWorld cities are crucial to moving to a low-carbon economy. Using waste to gen- erate clean energy can be an important element of their contribution to climate action. The EIB, as the world\u2019s largest in- vestor in clean energy, is pleased to sup- port this impressive initiative through the London Green Fund,\u201d said EIB Vice-Presi- dent Simon Brooks. Improving quality of life in cities Energy efficiency projects supported by the Fund will include the adaptation and refurbishment of existing public and voluntary sector buildings to make them more sustainable and environmentally friendly, as well as energy efficiency im- provements to existing social housing. The projects will promote sustainable economic growth and help the capital to reduce emissions. \u201cThe move towards energy-efficient transport, homes and workplaces will deliver a better quality of life,\u201d added Boris Johnson. The EIB manages further JESSICA funds in North-West England and Scotland. Its model enables returns to be reinvested and is designed to attract private sector investment alongside European Struc- tural Fund resources. It has already been successfully applied to 19 funds in 11 EU countries totalling EUR 1.49bn. Many of these funds support energy efficiency in- vestments, in countries such as Lithuania and Bulgaria or regions such as Sicily and Pomerania. p The new London Green Fund is set to invest in recycling and energy effi- ciency to help the city cut its carbon emissions.

Better schools for a better chance In Hamburg, twice as many children with an immigrant background leave school without a formal qualification (20.4%) than in the rest of the country (9.4%). A com- prehensive education reform programme is seeking to improve education standards and reduce early school leaving. As part S ituated on the banks of the river Elbe, Germany\u2019s second largest city, with its 1.7 million inhabit- ants, faces numerous cosmopolitan chal- lenges. Although Hamburg is among the country\u2019s most wealthy cities, the district of Wilhelmsburg, a former industrial ar- ea, has not benefited from the same de- velopment as elsewhere. Separated from the rest of the city by the Elbe\u2019s north and south arms, Wilhelmsburg is also itself di- vided by various transit lines. In addition, the district has a high rate of unemploy- ment, associated social problems and a large young and migrant population.

A CZK 2bn (almost EUR 75m) loan from the EIB will help to promote sustainable urban development by improving mu- nicipal infrastructure and facilities in Pils- en, part of which will be for investment in preparation for the 2015 event. The loan will be augmented by grants from EU Structural Fund resources.

So we decided to build a new one,\u201d Burian says. \u201cThe big advantage is that we will not only have a new building, but two stages for 500 people, plus a black box, a studio for hold- ing all sorts of contemporary performances.\u201d Opening season 2014/2015 The construction of the new theatre will undoubtedly be the city\u2019s biggest cultural infrastructure investment for the European Capital of Culture. The new building will stage opera, drama, operetta and musical performances, as well as hosting concerts and exhibitions and housing studios. The number of performances is expected to grow, as the theatre will be able to cater for the ballet school, non-professional thea- tre performances and teaching. The work will begin later this year and the theatre is scheduled to open for the 2014/15 sea- son \u201cbecause we want to have it up and running for the 2015 Capital of Culture,\u201d Burian adds. p The city\u2019s biggest cultural infrastructure investment for the European Capital of Culture.

Much of the municipal- ity\u2019s efforts will be devoted to fixing the local road and street network. As prop- erty owners are responsible for paving the road in front of their property up to the centre line and many buildings are vacant, many streets in Nicosia currently have no pedestrian sidewalks and where pavements do exist they are in poor con- dition. Often, they are also not adequately designed or built and are frequently sub- ject to flooding during the rainy season. New urban transport schemes encourage people to walk thanks to the provision of adequate public spaces and increase road safety. Newly-built sports facilities will not only contribute to the fitness of Nicosians, but should also bring a new sense of com- munity to the centre. \u201cQuite a number of projects are already being carried out and in certain areas we can already see an increased interest, es- \u201cIt was clear from the first meetings that they would become part of our vision and aid us along the way.

When we took up office in 1999, Eski\u015fehir\u2019s mass transportation system was in a piti- ful state. Upgrading the rail system was on the agenda, but making the necessary in- vestment with municipal funds was incon- ceivable. Moreover, the Porsuk river was a great risk and needed to be rehabilitated. Turkey\u2019s resources were extremely lim- ited. We had no chance of securing any domestic funding. At the same time, Tur- Located on the banks of the Porsuk river, Eski\u015fehir has seen a dramatic turnaround in city life for its over 600 000 inhabitants. Endorsing its efforts to revive the city centre, the EIB has provided a EUR 110m loan to support the construction of a light rail urban transport system, the Porsuk river rehabilitation scheme and the upgrading of water and wastewater services. The mayor of Eski\u015fehir, Prof. Dr Y\u0131lmaz B\u00fcy\u00fcker\u015fen, speaks to us about urban change and city life. In step with the city \u2019s pulse \u2013 Interview with the Mayor of Eski\u015fehir key was going through an economic cri- sis. Under these circumstances, we ap- plied for EIB funding with very little hope. However, our projects were found to be realistic and well prepared, so they were supported. How have the projects backed by the EIB changed life in the city for the people? The light rail transportation system, de- spite facing opposition as construction proceeded, was completed in record- breaking time. Shortly after, it became a part of the city that Eski\u015fehir people are most proud of. Soon there were calls for it to be extended, for which work is under way over the coming months. Our light rail system, which received an award from the International Association of Public Transport, meant that buses no longer needed to enter the city centre and has enabled new pedestrian areas to be created in the centre. Today Eski\u015fehir\u2019s busy pedestrian areas are one of the city\u2019s biggest attractions as a meeting point for city dwellers and a place for community engagement. ",

All these developments have changed the minds of people who, only a few years ago, could see no reason for their children to stay in Eski\u015fehir. They began to see their own city in a new light. In fact, migration of skilled people from other regions of Tur- key to Eski\u015fehir gained momentum. All of these were things we dreamt of when we took office. They seemed impossible at the time. Even we thought that it was unlikely to become a reality in such a short time. However, Eski\u015fehir is today one of the most popular centres in Turkey.

For the EIB and Belgian and French Governments, redeveloping the Tunisian city of Sfax was a worthwhile challenge . Today, Sfax has managed to recover its historical coastline and now looks at the opportunities ahead. The EIB, in concert with the French and Belgian Governments, provided the fi- nancial backing for the project.

From there to fill- ing the golden sands of its coastline with waste material (the toxic phosphogypsum) was a small but devastating step.
