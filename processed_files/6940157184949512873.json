        "EN 2 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM The Action Plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) 1 , endorsed by the Council in 2003 2 , proposes a set of measures that include support for timber-producing countries, multilateral collaboration to tackle trade in illegal timber, support for private-sector initiatives and measures to stop investment in activities that encourage illegal logging. The cornerstone of the Action Plan is the establishment of FLEGT partnerships between the European Union and timber-producing countries with the aim of stopping illegal logging. In 2005 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 3 which establishes a licensing scheme and a mechanism to verify the legality of timber imports into the European Union. In December 2005 the Council issued directives instructing the Commission to negotiate partnership agreements with timber-producing countries in order to implement the EU FLEGT Action Plan and, in particular, to encourage trade in verified legal timber imports into the European Union from such partner countries 4 . The partnership agreement with Cameroon is the third of its kind to be negotiated, after agreements with Ghana and the Republic of Congo. The Commission entered into negotiations with Cameroon in November 2007. Negotiations have proceeded since then and included four face\u2013to-face sessions and sixteen technical sessions via video-conference. Throughout the negotiations, the Commission has been assisted by a number of Member States. The Commission has kept the Council updated on progress throughout the period, with regular reports to the Working Party on Forests and to EU Heads of Mission and representatives based in Cameroon. After each negotiation session the parties held public meetings to keep stakeholders informed of progress with the talks. In addition, Cameroon adopted a highly participatory approach involving civil society and the private sector in the development of the agreement. The Agreement addresses all the elements contained in the Council negotiating directives. In particular, the Agreement establishes the framework, institutions and systems for the FLEGT licensing scheme. It outlines the supply chain controls, legal compliance framework and independent audit requirements for the system. These are set out in Annexes to the Agreement which provide a detailed description of the structures that will underpin the assurance of legality offered by the issuance of a FLEGT licence. Cameroon developed its definition of the applicable legislation by means of extensive stakeholder consultations. It includes laws and regulations granting rights to harvest, forest management, environmental, business and labour legislation, fiscal requirements, respect for tenure and use rights of nearby communities and other social obligations laid down in forest laws, as well as regulations governing commercial activity and export trade requirements. The Agreement goes beyond the limited product coverage proposed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 (\u2018the FLEGT Regulation\u2019) to cover trade in all timber products and, in doing so, commits Cameroon to building a system that will provide assurance to the European Union that all forest products from Cameroon are legally harvested and produced and contributing positively and sustainably to Cameroon\u2019s growth. 1 COM (2003) 251. 2 OJ C 268, 7.11.2003. 3 OJ L 347, 30.12.2005. 4 Council restricted document 15102/05. ",
        "EN 3 EN The Agreement provides for controls on imports at the European Union\u2019s borders, as established by the FLEGT Regulation and the associated Implementing Regulation (EC) No 1024/2008. The Agreement includes a description of the Cameroon FLEGT licence which adopts the format laid down in the Implementing Regulation. The Agreement establishes the mechanism for dialogue and cooperation on FLEGT with the European Union, in the form of the Joint Implementation Council and a consultative body known as the Joint Monitoring Committee. It also establishes the principles of stakeholder participation, social safeguards and transparency for monitoring impacts and reporting. The Agreement sets out a time frame and the procedures for entry into force of the Agreement and for implementing the licensing scheme. Since Cameroon will upgrade and redesign its regulatory and information management system, introduce more comprehensive supply chain controls and establish independent verification of legal compliance, it will take several years to develop and test the new systems and to build capacity on the part of the government, civil society and the private sector for the tasks envisaged. The FLEGT licence scheme is expected to be fully operational by the beginning of 2012. The licence scheme will be assessed against defined criteria before the EU begins accepting FLEGT licences. The steps and process for this are defined in the Agreement and its annexes. ",

        "EN 29 EN ANNEX II Legality matrices I. D EFINITION OF LEGALITY The legality of timbers placed on the market is based on compliance with national laws and regulations and duly ratified international legal instruments, the application of which is necessary in order to guarantee the viability of forest management by the producing and/or exporting enterprise, its suppliers and subcontractors, in the name of the owners of the forest (the State, the local government district, a private owner or a community). The definition of legality drawn up by consensus by all the stakeholders in this spirit may be summarised thus: \u2018Any timber which has been verified/controlled as originating or coming from one or more production or acquisition processes that meet all of the statutory and regulatory provisions in force in Cameroon applicable to the forest sector shall be deemed to be legal timber.\u2019 The definition of the legality of the commercial timbers is based on the knowledge and application of the laws and regulations in force in Cameroon, and on compliance with the international legal instruments duly ratified by Cameroon in the forest, commercial, environmental, social and human rights fields. The national laws and regulations under consideration include in particular: \u2013 the Constitution of the Republic of Cameroon; \u2013 Law No 81-13 governing forests, wildlife and fishing of 27 November 1981, not fully repealed, and its implementing texts (including implementing Decree No 83-169 of 12 April 1983, not repealed); \u2013 the new forest law No 94-01 governing forests, wildlife and fishing of 20 January 1994, and its implementing texts (including PM Decree No 94-436 of 23 August 1994 (of which not all the provisions have been repealed), PM Decree No 95-531 of 1995 and other decisions and circulars in force); \u2013 the framework law relating to environmental management, No 96/12 of 5 August 1996, and its implementing texts; \u2013 Order No 222 MINEF 15 of 25 May 2001 laying down the procedures for implementing the DFP 16 forest management plans; \u2013 Law No 2002/003 of 19 April 2002 setting out the General Tax Code; \u2013 the legislation governing investment (Law No 2002/004 of 19 April 2002 relating to the investment charter, amended by Law No 2004/020 of 22 July 2004); \u2013 Decree No 99/781/PM of 13 October 1999 laying down the application procedures for Article 71(1) of Forest Law No 94/01 of 20 January 1994 governing forests, wildlife and fishing; \u2013 Decree No 2005/577 of 23 February 2005 on EIEs and Order No 0069 MINEP 17 of 8 March 2005 on the categories subject to EIEs 18 ; 15 Ministry of the Environment and Forests. 16 Permanent forest domain. 17 Ministry of the Environment and Nature Protection. 18 Environmental impact study.

The international legal instruments referred to above include, inter alia : \u2013 the Treaty on the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Forest Ecosystems of Central Africa and establishing the Central Africa Forests Commission \u2013 COMIFAC (February 2005); \u2013 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), signed on 3 March 1973 and amended on 22 June 1979; \u2013 the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), signed in June 1992. The application of the provisions of these international legal instruments shall follow their transposition into the national legislative texts. Any amendment to these texts and any new legislation in this field will give rise to a subsequent amendment to this Annex. The following elements were also taken into consideration when drafting this definition of legality: \u2013 the various initiatives developed on the subject of legality (TFT-TTAP 21 , REM 22 , TRAFFIC 23 , CoC 24 , FSC 25 etc.) \u2013 the PROFOREST proposal 26 of 6 September 2005 relating to traceability; \u2013 the \u2018FLEGT Briefing Notes\u2019 27 published by the European Union; \u2013 the reference tool FORCOMS (Forest Concession Monitoring System) relating to conformity to regulations, first version 2005, followed by consolidated version of February 2007 for Cameroon); \u2013 the tools OLB-BVQI 28 and TLTS-SGS 29 of February 2006 relating to legality; \u2013 the report \u2018Definition of legal timber according to the texts and regulations in force in Cameroon\u2019 (GTZ/PGDRN 30 \u2013 MINFOF 31 ) of 15 February 2006; \u2013 the report \u2018Legality of VPA Timber in Cameroon (comparative approach of different systems)\u2019, GTZ document of May 2006; 19 See Caisse nationale de pr\u00e9voyance sociale, Recueil des textes de base (1979). 20 Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. 21 Private-sector association by the name of the Tropical Forest Trust, which manages a support project to the private sector involving checking legality (the Timber Trade Action Programme). 22 Resource Extraction Monitoring. 23 WWF traceability and legal compliance project. 24 Chain of Custody, traceability system. 25 Forest Stewardship Council. 26 Project financed by the European Union. 27 Briefing note on the European Union action plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade. 28 Legal Origin of Wood/Bureau V\u00e9ritas. 29 Timber Legality and Traceability Verification/Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de surveillance. 30 Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (German Technical Cooperation Society)/Sustainable Natural Resources Management Programme. 31 Ministry of Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife.

II. T HE LEGALITY MATRICES Based on the definition of legality, Cameroon has produced a set of legality matrices intended to be used to check conformity of the operation (against the legal provisions) of the forestry entities 38 active in Cameroon, as well as that of the products they produce. These matrices are the result of participatory and ongoing work incorporating the concerns of the various stakeholders. The broad range of legality matrices stems from the fact that Cameroon forest legislation stipulates many timber supply methods, in relation to which the legality concerns differ. Each of the matrices has thus been designed to clearly highlight the specific legal requirements associated with each of the supply methods stipulated by the Cameroon legislation. Bearing in mind these specific features, eight legality matrices have already been produced for different timber supply sources: the permanent forest domain (DFP) is made up of land definitively allocated to forest, the non-permanent forest domain (DFNP) is made up of forest land which may be allocated to uses other than forest domain (agro-forest domain), and finally, the timber processing units (UTB). In the permanent forest domain (DFP) \u2013 legality matrix 1 (LM1): logging agreement (CE). \u2013 legality matrix 2 (LM2): communal forest (FCle); State logging. In the non-permanent forest domain (DFNP) \u2013 legality matrix 3 (LM3): salvage licence (ARB). \u2013 legality matrix 4 (LM4): harvested timber removal licence (AEB). \u2013 legality matrix 5 (LM5): cut timber sale (VC) in the national domain. \u2013 legality matrix 6 (LM6): community forest (FC); State logging. \u2013 legality matrix 7 (LM7): special permit (PS); ebony logging in the national domain and the communal forests. In the timber processing units (UTB) \u2013 legality matrix 8 (LM8): timber processing units (UTB). The table below summarises the various timber supply sources and the associated legality matrices.

These are: \u2013 Legality matrix for private forests (FP); \u2013 Legality matrix for lumber permits (PBO); \u2013 Legality matrix for personal timber licences (APC); \u2013 Legality matrices of communal forests (FCle) and community forests (FC), when logging other than State logging takes place (VC, PBO, APC). The legality matrices are made up of criteria, indicators and verifiers, and are involved in the global Legality Assurance System (LAS), the functioning of which is described in detail in Annex III-A. The criteria and indicators have been analysed and subsequently tested in the field for all the matrices, and only the criteria and indicators of relevance in each specific matrix have been retained. III. M ETHOD OF USE With the exception of the matrix relating to timber processing units, the legality matrices have been drawn up on the basis of five (5) common criteria, which deal respectively with the regularity: \u2013 of the administrative and legal aspects (criteria 1); \u2013 of the logging and forest management (criteria 2); \u2013 of the transport (criteria 3); \u2013 of the social aspects (criteria 4); \u2013 of the environmental aspects (criteria 5). Dependent on the matrices, these criteria are broken down into a variable number of indicators, which reflect the different legal obligations associated with these different timber supply sources. The conformity of the indicators is assessed on the basis of the verifiers. For an indicator to \u2018conform\u2019 , all the associated verifiers must first be deemed to conform. The conformity of the verifier is based on the availability of the technical documents issued by the various administrations, which are stipulated in the regulatory texts and are, for the most part, available for consultation in the central database of the Ministry responsible for forests (second generation computer system administering forestry information \u2013 SIGIF II). The issue of a \u2018certificate of legality\u2019 , which represents one of the requirements for the issue of a FLEGT licence (see Annex III-A) is only possible provided all the indicators conform.

        "EN 69 EN ANNEX III-A Legality Assurance System I. I NTRODUCTION The Legality Assurance System (LAS) is a viable means of distinguishing forest products of lawful origin from those of unlawful origin, based on the definition of legal timber laid down in the text of this Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA). It makes it possible to ensure, at any time and anywhere within Cameroon, that only timber produced or acquired legally is in circulation, and may be granted a FLEGT licence when required. It functions on the basis of the following elements: 1. verification of the legality of the forestry entity 39 ; 2. national monitoring of forestry activities; 3. national control of forestry activities; 4. verification of the conformity of the supply chain; 5. issuing FLEGT licences; 6. an independent audit. II. C OVERAGE The LAS applies to all sources of production or acquisition of timber and timber products circulating within the national territory. Timber imported 40 by forestry entities established in Cameroon will continue to be imported subject to the conditions laid down in the Cameroon legislation and regulations. Such timber does not trigger the issue of a FLEGT licence by the Cameroon issuing authorities unless it meets the origin rules (which are laid down in the economic partnership agreements) and meet at least one of the following requirements: \u2013 it holds a FLEGT licence from its country of origin; \u2013 it holds a private certificate recognised by the Cameroon Government as having originated from a sustainable management reference tool including at least the criteria required in the Cameroon legality matrices. At all events, the legality of the timber imported by the forestry entities established in Cameroon is verified at the border before entering Cameroon and again when it enters the processing units, where it will be registered in the special \u2018CEMAC plant entry\u2019 books. Close cooperation with the other CEMAC countries will ensure avoidance of the import of illegal forestry products by Cameroon. Timber in transit through Cameroon must be saved in the traceability system (in a database created in the second generation computer system administering forestry information \u2013 SIGIF II) and must 39 \u2018forestry entity\u2019 : natural or legal person, community, commune with a legal source for the production, acquisition or processing timber and derived products. 40 At present, only CEMAC timber (which originates from a country belonging to the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa, other than Cameroon) is involved in import and transit, but cover under the system may be extended to any origin other than the CEMAC countries. ",
        "EN 70 EN follow a customs route defined for that purpose. The monitoring procedures for timber in transit will be defined in detail at a later date, during the implementation period, as will the information necessary in order to confirm the fact that the timber in question is in transit, based on the existing CEMAC procedures. III. V ERIFICATION OF THE LEGALITY OF THE FORESTRY ENTITY The definition of legality and the tools used to ensure the legality of the forestry entities are set out in Annex II. This Annex includes eight legality matrices produced in order to cover the different supply sources of the timber from the permanent forest domain (DFP), the non-permanent forest domain (DFNP) or the timber processing units (UTB): \u2013 Permanent forest domain \u2022 Legality matrix 1: logging agreement (CE). \u2022 Legality matrix 2: communal forest (FCle); State logging. \u2013 Non-permanent forest domain \u2022 Legality matrix 3: salvage licence (ARB). \u2022 Legality matrix 4: harvested timber removal licence (AEB). \u2022 Legality matrix 5: cut timber sale (VC) in the national domain. \u2022 Legality matrix 6: community forest (FC); State logging. \u2022 Legality matrix 7: special permit (PS); ebony logging in the national domain and the communal forests. \u2013 Timber processing units \u2022 Legality matrix 8: timber processing units (UTB). With the exception of the UTB matrix, which has certain specific features, all the legality matrices are based on five (5) common criteria, covering the aspects of administration (criteria 1), logging and management (criteria 2), transportation (criteria 3), the social area (criteria 4) and the environment (criteria 5). Dependent on the matrices, these criteria are broken down into a variable number of indicators, which are in turn broken down into verifiers. Verification of the conformity of the situation of every forestry entity with its verifiers is based on the technical documents stipulated in the regulatory texts issued by the various administrations and are, for the most part, available for consultation in the central database of the Ministry responsible for forests (SIGIF II). This verification work in relation to the legality of the forestry entity is undertaken within a formal structure of the Ministry responsible for forests in Yaound\u00e9 (see Annex III-B), using a flexible and rigorous procedure culminating in the issue of the certificate of legality to the logging/processing forestry entity, for every right awarded to it and/or every timber processing facility it owns. The procedures for issue of the \u2018certificate of legality\u2019 (identification of the documents of the administrative file, proper functioning of the system that reconciles the data from the various Ministries involved, procedure for renewal of the certificate of legality etc.) are defined in a special regulatory provision of the Ministry responsible for forests 41 . The \u2018certificate of legality\u2019 is issued for any given fiscal year, with a period of validity of: 41 This provision will be laid down during the operationalisation phase of the system. ",
        "EN 71 EN \u2013 at most 1 year for rights relating to the permanent forest domain (management agreement and communal forests); \u2013 at most 6 months for rights relating to the non-permanent forest domain; \u2013 at most 1 year for the processing units. The certificate of legality may be suspended at any time following a dispute as described in Section V. The central departments responsible for verifying legality may trigger site visits to check the authenticity of the verifiers set out in the corresponding legality matrix, which cannot always be fully understood on the basis of documentary analysis alone. These verifications also cover the elements supplied by the partner administrations (Ministry responsible for health, employment, social affairs, the environment and natural protection etc.), who issue documents required in the legality matrices. The detailed procedure for verifying the legality of the forestry entity, and in particular the methods that will be used by the central departments responsible for verifying legality, will be drawn up during the preparatory phase. In the specific case of forestry entities holding a private certificate of legality and/or sustainable forest management, which (i) is recognised and approved by the Minister responsible for forests, which defines the conditions of issue of approvals to certifiers and private auditors, (ii) has a credible and independent audit and (iii) uses a reference tool which must include all the requirements of the Cameroon legality matrices, these will be acknowledged as being in conformity with the legal situation in Cameroon. Such forestry entities will thus receive the \u2018certificate of legality\u2019 from the central departments responsible for verifying legality, on the basis of the valid certificate renewed annually, which will be requested during the monitoring audit. Recognition by MINFOF of private certificates of legality and/or sustainable management will take place following an analysis of the reference tools used by the approved offices, in order to check that they have in fact included all the criteria, indicators and verifiers of the Cameroon legality matrices (administrative, logging and management, transport, social and environmental aspects). MINFOF will conduct a formal assessment of the private certification standards of the forest concessions in Cameroon, based on the legality matrix, during the preparatory phase. Following this assessment, a report will be drawn up, which will be published and publicly accessible. If the assessment is positive, the private certification system will be approved by the Minister responsible for forests under a regulatory provision. This approval will be published. It will hence allow the issue of a certificate of legality to companies certified under such a system, without any specific assessment having to be conducted, avoiding dual verification of legality in these certified forestry concessions. However, the forestry company receiving this approved certification must send the central departments responsible for verifying legality all the certification audit reports drawn up in relation to the private certification system, to enable it to monitor compliance with legality in this process, and thus enable the issue of the certificate of legality with respect to the enterprise and the right in question. IV. N ATIONAL MONITORING OF FORESTRY ACTIVITIES National monitoring of forestry activities is coordinated by the Ministry responsible for forests, via the specialist departments, and involves all the other administrations concerned in the national land management process. The monitoring tool is the second generation computer system administering forestry information (SIGIF II), whose central memory is located at the Ministry responsible for ",
        "EN 72 EN forests, with links (electronic links allowing information to be uploaded and real-time access) to the \u2018MESURE\u2019 tax system and the \u2018SYDONIA\u2019 customs system of the Finance Ministry. It is therefore dependent not only on the proper functioning of those departments throughout the country, but also on positive collaboration with all the actors within the forestry industry. SIGIF II is the IT tool with a central memory located at the Forests Division, on which all the data relating to the forestry industry originating from the forest and hunting control points, checkpoints, departmental delegations, regional delegations, forestry entities, tax and customs administrations etc., is held on file. It enables, at all times, the situation of every forestry entity to be ascertained and all necessary decisions in relation to the legality of their activities to be taken. It thus represents the main source of information capable of blocking the process leading to the issue of the FLEGT licence, when a forestry entity whose situation is irregular requests such a document; hence the use of the term \u2018blocking system\u2019. MESURE ( Me illeur su ivi du re ndement fiscal/improved monitoring of the tax yield) is a client/server application, which operates in the large enterprises division (DGE), in the forestry revenue security program (PSRF) and in the tax offices responsible for medium-sized enterprises (CIME) of the General Tax Directorate. Its main function is to monitor and manage taxes, fees, duties and charges. It offers a platform for entry, processing and analysis of declaration data in relation to forestry taxation. After the link with SIGIF II is set up, it will generate the following data: \u2013 general taxation data (patents, CNPS, taxes under existing law) \u2013 chart monitoring payment of the felling tax; \u2013 table monitoring payment of the plant entry tax; \u2013 chart relating to collections from public auctions and transactions; \u2013 chart monitoring collection and allocation of the RFA; \u2013 chart relating to payment of small rights; \u2013 approval expenses, expenses for the award of rights etc. All this information is used in monitoring correspondence and enters the blocking system in the event of any irregularity. SYDONIA : the customs IT system (SYDONIA) is a global application; it is used by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), in several member countries of the World Customs Organization (WCO). It is a server/user application, which is currently used by the Cameroon customs administration. Under the link with SIGIF II, it communicates the following information in real-time: \u2013 statistical data relating to quantities exported: \u2022 national log exports; \u2022 exports of logs in transit (CEMAC); \u2022 national exports of sawn timber; \u2022 exports of sawn timber in transit (CEMAC); \u2022 exports of parquet; \u2022 exports of plywood; \u2022 exports of veneers; \u2022 exports of special products; \u2022 exports of finished timber products; \u2013 statistical data on the global taxable values of the quantities exported; \u2013 statistical data on the budgetary revenue generated by the timber exports; ",
        "EN 73 EN \u2013 data relating to the forestry entities suspended from customs activity and the reasons for their suspension; \u2013 data relating to the discharge of payments and the volumes granted either by the General Tax Directorate (DGI) or MINFOF; \u2013 data relating to the volumes of logs exported by certain forestry entities holding special licences (export of logs of category 2 promotion species); \u2013 data relating to the number of FLEGT licences accompanying the shipments actually loaded; \u2013 data on the quantities of CEMAC timber in transit or imported; As in the case of MESURE, all the SYDONIA information is used in monitoring correspondence and enters the blocking system in the event of any irregularity. V. N ATIONAL CONTROL OF FORESTRY ACTIVITIES National control of forestry activities is undertaken on a day-to-day basis along the entire supply chain. All the information obtained is saved in the traceability system and enters the central database SIGIF II. This is undertaken by all the specialist departments of the Ministry responsible for forests, assisted by the forces responsible for keeping order and the Justice Ministry. It takes place in conformity with the \u2018National Strategy for Forestry and Fauna Control\u2019, which applies to the individual stages of the supply chain and is based, inter alia , on the traceability system described in this Annex. Amended control procedures will be drawn up during the preparatory phase, in order to take account of the requirements of the Legality Assurance System. The forestry control activities may give rise to disputes, which are managed using the software tool \u2018Monitoring offences and IT management of forestry disputes\u2019 (SIGICOF), a module linked to SIGIF II. The conclusions of the forestry complaint will be used in the blocking system against any forestry entity committing an offence, as soon as it has been declared guilty by the competent courts. These conclusions are therefore set out in the record of offences within the SIGIF II database and continue to block for the entity in question (i.e. prevent the issue of the certificate of legality), while not having yet produced all the legal effects laid down in the applicable regulations. VI. V ERIFICATION OF THE CONFORMITY OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN This is the traceability system for timber and derived products in Cameroon. VI a. Objective The traceability system will be capable of monitoring the trace of the timber and timber products from the forest to the point of export, including all intermediate points. This traceability system thus allows entry of the results of the logging inventory, all the volumes felled, transported, entering the plant and processed, and all the CEMAC products imported or in transit. VI b. Coverage Verification of conformity of the supply chain covers the entire national territory, all the production or acquisition methods (forestry concession, cut timber sale, community forests, communal forests, salvage licences and public auctions) and all forestry products exported, imported, in transit and exchanged within the country. ",
        "EN 74 EN VI c. Principles The system is designed on the basis of the following principles: \u2013 it is a central database (SIGIF II), which is accessible online by all the actors involved in the timber sector; \u2013 it is linked to the databases of other administrations or departments, for the purposes of linking and consolidating information [SIGIF II, SIGICOF, SYDONIA, MESURE] in real-time; \u2013 it functions in client/server mode , with regulated access to the server (group, rights etc.). Data is uploaded in real-time by all those using the system (loggers, industrial operators, exporters, importers, tax administration, customs administration and forest administration); \u2013 it permits transparency of the sector , by providing online access to reliable and relevant information to the benefit of the actors dealing with forestry problems; \u2013 it sets up the logging inventory: every tree listed under the existing legislation is given a reference number (barcode); \u2013 it is electronic (fast and reliable) and is at the same time documentary (waybills, worksite books etc.); \u2013 it is declarative and increases accountability (in both tax and forestry terms). The forestry entity is made accountable through the fact that it is itself responsible for blockages and delays: if it fails to send its felling (and other) declarations, it penalises itself as regards downstream operations (export); \u2013 it is compatible with the systems established in neighbouring countries and with those set up by the forestry entities; \u2013 it has a blocking effect in relation to the member groups, to the rights granted to each group and to the encoding of the centrally secured databases. The traceability system must include validation of data entered at every stage. (e.g.: issue of the permit by the central MINFOF requires entry of the logging inventory data); \u2013 it is a system designed to simplify the control procedures , in particular through reduction of the number of control points (identification of mandatory points of passage), through the electronic link which facilitates information exchange etc. VI d. The actors and their r\u00f4les As indicated above, the actors may encode, transmit or consult the data in SIGIF II at various levels along the traceability chain.

        "EN 84 EN VII. I SSUE OF FLEGT LICENCES The system for granting FLEGT licences validates the results of the verification of the legality of the forestry entities, of the conformity of the supply chain, of the national monitoring and control of forestry activity, for the shipments of timber that are the subjects of a FLEGT licence application. The FLEGT licence, like the certificate of legality, is a derivative of the LAS. Verification of the situation of any given timber shipment is undertaken via consultation of the secure documents exchange between \u2018the central departments responsible for legality\u2019 (at Yaound\u00e9) and the \u2018devolved departments responsible for legality\u2019 (at the export points), online, using a single use numbering system and automatic recording in the central database, or else via secure documents put out in paper format, in the event of failure of the electronic system. The FLEGT licence is issued by the designated managers of the devolved departments responsible for legality, of the Ministry responsible for forests (regional or departmental delegations, forestry and hunting control points), based on a final report supplied by SIGIF II certifying the regulatory conformity of the timber to be exported. This report represents the product of the verification of three basic signals, which are involved in the blocking system: \u2013 signal 1 : which indicates regularity with respect to the certificate of legality; \u2013 signal 2 : which indicates regularity with respect to disputes (SIGICOF); \u2013 signal 3 : which indicates regularity with respect to national monitoring (supply chain, MESURE and SYDONIA). The FLEGT licence, when required, accompanies the specification bulletins (BSE) issued by the competent local department of the Ministry responsible for forests, and enables the \u2018lading note\u2019 issued by the customs to be obtained, when the loading operations for each shipment of timber for export have been completed. In any event, staff of the Ministry responsible for forests ultimately check the conformity of the shipments with the associated FLEGT licences before the shipments in question leave. The signatures on the FLEGT licences are officially known. The procedure for the issue of the FLEGT licences is defined in a text produced by the Minister responsible for forests. The authorised signatures are sent regularly to the competent authorities of the European Union, which inform the European customs departments. Specific equipment and resources for controlling and registering the FLEGT licences prior to loading are made available to the controllers at the port of lading. The FLEGT licences and the procedures for issuing them are described in Annex V and will be the subject of further development during the preparatory phase. Timber and derived products in transit under the control of the Cameroon customs authorities will not require a Cameroon FLEGT licence for export to the European Union. ",
        "EN 85 EN VIII. I NDEPENDENT AUDIT An independent audit is conducted periodically on the entire LAS, in such a way as to ensure its credibility and its transparency from production to export, and even extends to the functioning of the competent European Union authorities. The role, competences and recruitment conditions of the independent auditor are described in Annex VI. IX. C ONCLUSION Ultimately, the LAS represents a pooling of resources for the purposes of functional synergy of a monitoring system for forestry activity, of national control along the supply chain and of the services provided in the forestry sector; the entire system undergoes an independent audit to ensure its credibility. In effect, the national monitoring of forestry activity feeds into and manages a central database at the Forests Division, with links to the partner administrations. National control of forestry activity itself takes place along the timber supply chain and the processing cycle of the files inherent in the forestry sector, and enables the regularity of the situation and of the files added by every user of the forestry sector to be confirmed at all times and at all locations around the national territory. It also enables the offences recorded in the SIGICOF database to be detected and punished. Implementation of the LAS takes place within a well-defined institutional framework. I NSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK The LAS is integrated into the existing institutional framework of the Ministry responsible for forests. The resulting institutional framework is based on management that takes account of the new order brought about by the VPA, without creating any new structures. The institutional framework thus displays all the structures and human, material and financial resources that can be mobilised in order to implement the LAS, leading to the issue of certificates of legality and FLEGT licences. The institutional framework is described in Annex III-B, while the requirements are described in Annex X. ",
        "EN 86 EN ANNEX III-B Institutional framework of the Legality Assurance System I. I MPLEMENTATION STRUCTURES OF THE L EGALITY A SSURANCE S YSTEM The Legality Assurance System (LAS) in Cameroon is implemented as part of the functioning of the internal structures of the Ministry responsible for forests (MINFOF). These structures operate at different levels (central and devolved departments) and to different degrees, in order to put into operation the various elements on which the LAS is based (see Annex III-A), namely: \u2013 verification of the legality of the logging/processing forestry entity; \u2013 national monitoring of forestry activities; \u2013 national control of forestry activities; \u2013 verification of the conformity of the supply chain; \u2013 issuing FLEGT licences; \u2013 independent audit. The various entities responsible for implementing the LAS, and their roles, are described below, with specific focus on the new aspects involved in issue of the legality certificate and/or the FLEGT licence, these being the two new documents originating out of the LAS. I a. Central departments responsible for controlling legality These departments are part of the Forest Division (DF). The departments in question are: the department responsible for rules on activities in forest areas (SN) and the department responsible for the administration of forestry information (SEGIF). They operate under the authority of the Forest Taxation and Agreements Sub-Division (SDAFF), which is answerable to the Forests Division, which is in turn answerable to the General Secretariat (SG) of the MINFOF, under the authority of the Minister responsible for forests and fauna. The department responsible for rules on activities in forest areas (SN) , in addition to other duties that are devolved to it by the organisation chart, examines applications for \u2018certificates of legality\u2019 and verifies the conformity of the activities of the forestry entities with the provisions of the legality matrices (see Annex II). In this context, it liaises (consultation and documentary or electronic applications) with all the internal departments of MINFOF (DF [Forests Division], DPT, DFAP [Department of Wildlife and Protected Areas], BNC etc.) and the competent departments of the other administrations involved in the issue of the documents required under the legality matrices (Ministries responsible for: the environment, finance, customs, customs, health, industry, mines, employment, social services and agriculture). An interministerial committee to monitor links will also be set up by the national committee responsible for monitoring the Agreement. Once the verifications have been undertaken, the SN validates the applications for a certificate of legality and transmits them to the department responsible for administration of forestry information , to enable draft certificates of legality to be prepared and the associated data encoded in the database. ",
        "EN 87 EN The department responsible for administering forestry information (SEGIF) , as its name implies, is responsible for administering all the information on the forestry sector that is available in the second generation computer system administering forestry information (SIGIF II) database, which it uses to respond to all requests for information and/or to produce the certificates of legality, following the example of other annual forestry operation permits and certificates. It is therefore this department which houses the central memory of the SIGIF II, which is the tool with which all data on the forestry sector are centralised and processed along with the data from the links with the other administrations. This is where the notices and signals necessary to allow the issue of the FLEGT licence, where applicable, are issued (see Annex III-A), and the issue of draft certificates of legality. The draft certificates of legality issued by the SEGIF are sent for examination by the Forest Taxation and Approvals Sub-Division (SDAFF), its direct hierarchical superior, which sets them along the normal file processing route to the point of signature by the Minister responsible for forests and fauna, via the Secretary General (SG). In summary, issue of the certificates of legality involves the invention of the departments in the following order: SN-SEGIF-SDAFF-DF-SG-MINFOF. I b. Devolved departments responsible for legality All the devolved structures of the MINFOF are involved in implementing the LAS. Some, which are selected according to their position along the timber circulation and/or loading route, play a key r\u00f4le, specifically: the border posts, the forestry and hunting control posts (PCFC) of the timber production/acquisition locations, the checkpoints, regional delegations, departmental delegations, forestry and hunting control posts of the timber loading points and of the airports. These departments are responsible for application of the legislative and regulatory requirements as regards national monitoring of forestry activity, timber control and traceability, with special responsibility, at loading points, for the export of timber and derived products, where the FLEGT licences are issued. The border incoming timber PCFCs (forestry and hunting control posts): are responsible for: \u2013 verifying the legality of the imported timber (verifying conformity of the documents presented with the products being transported); \u2013 applying the requirements for placing them in the customs route for timber in transit, together with the customs departments; \u2013 encoding the data in SIGIF II; \u2013 reading and verifying the barcodes on the imported timber and signing the transport documentation; \u2013 applying barcodes to timber in transit and imported timber. The PCFC\u2019s (forestry and hunting posts) of the timber production or acquisition locations are responsible for: \u2013 controlling logging operations (physical and documentary control); \u2013 marking inspection of logs and stumps; \u2013 reading and verifying barcodes; \u2013 recording data; \u2013 stamping waybills on departure from the sites. ",
        "EN 88 EN Checkpoints: a distinction is made between plant entry and road checkpoints, some of the latter being mandatory points of passage; they are responsible for the following, as applicable: \u2013 plant entry/departure control; \u2013 physical cargo control; \u2013 waybill control; \u2013 encoding the data in SIGIF II; \u2013 reading and verifying barcodes; \u2013 signing waybills; \u2013 recording data; The PCFCs (forestry and hunting control posts) at the loading points for exported timber (ports of Douala, Kribi, Limb\u00e9, Idenau, Campo and the airports) are responsible for: \u2013 controlling the timber traceability elements (physical and documentary control); \u2013 recording data; \u2013 taking receipt of and examining the files on applications for FLEGT licences, then forwarding these to the competent departmental delegation for preparation of the licences in question, provided they conform to the conditions laid down in Annex III-A. The departmental delegations are responsible for: \u2013 supervising the activities of the PCFCs situated in the geographical area for which they are responsible; \u2013 physical control of cargos (forest section); \u2013 waybill control (forest section); \u2013 encoding the data in SIGIF II; \u2013 monitoring and control of coherence of logging data; \u2013 reading and verifying barcodes; \u2013 signing waybills and/or specification bulletins and forwarding them to the competent regional delegation; \u2013 collecting copies of duly completed DF10 worksite books and bill of lading forms; \u2013 recording data; \u2013 on behalf of the departmental delegations at the points of loading, issuing the FLEGT licences on the basis of a complete and conforming file forwarded by the forestry and hunting control posts of the point of loading for export. For this purpose, they have a link to the SIGIF II database, which provides them with signals relating to the legality of the logging/processing forestry unit and the shipments of timber for export in accordance with Annex III-A. The FLEGT licences issued are returned to the forestry and hunting control posts at the points of loading, where the lading formalities will be completed with the customs departments. The regional delegations are responsible for: \u2013 supervising the activities of the departmental delegations; \u2013 physical cargo control (regional teams); \u2013 waybill control (regional teams); \u2013 monitoring and control of coherence of logging data; ",
        "EN 89 EN \u2013 encoding the data in SIGIF II; \u2013 reading and verifying barcodes; \u2013 applying barcodes for timber sold at public auction; \u2013 signature of specification bulletins and their transmission to the competent PCFC of the point of loading for export, for the export formalities associated with the customs departments; \u2013 collecting DF10 worksite books and waybill copies; \u2013 recording data. Finally, virtually all of MINFOF devolved departments and central technical division departments specialising in forestry, are links in the implementation chain of the LAS, with some specific features in the Forest Division, where the certificates of legality are initiated, and in the departmental delegations, where the FLEGT licences are issued. The monitoring and control activities involving the timber production/acquisition and circulation routes are of course undertaken normally and on an ongoing basis by the controllers of the National Control Team (BNC) and of the regional delegations, by the staff of the departmental delegations and of the forestry and hunting control points throughout the national territory. When the Legality Assurance System is launched, the structures responsible for its implementation will enjoy the technical assistance, for a pre-determined period, of the research departments, which will have put in place the technical and technological tools of the traceability system.

        "EN 93 EN ANNEX IV Conditions governing the release for free circulation in the European Union of timber and derived products exported from Cameroon and accompanied by a FLEGT licence I. P RINCIPLES In order to guarantee the efficient operation of the Cameroon FLEGT licensing scheme, the Member States of the European Union must verify that the timber and derived products sent from Cameroon and entered for release for free circulation in the European Union are accompanied by a FLEGT licence in accordance with the rules (see Articles 6 and 10). The existence and regularity of the FLEGT licence are ascertained following documentary verification by the competent authorities that the States will have designated. The timber and derived products within a shipment will not be released for free circulation until the customs authorities have been informed of the existence and regularity of the FLEGT licence corresponding to the shipment. Before the FLEGT licensing scheme is launched, the European Party will notify the Cameroon Party of the list of competent authorities designated by each of the Member States and also the procedure that will be used by those competent authorities. II. D EADLINES The FLEGT licence scheme establishes a set of requirements and procedures designed to verify that the timber and derived products shipped to the European Union are produced legally. The establishment of this scheme must not be at the expense of the competitiveness of the timber and derived products originating from Cameroon. The deadlines for release for free circulation within the European Union must in particular be observed, in order to prevent any distortion against timber and derived products originating from a country that has not established a FLEGT licence scheme. This concern will be taken into account by the Joint Monitoring Committee (JMC) and has been explicitly included in: \u2013 the \u2018Terms of Reference for the Independent System Audit (ISA)\u2019 (Annex VI, Section II.4); \u2013 the \u2018Evaluation criteria for the system established in the European Union to accept FLEGT licences\u2019 (Annex VIII, Section VI). III. P ROCEDURE The importer sends the licence accompanying a shipment to the competent authorities of the Member State in which the customs declaration for the purposes of release of the shipment for free circulation is made. The importer is actively encouraged to send the licence before the shipment arrives in the European Union, in order to allow its prior processing by the European authorities. The competent authorities examine the licence from five aspects (documentary control): ",
        "EN 94 EN \u2013 conformity to the specimen or to the technical specifications of the licence for Cameroon, which the European Commission transmitted earlier to the competent authorities; \u2013 presence of an original or of a replacement document bearing the word \u2018Duplicate\u2019, issued by the licensing authority; \u2013 the fact that the examination date is earlier than the expiry date appearing on the licence; \u2013 absence of erasures and alterations, unless they have been authenticated by the licensing authority; \u2013 absence of extension of the validity of the licence, unless the extension was issued by the licensing authority. Following the examination, the competent authorities inform the customs authorities, in accordance with the applicable national procedures, of the existence, regularity and number of the licence. This information is required by the customs authorities processing the customs declaration for release for free circulation. The importer mentions the licence number on this declaration. During examination of the licence, the competent authorities may request further information from the Cameroon issuing authorities, in order to confirm the existence and regularity of the licence. They may also decide to undertake controls to determine whether the shipment itself conforms to the information in the licence (this is termed a \u2018physical inspection\u2019). If a physical inspection is decided upon, the authorities of the Member State endeavour to undertake their controls at the same time and in the same place, so that they only need to inspect the shipment once. If a physical inspection is undertaken, the volume and net weight of the shipment are deemed to conform to the information in the licence where the volume or net weight of the timber and derived products in the shipment does not vary by more than 10% from the volume or net weight stated in the corresponding licence.

        "EN 113 EN ANNEX VIII Criteria for evaluation of the Legality Assurance System (LAS). This Agreement provides for the implementation of a Legality Assurance System (LAS) intended to guarantee that all timber and derived products specified in the Agreement and exported from Cameroon to the European Union are produced entirely legally. The LAS should include: \u2013 a definition of legally produced timber that lists the laws that must be complied with in order for a licence to be issued; \u2013 control of the supply chain to track timber from the forest to the point of export; \u2013 verification of compliance with all elements of the definition of legality and control of the supply chain; \u2013 the procedures for issuing certificates of legality and FLEGT licences, and finally \u2013 the independent audit to ensure that the system is working as intended. The LAS will be subject to an independent technical evaluation before the licensing scheme becomes fully operational; the Terms of Reference will be jointly agreed between the Parties, via the Joint Monitoring Committee (JMC) for the Agreement. These evaluation criteria describe what the LAS is expected to produce and will provide the basis for the Terms of Reference for the evaluation. The evaluation will be aimed in particular at: \u2013 reviewing the system description with special focus on any revisions made after the FLEGT-VPA was signed and \u2013 examining the functioning of the system in practice. I. D EFINITION OF LEGALITY Legally produced timber needs to be defined on the basis of the laws applicable in Cameroon. The definition used must be unambiguous, objectively verifiable and operationally workable and, as a minimum, include those laws which cover: Harvesting rights : granting of legal rights to harvest timber within legally gazetted boundaries. Forestry operations : compliance with legal requirements regarding forest management including compliance with relevant environmental and employment legislation. Fees and taxes : compliance with legal requirements concerning taxes and fees directly related to timber harvesting and harvesting rights. Other users : respect for other Parties\u2019 legal tenure or rights of use of land and resources that may be affected by timber harvesting rights, where such other rights exist. Trade and customs : compliance with legal requirements for trade and customs procedures. Is it clear what legal instrument underpins each element of the definition? Are criteria and indicators that can be used to test compliance with each element of the definition specified? Are the criteria/indicators clear, objective and operationally workable? ",
        "EN 114 EN Do the indicators and criteria clearly identify the roles and responsibilities of the various Parties and does verification assess performance of all relevant Parties? Does the definition of legality include the main areas of existing law outlined above? If not: why were certain areas of law left out of the definition? In drawing up the definition, did the Parties concerned consider all the main areas of applicable law? Does the legality control system incorporate the main legal provisions identified through prior discussion between the various Parties involved? Has the definition of legality and the legality control matrix been amended since the FLEGT-VPA was concluded? Have indicators and criteria been defined to ensure verification of these changes? II. C ONTROL OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN Systems to control the supply chain must provide credible assurance that timber products can be traced throughout the supply chain from harvesting or point of import to the point of export. It will not always be necessary to maintain physical traceability for a log, log load or timber product from the point of export back to the forest of origin, but it is always needed between the forest and the first point of mixing (e.g. a timber terminal or a processing facility). II a. Logging rights There is clear delineation of areas where forest resource rights have been allocated and the holders of those rights have been identified. Does the control system ensure that only timber originating from a forest area with valid and permissible rights of use enters the supply chain? Does the control system ensure that enterprises carrying out harvesting operations have been issued appropriate logging rights for the forest areas concerned? Have the procedures for issuing logging rights and information on issued logging rights and their holders been published? II b. Systems for controlling the supply chain There are effective mechanisms for tracing timber throughout the supply chain from harvesting to the point of export. The approach for identifying timber may vary, ranging from the use of labels for individual items to reliance on documentation accompanying a load or batch. The selected method should reflect the type and value of timber and the risk of contamination with illegal or unverified timber. Are all the supply chain alternatives identified and described in the control system? Are all stages in the supply chain identified and described in the control system? Are methods defined and documented to (a) identify the product origin and (b) prevent mixing with timber from unknown sources in the subsequent stages of the supply chain? ",

Which organisations are in charge of controlling the timber flows? Do they have adequate human and other resources for carrying out the control activities? Is there a protocol for verifying the results of the control procedures set up and applied? Are the application procedures clearly defined and communicated to all interested Parties? II c. Quantities There are robust and effective mechanisms for measuring and recording the quantities of timber or timber products at each stage of the supply chain, including reliable and accurate pre-harvest estimates of the volume of standing timber in each harvesting site. Does the control system produce quantitative data of inputs and outputs at the following stages of the supply chain? \u2013 standing timber, \u2013 logs in the forest, \u2013 transported and stored timber, \u2013 arrival at the primary processing facility, \u2013 control within the processing facilities, \u2013 arrival at point of export? Which organisations are responsible for feeding the quantitative data into the control system? How are these organisations linked? Are the staff of these organisations given standard training in data management? What is the quality of the controlled data? If different organisations are responsible, how is it ensured that control performance and data management are conducted in the same way in each organisation? II d. Data gathering All data is recorded in a way which makes it possible to reconcile it with the prior and subsequent links in the chain in a timely manner. Reliable reconciliation is carried out for the entire supply chain. Is all quantitative data recorded in a way which makes it possible to quickly reconcile quantities with the prior and subsequent stages in the supply chain? Are there methods to assess coherence between inputs of raw materials and outputs of processed products at sawmills and other plants? ",

What information systems and technologies are applied for storing and reconciliation of data and for recording it? Are there robust systems in place for securing the data? How is unauthorised access to the system avoided (system security)? How is the viability of the security systems guaranteed? Which organisation is responsible for data reconciliation? Does it have adequate human and other resources for carrying out the data management activities? What information on the supply chain control is made publicly available? How can the interested Parties access this information? II e. Mixing of legally verified timber with timber approved elsewhere If mixing of logs or timber from verified legal sources with logs or timber from other sources is allowed, there are sufficient controls in place to exclude timber from unknown sources or which was harvested without legal logging rights. Does the control system allow verified timber to be mixed with other approved timber (e.g.: with imported timber or timber originating from a forest area where clear legal harvesting rights have been granted, but that is still not covered by the full verification process)? What control measures are applied in these cases? For example, do controls ensure that verified output volumes declared do not exceed total verified input volumes at each stage? What are the conditions for introducing into the supply chain confiscated timber sold at public auction, and is there a viable verification procedure? II f. Imported timber products There are adequate controls to ensure that imported timber and derived products have been legally imported. How is the legality of imports of timber and derived products demonstrated? What evidence is required to demonstrate that imported products originate from trees harvested legally in a third country? Does the LAS identify imported timber and timber products throughout the supply chain? Where imported timber is used, can the country of origin be identified on the FLEGT licence, including that of components in composite products? Does the use of barcodes on imported timber guarantee that only forestry products that have been legally logged and processed will be exported with a FLEGT licence? (For example, what happens to imported timber after the initial processing stage, how is the mark applied, how will the mark be altered after the subsequent processing stages)? ",
        "EN 117 EN III. V ERIFICATION Verification provides adequate checks to ensure the legality of timber. It must be sufficiently robust and effective to ensure that any non-compliance with requirements, either in the forest or within the supply chain, is identified and corrective action is taken in good time. III a. Organisation Verification is carried out by a government, a third-party organisation or some combination of these, which has adequate resources, management systems and skilled and trained personnel, as well as robust and effective mechanisms to control conflicts of interest. Has the government appointed a body or bodies to undertake the verification tasks? Is the mandate (including associated responsibilities) clear and in the public domain? Are the responsibilities clearly allocated and are the required competences associated with the responsibilities clearly defined; how are they implemented? How do the departments responsible for verifying legality guarantee the highest possible level of rationalised collaboration and data management between the administrations involved in forestry sector control (MINEP \u2013 MINFI etc.)? Does the verification body have adequate resources for carrying out the verification of the legality definition and the systems for controlling the timber supply chain? Does the verification body have a fully documented management system that: \u2013 ensures adequate competence/experience for the personnel of the verification body, \u2013 applies internal control/supervision, \u2013 includes mechanisms to control conflicts of interest, \u2013 ensures transparency of the system, \u2013 defines and applies verification methodology, \u2013 uses a publicly accessible complaints management system? III b. Verification against the definition of legality There is a clear definition setting out what has to be verified. The verification methodology is documented and ensures that the process is systematic, transparent, evidence-based, carried out at regular intervals and covers everything included within the definition. Does the verification methodology cover all elements of the legality definition and include tests of compliance with all specified indicators? Does verification require: \u2013 checks of documentation, operating records and field operations (including spot checks), \u2013 collection of information from external interested Parties, \u2013 recording of verification activities that allows checking by internal auditors and the independent monitor? Are institutional roles and responsibilities clearly defined and applied? ",

The verification methodology is documented and ensures that the process is systematic, transparent, evidence-based, carried out at regular intervals and covers everything included within the scope, and includes regular and timely reconciliation of data between each stage in the chain. Does the verification methodology fully cover checks on supply chain controls? Is this clearly spelt out in verification methodology? What evidence is there to demonstrate application of verification of supply chain controls? Are institutional roles and responsibilities clearly defined and applied? Are the verification results on supply chain control made publicly available? How can the interested Parties access this information? III d. Non-compliance There is an effective and functioning mechanism for requiring and enforcing appropriate corrective action where offences are identified. Does the verification system define the above requirement? Have mechanisms been developed for handling non-compliance? Are these applied in practice? Are there adequate records available on the offences identified and corrective action taken? Is the effectiveness of corrective actions evaluated?

What information on issued licences goes into the public domain? V. I NSTRUCTIONS ON THE INDEPENDENT SYSTEM AUDIT The Independent System Audit (ISA) is a function that is independent of Cameroon\u2019s forestry sector regulatory bodies. It aims to provide credibility to the FLEGT licensing scheme by checking that all aspects of the LAS are operating as intended. V a. Institutional arrangements Designation of authority: Cameroon has formally authorised the ISA function and allows it to operate in an effective and transparent way. Independence from other elements of the LAS: There is a clear separation between organisations and individuals that are involved in management or regulation of the forest resource and those involved in the independent audit. \u2013 Does the government have documented requirements for the independence of the independent auditor? \u2013 Do provisions state that organisations or individuals from both Parties having a commercial interest or an institutional role in the forestry sector are not eligible to perform the independent auditor function? Designation of the independent auditor: The independent auditor was appointed through a transparent mechanism and there are clear and publicly-available rules regarding his actions. \u2013 Has the government made the terms of reference for the independent auditor publicly available? \u2013 Has the government documented the procedures for appointing the independent auditor and made them publicly available?

VI. THE \u2018E VALUATION CRITERIA OF THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED IN THE E UROPEAN U NION TO ACCEPT FLEGT LICENCES The FLEGT Regulation and its application measures lay down procedures for establishing the FLEGT licensing scheme, including procedures to enable verification that the Cameroon timber products intended for release for free circulation within the European Union are properly covered by a FLEGT licence. These procedures also require Member States to designate a competent authority to take on this responsibility. ",
        "EN 121 EN Since these are new measures introduced specifically to implement the FLEGT scheme, the evaluation will examine the degree of preparedness of the European Union as regards verification of the FLEGT licences. Have the competent authorities been identified in each Member State? Has this information been made public? Have the procedures for processing the FLEGT licences been established in every Member State? Have these procedures been made public? Have appropriate legislation and regulations been established where deemed necessary by the Member States? Have the means of communication between the competent authorities and the customs authorities been determined? Have procedures been established to enable the European Union, or any person or body designated by the European Union, to gain access to relevant documents and data and to avoid any problems arising that could hamper the proper functioning of the FLEGT licensing scheme? Have procedures been established to enable the independent auditor to gain access to all relevant documents and data? Have reporting methods been negotiated between the Member States and the European Commission? Have publication procedures for these reports been drawn up and adopted? Do procedures cover cases where goods accompanied by a FLEGT licence are not accepted? Have procedures been established to report any contradictions in the licences and to deal with offences? Has the information relating to fines in various offence scenarios been published? ",

F INANCING MECHANISMS A large proportion of the activities required for implementation of the VPA is already included under the sector reforms introduced by the Cameroon Government, which are identified as some of the priority activities to be undertaken by the Forest and Environment Sector Programme (PSFE). As a result, their financing is assured through the instruments identified under that programme, in particular: a) for funds provided by Cameroon itself: \u2013 the national budget; \u2013 the Special Forestry Development Fund (FSDF). b) for contributions by the partners: \u2013 the Common Fund; \u2013 budgetary support. However, additional financial resources are needed for some actions that are specific to the VPA, hence the need to seek resources elsewhere: \u2013 from the development partners: the support of the European Union via the 10 th European Development Fund (EDF) and other mechanisms to be identified; \u2013 internally: the introduction of a tax. These additional funds must be mobilised in accordance with the Forest and Environment Sector Programme. II. S UPPORTING MEASURES The implementation of actions more specific to the VPA will require supporting measures in the following fields: a) capacity building; b) communication; c) promotion of FLEGT products on the European market; d) monitoring the domestic timber market; e) industrialisation; f) monitoring the impact of the VPA; g) helping to monitor implementation of the Legality Assurance Scheme (LAS); h) modernising the traceability system; i) strengthening the national control system; j) the Legality Assurance System; k) the system for issuing FLEGT licences; l) establishing the independent audit; m) reforms of the legal framework; n) seeking additional financing. To this end, the Parties must ensure that adequate technical and financial support is in place, in order to enable the Cameroon Government to implement the necessary actions. ",
