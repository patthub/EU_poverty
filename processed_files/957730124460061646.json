        "EN 1 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL \u2022 Reasons for and objectives of the proposal Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the creation of a European Child Guarantee with a view to ensuring that \u2018every child in Europe at risk of poverty or social exclusion has access to the most basic of rights like healthcare and education\u2019 1 . Supporting children from an early age and throughout their childhood is of paramount importance with a view to building a sustainable, equal, inclusive and competitive knowledge economy and a fair society. With the aim of preventing and combating social exclusion, this proposal supports Member States in their efforts to guarantee access to quality key services for children in need: early childhood education and care, education (including school-based activities), healthcare, nutrition, and housing. While most children in the EU already have access to these services, inclusive and truly universal access is vital for ensuring equal opportunities for all children, and in particular those who experience social exclusion due to poverty or other forms of a disadvantage. Social exclusion is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon . Its key drivers are insufficient resources and poverty, but also lack of equal access to goods and services due to various forms of disadvantage, preventing full participation in the society 2 . The proposal targets children in need , referring to children at risk of poverty or social exclusion. In view of the multi-faceted challenges faced by people with low income, having difficulties to access goods and services or the labour market, a composite indicator being \u2018 at risk of poverty or social exclusion \u2019 has been agreed at EU level. The indicator measures: (i) the number of people who have an equivalised disposable income (after social transfers) that is less than the at risk of poverty threshold 3 ; (ii) severe material deprivation, that captures the lack of basic goods that are needed to guarantee an adequate standard of living in a given society 4 ; and (iii) very low work intensity 5 . Children living in such households are particularly prone to social exclusion and are the group targeted by this recommendation. In a majority of EU-27 countries, the rate of persons at risk of poverty or social exclusion is higher for children than for the total population. In 2019, 22.2% (nearly 18 million) of children lived in households at risk of poverty or social exclusion, as opposed to 20.9% (around 91 million) for the total population. The reduction of the risk of poverty or social exclusion among children over the last decade has been slower than among the general 1 Political Guidelines for the European Commission 2019-2024. 2 See for instance: Communication from the Commission \u2018Towards a Europe of Solidarity: Intensifying the Figh t Against Social exclusion, Fostering Integration\u2019, COM(92)542. Resolution of the Council and of the ministers for social affairs meeting with in the Council of 29 September 1989 on combating social exclusion, OJ C 277, 31.10.1989, p. 1- 1. \u2018The multi -dimen sional analysis of social exclusion\u2019, Levitas at al, (2007); \u2018Leaving no one behind: the imperative of inclusive development. Report on the World social situation 2016.\u2019, UN (2016). 3 Fixed at 60% of the national median equivalised disposable income after social transfers. 4 Severe material deprivation means the enforced inability to pay for at least 4of the following 9 items: (1) rent, mortgage or utility bills; (2) keeping home adequately warm; (3) unexpected expenses; (4) eating meat or proteins regularly; (5) holidays; (6) a television set; (7) a washing machine; (8) a car; (9) a telephone. 5 This reflects the share of the population under 60 years old who live in households where the people of working age have worked less than 20% of their total work potential during the past year.

        "EN 2 EN population. In addition, the poverty gap 6 in EU-27 is higher for children (25.4% in 2019) than for the rest of the population (24.3%), with the same holding true for the persistence of poverty 7 (14.1% for children in 2018 vs 10.8% for the rest of the population). There is a strong correlation between social exclusion of children and the lack of access to key services. Children living in poverty or who experience particular disadvantages are more likely to face barriers in accessing services, which are key for their well-being and the development of social, cognitive, and emotional skills. While such services in all Member States are generally in place, the evidence shows that the access is uneven. In around one third of Member States, parents on moderate incomes find costs of early childhood education and care to be very high. Schoolbooks, school transport, meals and additional school-based activities place a significant burden on family budgets in 15 Member States. In several Member States, only some healthcare-related services for children are fully free of charge. In six Member States, more than 10% of children experience severe housing deprivation. Homelessness has increased in nearly all Member States, also affecting children. The drivers of unequal access to services may be manifold and can include: the lack of financial resources to cover for the costs of the services by parents or guardians; limited availability, particularly in rural 8 , remote or disadvantaged areas; lack of adaptation of services, or personnel, to children with particular needs; lack of information on the available services; or administrative barriers. Alongside poverty, other forms of disadvantage create barriers for inclusion and participation in the society. The proposal also recommends that, when designing their national integrated measures to support children at risk of poverty or social exclusion, Member States take also into account, wherever appropriate, the specific needs of children who are homeless or experience severe housing deprivation; who have a disability; those with a migrant background; with a minority racial or ethnic background (particularly Roma); those being in alternative (especially institutional) care; and children in precarious family situations. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are disproportionally affected by social exclusion, often resulting from poverty or deprivation. Depending on the Member State, the poverty risk for children raised by a single parent, in families with three or more children, or with a migrant or Roma background is up to three times higher than that of other children 9 . Children from disadvantaged backgrounds also show considerably lower early childhood education and care attendance rates. Children placed in institutional care may not fully benefit from mainstream and inclusive education. Furthermore, children with disabilities, with a migrant background or those living in rural or remote areas might be unable to take part in many of school-based activities. Barriers can include affordability, the lack of proper infrastructure, poor accessibility, or language problems. The participation of those children in preventive health programmes is also hindered. Low-income status or a precarious family situation often result in irregular or unhealthy nutrition. Finally, the lack of access to affordable and adequate housing, including safe drinking water, poses an increased risk of severe housing deprivation and affects the overall wellbeing of children. All these access 6 The relative median at-risk-of-poverty gap that helps to quantify how poor the poor are. It is calculated as the difference between the median equivalised disposable income of people below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold and the at-risk-of-poverty threshold, expressed as a percentage of the at-risk-of-poverty threshold. 7 The persistent poverty rate is the share of persons living in a household with an equivalised disposable income below the poverty threshold in the current year and in at least 2 of the preceding 3 years. 8 The Commission will adopt in June 2021 a Communication entitled \u2018The long - term vision for rural areas\u2019, which inter alia will address a limited access of children to services or infrastructures in rural, remote or disadvantaged areas . 9 Joint Employment Report 2021 adopted by the Council on 15 March 2021.

        "EN 3 EN barriers perpetuate the intergenerational cycle of social exclusion, with profound and long \u2010 term effects on children\u2019s lives. Preventing and combating social exclusion of children is essential for social progress and sustainable development. Social exclusion has damaging effects on the present and future opportunities of children and on their capacity to contribute to today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s society. Children who are socially excluded are less likely than their better-off peers to perform well in school and enjoy good health. They are at a higher risk of dropping out of school and, when they become adults, are more likely to be (long-term) unemployed and to experience poverty, because of reduced job opportunities and earnings. Poor education and health also have an important economic and labour market impact as they hinder the employment growth and lead to a lower-quality and less-productive workforce. The COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities and entails a significant risk of an increased poverty or social exclusion rate. It has created socio-economic risks for women and vulnerable groups such as single parents, children and the elderly, the persons with disabilities, migrants, minorities, younger and precarious workers and people living in areas and households with limited or no digital connectivity. Low and middle-income groups have a higher probability of income loss due to increasing unemployment and fewer telework possibilities. The impact on the disposable income of households is expected to drive up inequalities and may lead to new categories of households being at risk of poverty or social exclusion. School closures resulted in children missing out a reliable source of nutrition, as many children were deprived of school meals. Widespread digitalisation mitigated to a certain degree the education loss caused by school-closures, but many children lacked good home- learning environments e.g. due to the lack of necessary equipment, a poor internet connection, or lack of support in school work. COVID \u2010 19 and social distancing measures also affected formal care arrangements, education, and leisure services. There is consensus in the EU on the importance of guaranteeing effective and non- discriminatory access to quality key services for children who face various forms of disadvantage. In its Resolution of 24 November 2015 10 , and as confirmed in its Resolution on the European Social Fund Plus of 4 April 2019 11 , the European Parliament called for a European Child Guarantee, with a focus on children in poverty and with an emphasis on certain key services. The Parliament also asked the Commission to explore the feasibility of such a European Child Guarantee via a multi-annual preparatory action. In its conclusions of 8 June 2020, the Council likewise invited the Commission to deliver a proposal for a European Child Guarantee. In its Special Report 20/2020 on child poverty of 29 September 2020 12 , the European Court of Auditors highlighted that a better targeting of Commission support to the Member States actions is needed to combat child poverty. Reacting to this report, the Council called on the Commission to include actions and objectives to tackle child poverty in its future initiatives, including as part of the European Semester economic coordination process. On 11 March 2021, the European Parliament adopted a Resolution on 10 European Parliament resolution of 24 November 2015 on reducing inequalities with a special focus on child poverty (2014/2237(INI)). 11 European Parliament legislative resolution of 4 April 2019 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), (COM(2018)0382 \u2013 C8-0232/2018 \u2013 2018/0206(COD)). 12 Special Report 20/2020: \u2018Combatting chil d poverty \u2013 Better targeting of Commission support required\u2019, European Court of Auditors, 2020.

The European Parliament also highlighted that Member States should establish multi-annual national strategies for tackling child poverty and social exclusion and the European Child Guarantee national action plans. No child should be left behind. The demographic trends and skills shortages, highlighted in the Commission\u2019s Report on the impact of demographic change adopted on 17 June 2020 14 , make it indispensable to foster the potential of the young generations, regardless of their socio-economic background. While the EU experiences one of the highest levels of social inclusion and cohesion in the world 15 , a decisive policy action is needed to support children in more difficult circumstances and who may face barriers due to different forms of disadvantages. Therefore, the European Child Guarantee puts focus on supporting children in need. The European Pillar of Social Rights provides the framework for EU and national action for fair and well-functioning labour markets and social protection and inclusion 16 . The European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan 17 strives for further improvements in living standards, working conditions and equal opportunities for all, thereby ensuring fairness, resilience and upward social convergence. The Action Plan provides a new impetus to address poverty or social exclusion in the EU. It sets the target to reduce by at least 15 million the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion, and out of this at least 5 million should be children. The revised Social Scoreboard will track performance and trends in the Member States, enabling the Commission to monitor progress towards the implementation of the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights as part of the well-established policy coordination framework in the context of the European Semester. The objective of the European Child Guarantee is to prevent and combat social exclusion by guaranteeing the access of children in need to a set of key services. In doing so, the initiative will contribute to fostering equal opportunities for children in need and combating child poverty. To achieve this objective, and on the basis of extensive consultation process, the proposal: \u2013 recommends Member States to target support measures at children in need, understood as persons under the age of 18 years who are at risk of poverty or social exclusion; \u2013 when identifying children in need and within this group, recommends Member States to take into account, wherever appropriate, specific forms of a disadvantage, such as 13 European Parliament resolution of 11 March 2021 on children\u2019s rights in view of the EU Strategy on the rights of the child (2021/2523(RSP)). 14 Report on the Impact of Demographic Change, European Commission, 2020. 15 For instance, overall income inequality, as measured by the S80/S20 ratio, amounted in 2018 to 8.4 for the US but only 5.05 for the EU-27, with other leading economies either lacking recent and reliable data (China estimate for 2011 was 28.3), or being above the EU level (UK 5.6, Japan 6.2).

The proposal recognises that addressing the drivers of social exclusion of children is a multi- dimensional challenge. The European Child Guarantee itself will be effective only within a broader set of integrated measures, as outlined in the action European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan , and within a broader policy framework of the EU strategy on the Rights of the Child , to which this proposal also contributes. To this effect, the proposal recommends that Member States build a supportive enabling policy framework by: (i) ensuring that relevant policies are consistent with one another and improving their relevance for supporting children; (ii) investing in adequate education, health and social protection systems; (iii) providing labour market integration measures for parents or guardians and income support for families and children; (iv) addressing the territorial dimension of social exclusion, including in distinctive urban, rural and remote areas; (v) strengthening cooperation and involvement of various stakeholders; (vi) avoiding discrimination and stigmatisation of children in need; (vii) supporting strategic investments in children and services, including enabling infrastructure and qualified workforce; and (viii) allocate adequate resources and making optimal use of the EU funding. Union funds are available to support measures addressing child poverty and social exclusion and the implementation of the European Child Guarantee . Within the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), for the 2021-2027 financing period, Member States that have a rate of children at risk of poverty or social exclusion higher than the EU average (in 2017-2019) will have to earmark 5% of the ESF+ for combatting child poverty or social exclusion, while other Member States will be required to earmark an appropriate amount. The European Regional Development Fund will contribute as well with future-proof investments in social infrastructure, equipment and access to quality and mainstream services, as well as with cooperation projects in border regions. The Recovery and Resilience Facility will provide an opportunity to strengthen the growth potential, job creation and economic, social and institutional resilience of the Member States, including through the promotion of policies for children and the youth, and to mitigate the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis, contributing to the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, and enhancing economic, social and territorial cohesion.

Member States will also continue benefitting from the 2017 \u2013 2023 EU milk, fruits and vegetable scheme 18 . In 2023, the Commission will propose a revision of the scheme to make healthy products more available to children and improve their understanding of the benefits of healthy and sustainable food. \u2022 Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area The 2013 Commission Recommendation Investing in Children: breaking the cycle of disadvantage 19 set out an integrated approach to reducing child poverty or social exclusion and improving child wellbeing. The Recommendation focused on the three strands: (i) access to adequate resources; (ii) ensuring access to affordable quality services; and (iii) upholding children\u2019s rights to participate in play, recreation, sport and cultural activities, as well as in decision-making that affects their lives. This proposal complements the existing policies in the area of combating social exclusion of children, builds on the experience and lessons learnt from the implementation of the Investing in Children Recommendation and reinforces its second strand by prioritising access to key services for children in need. The European Semester economic and employment coordination process, supported by the Social Scoreboard 20 , has highlighted the challenge of child poverty or social exclusion, with a number of Member States receiving related country specific recommendations 21 . The Employment Guidelines 22 underline the importance of ensuring the access of everyone, including children, to certain services, such as early childhood education and care, education and healthcare, with such access serving as a necessary condition for ensuring equal opportunities. In the 2014-2020 financing period, European Structural and Investment Funds (in particular the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund and the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived) supported a number of policy areas relevant for children, including tackling child poverty or social exclusion, quality mainstream education and care services, as well as healthy and nutritious food and material assistance to deprived children. In 2017-2020, the Structural Reform Support Programme provided technical support to implement Member States\u2019 reforms aimed at: (i) increasing the quality of early childhood education and care and preventing early school leaving; (ii) making education systems more inclusive; (iii) supporting deinstitutionalisation of children; (iv) improving access to services for children with disabilities; (v) fostering social integration of migrant and ethnic minority children; (vi) increasing the child-friendliness of national justice systems; and (vii) reviewing family protection legislation, to meet the evolving needs of all types of families. 18 Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007, OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 671 \u2013 854. 19 Commission Recommendation 2013/ 112/EU of 20 February 2013 \u2018Investing in children: breaking the cycle of disadvantage\u2019, OJ L 59, 2.3.2013, p. 5. 20 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/european-pillar-of-social-rights/indicators/social-scoreboard-indicators. 21 Country-specific recommendations address a broad range of issues relevant to child poverty, such as income support, inclusive education, access to early childhood education and care, access to healthcare and homelessness. 22 Council Decision (EU) 2020/1512 of 13 October 2020 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, OJ L 344, 19.10.2020, p. 22 \u2013 28.

Increasing labour market participation of underrepresented groups, including women, will also contribute to tackling poverty; the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan sets a headline target of achieving an employment rate of 78% and puts forward a complementary ambition to at least halve the gender employment gap, by 2030.

On 12 November 2020, the Commission adopted the LGBTIQ Equality Strategy 2020- 2025 36 , which presents measures to promote inclusion and combat discrimination against LGBTIQ persons and their families, including children. On 24 November 2020, the Commission adopted an action plan on integration and inclusion 2021-2027 37 , which covers migrants and EU citizens with a migrant background. The action plan focuses on the enabling factors essential for a successful integration and inclusion: education and training, employment and skills, and health and housing. It pays particular attention to children of migrants and EU citizens with a migrant background. On 3 February 2021, the Commission adopted a Communication entitled \u2018 The Europe\u2019s Beating Cancer Plan \u2019 38 , putting childhood cancer under the spotlight. One of the flagship initiatives of the plan is to launch the \u2018Helping Children with Cancer Initiative\u2019 to ensure that children have access to rapid and optimal detection, diagnosis, treatment and care. The EU Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2021-2030 39 aims to improve the lives of persons with disabilities in the coming decade, in the EU and beyond . The strategy also adopts an intersectional perspective to the needs of children with disabilities.

LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY \u2022 Legal basis Under Article 151 TFEU, the objectives of the Union and the Member States include the promotion of improved living conditions, proper social protection, and the development of human resources, with a view to lasting high employment and the combating of exclusion. Improving equality of opportunities for all children living in the EU contributes to reaching those objectives. Under Article 153 (1)(j) TFEU, the Union supports and complements the activities of the Member States in the field of combatting social exclusion, with a view to achieving the objectives of Article 151. The proposal is based on Article 292 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), under which the Council adopts recommendations on a proposal from the Commission, in conjunction with Article 153(1)(j) and Article 153(2) TFEU. The proposal will contribute to the objectives of the Treaty on European Union, notably to combating social exclusion and discrimination, and protecting the rights of the child (Article 3 of the Treaty). The proposal will also contribute to implementing the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, and particularly to its Article 24, which recognises that children have the right to protection and care as is necessary for their well-being, and Article 33, which stipulates that the family must enjoy legal, economic and social protection. \u2022 Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) While policies addressing child social exclusion are the responsibility of the Member States, the Union has the competence to support and complement Member States\u2019 actions. The proposal ensures the added value of action at the EU level. It will uphold a political commitment to advance on equal opportunities for all children, and in particular for children in need, and will support upward social convergence of Member States. The added value of EU-level action is becoming even greater in view of the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, as its socio-economic impacts are likely to disproportionately affect children in need. The European Child Guarantee will help mitigate some of the negative effects of the pandemic by ensuring that children in need have full access to key services. While respecting the Member States\u2019 competences, the proposal gives concrete content to this ambition in particular by capitalising on 8 years of the implementation of the Investing in Children Recommendation. A focused EU intervention to reduce the gap between children in need and their better off peers in terms of access to key services will ultimately contribute to ensuring equal opportunities for children in the EU, while avoiding the high economic and societal costs of child social exclusion and the intergenerational transmission of disadvantages. The proposal will also help Member States to make best use of the EU and national funding in order to address social exclusion of children. The Commission strongly encourages Member States to address child social exclusion as a matter of priority. ",
        "EN 11 EN \u2022 Proportionality The proposal complements Member States\u2019 efforts in the area of addressing social exclusion of children. It respects Member States\u2019 practices and the diversity of systems. It recognises that different national, regional or local situations could lead to differences in how the Recommendation is implemented. This will allow Member States to make use of the Recommendation according to their specific context. Proportionality also played a key role in guiding the choice of the instrument. \u2022 Choice of the instrument The instrument is a proposal for a Council recommendation, which abides by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. It builds on the existing body of the European Union law and is in line with the type of instruments available for European Union actions in the area of social policy. As a legal instrument, the proposal signals the Member States\u2019 commitment to the measures laid down in this Recommendation and provides a strong political basis for cooperation at European level in this area, while fully respecting the remit of the Member States. 3. RESULTS OF EX POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS \u2022 Ex post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation In 2017, when presenting the European Pillar of Social Rights, the Commission took stock of 4 years of the implementation of the Investing in Children Recommendation 47 . The assessment was complemented by a study by experts from the European Social Policy Network entitled \u2018Progress across Europe in the implementation of the 2013 EU recommendation on Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage. A study of national policies\u2019 48 . The Commission assessment reviewed progress achieved, both in general policy terms and for each of the three strands. It also examined the impact on policy-making for children and families, including a number of good practices and practical examples of actions taken. The assessment concluded that the full implementation of the Recommendation was still work in progress. Although the Recommendation received strong support both at national and EU level, including from the European Parliament and civil society, it was still neither well- known nor properly used within the Member States at the local level, where concrete policy mechanisms have to be developed and implemented. However, the assessment did highlight that the Recommendation inspired a number of projects with positive impact. It was, to various degrees, successfully used as a policy lever in the European Semester, contributing to relevant country-specific recommendations to Member States on topics ranging from early childhood education and care services and income support to inclusive education.

The assessment highlighted that most Member States agreed that only a comprehensive integrated approach would be an effective strategy capable of breaking the cycle of disadvantage. Member States identified this renewed focus and the need to improve cooperation between all stakeholders at local level as a challenge. Most Member States agreed that it is socially fair and economically sound to invest more in children during the early years and that the provision of high-quality early childhood education and care is the key component. Finally, in terms of achievements, the assessment found out that the Recommendation\u2019s first two strands, on access to income and services, were instrumental in bringing about concrete policy changes and developing projects. In addition, the study by the European Social Policy Network concluded that the improvement in the Member States on access to affordable quality services was insufficient and uneven. The least progress has been made in the areas of access to housing, healthcare and education. Lessons learnt from the implementation of the Investing in Children Recommendation and the findings of the European Court of Auditors underline that combating social exclusion of children effectively requires reinforced efforts to better target the EU funding support in the Member States. \u2022 Stakeholder consultations The Commission carried out a targeted consultation between July and November 2020 through on-line questionnaires, focus groups and dedicated hearings, which involved Member States through the Council\u2019s Social Protection Committee, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the European social partners, civil society organisations and children themselves. This proposal reflects to a large degree the stakeholders\u2019 views gathered during the consultations. A majority of the respondents to the targeted consultation emphasised that the EU has a major role to play in supporting national, regional and local authorities in coordinated efforts to improve the situation of children in need. The stakeholders welcomed an initiative on a European Child Guarantee and stressed the importance of ensuring access to free early childhood education and care, free education, free healthcare, adequate housing and healthy nutrition, and of ensuring play and recreational activities for children. The majority of consulted stakeholders were in favour of proposing a Council recommendation on a European Child Guarantee. Stakeholders also stressed the importance of including specific groups of children in the target group of the Child Guarantee. They highlighted the importance of developing and implementing integrated strategies in fighting social exclusion and breaking the cycle of disadvantage, focusing not only on children\u2019s needs, but supporting entire families. The proposal benefits also from the wide consultation process with children where 10.000 children took part. The outcome called for the European Child Guarantee to focus on concrete and effective measures to ensure equal treatment of all children, with particular attention to 49 In the 2014 \u2013 2020 programming period, 25.6% of the total ESF allocation of EUR 86.4 billion was earmarked for social inclusion measures.

The study focused on four specific groups of socially vulnerable children: children in residential care, children with disabilities, children with a migrant background (including refugee children) and children living in a precarious family situation. It analysed the feasibility of guaranteeing them access to 5 key services: free healthcare, free education, free early childhood education and care, adequate housing and healthy nutrition. The study concluded that the access of the above categories of children to the 5 services indeed needs to be improved. Lack of access may have short- and long-term consequences for children themselves, but also for society. Mainstream services need to be inclusive to ensure that children in need benefit fully and avoid stigma and segregation. Although ensuring access to the services would be an important part of tackling child social exclusion, it would need to be placed within a broader approach, as set out in the Investing in Children Recommendation, and within an enabling social policy framework. Finally, EU funds have considerable potential to play a more effective and strategic role in supporting access to the services. The \u2018Study on the economic implementing framework of a possible EU Child Guarantee scheme including its financial foundation\u2019, complementary to the feasibility study, explored what could be the cost and benefits for the competent authorities of guaranteeing that all children in need have indiscriminatory access to the 5 services covered by the European Child Guarantee. The study concluded that benefits will have both a short-term impact on children\u2019s lives and a long-term impact on children\u2019s prospects as adults, on society and on future public expenditures. The study showed that the costs associated with providing children in need with free school meals, free quality early childhood education and care and removing school costs are relatively low, and are especially low in the light of the potentially high benefits that the actions can bring. Finally, the Commission, at the request of the European Parliament and in partnership with UNICEF, is running pilot projects in Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, and Italy to test these actions on the ground, and is researching the policy frameworks in Germany, Lithuania, and Spain. This will provide a valuable input to the implementation phase of the proposed recommendation. 50 \u2018Feasibility Study for a Child Guarantee, Final Report\u2019, European Commission, 2020. 51 \u2018Study on the economic implementing framework of a possible EU Child Guarantee Scheme including its financial foundation, Final Report\u2019, European Co mmission 2020.

It also aims to combat discrimination of children, including on the grounds of their sex or sexual orientation \u2013 or that of their parents. (15) The objective of this Recommendation is to prevent and combat social exclusion by guaranteeing the access of children in need to a set of key services. Children in need are persons under the age of 18 years who are at risk of poverty or social exclusion 58 . (16) In order to provide for effective access or effective and free access to key services, Member States \u2013 in accordance with national circumstances and approaches \u2013 should either organise and provide such services or provide adequate benefits so that parents or guardians of children in need are in a position to cover for these services. (17) There are close to 18 million children at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the EU. One of the main determinants of social exclusion of children is the unequal access to key services, which are essential for the wellbeing and the development of social, cognitive and emotional skills. Children living in poverty or children from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to face barriers in accessing early childhood education and care, inclusive education, healthcare, healthy nutrition and adequate housing. They start their lives at a disadvantage, which can have long-term implications for their development and future prospects. (18) The intergenerational transmission of social exclusion jeopardises social cohesion over generations and generates higher costs to our welfare states, hindering economic and social resilience. Improving equal access of children in need to the key services is an important means of stepping up efforts to prevent and combat social exclusion. It also contributes to fostering equal opportunities for children in need and combatting child poverty.

Investing in equal opportunities for children lays the foundation for a sustainable and inclusive growth, supporting fair and resilient societies and upward social convergence. It also contributes to addressing the impact of adverse demographic developments by reducing skills and labour shortages and ensuring a better territorial coverage, while harnessing the opportunities arising from the green and digital transitions. (20) Equal access to quality and inclusive early childhood education and care and education is central to breaking the transmission of social exclusion and securing equal opportunities for children in a disadvantaged situation. However, limited availability and high costs of early childhood education and care can form a barrier for children from low-income families. Their attendance rates are considerably lower and result later on in worse educational outcomes and higher school drop-our rates, in particular for children with a migrant background or Roma children. Segregation and discrimination in accessing mainstream education by children with disabilities or special educational needs remains a challenge. The choice of the educational establishment needs to reflect the best interests of the child. The growing number of children with a migrant background in education systems calls for the prevention of segregated school settings and the adaptation of teaching methods. (21) Important part of learning, including acquiring social skills, takes place by means of sport, leisure or cultural activities. Such activities proved to be beneficial, especially for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. However, certain groups of children may either not afford them or their participation is hindered by the lack of proper infrastructure, poor accessibility or language problems. (22) Children from low-income families have hindered access to certain healthcare services, such as dental care or to supports, such as braces, corrective lenses or spectacles. They also have fewer opportunities and resources to benefit from disease prevention and health promotion programmes. Income poverty and other social determinants significantly affect the overall development and health, including mental health, of children and increase the risk of ill-health in later years. Early intervention and prevention are essential. Better access to public health prevention and promotion programmes, including vaccination, and parenting support can help achieve better outcomes. (23) Access to healthy and sustainable nutrition is a challenge notably for low-income families. Healthy food and nutrition programmes can help address problems such as poor diet, lack of physical activity, obesity or use of alcohol and tobacco, thereby reducing malnutrition and poor nutrition, which is more prevalent among children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the importance of the school meal schemes for some children, who suddenly were deprived of a reliable source of nutrition during the lockdown 59 . (24) Children from low-income families, with a migrant background or with a minority racial or ethnic background are at a higher risk of severe housing deprivation, overcrowding, and energy poverty, and are more exposed to homelessness.

        "EN 21 EN adequate accommodation in emergency shelters is an important mechanism for tackling social exclusion of children and minimising the risk of homelessness. Aiming at the de-institutionalisation of children, the placing of children in institutional care should be used as last resort, taking into account the best interest of the child. Quality community-based or family-based care should be promoted. Providing support to children who leave institutional care would support their independent living and social integration. (25) The COVID-19 pandemic may have far reaching effects on the economic and social well-being of families and children, and is likely to disproportionally affect children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Low and middle-income groups face a higher risk of income loss, with potentially significant impact on the disposable income of households due to increasing unemployment and reduced telework possibilities. The crisis is expected to exacerbate existing inequalities and is likely to result in an increase the number of households being at risk of poverty or social exclusion. It also puts a significant pressure on the availability of services. Children experiencing various forms of a disadvantage are among the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Distance learning has been difficult for many children living in households without adequate family support, skills or equipment, including for children living in remote or rural territories with inadequate digital infrastructure. (26) Tackling social exclusion of children and reducing the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic requires an integrated, person-centred and multidimensional approach and an enabling policy framework. Strengthening cooperation and coordination between services at various levels warrants effective prevention and supports social inclusion of children. Along with ensuring access to the key services, across all regions and territories, including through investments in services\u2019 infrastructure and the workforce, it is also necessary to improve the effectiveness and relevance of related policies, combine preventive and remedial measures and make the best out of existing Union instruments. (27) The European Semester economic and employment coordination process, supported by the Social Scoreboard, has highlighted the challenge of child poverty or social exclusion, with a number of Member States receiving related country specific recommendations. The Employment Guidelines underline the importance of ensuring the access of everyone, including children, to certain services, such as early childhood education and care, education and healthcare; with such access serving as a necessary condition for ensuring equal opportunities. (28) Union funds are available to support the implementation of the European Child Guarantee and further supportive measures. Within the proposed European Social Fund Plus 60 all Member States will need to earmark an appropriate amount to tackle child poverty or social exclusion. For Member States, in which a rate of children at risk of poverty or social exclusion is above the Union average, this amount is to be at least 5% of their national European Social Fund Plus allocation. The European Regional Development Fund and InvestEU will equally support investments in enabling infrastructure, such as social housing and early childhood education and care facilities, as well as equipment and access to quality and mainstream services.
