        "7 PREFACE In many countries around the world, migration has become a defining issue of the current age. In 2017, there were an estimated 258 million people living in a country other than that of their birth. This is a significant increase on the figure from the turn of the century, which was estimated at 173 million. Most migrants move to take up employment opportunities or to be reunited with their families. Others flee from wars and natural disasters or move for a combination of reasons. Migration has happened throughout much of history and although the number of migrants around the world has recently risen, this is in line with general population growth. Since the 1960s, the proportion of the world\u2019s population that has moved from one country to another has remained relatively stable, at around 3 percent. In 2017, 3.4 percent of the world\u2019s population lived in a country other than that of their birth. Migration has been at the top of the EU political agenda and figures among the 10 political priorities of the European Commission for the period 2015 to 2019. The European Agenda on Migration has guided the EU\u2019s response to the immediate challenges linked to the 2015 migration crisis. It now focuses on the medium to long term solutions to equip Europe with future-proof means of managing migration responsibly and fairly, in the areas of irregular migration, borders, asylum and legal migration. With Europe in demographic decline and Africa\u2019s population still increasing, the EU will most probably remain a destination which people continue to move to. However, political debates about migration appear to be increasingly polarised with emotions often prevailing over facts and evidence. People frequently have misconceptions about the details of how and why migration happens. One survey from 2017 found that most people in Europe tended to overestimate the proportion of immigrants in their countries 1 and that only 4 percent of respondents felt that they were \u2018very well informed\u2019 about migration. Over-simplified perspectives do not help to understand a complex, multi-faceted phenomenon like migration, and certainly tell little about the reality of migration around the world. Migration is highly varied and presents a range of challenges and benefits, not only for migrants themselves but also for the communities and the countries which they have left and the ones that they have moved to. Many migration flows have become mixed, with the distinction between countries of origin, transit and destination more blurred. Informing political decision making and the general public on complex topics with better data is at the heart of the Joint Research Centre\u2019s new role in translating scientific input into impactful information. To grasp the complexities in migration requires an understanding of processes spanning across a broad range of themes and issues. With this in mind, the European Commission\u2019s Knowledge Centre on Migration and Demography set out to prepare this Atlas of Migration. The Atlas is intended to be used as a reference book for a variety of uses by migration policy makers, other relevant stakeholders, businesses, researchers and also the general public. It will be produced annually, both in paper and electronic forms. A set of online resources that will accompany the book will allow for interactive exploration of its data and will be made available starting in early 2019. The 2018 Atlas contains information which has been updated to the end of 2017. 2 It draws mostly on Eurostat data for the profiles of the 28 EU Member States in Section One and on a large number of public data sources for 44 non-EU country migration profiles in Section Two. These statistics from multiple sources are condensed in country-focused overviews to show patterns and trends within and between places and over time. The Atlas includes data and indicators on demography, migrant stocks and flows, legal migration, asylum, irregular migration and naturalisation. For non- EU countries this is complemented by sections on development and humanitarian aid, remittances and socioeconomic characteristics, while for EU Member States by a section on migrant integration. As it stands, this first edition of the Atlas highlights what can be seen with the data which is available today. Data on migration is often specific to individual countries and contexts. This means it can be difficult to compare countries or build a comprehensive view of the situation in different parts of the world. The Atlas uses software to collect and process publicly available data from original sources, cleaning and harmonising it before storing it into a single large database. Its data visualisation approach is there for ease of reading and to facilitate a more rapid making sense of the data. Readers can explore the migration profiles of their countries of interest and use the Technical Notes to check the evidence for themselves and to access the original datasets for more detailed analysis. However, to assure comparability of the data, make it accessible to a larger public, and fit it into the space of two printed pages per country, some choices needed to be made PREFACE ",
        "8 ATLAS OF MIGRATION 2018 which resulted in not all relevant data being included. Whereas the annual publication of the Atlas shows a snapshot of the situation in each year, a unified data repository has also been developed which is more dynamic, continuously updated and shows extended datasets on certain themes. With better and broader global data, we hope to gradually build a more complete picture of migration around the world and illustrate it through the Atlas. The structure of the Atlas The Atlas is structured around three key sections, each with a distinct focus. The first presents data on a series of thematic areas across all 28 EU Member States. The second adopts a broader view by showcasing the most complete data available across 44 selected countries with migration connections with Europe, situating the EU within its global migratory context. The third and final section focuses on the issue of forced displacement in Africa, presenting details and trends on this particularly pressing question for Europe\u2019s neighbours. The topic to address in the third section will change each year. In addition, each section is accompanied by a How to Read guide to interpret the datasets and a Technical Note with more detailed information on sources, definitions and further details, including the date of last update for the datasets in the Atlas.

        "Migration has been changing and diversifying across the EU over recent decades. In 2017, 21.6 million citizens of non-EU countries (third country nationals) were residing in the EU\u2019s 28 Member States and 16.9 million citizens of a Member State had moved to another country within the EU. Historically, varied patterns of migration have existed across the Member States. Countries such as France or the UK were countries of immigration already in the second half of the Twentieth Century, whereas countries such as Spain, Italy and Greece became countries of immigration 20 to 25 years later. Nordic countries such as Denmark, Finland and Sweden have long traditions of providing refugee protection. 1 Other EU Member States which have seen high rates of emigration in the past such as Poland have now become new destinations as people who previously left return and new migrants arrive from elsewhere. 2 Today migration has increasingly come to be seen as a shared concern for the EU and its Member States to address together. Ongoing initiatives have enabled steps to be made towards closer cooperation. For example, the Global Approach to Migration and Mobility 3 and the European Agenda on Migration 4 have sought to foster cooperation to manage migration flows. The Commission\u2019s Action Plan on the Integration of Third Country Nationals 5 defines the successful integration of third country nationals as a matter of common interest to all Member States. But the scale, origin and composition of migration flows to Member States continues to vary widely from one place to another. Third country nationals\u2019 employment rates and levels of social inclusion are in general below the average of host-country citizens in most Member States 6 , but patterns are diverse from place to place. Asylum seekers and refugees are unevenly distributed and continue to undergo different processes of integration across the Union. This section of the Atlas gives a comprehensive overview of data in all EU Member States. The available data on migration to and within Member States can help to have a clearer view of differences and similarities across the EU. It includes information on migration flows and the size of migrant populations, on asylum applications and outcomes as well as on residence permits and Schengen Visas. It also includes a range of indicators on integration, from naturalisation to social inclusion and participation in education and employment. The views presented in this section are designed to address a range of questions regarding migration and integration in all EU Member States. What are the Member State\u2019s demographic characteristics? How many people have immigrated to the country and emigrated from it? How many persons filed for asylum there and what were the decisions on these applications? How many people from non-EU countries have which types of residence permit to reside in the Member State? How many applications for travel visas did the Member State receive? How many people from non-EU countries received an order to leave the Member State, and how many were returned to another country? How many nationals of non-EU countries acquired citizenship? What is the level of inclusion of migrants in the Member State society? Are there differences in educational attainment between different groups? What is the level of migrants\u2019 participation in the labour market? In conclusion, this section provides insights not only into the size and scale of migration across the Union, but also the types of migration and the living conditions of migrants in the individual Member States. Doing so provides a starting point for observing convergence or divergence in patterns of migration and offers a reference for potential future cooperation to be built on. The data in this section comes primarily from Eurostat. INTRODUCTION Notes (1) Anna Karlsd\u00f3ttir, Gustaf Norl\u00e9n, Linus Rispling and Linda Randall (eds). State of the Nordic Region 2018.

        "Population pyramid The chart shows the demographic composition of population in the MS. It indicates the number of people by age group, sex (males and females) and broad group of citizenship (shown from the outside to the inside of the pyramid), specifically \u2018Nationals\u2019 (citizens of the MS), \u2018EU Mobile\u2019 (citizens of the other 27 MSs) and \u2018Non-EU\u2019 citizens (which includes also \u2018Stateless\u2019 and \u2018Unknown\u2019). The original Eurostat data is organised in 5-year cohorts and has been aggregated to obtain 10-year cohorts. The data refers to the population on 1st January. Population The larger donut chart shows the number of people residing in the MS by broad group of citizenship. The groups are \u2018Nationals\u2019, \u2018EU Mobile\u2019, \u2018Non-EU\u2019 (which includes also \u2018Stateless\u2019 and \u2018Unknown\u2019). The total population of the country is in the centre. Yearly flows The two smaller charts show the scale of migration to and from the MS. The top chart shows the number of people who have immigrated to the MS over the last year. \u2018Within EU\u2019 immigration refers to people who are citizens of other EU MSs. \u2018Outside EU\u2019 immigration refers to non-EU citizens. The bottom chart shows the number of people who have emigrated from the MS over the last year, moving to another MS (\u2018within EU\u2019) or to a non-EU country (\u2018outside EU\u2019). The total numbers of immigrants and emigrants are in the centre of each respective chart. First time applications The chart on the left shows the number of people who have made a first application for asylum in the MS during a year. The data covers the last four years and is broken down by sex. First instance decisions The central chart shows the total decisions made by the MS on first applications for asylum during a year, over the last four years. First instance decisions by outcome The chart on the right shows the distribution of decisions on first asylum applications by outcome: \u2018Geneva\u2019 for \u2018Geneva convention status\u2019; \u2018Subsid.\u2019 for \u2018Subsidiary protection\u2019; \u2018Human.\u2019 for \u2018Humanitarian protection\u2019; and \u2018Reject.\u2019 for \u2018Rejected application\u2019. Each donut chart shows the percentage of Schengen visas issued and not issued per year. The number in the centre shows the total number of visas applied for during each year. The figure refers to the sum of uniform visas (including MEV and LTVs) and ATVs. For detailed description, see Technical Notes. Note that for Romania, Bulgaria & Croatia the data on LTV visas is missing. The bar charts show the number of people who have been \u2018Ordered to leave\u2019 the country and those who have been physically \u2018Returned\u2019 to a third country per year over the last four years. From this data, a \u2018Return rate\u2019 has been calculated as the ratio between the number of people physically returned to a third country and the people who received an order to leave. First residence permits The top chart shows the number of people who have received a particular residence permit for the first time during a year, for the last four years. The reasons for issued permits are \u2018Work\u2019, \u2018Family\u2019, \u2018Education\u2019 or \u2018Other\u2019 (which includes \u2018Refugee status\u2019 and \u2018Subsidiary protection\u2019). Total permits (stock) The bottom chart shows the number of migrants residing in the MS with different types of residence permits and with permits that are valid for at least five years (long term residence permits). This signals the total number of permits held by people in the country at the end of the reference year (the migrant stock). HOW TO READ THIS SECTION This section covers each of the 28 EU Member States (MS). The charts are organised in thematic parts. More detailed information is available in the Technical Notes at the end of this section. The data refers to 2017. If the data for 2017 is not available from the original source, the corresponding field is either missing or indicated as \u2018N/A\u2019. Whenever 2017 data is not available for an entire thematic part, the latest available values are provided. Note that in some cases, because of rounding, the sum of percentages provided might not add up to 100. 12 DEMOGRAPHY (at 1st January 2017) ASYLUM (1st Instance) RESIDENCE PERMITS IRREGULAR MIGRATION OVERVIEW (at 1st January 2017) SCHENGEN VISAS ATLAS OF MIGRATION 2018 ",
        "The charts present employment and unemployment related indicators by broad group of citizenship (\u2018Nationals\u2019, \u2018EU Mobile\u2019 and \u2018Non-EU\u2019), age group and sex. This can signal similarities and differences in integration of these subgroups in the labour market. Employment rate shows the share of the total working-age population which is employed. The data is broken down by age groups. Unemployment rate indicates the percentage of unemployed people in the labour force. It is calculated as the ratio between the unemployed population and the sum of employed and unemployed population within the same age group. Long term unemployment rate refers to people who have been unemployed for more than one year. It is calculated as the proportion of the total unemployed population within each age group which has been unemployed for more than one year. Employment rate by educational attainment shows employment rates by level of educational attainment, sex and broad group of citizenship. The three charts show differences in educational attainment and participation in education by broad group of citizenship: Nationals, EU Mobile and Non-EU. Population by educational attainment (25-64) refers to the education level of people aged between 25 and 64. \u2018LOW\u2019 refers to Less than primary, primary and lower secondary education; \u2018MEDIUM\u2019 refers to Upper secondary and post-secondary, non-tertiary, education, and \u2018HIGH\u2019 refers to Tertiary education. NEET (18-24) shows the proportion of people aged between 18 and 24 who are \u2018Neither Employed nor in Education or Training\u2019 in the four weeks preceding the survey. Early school leavers (18-24) shows the proportion of the population aged between 18 and 24 which has completed no more than lower secondary education and is not involved in further education or training. The three charts refer to different aspects of social inclusion of migrants in the MS during the year. Together, they highlight differences in the relative wealth and living standards of residents by broad group of citizenship: Nationals, EU Mobile and Non-EU. Median equivalised net income (18+) shows differences in income levels for adults by broad group of citizenship. The values are in Euro. Overcrowding rate (18+) shows the percentage of adults by broad group of citizenship who live in a household defined as \u2018overcrowded\u2019 (for a more complete definition see the Technical Notes). At risk of poverty or social exclusion (18+) shows the percentage of the adults by broad group of citizenship who are either at risk of poverty, face serious material deprivation or live in a household defined as having a \u2018very low work intensity\u2019 (for a more complete definition see the Technical Notes). At risk of poverty rate for children indicates the number of people under 18 (Nationals vs Non-Nationals) who are defined as being \u2018at risk of poverty\u2019 (for a more complete definition see the Technical Notes). Number of foreign nationals who have acquired citizenship Each of the pie charts, together with the relative number, shows how many people from other countries have acquired the citizenship of the MS per year. The data is broken down into (a) people whose previous citizenship was from another MS (\u2018EU\u2019) and (b) people whose previous citizenship was from a \u2018Non-EU\u2019 country (including both \u2018Stateless\u2019 and Unknown\u2019). Share of foreign nationals who have acquired citizenship The bar charts show the acquisition of citizenship over the last four years by people who have moved to the MS. The first bar (\u2018EU\u2019) shows the proportion of all nationals from other EU MSs residing in this country who having acquired its citizenship during the calendar year. The second bar (\u2018Non-EU\u2019) shows the proportion of all citizens from non-EU countries residing in the country (including Stateless and Unknown) who have acquired its citizenship during the year. 13 NATURALISATION SOCIAL INCLUSION LABOUR MARKET EDUCATION MIGRATION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ",

        "77 MIGRATION IN 44 SELECTED NON-EU COUNTRIES For much of history, European countries were a source of emigrant populations which moved to other parts of the world. Over the last three decades, however, the EU has become a destination on a multitude of global migration routes. Amsterdam, London, Milan and others have become global cities with highly diverse populations of residents from around the world. Each year around half a million people from non-EU countries are granted permits enabling them to move to a Member State to study. And among those making the boat journey across the Mediterranean Sea to Greece, Italy and Spain in recent years there have been people from North, West and East Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Migration bridges countries and regions around the world that have become increasingly interconnected as globalisation has expanded. Developments in international politics which have come in response to this interconnectedness include the UN\u2019s New York Declaration on Refugees and Migrants 1 and the Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration 2 and the forthcoming Global Compact on Refugees. 3 This section of the Atlas situates the EU within its global migratory context. It provides a uniform and comparable snapshot of the various national settings from which different forms of migration to the EU derive by bringing together only the datasets on migration and contextual factors which consistently and reliably cover all of the selected countries. In this section, 44 countries from Africa, Asia and the Middle East, as well as the EU\u2019s closer neighbourhood in eastern and south-east Europe are examined. These are all countries which are linked with the EU through different migration patterns and dynamics. As the following pages will show, patterns and trends of migration between the EU and these 44 countries are highly varied. The country with the largest population of emigrants residing in the EU was Turkey, with 2.7 million nationals in the EU\u2019s 28 Member States. This is followed by 2.5 million people from Morocco. But, as well as being countries of origin for migrants to the EU, many of the countries presented in this section are also themselves places of destination for migrants from other countries. For example, in 2017, around 400 000 people from Nigeria were residing in the EU. But at the same time it was estimated that 1.2 million people were living in Nigeria who had themselves originated in other countries. The views in this section are designed to address the following questions: what are the demographic characteristics of these countries? How many people have emigrated from or immigrated to them? How many people from a given country are refugees or internally displaced? How many people filed for asylum in the EU and what were the decisions on their applications? How many residence permits were issued by EU Member States to people from these countries, and of which types? How many people from these countries were found to be illegally present in the EU and how many of them were returned? How many nationals of these countries acquired EU citizenship? What is the estimated scale of remittances to these countries and how much development assistance and humanitarian aid was sent there from the EU? How do these third countries stand with respect to widely accepted indicators of social, economic and political risk and development? Are migration trends likely to continue in the future? This Atlas is unable to provide a detailed prediction of upcoming trends, but does provide a starting point for reflecting on the factors which may shape migration in the future. This includes indicators that reflect the political, economic, social and environmental context in each country. Together, they build a picture of possible contextual drivers of migration, providing a starting point from which to consider more complete analyses of the situation in different places. As a result, this section of the Atlas aligns with the KCMD Migration Profiles 4 , together providing easily accessible and data- rich insights into the migratory contexts of countries, regions and migration corridors around the world. The data in this section come from a host of different sources including UNDESA, UNHCR, IDMC, Eurostat, World Bank, OECD, UNOCHA, IEP, and INFORM.

The chart shows the demographic composition of the population in the country. It indicates the number of people by age group and sex (males and females). The data for the pyramid refers to 2015, as this is the most recent data available from the source with the required detail. Data estimates of the age are available every 5 years and the original data has been aggregated into 10-year cohorts. As a result, the latest available data may not refer to the publication year of the Atlas. Emigrants The chart on the left shows the number of nationals of this country who reside in an EU MS (\u2018within EU\u2019) or in country other than that of their birth outside of the EU (\u2018outside EU\u2019). Refugees The chart shows the number of refugees and people in refugee-like situations from this country who reside in an EU MS (\u2018within EU\u2019) or another country other than that of their birth outside of the EU (\u2018outside EU\u2019). IDPs The box shows the number of people who are internally displaced within the country due to conflict (IDPs). Data on the stock of people displaced by natural disasters is not readily available or comparable. Migration The chart shows how many people have immigrated to the country and how many from the country have emigrated to the EU (\u2018EU\u2019) or to the rest of the world (\u2018other\u2019). First time applications The top chart shows the number of people who have made a first application for asylum in an EU MS per year. The data covers the last four years and is broken down by sex. First instance decisions by outcome The bottom chart shows the decisions made by EU MS on asylum applications by nationals of this country. Outcomes are one of the following: \u2018Geneva\u2019 for \u2018Geneva convention status\u2019; \u2018Subsid.\u2019 for \u2018Subsidiary protection\u2019; \u2018Human.\u2019 for \u2018Humanitarian protection\u2019; and \u2018Reject.\u2019 for \u2018Rejected application\u2019. The total number of decisions from each year is on the right of the chart. First residence permits The top chart shows the number of people from this country who have received a first residence permit in an EU MS each year, during the last four years. The reasons for each permit are \u2018Work\u2019, \u2018Family\u2019, \u2018Education\u2019 or \u2018Other\u2019 (which includes \u2018Refugee status\u2019 and \u2018Subsidiary protection\u2019). Total permits (stock) The bottom chart shows the number of migrants from this country residing in the EU and the different types of residence permits that they hold. It also shows the number of people with permits that are valid for at least five years (long term residence permits). This signals the total number of permits held by people in the country during the year (the migrant stock). Found to be illegally present The chart shows the number of detections of people from this country who have been determined by EU MS authorities to be \u2018illegally present\u2019 under their national laws relating to immigration. Note that the definition of \u2018illegal\u2019 may vary across MS and only people who are apprehended or otherwise come to the attention of immigration authorities are counted. People who are \u2018illegally present\u2019 might have entered the country legally. Return rate, returned, ordered to leave The bar chart shows the number of people who have been \u2018Ordered to leave\u2019 the country and those who have been physically \u2018Returned\u2019 to a third country per year over the last four years. From this data a \u2018Return rate\u2019 has been calculated. This is the ratio between the number of people physically returned to a third country and the people who received an order to leave. HOW TO READ THIS SECTION This section covers 44 non-EU countries*. The charts are organised in thematic parts. More detailed information is available in the Technical Notes at the end of this section The data refers to 2017. If the data for 2017 is not available from the original source, the corresponding field is either missing or indicated as \u2018N/A\u2019. Whenever 2017 data is not available for an entire thematic part, the latest available values are provided. Note that in some cases, because of rounding, the sum of percentages provided might not add up to 100. * The boundaries and the names shown on the maps do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the European Union.

        "79 DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS NATURALISATION IN EU REMITTANCES INFORM RISK INDEXES FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE MIGRATION IN 44 SELECTED NON-EU COUNTRIES The charts show a range of indicators from the INFORM Risk Index on humanitarian crises and disasters. This collates multiple data sources to give a single score ranging from 0 (lower risk) to 10 (higher risk). It describes the context in the country, giving an overview of factors which may have an influence on dynamics of internal and international migration in the country. The indicators are defined in the Technical Notes. Eight indicators in this part give an overview of the political, social, economic and environmental context in the selected country. They provide a first view of factors relating to the country\u2019s development which may have an influence on the drivers and dynamics of internal and international migration there. The number at the top shows the latest available data for this country and the year it comes from. The lines show the trend over time for each indicator from 2000 to 2015. Global Peace Index shows the relative peacefulness of states and territories around the world according to multiple variables (for more information see Technical Notes). The values range from 1.11 (most peaceful) to 3.81 (least peaceful). Political stability shows a score of how people in a country perceive the potential for political instability, violence or terrorism there, between 0 (least stable) and 100 (most stable). Human Development Index shows the score of a country according to its socio-economic development (health, education and general standard of living) ranging from 0 (lowest development) to 1 (highest development). Under 5 mortality rate shows an estimate of how many of the children born in this year are likely to die before reaching five years old. GDP per capita (PPP) is an indicator of economic standing, showing a country\u2019s economic output (in USD) per member of its population. Below internat. poverty line shows the proportion of the country\u2019s population which lives on less than USD 1.90 per day. Urban pop. shows the proportion of the country\u2019s population which resides in urban areas. Agriculture land use shows how much of the land in this country is used for agricultural production. Inflows The chart gives an indication of economic ties between emigrants and communities in the country of origin. It shows the amount of money that is sent to the country (inflows) through personal transfers from the EU (\u2018from EU\u2019) and from the rest of the world (\u2018other\u2019). ODA and Humanitarian aid The bars show the scale of economic transfers to the country to address humanitarian needs and support development. The chart includes data on humanitarian aid and official development assistance (ODA) sent to the country from EU institutions during the reference year. The amounts cover all sectors and include only paid contributions. Number of nationals who have acquired citizenship in EU The bar chart shows the acquisition of citizenship over each of the last four years by people who are nationals of this country and have moved to an EU MS. This part shows a series of key international agreements and bilateral agreements with the EU, showing whether the country is an accession country, has ratified them or is a signatory of them. This gives an overview of international and bilateral frameworks governing different forms of migration in the country. For a definition of each agreement see the Technical Notes. ",

        "177 FORCED DISPLACEMENT: AFRICA FOCUS According to UNHCR, the number of people around the world who have been forcibly displaced has risen over the past decade from 42.7 million in 2007, to 68.5 million in 2017. 1 Forced displacement refers to people who have moved within countries (internally displaced people) or across international borders (refugees) due to conflict, the threat of persecution or natural disasters. This section of the Atlas focuses on the context in Africa, where forced displacement has represented a persistent challenge and looks set to continue to do so into the future. Nearly one third of the global total of forcibly displaced people lives on the African continent, where there were 6.7 million refugees and 14 million people internally displaced due to conflict in 2017. Forced displacement in Africa has also recently been at the top of policy agendas in Europe and elsewhere. 2 Images of people on treacherous journeys across the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa to Europe have been a common sight on news reports. In response, the European Union has intensified its dialogue with African partners through partnerships and regional fora, such as the Rabat and Khartoum processes. Among other things, these include the objectives of providing humanitarian assistance and durable solutions for refugees in Africa. However, the arrival of African refugees at the shores of Europe is just one part of a broad and varied range of displacement dynamics that occur across the African continent. Different regions and countries have their own histories and experiences of displacement. In some places, people have lived in protracted situations of displacement that extend over lengthy periods of time such as in Dadaab in Kenya, where refugee camps have existed for over 25 years. 3 In other places, however, the need to move in search of protection can arise suddenly. In just 2017, for example, over two million people were newly displaced by conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 4 The reasons for moving also vary from one place to another. Although conflict has been associated with the majority of forced displacement over recent years, natural disasters including drought, flooding and tropical storms have also been important factors. In the majority of cases, people who undergo displacement tend to remain near to their place of origin. However, if they cannot find safety and a future there, then it is more likely that they will seek to move further afield. This could involve taking part in resettlement programmes or seeking to find their own way through onward migration to other places. The diversity of dynamics of forced displacement in Africa means that it cannot always be quickly and easily summarised in short and simple messages. With this in mind, our intention here is to present not only a broad overview of some of the main patterns but also insights into the varied processes across the continent. Definitions: Internally displaced persons (IDPs): Persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalised violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognised state border. 5 Refugees: A refugee is someone who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. 6 Regions: For grouping countries by region in Africa this section follows the regions used by the African Union (AU). Data and data sources: The available data on forced displacement is often varied and it is difficult to assess its accuracy. Multiple actors are involved in collecting it, using their own definitions and methodologies 7 . This is compounded by the difficulty of counting mobile populations and obtaining accurate data on people who return after displacement or are displaced multiple times. Here data is provided by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) and UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 8 These are widely accepted figures and are the most consistent of available sources for comparing across countries. For information on granting of refugee status and subsidiary protection in the EU, data is taken form Eurostat. 9 For population data the source is the World Bank. 10 INTRODUCTION ",

However, the maps recording the total number of IDPs residing in each country show considerable variation from one place to another. Three countries stand out in particular as consistently having the largest populations of IDPs: Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sudan and South Sudan. The country with the largest population of IDPs in Africa in 2017 was the DRC, where over four million people had been forcibly displaced. This figure was double that of 2016, indicating a rapidly deteriorating situation. In South Sudan and the Central African Republic 15 percent of the population were internally displaced in 2017. 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Displacement type IDPs Refugees DRC* 4 480K Sudan South Sudan 2 072K 1 899K Nigeria 1 707K Ethiopia 1 078K Somalia 825K CAR** 689K Cameroon 239K Libya 197K Kenya 159K FIGURE 5.

        "181 FORCED DISPLACEMENT: AFRICA FOCUS The charts below offer more detail on the different trajectories of internal displacement in African countries. Over the past five years, East Africa has consistently had a larger IDP population than the North, West, Central or Southern parts of the continent. The displaced population in South Sudan grew suddenly in 2014. In neighbouring Sudan the population of IDPs was consistently large until a slight decline in 2017. In Ethiopia and Somalia the IDP population remained relatively stable. There have also been significant increases in internal displacement in Central Africa, especially prior to 2013 and following 2015. This is above all accounted for by the massive levels of displacement in the DRC where conflict over the past two decades has affected millions. Despite an initial decline in the DRC\u2019s displaced population in 2014 and 2015, increases have again been recorded in more recent years alongside reports of intensified political violence. 11 Displacement has been less prevalent in West Africa. Of note here has been the large-scale displacement in Nigeria since 2013, a time of more frequent attacks by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram. 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 0M 2M 4M 6M 8M 1.93M 0.02M 0.01M 2.34M 5.73M 0.41M 7.45M 6.06M 0.15M 0.28M AU Regions North Africa East Africa West Africa Central Africa South Africa FIGURE 8.

        "182 ATLAS OF MIGRATION 2018 The data below refers to new cases of displacement per year. 12 This draws attention to yearly fluctuations occurring in response to contextual changes driving people to move. Sometimes, already displaced people will be counted again as they undergo a new case of displacement to escape situations of continued or renewed instability. There were 5.5 million new displacements in Africa in 2017, two thirds of which were caused by conflict. Nearly all of these took place in Central and East Africa, whereas levels of displacement in North and Southern Africa were relatively low. Displacement dynamics have varied across the continent, often changing rapidly in different times and places. The DRC recorded a dramatic increase in new cases of displacement in 2017 (2.2 million people). This was more than double the number of people who were displaced during 2016 and three and a half times more than in 2015. The situation in South Sudan shows similar variation, where the outbreak of violent conflict in 2013 was followed by the displacement of 1.3 million people in 2014. In 2017, 857 000 new displacements were recorded as the conflict spread to new parts of the country. But not all countries recorded increases in displacement. Annual cases of displacement in Nigeria decreased from nearly one million people in 2014 to 279 000 in 2017, for example.

        "183 FORCED DISPLACEMENT: AFRICA FOCUS One third of the cases of displacement in Africa in 2017 were due to disasters rather than conflicts. Disasters are usually sudden changes in the natural environment such as storms, floods, drought, earthquakes, fires, landslides and volcanic eruptions. In 2017, 2.6 million new displacements were caused by such disasters. Displacement due to disasters is often quite distinct from displacement due to conflict. Disasters are often short-lived, resulting in short term displacement followed soon by moving back. Displacement due to conflict, on the other hand, is more likely to extend over longer periods of time. Drought accounted for half of the displacements due to disasters in Africa during 2017 (this was the first year in which it was recorded in data on disaster displacement). In Somalia in particular, failed rains over recent years have led to hundreds of thousands of people facing hardship and having to move to new places. 13 Flooding has consistently affected a high number of people across the continent. In 2016 and 2017, floods caused tens of thousands to have to leave their homes in Niger, especially in the regions of Agadez, Maradi and Tahoua. Storms also caused the displacement of over 400 000 people, principally due to tropical cyclones in Mozambique and Madagascar. 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 0M 2M 4M 6M 8M 3.7M 4.9M 2.4M 2.8M 5.5M 0.7M 1.1M 1.1M 1.6M 2.6M Displacement reason Conflict Disaster FIGURE 13.

        "184 ATLAS OF MIGRATION 2018 The blue maps below show the countries of origin of refugees from Africa. The largest refugee populations from Africa have come from Somalia and South Sudan. Relatively few refugees have originated in North, West or Southern Africa. As with the data on IDPs, some refugee situations have been volatile and changed significantly. For example, the number of refugees from South Sudan in 2017 was almost 30 times higher than the figure from 2012, recorded before the outbreak of conflict in the country. Other refugee situations are more stable. The number of refugees from Somalia, for example, did not rise or fall significantly between 2012 and 2017. According to UNHCR at the end of 2017 approximately two thirds of all refugees were living in so-called \u2018protracted\u2019 refugee situations in which they had been displaced for over five years and were without prospects for a durable solution. 14 REFUGEES IN AFRICA BY ORIGIN AND DESTINATION 1 2,500,000 1 2,500,000 1 2,500,000 1 2,500,000 1 2,500,000 1 2,500,000 FIGURE 17.

        "185 FORCED DISPLACEMENT: AFRICA FOCUS The pink maps below show the total number of refugees residing in African countries. According to this data, the number of refugees from Central and Eastern Africa has risen constantly from 2013 to 2017. From 2016 to 2017 there was an increase of 30 percent of refugees from East Africa, but in the same time a small decrease of refugees from West Africa. Over the past six years Ethiopia, Uganda, Chad, Kenya and Sudan have been the countries hosting the largest refugee populations. In Chad, the refugee population was equal to three percent of the country\u2019s total population throughout this period. In 2017 Uganda was the country hosting the highest number of refugees, with more than 1.3 million residing there, almost seven times more than in 2012. Some countries, such as Ethiopia and Kenya, have consistently hosted large numbers of refugees. Others have seen sudden changes in the refugee population that they host, such as Sudan where the number of refugees more than doubled from 2016 to 2017 due to the rapid increase of refugees from South Sudan. Often, countries from which refugees are fleeing are places where others seek refuge. For example, in 2017 nearly 900 000 refugees resided in Sudan while over 700 000 Sudanese refugees were in other countries. Generally, most refugees remain near to their country of origin. The high number of refugees from Central Africa residing in East Africa can be explained by the proximity of East Africa to the DRC. 1 1,400,000 Value %population \u2264 1.0% 1.5% 2.0% 2.5% 3.0% 3.5% 1 1,400,000 Value %population \u2264 1.0% 1.5% 2.0% 2.5% 3.0% 3.5% 1 1,400,000 Value %population \u2264 1.0% 1.5% 2.0% 2.5% 3.0% 3.5% %population \u2264 1.0% 1.5% 2.0% 2.5% 3.0% 3.5% 1 1,400,000 Value 1 1,400,000 Value %population \u2264 1.0% 1.5% 2.0% 2.5% 3.0% 3.5% 1 1,400,000 Value %population \u2264 1.0% 1.5% 2.0% 2.5% 3.0% 3.5% FIGURE 20.

In the past five years, the five countries of destination of the highest number of African refugees were Yemen, Italy, France, United Kingdom and United States. It should be noted that in 2017 Yemen hosted nearly 264 000 African refugees whilst facing what has been described as the world\u2019s most severe humanitarian crisis. 15 The number of refugees from African countries who reside in Europe has increased over the past decade from 309 000 in 2009 to 535 000 in 2017.

The number of African refugees residing in North America decreased every year from 2009 to 2016, before increasing slightly by five percent in 2017. In Asia and the Middle East the number of refugees from African countries grew rapidly by between 12 to 19 percent each year from 2009 to 2012. However, this has recently slowed to an increase of one to two percent per year between 2013 and 2016. Worsening conditions in Yemen, which hosts the largest African refugee population in Asia and the Middle East, may have contributed to this decline. In relative terms Uganda remains the country hosting the highest number of African refugees. In Uganda in 2017 there were 32 refugees from African countries per 1 000 people. In Chad there were 28 and in South Sudan 23. In the EU the figure was considerably lower, where the countries hosting the highest number of African refugees per 1 000 of the national population in 2017 were Malta (13), Sweden (6) Italy (2) and the Netherlands (2). The largest nationality group was that of Eritrean refugees, followed by refugees from Somalia.

        "188 ATLAS OF MIGRATION 2018 These pages illustrate the distribution of refugees from African countries who reside within the EU. There is wide variation in the total number of refugees from African countries residing in different EU Member States. Italy is the country hosting the highest number (101 000 people), followed by Germany (93 000) and France (83 000). Moreover, when seen as a proportion of the host country\u2019s total population there is less variation. Only two countries (Sweden and Malta) host more than two refugees from an African country per 1 000 of the total population. Malta is a somewhat anomalous case, with 13 African refugees per 1 000 of the total population. The majority of the refugees from African countries who reside in the EU are from East Africa (269 000 people). Nevertheless, they represent only five percent of the East African refugees around the world. Similarly, only a small proportion of refugees from Central African countries reside in the EU (two percent of the global total). In contrast, a much higher proportion (21 percent) of all refugees from West African countries currently reside in EU Member States.

The number of refugees in the EU from Asian and Middle Eastern countries of origin has increased much more rapidly than the number from Africa, tripling over the past five years. This can be attributed to a large degree to the arrival of refugees from Syria. Once within the EU, there are variations in the forms of international protection that people are granted. Of the applications that receive a positive outcome, the majority tend to be granted refugee status and between half and one third of applicants each year are granted subsidiary protection, which is a shorter term residence permit.
