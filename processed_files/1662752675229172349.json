The income level is usually considered as one of the main factors in determining an individual standard of living. Social transfers have an important redistributive effect that helps to reduce the number of people who are at risk of poverty. Its impact is more marked in the case of older people. Developments: The at-risk-of-poverty rate in the EU-25 did not change significantly between 1998 and 2001. Following a change in data source after 2001, it stood at 16 % in 2005 (the first year with fully harmonised data for all EU Member States). From a gender perspective, the rate is generally higher among women than among men.

But many older workers withdraw from the labour force at a relatively young age. This indicator is intended to monitor progress towards the objective that at least half of the EU population in the 55-64 age group should be in employment by 2010. Developments: As at 2006, the total employment rate stood at 64.3 % in the EU-27. However, these figures mask discrepancies between the employment rates for different age groups. Only 43.5 % of the EU-27 population aged between 55 and 64 years were in employment, compared with 78 % for the 25-54 group. Raising the employment rate of older workers to 50 % represents a challenge for the coming years, even though recent changes are encouraging, with an increase of 6.6 percentage points between 2000 and 2006 in the EU-27, compared with 0.7 percentage points between 1997 and 2000.

It provides an objective, statistical picture of progress, based on the EU set of sustainable deve- lopment indicators. The report provides a relative assessment of whether Europe is moving in the right direction, and with sufficient haste, given the objectives and targets defined in the strategy. c o m p a c t g u i d e Sustainable development indicators Public health Strategy objective: To promote good public health on equal conditions and improve protection against health threats Healthy life years Life expectancy 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Females Healthy life years Life expectancy 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Males Indicator relevance: The indicator reflects an emphasis that has shifted from measuring health simply in terms of longevity to one that also considers well- being. An improvement in healthy life-years is considered as one of the main health goals for the EU. Developments: As a result of the faster growth in male life expectancy, the gap of 6.5 years between females and males in 1995 has closed slightly to reach 5.8 years in 2003. Healthy life-years at birth are growing faster than life expectancy, for both males and females. Healthy life- years grew at 0.8 % per year on average for females, compared with 0.5 % for males over the period 1999 to 2003. The overall result is longer lives, with more healthy years. In 2003, newborn girls could be expected to live 66 years free of disability and boys 64\u00bd years.

Developments: During the period 2000-2005, the EU-15 official development assistance increased from 0.32 % to 0.44 % of gross national income, although it stagnated in 2006. Overall this corresponded to an average annual growth of more than 15 % of disbursed amounts in absolute value. This positive trend should be contrasted with a decrease from 0.44 % to 0.32 % between 1990 and 2000. Despite the lack of increase in the latest year, the EU exceeded its 2006 collective objective of 0.39 % of GNI.

        "Monitoring Sustainable Development in the European Union Sustainable development is a fundamental and overarching objective of the European Union, enshrined in the Treaty. It can be defined simply as the pursuit of a better quality of life for everyone, for present and future generations. It is a vision of progress that links economic development, protection of the environment and social justice, and therefore concerns all citizens of the EU, and indeed of the whole world. The Union\u2019s commitment to sustainable development at the first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 led in due course to an EU- wide sustainable development strategy, which was adopted by the European Council in Gothenburg in June 2001, and renewed in June 2006. The renewed strategy sets out a single, coherent approach on how the EU will more effectively live up to its long- standing commitment to meet the challenges of sustainable development. The key challenges are: \u2022 climate change and clean energy \u2022 sustainable transport \u2022 sustainable consumption and production \u2022 conservation and management of natural resources \u2022 public health \u2022 social inclusion, demography and migration \u2022 global poverty and sustainable development challenges Measuring progress towards sustainable development is an integral part of the renewed strategy. For this purpose, a set of sustainable development indicators has been developed by the European Commission, in cooperation with Member States, through the Eurostat Working Group on Sustainable Development Indicators. The strategy foresees that Eurostat will produce a monitoring report based on this indicator set every two years. This leaflet presents the \u201cheadline\u201d sustainable development indicators, aimed at monitoring the overall objectives of the strategy. They are well-known indicators with a high communication value, robust and available for most EU Member States for a period of at least five years. More indicators, including methodological information, are available on Eurostat\u2019s Sustainable Development Indicators website: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/sustainabledevelopment Socio-economic development Strategy objective: To promote a prosperous, innovative, knowledge-rich, competitive and eco-efficient economy, which provides high living standards and full and high-quality employment throughout the European Union EU-27 EU-15 01234 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Indicator relevance: The growth rate of GDP (per inhabitant) is a measure of the dynamism of the economy and its capacity to create new jobs. A sufficiently high GDP growth rate means that society is generating additional economic resources to meet the (growing) economic needs of the present generation, to invest in view of higher returns in the future, or to address social and environmental concerns. Developments: In general, the EU's economic performance was relatively modest between 2000 and 2006, despite some upturns, in particular a 2.8 % growth in 2006, resulting in an average annual growth of 1.6 % in the EU-27 (1.3 % in the EU-15). These figures compare unfavourably with the sustained growth rates prevailing over the previous period, from 1996 to 2000 (2.9 and 2.8 %, for EU-27 and EU-15, respectively, on average). The relative upturns observed in 2004 and 2006 can be partly attributed to favourable cyclical developments, but there is also evidence that it is partly due to the impact of previous structural reforms.

The mid-term review of the Commission\u2019s 2001 transport White Paper also stresses that \u2018transport policy must contribute to achieving the objectives of European energy policy \u2026, in particular as regards security of supply and sustainability\u2019. Developments: Between 1995 and 1999, transport energy consumption grew at a somewhat higher rate than GDP. However, in the year 2000, growth in energy consumption reduced dramatically, whilst GDP growth remained strong. Since 2000, the growth in both has slowed down, but, even if the growth in the energy consumption of transport is weaker (1.3 % average annual increase between 2000 and 2005, compared to 1.7 % for GDP), it is insufficient to demonstrate decoupling.

Taken on its own, domestic material consumption (DMC) also provides an assessment of the absolute level of use of scarce resources. Developments: From 1990 to 2000, domestic material consumption remained relatively stable, while GDP increased, resulting in relative decoupling and an increase in resource productivity of 2.1 % per year on average. From 2000 to 2004, a slowing down of GDP growth was accompanied by a decrease in DMC, resulting in the absolute decoupling of resource use from economic growth over that period, and a further increase in resource productivity by 2.3 % per year on average. The decrease in DMC, by 0.8 % per year on average from 2000 to 2004, also represents progress towards the strategy\u2019s objective of reducing the overall use of non-renewable natural resources.

Developments: Between 1990 and 2000, EU-15 greenhouse gas emissions fell and were more or less in line with the target path. However, since 2000, the trend has reversed.

The EU has set a target for the use of renewables to 12 % in 2010.

Developments: The index of all common bird species fell steadily between 1990 and 2000, with an average annual decrease of 1.3 percentage points. This drop was even sharper for farmland birds. Between 2000 and 2005, the index has remained relatively stable.

The renewed common fisheries policy aims to maintain or restore stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield in fisheries and especially to achieve these goals for depleted stocks. Proportion of fish catches taken from stocks outside safe biological limits % Figures from 2007 onwards are forecasts from Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs. Other renewables, including solar, do not appear in the figure as they represents less than 1% of the total. The EU aggregate figure is an estimate based on 16 Member States from EU-25. Source: EBCC/RSPB/BirdLife/Statistics Netherlands. Developments: During the 1990s, the share of total renewables in EU-27 gross inland energy consumption grew at the average rate of 0.14 percentage points per year. Since then growth has been stronger (0.18 percentage points per year) but the share in 2005 (6.7%) is still substantially below the target path. Developments: In 2001 and 2003/2004 catches of some pelagic and industrial stocks exceeded safe biological limits, leading to the peaks in this indicator for those years.
