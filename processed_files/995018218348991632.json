        "Introduction Women\u2019s economic empowerment has long been a feature of EU policy, but the shift in priorities in the aftermath of the economic crisis has left the employment policy largely gen- der blind. Thus the Europe 2020 strategy includes a target of having 75 % of the working age population in employment by 2020 but does not distinguish between women and men. While the overall EU employment rate is getting closer to this target (72.2 % in 2017), this masks a significant disparity between the employment rates of women (66.5 %) and men (78 %). A gender perspective in employment policy acknowledges that women undertake a disproportionate share of unpaid care work, which limits their participation in the labour mar- ket and the quality of their employment. The European Pil- lar of Social Rights was introduced in 2017 to ensure equal opportunities for women and men in areas such as equal conditions of work, career progression and equal pay. Fol- lowing the principles of the Pillar, the 2019 Directive on work- life balance for parents and carers seeks to address the \u2018care penalty\u2019 and encourage men to take up more caregiving re- sponsibilities. The 2014 Pay Transparency Recommendation provided guidance to Member States on how to tackle pay inequalities through greater transparency, although its im- plementation remains limited. A new EU action plan (2017- 2019) on tackling the gender pay gap calls on Member States to apply effective equal pay legislation. However, the care penalty continues to be a major risk factor holding women back in the economy, alongside austerity and deregulation of working conditions. New challenges are also emerging in the context of advances in digitalisation, with women under-represented in key information and commu- nication technology (ICT) and science, technology, engineer- ing and mathematics (STEM) jobs. If these challenges are not addressed, they will have serious consequences for women\u2019s economic equality, independence and well-being, and for the overall growth of the economy.

        "European Institute for Gender Equality Beijing + 25: the fifth review of the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action in the EU Member States Care penalty generates inequality and limits economic growth Women continue to take disproportionate responsibility for un- paid care work, for children, spouses, partners, older relatives and persons with disabilities. In the EU, women report spend- ing an average of 39 hours per week caring for their children, compared with men\u2019s 21 hours. Many Member States have expanded parental leave for fathers but take-up remains very low. Flexible working arrangements, such as teleworking or flexitime, may help women to combine paid work and unpaid care work but, to date, have had little impact on men\u2019s contri- bution to caregiving. Joint taxation and means-testing of joint household income to access public benefits have been linked to greater gender inequality in care and paid work. Caregiving responsibilities are estimated to keep 7.7 million women out of the labour market, compared with just 450 000 men. For those who are in work, gender inequalities persist. The gender pay gap (women consistently earning less per hour than men) is closing very slowly across EU Member States (Figure 1). In part, this relates to women\u2019s over-representa- tion in lower paying occupations, such as education (72.5 %), human health and social work activities (78.6 %), and among service, sales and clerical support workers (over 60 %). By contrast, women are under-represented in certain STEM oc- cupations, which tend to have higher salaries. The above inequalities hamper economic growth. The cost of employment loss associated with women\u2019s care responsibili- ties has been estimated at about EUR 370 billion per year for the EU. Improving women\u2019s participation in the labour market could create up to 6 million additional jobs by 2050, with an increase in per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of up to 5.5 %. More well-paid jobs for women would also lower poverty and inequality, and increase the well-being of children. Women\u2019s jobs insecure as digitalisation advances To combine care responsibilities and work, women frequently choose jobs that are more likely to be temporary, part-time and/or precarious than men\u2019s (Figure 2). These not only pay less but provide weaker legal protection, are less likely to qualify for social security benefits, accumulate fewer pension rights and provide fewer opportunities for career progres- sion. In increasingly flexible and insecure labour markets, this remains a concern for gender equality over the life course. Figure 1.

This is linked to challenges in gaining access to finance, information, training and business networks. Such barriers limit women\u2019s entrepreneurial poten- tial for innovation and job creation in the EU. Austerity is likely to have exacerbated such gender inequali- ties through cuts in employment and wages in the public sec- tor (where women are over-represented), and deregulation of private-sector working conditions. Advances in digitalisation lead to many exciting new job op- portunities, but persistent differences in study choices by young women and men and the resulting gender divisions in the labour market mean that these benefits are not shared equally. Women are severely under-represented in certain STEM study fields that are likely to be in high demand in the future. Notably, they make up fewer than 20 % of ICT grad- uates in the EU, which means they could miss out on many of these jobs. As women are more likely than men to work in low-skilled clerical, services and sales positions, they are more likely to see their jobs disappear as a result of automation. The low proportion of women in some STEM occupations has important implications for economic growth. Address- ing women\u2019s under-representation in STEM occupations could create up to 1.2 million jobs and increase GDP by up to EUR 820 billion by 2050. Recommendations for action To address gender inequalities in the economy, Mem- ber States are recommended to ensure the availability of high-quality care services that are affordable for all levels of income and encompass both childcare and long-term care. Adopting individualised taxation to promote a more equal division of paid work and care within couples would be ben- eficial. Member States should also consider initiatives to en- courage men to take up caring responsibilities and to tackle gender stereotypes, such as parental leave earmarked for fa- thers, public awareness campaigns and education curricula. Part-time, flexible and other forms of non-standard employ- ment should be better paid and covered by social protection systems. Member States can, for example, increase the eligi- bility of such jobs for social security, ensure adequate min- imum wages, and provide financial incentives or top-ups to partners who both work part-time. Easy-to-use information systems would help workers to understand the long-term consequences of working part-time and, for non-standard contracts, the accumulation of social security and pension rights. Members States should also ensure education free of gender stereotypes, in which career counselling and aware- ness-raising initiatives promote greater participation of wom- en in STEM study fields.

To name just a few: women not only earn less, but as a result also receive lower pensions; various sectors and occupations continue to be heavily gender segregated; and women tend to be under-represented in economic decision-making positions. Inequalities are par- ticularly acute for certain groups of women, such as the less educated, older workers, migrant women, women from certain ethnic backgrounds, women with disabilities and lone mothers, who face additional economic disad- vantages. Further information on EU policy developments and trends in the area of women and the economy can be found in EIGE\u2019s Beijing + 25 report. Some other policy briefs based on this re- port also present challenges that are closely related to wom- en and the economy (such as Area A, Women and poverty, Area B, Education and training of women, and Area G, Wom- en in power and decision-making).
