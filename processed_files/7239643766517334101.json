        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 2 Abstract In this report, three methodological approaches are applied to assess the size of the International Monetary Fund: benchmarking Fund resources against a number of relevant global economic and financial indicators; an extrapolation of past and current IMF programme characteristics; and a shock scenario analysis. Overall, while the results of the different approaches depend on the assumptions and the timeframe considered, the quantitative analysis indicates that a prudent approach would call for maintaining Fund total resources at their current levels. Yet, the quantitative analysis of the size of the Fund made in this report should be seen only as one element to assess the adequacy of Fund resources. It does not take into account qualitative considerations, such as the increased resilience of the global economy and the efforts made to strengthen regulation and supervision since the financial crisis, which should complement the quantitative analysis to complete the analytical basis for decision makers. Moreover, the final decision on the appropriate size of Fund resources will need to include political judgement. Therefore, this report does not provide recommendations on the appropriate level of IMF resources after the expiration of borrowed resources.

        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 3 Non-technical summary This report assesses \u2013 from a quantitative point of view \u2013 the amount of resources that the Fund should have available to appropriately pursue its mandate as the key international financial institution. The global financial safety net (GFSN) has undergone a significant expansion both in the number of layers and the amount of resources available over the past decade, but the IMF remains the core global institution at its centre, responsible for maintaining stability at the global level, preventing crises and supporting member countries under balance of payments stress. Additional sources of liquidity support are available to a number of countries but not all. Three methodological approaches are applied to assess the size of the Fund: the traditional approach of benchmarking Fund resources against a number of relevant global economic and financial indicators; the analysis and extrapolation of past and current IMF programme characteristics; and a shock scenario analysis. Before describing the results, there are some aspects of the size of the Fund worth mentioning: (1) the 14th General Review of Quotas (GRQ) and the 2010 Reform represented a significant improvement of the Fund\u2019s own resources; (2) the 15th GRQ is under way; (3) going forward, the expiration of bilateral borrowing agreements (BBAs), in 2019-2020, and of the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), in 2022, may imply a strong reduction in the Fund\u2019s lending capacity; (4) the level of actual commitments of Fund resources in the past has always been below 50% of quota and NAB resources; and (5) neither the 2012 nor the 2016 BBAs have had to be activated yet. Our results show that the traditional-indicator analysis is not conclusive on the adequacy of Fund current resources, although it points to a sizable deterioration in the medium term. The Fund current resources appear sufficient in terms of GDP or capital-inflow metrics, but they look too low compared with other indicators such as external liabilities, which better represent the increasing size of global financial interconnections and the related risks of propagation. In the same vein, current programme characteristics would not signal the need for additional IMF resources at the present stage, but this situation may change going forward if the global economy moved from the present phase of cyclical upturn and benign financial backdrop to more stressed situations. Finally, the variety of hypotheses and assumptions used in the shock-scenario analysis leads to a wide range of results: they suggest that the IMF\u2019s current overall resources are sufficient to cover remaining financing gaps in most moderate sudden- stop scenarios in Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) or sovereign debt shock scenarios in Advanced Economies (AEs). However, Fund resources (including the currently inactivated borrowed resources) would just cover \u2013 or not even cover \u2013 the potential demand for financing in more severe scenarios. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that systemic crises in advanced economies, for example, could rapidly spill over into other regions, making the shock more severe and therefore potentially ",

All in all, the results of the different approaches applied in this report to assess the Fund\u2019s resources depend on the assumptions and the time frame considered. Having said that, the quantitative analysis indicates that a prudent approach would call for maintaining Fund total resources at their current levels. This conclusion is also relevant from another perspective, as a strong and well-funded IMF is a central piece of a strong and credible GFSN. Yet, the quantitative analysis of the size of the Fund made in this report should be seen only as one element to assess the adequacy of Fund resources. It does not take into account qualitative considerations. The report does not discuss either issues related to the composition of Fund resources between quota and different types of borrowed resources. ",
        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 5 1 Introduction This report assesses \u2013 from a quantitative point of view \u2013 the amount of resources that the Fund should have available to appropriately pursue its mandate as the key international financial institution. In section 2, we present a metric-based analysis, using traditional benchmark indicators. An approach based on current programme characteristics is applied in Section 3. Section 4 contains a brief description of the different layers of the GFSN other than Fund resources (i.e. reserves, swap lines and regional financing arrangements), information that is used in Section 5 in order to estimate the potential calls on IMF resources under adverse shock scenarios for both Advanced Economies (AEs) and Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). The analysis focuses on quantitative benchmarks and scenarios and does not enter into qualitative considerations, such as the resilience of the global economy and the efforts made to strengthen it since the financial crisis. The note does not discuss issues related to the composition of Fund resources. These aspects will need to be considered by policymakers in order to make well-informed decisions. As background information for the discussions and assessments in the note, Table 1 provides data on the Fund\u2019s size and financing capacity. In the metric-based analysis of Section 1, a broad definition of the Fund\u2019s resource envelope is used: the total amount of disbursed quotas and standing borrowed resources. In the shock-scenario analysis, a narrower definition of the Fund\u2019s financing capacity is used, i.e. uncommitted and potentially usable resources for non-concessional financing, computed as the sum of the Forward Commitment Capacity (FCC) and inactivated borrowed resources from NAB and bilateral borrowing agreements (BBAs), excluding the prudential balance. Traditionally the GFSN had consisted mainly of countries\u00b4 own foreign exchange reserves, with the IMF acting as a backstop (ECB, 2018). However, since the global financial crisis, the GFSN has expanded significantly with the continued accumulation of reserves as well as the sharp increase of swap lines between central banks, and the further development and creation of new Regional Financing Arrangements (RFAs). GFSN resources now comprise four broad categories each having its particular country coverage, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses: foreign exchange reserves, bilateral swap lines, the IMF and RFAs (Scheubel and Stracca, 2016 and ECB, 2016 and 2018). In 2011, the G20 agreed on a set of general principles to guide the relationship between the IMF and RFAs. Since then, the GFSN has continued to grow, becoming more multipolar. RFAs have expanded, reaching an aggregate size comparable to that of the IMF. The IMF, with its quasi universal membership and its large amount of resources available, continues to be at the centre of the GFSN. The G20 has taken a lead role in discussing and overseeing the GFSN. In 2017, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors mandated a group of experts (denominated Eminent Persons Group) to consider the optimal role of the international financial institutions (IFIs) including the IMF and recommend practical reforms to improve the ",

        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 7 2 The relative size of the IMF according to traditional measures This section presents a metric-based assessment of the size of the IMF based on the traditional approach of benchmarking Fund resources against a number of relevant global economic and financial indicators. Fund resources consist of quota, effectively members\u2019 capital subscriptions to the Fund, and borrowed resources. The (currently inactivated) borrowed resources are the NAB and the more recent BBAs; both are credit arrangements between the IMF and a group of member countries, the main difference being that the BBAs are only used after the NAB is exhausted. The indicators used to assess the size of these resources are GDP, international reserves, balance of payments (BoP) flows \u2013 financial inflows and current account payments \u2013 and gross external liabilities. In this paper, the analyses give a view of potential resource needs from a broad set of measures. 1 IMF staff usually calculates ratios of resources to global indicators using the agreed quota size in past quota reviews (those where quota increases were agreed), relative to each indicator\u2019s average for the review period. 2 Instead, in this report resources are measured on a yearly basis and compared to the historical average (1975-2016 post Bretton Woods) 3 and the post-crisis period (2008-2016); in doing so, the adequacy of quota-size decisions in past reviews is not prejudged. For each indicator, the Fund\u2019s \u201csize gap\u201d is estimated as the difference between the current level of Fund resources relative to the indicator, and the reference historical average for that ratio. When assessing the adequacy of Fund resources using these traditional metrics, two aspects stand out: first, the 14th General Review of Quotas (GRQ) which was the most recent adjustment of the size and distribution of quota resources, represented a significant improvement of the Fund\u2019s own resources in terms of traditional metrics, restoring some relevant ratios to historical averages; second, going forward, bilateral agreements are projected to expire in 2019-2020; if they are not renewed, the Fund\u2019s lending capacity will decline accordingly at that point. NABs have been renewed through November 2022. 1 Data availability is a constraint when constructing some measures. Additionally, we acknowledge the caveats for using some measures as benchmark indicators (for instance, international reserves, given diverse motivations for accumulation in addition to insurance). 2 IMF (2010). 3 Due to data collection restrictions, most of the series used start in 1975 (instead of the formal end of the Gold Standard in 1973). External Liabilities start in 1980, given the very volatile figures recorded in the late 70s. ",

The ratios of IMF resources to FX international reserves have also picked up from historic lows since the Global Financial Crisis due to the increase in quota and borrowed resources (see Chart 1, bottom panel); so even if the ratios are below long-term historical averages they are above the 2008-2016 reference level (see Charts 3 and 4). Otherwise, the declining trend of these ratios reflects the rapid build-up of FX reserves. It has to be emphasised that the use of FX reserves to benchmark the size of the Fund is not straightforward as both are part of the GFSN and their relative movements may well signal changes in the preference for self-insurance vs. Fund support. This has to be taken into consideration when assessing these ratios. Financial inflows and current payments. The size of the Fund relative to gross financial inflows and current payments shows significant historical fluctuations. In 2017, these ratios were in line with reference averages (see Chart 2), resulting in small positive size gaps compared to historical averages (see Chart 3), and a positive gap compared to the 2008-2016 average (see Chart 4). External liabilities. Finally, as with previous metrics, the ratio of resources to gross external liabilities \u2013 an indicator of the scale of external balance sheet risks \u2013 has recovered recently, but in this case, it remains lower than the historical average (see Chart 2), resulting in a large negative gap (see Chart 3). In relation to the 2008-2016 average, the gap would be positive (see Chart 4).

Total size Q+NAB is SDR 657,842 bn in December2017 and falls to 447,026 bn in 2022 after the expiration of the NAB. The assessment of the size of Fund resources in terms of traditional benchmarks depends both on the reference period and the specific indicator chosen. From a long-term historical perspective (1975-2016), the current size of the Fund is above reference levels in terms of GDP and BoP inflows.

        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 12 3 Programme characteristics and implications for the size of the Fund Recent years since the crisis have seen important changes in the characteristics of IMF programmes. This section provides an update of current programme trends taking into account the developments over the past years (see Annex A for updated tables). 4 A few key points are worth stressing when comparing the pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis episodes. 5 \u2022 There has been a decline in the size of total Fund commitments since the crisis period (2008-2012). In the past couple of years, the overall amount of resources committed to new programmes related to non-concessional (i.e. on competitive terms as opposed to credit lines with low-income countries) loans declined with respect to the very high levels seen earlier (see Table 2). In 2016 and 2017, new programme funding excluding precautionary lines was 18.0 and 1.0 billion SDR respectively, well below the level recorded in 2010 of SDR 59.8 billion (see Annex A). 6 Precautionary lines are credit arrangements under which the member agrees to meet specific conditions although it has indicated its intention not to make use of the arrangement. They are generally considerably larger than a non-precautionary IMF programme such as a stand- by arrangement (SBA). \u2022 The size of the countries receiving IMF loans has also decreased, reflecting less IMF involvement in advanced economies. The share of world GDP of countries supported by non-concessional loans declined by around half since the crisis. This decline reflects the fact that there were no advanced economies (AEs) in the list of countries supported by new non-concessional loans since Cyprus\u2019 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme in 2013 (not considering here the Greek \u201capproval in principle\u201d SBA in 2017 nor the precautionary lines). \u2022 There is also a predominance, in terms of size, of precautionary lines concentrated in a few countries. The resources committed to new programmes in recent years were predominantly applied to precautionary lines (the so-called FCL and PLL), although none of these lines have been disbursed to date. These facilities represented almost 82 percent of new committed resources in the whole of the post-crisis period, while it was about 57 percent of total committed resources in the crisis period (2008-2012). These resources 4 The new IMF programme for Argentina was approved in June 2018 after the finalisation of this paper. 5 Time partition, that is the assignment of any programme to a year, was made only on the basis of the first programme year. 6 These figures do not reveal the amount of actually disbursed resources but the programme commitments. Further, a simple sum across a given time period of the resources allocated to IMF programmes would overestimate the actual amount of resources committed to programmes in the final year of the time period, since within a given time period, IMF programs can replace other programmes. This has also occurred systematically with precautionary lines. ",
        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 13 continued to be highly concentrated, as revealed by the very small number of precautionary lines. The largest IMF programme in terms of resources committed, classified by the first programme year, has always been a precautionary line since 2009. \u2022 The reform of the exceptional access lending framework in early 2016 may result in a lower number of large IMF programmes. As part of the package that sealed the ratification of the 2010 Reforms, the IMF Executive Board agreed to the elimination of the \u201csystemic exemption\u201d introduced in 2010. This reduces the IMF\u2019s flexibility to lend to countries whose debt is assessed to be sustainable but not with high probability in the presence of spillover and contagion risks, an exemption that was used, most notably, in the case of the 2010 Stand-By Arrangement with Greece. The removal of the exemption and an expectation that similar cases would lean more heavily on the private sector, through debt reprofiling or other sources of financing, would limit the involvement and financial risks of the IMF in comparable cases.

In any case, while the average size of programmes and the number of commitments has abated compared to the crisis period, it is too early to talk about a \u201cclear trend\u201d. In the five-year period after the crisis (2013-2017) the number of non-concessional/non-precautionary programmes fell back to pre-crisis levels, and although the average size of those programmes is still double the pre- crisis period, it is markedly below the crisis peak. Indeed, current programme characteristics would not signal the need for additional IMF resources. Table 3 gives the result of a simple exercise, projecting the programme characteristics of 2010 and 2015/2017 in terms of committed resources under non-concessional programmes as percentage to world GDP, to the WEO world GDP forecasts for 2018/2019. If the number and size of programmes remained unchanged in the forthcoming years relative to the period 2015-2017, the Fund would have sufficient resources available to meet the demand in the years 2018/2019 (also taking into account growth of world GDP), as total lending would amount to USD 118 billion. However, this call on IMF resources corresponds to a situation of cyclical upturn in the global economy and ",
        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 14 new crisis peaks may be ahead in view of existing global risks. From that perspective, it seems too early to conclude that the current programme characteristics represent a \u201cclear trend\u201d. If future IMF lending would revert to the levels seen in 2010 at the time of the GFC, the size of programmes in the two years 2018/2019 could be around USD 440 billion (see Table 3).

        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 15 4 Other resources: reserves, RFAs, and swap lines Since 2009, the Global Financial Safety Net (GFSN) has expanded significantly, making available sizable additional resources, which are complementary to the IMF. While they are not accessible to all countries, their use by Regional Financing Arrangement (RFA) countries can reduce the related calls on IMF resources and indirectly preserve IMF liquidity available also for non-RFA member countries. Two layers of the GFSN have shown particularly high growth. First, international reserves, due in part to countries\u2019 increased preference for self-insurance in case of a balance of payments crisis. Nevertheless, countries avoid using too much of their reserves in case of need. Furthermore, the market turmoil surrounding China in 2015 also showed how fast these buffers can get depleted in case of a severe crisis. Second, regional financing arrangements (RFAs), which provide additional finance for their member countries. In addition, central banks have opened bilateral swap lines mainly, although not only, to ensure short-term liquidity of financial institutions in foreign currency. 7 However, countries do not have the same access to all these layers of the GFSN. This is the case especially for many EMEs but also for Low Income Countries (LICs). Yet, many of the LICs have access to Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) facilities and Multilateral Development Banks (MDB) liquidity. Aggregate RFAs\u2019 resources are now somewhat larger than the Fund\u2019s (excluding bilateral loans). Chart 5 summarises the size of the IMF compared to the main RFAs, reserves and swap lines. Before 2009, the IMF was in practice the main multilateral layer of the GFSN. Due to the growth of RFAs\u2019 and the IMF\u00b4s borrowed resources since the onset of the global financial crisis, the relative quota size of the IMF has been declining, and it has only caught up to some extent when the 14th Quota review was implemented. 7 People\u2019s Bank of China swap lines would have a broader goal of spurring trade, promoting financial stability and helping boost internationalisation of the yuan.

It is important to stress that RFAs\u2019 programmes are linked to a large extent to an IMF programme when there is a balance of payment need (ECB, 2018). Chart 6 compares the size of the IMF with that of the most important RFAs. Central bank swap lines have also come to play an increasingly important role in the global financial safety net. However, in view of central bank mandates, in most cases swap lines tend to be focused on providing liquidity to the banking sector in order to protect financial stability, rather than on traditional balance of payments financing. This means one should refrain from adding them directly to the other sources of liquidity. Since 2008, when the Federal Reserve extended swap lines to 14 AE and EME central banks, swap lines have increased significantly in number and value. Swap lines now exist among AE central banks, between AEs and EMEs, and between EME central banks. They exist for a range of motivations, some for provision of foreign exchange liquidity to central banks, some to support the internationalisation of the RMB, others for regional political and economic reasons. It is important to keep in mind that swap lines are not available to all countries in the same way as IMF loans. -1,000 1,000 3,000 5,000 7,000 9,000 11,000 13,000 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 1,400 2000 2005 2010 2016 T h d IMF (Q+NAB) IMF bilateral arrangements ESM EFSF EFSM EU BoP CMIM CRA Others (FLAR, AMF, EFSD) BSAs (right-hand scale) Total reserves incling gold (right-hand scale) ",

Most countries have access to the IMF and reserves while others have access to additional elements of the GFSN, such as the RFAs, that have a regional focus. A number of EMEs and LICs do not have access to this layer. Reserves and swap lines have grown since the crisis as well, but they might prove inadequate to stem a severe crisis, in the case of the former, or are often not available to address balance of payments crises, in the case of the latter. While additional layers could probably account for much of the liquidity need in \u201cnormal times\u201d, a strong IMF at the centre of the GFSN remains imperative to backstop future crises of greater magnitude \u2013 as also the next section will show.

        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 18 5 Scenario analysis In this section, we provide estimates of potential calls on IMF resources based on potential financing needs of advanced and emerging market economies that are assumed to experience a shock over 2018-2019. We assume a sovereign debt shock for AEs and a balance of payments one for EMEs. 8 Of course, this does not rule out the possibility of a debt crisis in EMEs or a balance of payments crisis in AEs. We calculate the potential financing needs by simulating a shock for individual countries and then aggregating up to the country group level. Since it is a partial equilibrium exercise, each country is treated independently and we do not consider spillovers among countries, or the possible feedback on other macroeconomic variables (such as GDP) of the simulated shocks, nor the consequent policy responses (for example, the announcement of a programme with the IMF). The details of the methodologies used for computing the potential calls on IMF resources are explained in detail in Annex B. For ease of presentation and interpretation, we chose to present two main different scenarios based on the intensity of the shock: a moderate scenario and a severe one. Additionally, a complete set of results for different scenarios is presented as sensitivity analyses in Annex C. The analysis considers the types of shock that are more likely to affect each country group, simulating a balance of payment shock for EMEs and a sovereign debt shock for AEs instead of considering the same global scenario for all countries. Most parameters are calibrated on historical post-crisis experience rather than assumed exogenously. 5.1 Advanced Economies The sovereign debt shock for AEs is based on the methodology used in Denbee et al. (2016). The shock envisages: (i) a reduced willingness of foreign investors to rollover maturing debt and to fund fiscal deficits and, at least in the severe scenario, (ii) a widening of the fiscal deficit, calibrated on historical experience. The sample of countries considered in the exercise is taken from the list of advanced economies that report data on maturing debt over the next two years in the IMF Fiscal Monitor. To make an adjustment for vulnerability, we exclude all reserve issuers (apart from euro area countries) and countries that are currently AAA rated by all 3 major ratings agencies. This leaves a sample of 16 countries. In the scenarios, we assume that foreign investors are willing to rollover 20% of (i) their maturing sovereign debt over two years and (ii) to finance 20% of any new debt issued to finance the fiscal deficit. 9 Domestic investors are assumed to be willing to rollover all the maturing sovereign debt that they own and in addition fund a 8 Here we follow an approach similar to Denbee at all (2016). 9 Annex C provides robustness tests with alternative assumptions. ",
        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 19 portion of the fiscal deficit increase, without substituting for foreign investors. We then assess two scenarios using different assumptions for the fiscal balance based on the past post-crisis experience. We use the Laeven and Valencia (2012) database to date sovereign debt crises and calculate the distribution of the percentage change in the fiscal balance over the two years following the crisis. The parameters of the scenarios are described in Table 4. As the table shows, in the moderate scenario, the fiscal deficit narrows but in the severe shock fiscal deficits widen significantly.

(2) Relaxing the reserve assumption to 80% of short-term debt and a maximum 40% of stock decrease has no effect on the results. The financing needs are assumed to be addressed first by running down, up to a certain point, FX reserves, second from RFAs where present, and third from IMF resources. As shown in Table 4, the potential financing needs that the IMF has to satisfy, once FX reserve and RFAs resources have been taken into account would range between USD 220 and USD 572 billion. This compares with current IMF ",

This scenario uses the median value of the percent change in the fiscal deficit in previous crises (as calculated by Denbee et al., 2016). In this case, the overall financing needs are USD 950 billion and are mostly covered by the ESM (USD 450 billion) which is the main AE RFA for the countries in the sample. Since most AEs hold limited FX reserves, the estimates are quite sensitive to the assumptions on reserve usage. If we assume countries use up to a 100 percent of their short-term debt subject to a maximum usage of 25 percent, the financing needs would amount to USD 469 billion. Still, IMF current total available resources would be enough to cover the financing needs under this scenario. 11 \u2022 Severe shock. Compared with the baseline scenario, the severe shock scenario uses the 25th percentile of the historical change in the fiscal deficit, while the other parameters are left unchanged. This entails higher fiscal deficits and thus higher overall financing needs. However, FX reserve and RFA usage do not change significantly as the financing needs are concentrated in the same set of countries as in the moderate scenario. The potential call on IMF resources would increase to around USD 572 billion (when countries are allowed to use reserves up to 100 percent of the short-term debt metric subject to a maximum usage of 25 percent). In this case, the IMF available resources would slightly fall short of the potential demand. Overall, our analysis suggests that in order for the IMF to be able to cover the majority of potential AEs sovereign debt crisis scenarios, its overall resources would need to remain at current levels. 5.2 Emerging Market Economies The balance of payment shock for EMEs assumes only a partial rollover of long- and short-term external debt coupled with a change in the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows (see Table 5). This sudden stop in capital inflows is assumed to be partially accommodated by a reduction (increase) in the current account deficit (surplus) and a reduction in residents\u2019 net capital outflows. As in the advanced country scenarios, IMF financing (in addition to the resources already committed under the existing precautionary lines) is assumed to be the last resort after running down FX reserves and accessing, where available, RFAs. The scenarios proposed differ according to the assumed rollover rates. As shown in Table 6, the potential financing needs that the IMF would need to satisfy range 10 As explained in the Foreword section, these are calculated as the sum of end-2017 FCC (USD 312.5 billion) plus inactivated borrowed resources, excluding 20% prudential balance (USD 495.4 billion). Available at IMF. Please note that current IMF total resources are slightly higher because of the approval of some new bilateral borrowing agreements. 11 As explained in the foreword section, the definition of IMF available resources used in the shock- scenario analyses refers to the uncommitted lending capacity.

This scenario uses rollover rates between 0.7 and 0.8, the median value of the historical distribution of current account adjustment and changes in FDI inflows and FDI, portfolio and other outflows (as calculated by Denbee et al., 2016). In this case, the overall financing needs amount to around USD 1,300 billion and are mostly covered by FX reserves (almost USD 1,000 billion), while RFAs\u2019 contribution is much smaller (between USD 15 and USD 40 billion). The financing need from the IMF, as expected, is higher (lower) when considering the stricter (looser) criteria for reserve use. Current IMF resources (including the activation of borrowed resources) would be more than sufficient to cover the financing needs under this scenario. \u2022 Severe shock. Compared with the moderate shock scenario, the severe shock one implies a smaller rollover of external debt, while the other parameters are left unchanged.

It should be noted that both scenarios assume an improvement in the current account balance and decline in residents\u2019 capital outflows. Should those adjustments not materialise, the resulting financing needs would be higher, as shown in Annex C. In addition, the sensitivity analysis also highlights the importance of the assumed rundown in FX reserves. Given the high level of reserves on average in EMEs, a change in the adequacy metric can change the results significantly. Overall, our EME scenarios suggest that to cover potential demand IMF resources would need to stay at least at current levels. ",
        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 23 6 Conclusions The IMF stands at the core of the GFSN as the key international institution for surveillance and balance of payments support in crisis situations. During the past decade, the GFSN has witnessed a significant expansion in the number of layers and the amount of resources available for crisis prevention and resolution, especially through international reserves accumulation, central bank swap lines and regional financing arrangements. For a number of countries, there are more resources available in a balance of payments crisis than just those of the IMF and own reserves. Indeed, FX reserves should be considered as the first line of defence in terms of financing. 12 RFAs provide another complementary source of financing for a number of countries; the lack of conditionality and supervisory functions in some regional arrangements make them a suboptimal tool for crisis prevention and resolution. The Fund continues to play a central role at the core of the GFSN, providing the only truly financial backstop for crisis management at the global level and being essential to the credibility of the GFSN. This is why a strong and well- funded IMF is a centrepiece of a strong and credible GFSN. Turning to the analysis carried out in this report, the traditional indicator analysis is not conclusive on the adequacy of the Fund\u2019s current resources. However, some results point to a sizable deterioration in the medium term. Comparing traditional indicators with long-term historical averages yields a mixed assessment at present: the Fund\u2019s current resources would appear sufficient in terms of GDP or capital-inflow metrics. However, the Fund\u2019s resources look insufficient compared with other indicators such as external liabilities that capture the increasing size of global financial risks. In the same vein, at this stage current programme characteristics would not signal the need for additional IMF resources, but this situation may change going forward. Current programme characteristics correspond to a phase of cyclical upturn and it is too early to talk about a \u201cclear trend\u201d. New crisis peaks may be ahead of us, given the risks related to the normalisation of unconventional monetary policies, the geopolitical environment, record levels of debt globally and financial stability risks. Indeed, if future IMF lending would revert to levels seen in 2010 at the time of the GFC, the size of programmes could reach two thirds of current quota resources. Finally, the analysis of adverse shock-scenarios suggests that the IMF\u2019s current overall resources are enough to cover remaining financing gaps in most moderate sudden stop scenarios in EMEs or sovereign debt shock scenarios in advanced countries. However, current Fund resources would be hardly sufficient to cover more severe scenarios. These estimates are very sensitive to the assumptions made on debt rollover rates and on the cushion provided from accumulated FX reserves. At the pessimistic end of these assumptions, the IMF 12 Sound macro policies and strong frameworks are the first line of defence in terms of policies. ",
        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 24 resources would not be enough to cover the potential demand for financing. While a severe adverse shock scenario might be seen as more unlikely, it should be kept in mind that the safety net provided by the IMF has also an important crisis prevention function in that its resource buffer provides confidence. This is particularly important as the nature and size of the next crisis in an increasingly interlinked global financial system is difficult to predict. Furthermore, the following caveats are worth mentioning: \u2022 In assessing the appropriate size of the IMF, separate shocks have been used for AEs and EMEs. The different nature of these shocks makes it preferable to consider them separately. Indeed, it would be extremely unlikely that many AEs and EMEs would simultaneously have calls on IMF resources (there is no historical precedent for this). Still, it cannot be excluded that systemic crisis in AEs \u2013 or in EMEs \u2013 could rapidly spill over into other regions, making the shock more severe and therefore increasing the need for Fund resources by more than suggested by the separate shocks. \u2022 Given the uneven coverage of the additional layers of protection that the GFSN provides, if shocks were asymmetric and biased to less-protected/more protected countries, the call for IMF funding could be higher/lower than suggested above. Additionally, the take up of IMF precautionary facilities, which could help countries without RFA access, has been highly concentrated in very few countries to date. Based on the results of the different methodologies applied in this report to provide a quantitative assessment of the appropriate size of the Fund, a prudent approach would call for maintaining the Fund\u2019s total resources at their current levels (Table 7 shows a comparison of the different results). In this respect, it should be recalled that the Fund\u2019s relative size is projected to decline markedly over coming years, as the Fund\u2019s borrowed resources expire. However, this report only presents a quantitative analysis that needs to be complemented by other considerations and qualitative assessments \u2013 such as the strengthening of domestic and international resilience by stronger regulation and supervision after the GFC, and the ability of the IMF and its stakeholders to react quickly in crisis situations, assuming continued preparedness to cooperate \u2013 in order to derive any conclusions on the appropriate level of IMF resources after the expiration of borrowed resources.

        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 28 B Methodology B.1 Advanced economies For the calculation of the potential call on IMF resources by AEs, we use the sample of countries for which data on maturing debt are published in the Fiscal Monitor. To adjust for vulnerability, we exclude all countries that are currently AAA rated by all 3 major ratings agencies and are not reserve issuers (excluding euro area countries); this leaves a sample of 16 countries. The exercise involves the following steps. Step 1. Sovereign Debt Crisis in AEs. A sovereign debt crisis lasting two years (2018-2019) is characterised by the following assumptions: 1. A change in the fiscal balance based on historical experience. 2. Partial rollover rate of maturing external debt and partial external financing of the fiscal deficit. 3. Full rollover of maturing debt held by residents and full rollover of the domestic portion of the fiscal deficit. 4. Domestic investors are not willing to fund the rollover of sovereign debt previously held by foreign investors. The scenarios are calibrated on historical experience. We use the Laeven and Valencia (2012) database to date sovereign debt crises and calculate the distribution of the percentage change in the fiscal balance over the two years following the crisis. The parameters of the scenarios are described in table 4. Step 2. Domestic adjustment. Domestic adjustment is calibrated through the change in the fiscal balance. In response to the sovereign debt crisis, countries are assumed to change their fiscal deficits in line with historical experience. Step 3. Calculation of total financing needs. We apply a shock where the 16 countries considered partially lose access to external financing for their sovereign debt. This affects the refinancing of maturing debt and the issuance of new debt to finance the government\u2019s fiscal deficit. We provide estimates for foreign rollover rates of 0%, 20% and 40% and implicitly assume a rollover rate of 100% on borrowing by residents. But we assume that domestic residents are not willing to step in to replace foreign investors. We also assume that the domestic central bank does not intervene to buy newly issued sovereign debt. For each of the stressed countries, we calculate the sovereign financing needs as the sum of the maturing sovereign debt and the fiscal deficit over the 2018-2019 period. Historically, in the median case, the fiscal balance improves in the wake of a sovereign crisis (Table 4). In the severe scenario, the fiscal deficit increases. This is calibrated using the 25th percentile from the historical episode. We then multiply the ",
        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 29 total financing needs by the share of the outstanding debt stock held by foreign investors. Step 4. Use of reserves. When a country faces a financing gap need, it can rundown up to a certain level its FX reserves. The maximum amount of usable reserves is calculated using two alternatives to provide a sensitivity analysis on the potential demand on IMF. Countries can rundown reserves: 1. by up to 50% of their initial stock (as in Denbee et al. 2016); 2. up to 100% of their short-term external debt level, with a maximum reduction of 25%; Step 5. Use of RFAs. The remaining financing needs after reserves have been used are covered by RFA resources, when available, up to each country\u2019s borrowing limits. When no official borrowing limits apply countries are allowed unlimited claims on their RFA subject to the overall financing constraint of their RFA. Step 6. Adjusting available IMF resources. Countries that are left with a remaining financing gap are considered unable to contribute to IMF resources, since they would no longer participate in the Financial Transaction Plan. Therefore their contributions through quotas, NAB and bilateral borrowing agreements (when applicable) are subtracted to IMF\u2019s available resources. Parameters. These scenarios use parameters calibrated by Denbee et al. (2016) based on the Laeven and Valencia (2012) crisis database. Those parameters are used to calculate the percentage change in the relevant flow in 2018-2019 compared with 2017. Data. We use the IMF\u2019s October 2017 Fiscal Monitor forecast for financing needs as our baseline and Arslanalp and Tsuda (2014, October 2017 data update) on the external share of countries\u2019 government financing at Q2 2017. The Fiscal Monitor provides data on the maturing external debt of 26 AEs. From this sample, we exclude 3 reserve issuers and 7 countries that are rated AAA by all three major ratings agencies. Data on IMF available quota are taken from the Financing IMF Transaction Quarterly Report for the period May-July 2017. For the exchange rate and the IMF Forward Commitment capacity (FCC), we use the last daily and weekly data available for 2017. Scenario description. In the main text of this report we present two scenarios, accounting for a moderate and a severe shock. In the moderate shock, the fiscal deficit is calibrated on the median of the distribution of past post-crisis episodes. For the severe shock we use the 25th percentile of the distribution. Financing sources. A country\u2019s first line of defence in the face of a financing gap is its own FX reserves. We then consider each country\u2019s RFA membership and the relative borrowing limits. There are two RFAs which could provide financing to AEs: the European Stability Mechanism and the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation. ",
        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 30 B.2 Emerging Market economies For the EMEs scenarios, we use a set of between 33 and 44 countries from the WEO database, for which the relevant data for the exercise are available. 13 The calculation of the potential call on IMF resources by EMEs involves the following steps. Step 1. Sudden stops in capital inflows. The shocks performed (moderate and severe) take the form of a sudden stop lasting two years (2018-2019), characterised by the following assumptions: \u2022 Only a partial rollover rate of short-term external debt. 14 \u2022 Only a partial rollover rate of long-term external debt \u2022 Change in FDI inflows Step 2. Domestic adjustment. It takes four forms: 1. an improvement in the current account balance and 2. a decline in domestic investors\u2019 outflows: FDI, 3. portfolio and 4. other investment. Step 3. Calculation of total financing needs. The implied variation in the country\u2019s reserve balance is calculated using the balance of payment identity. Step 4. Use of reserves. When a country faces a financing gap, FX reserves can be rundown up until a certain level. The maximum amount of usable reserves is calculated using three alternatives to provide a sensitivity analysis on the potential demand on IMF financing. 15 Countries can use reserves up to: 1. 100% of their short-term external debt level, with a maximum decrease of 30% 2. 100% of the reserve adequacy metric (ARA metric) calculated by the IMF (on 2017 data), with a maximum decrease of 25% 13 The larger set of countries comprises: Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Belarus, Belize, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cabo Verde, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Georgia, Grenada, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Macedonia, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Romania, Serbia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Swaziland, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine. 14 In particular, we apply the partial rollover rates on total short-term external debt and on the principal repayments on long-term external debt. The short-term debt which is not rolled over in the first year is subtracted from the stock in the second year. 15 The total financing needs and the underlying number of countries are different when using the first metric for reserve adequacy with respect to the other two, because data availability on reserve adequacy changes. In addition, it may happen that the number of countries using IMF resources is greater than that of countries using reserves, since it may be that a country does not have available reserves (according to the relevant metric) and it directly resorts to the IMF. ",
        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 31 3. 80% of the ARA metric (on 2017 data), with a maximum decrease of 40% Step 5. Use of RFAs. The remaining financing needs after reserves have been used are covered by RFA resources, when available, up to each country\u2019s borrowing limits. Step 6. Adjusting available IMF resources. Countries that are left with a remaining financing gap are considered unable to contribute to IMF resources, since they would no longer participate in the Financial Transaction Plan. Therefore, their contributions through quotas, NAB and bilateral borrowing agreements (when applicable) are subtracted to IMF\u2019s available resources. Parameters. These scenarios use parameters calibrated by Denbee et al. (2016) on the historical experiences of EMEs balance of payment crisis on all flows and adjustments, except the external debt rollover rates, which take values between 0.6 and 0.8 (Table 5). 16 Those parameters are used to calculate the percentage change in the relevant flow in 2018-19 compared with 2017. 17 Data. We use mostly the October 2017 IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) data, except for one variable (principal repayments on long-term external debt), which is taken from the 2017 World Bank International Debt Statistics (IDS) database. The WEO database contains information for 95 EMEs (which are not Low Income Countries), but not all relevant data are available for all countries, hence our simulations comprise between 33 and 45 countries, depending on the reserve adequacy metric considered. The reserve metric based on short-term external debt only is calculated on the basis of WEO 2017 data, while data on IMF ARA metrics are taken from the IMF website and refer to 2017 data, adjusted for the presence of capital control measures. 18 As for AEs scenarios, data on IMF available quota are taken from the Financing IMF Transaction Quarterly Report for the period May- July 2017. For the exchange rate and the IMF Forward Commitment capacity (FCC), we use the last daily and weekly data available for 2017. Scenario description. In the main text we present two scenarios, accounting for a moderate and a severe shock, the severity of the shock is dictated by the rollover rates of external debt. The reaction of the other flows is set at the median value of the historic distribution of the parameters in past post-crisis situations, as calculated by Denbee et al. (2016). In both scenarios, the FDI capital inflows slightly increase (by 7.9 percent in the first year and 10.2 percent in the second year of the crisis), reflecting the fact that FDI investors tend to take a longer view of EMEs growth potential and their investments show less volatility. Financing sources. A country\u2019s first line of defence in face of a financing gap are its own FX reserves. After that, if a country has an IMF precautionary facility (e.g. the Flexible Credit Line and the Precautionary and Liquidity Line), it can use it up to its 16 The calibration of rollover rates is not possible due to the lack of data on the behaviour of external debt flows during the past crisis. 17 When the parameter for one specific item is set to zero, we assume no change in the underlying flow with respect to 2017 data. 18 Available at IMF.

        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 33 C Scenario analysis: Robustness exercises C.1 Advanced economies Table C.1 provides a set of robustness tests using different assumptions of the rollover rates on external debt. As the results show, the estimates are highly sensitive to the rollover rate assumptions. In an extreme scenario with a 0% rollover rate and limited use of reserves, IMF financing needs are USD 830 billion. Current IMF resources are not large enough to fully fund this scenario. On the other hand, a very benign scenario with a mild fiscal deficit shock, rollover rate of 40% and extensive use of reserves (up to 50% of total stock) is fully funded by reserves and RFAs, with no calls on the fund in this scenario.

        "ECB Occasional Paper Series No 213 / October 2018 34 C.2 Emerging Market economies Our analysis encompassed different set of hypothesis on the crisis definition and on the domestic reaction to it; in addition, we run a battery of scenarios using a different method for computing the impact of the shock on the balance of payment variables. Table C.2 shows a set of baseline and a set of severe scenarios, whereas the severity is dictated by the rollover rate and within each set the scenarios are differentiated by the extent of domestic response to the shock; there is no domestic response (scenarios 1 and 4), current account adjustment (2 and 5) and current account adjustment coupled by a full response in FDI, portfolio and other investment outflows (3 and 6, which correspond to the scenarios presented in the main text). In the full set of scenarios, the potential IMF demand varies from USD 300 up to 1,200 billion and there are multiple scenarios in which IMF resources would not suffice to cover the potential needs of the membership (scenarios 1, 4 and 5). In Table C.3 we change the method of calculation of the stressed variables and the calibrated parameters change accordingly, again based on Denbee et al. (2016). Instead of focusing on the percentage change of each balance of payments variable during the sudden stop episodes, here we look at the percentage deviation from the IMF WEO forecasted values for balance of payments variables in the year prior to the shock. In this case we no longer use partial rollover rates on external debt, but apply the calibrated parameters at portfolio, FDI and other inflows. The deviation of portfolio and other inflows is set at the median value of the historical distribution in the first three scenarios and at the 25th percentile of the same distribution in scenarios 4 to 6; the other parameters are set at their median values. As a result, there is an extremely benign scenario (no. 2) where domestic adjustment almost fully compensates for the sudden stop, and other cases where IMF resources would be enough or more than enough to cover the potential demand.
