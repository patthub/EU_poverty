        "M. whereas the focus of the 59th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women, to be held in New York from 9 to 20 March 2015, will be the follow-up to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, including the current challenges that impede its implementation and therefore the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women, and also the opportunities for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women in the post-2015 agenda for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); N. whereas free primary education for all children is a fundamental right established by the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; whereas educating children and adults helps reduce poverty and infant mortality and promote good environmental practices; whereas access to education for all is intrinsically linked to the gender equality MDG, in particular in terms of completing primary education; whereas this goal is far from being achieved; O. whereas in times of armed conflict women and children, including female and child refugees, asylum seekers and stateless persons, are among the most vulnerable groups in society, and whereas the risks to adolescent girls displaced during humanitarian crises are significantly heightened; P. whereas all types of discrimination and violence against women, including sexual abuse, female genital mutilation, forced marriage, so-called honour crimes, the commercial sexual exploitation of women and domestic violence, should never be justified on any political, social, religious or cultural grounds or on the basis of any popular or tribal tradition; Q. whereas there is a clear relationship between corruption and violations of human rights; whereas corruption in the public and private sectors perpetrates and aggravates inequality and discrimination, and consequently prevents the equal enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights; whereas it is proven that acts of corruption are often linked to human rights violations, abuse of power and lack of accountability; R. whereas labour rights and trade union rights are under serious attack around the world, while the ways in which companies operate have a profound impact on the rights of workers, communities, and consumers within and outside Europe; whereas international human rights law imposes on states the duty to protect human rights, to ensure that the activities of corporations under their jurisdiction do not violate human rights, and to ensure that effective forms of remedy are available to victims; S. whereas the business community has a great role to play in promoting human rights and whereas such efforts are deeply desirable and should be supported by public institutions worldwide; whereas the promotion of human rights should be considered to be a platform for cooperation between government and the private sector; T. whereas a clause on compliance with international conventions on human rights and labour rights is a requirement of the enhanced Generalised System of Preferences (GSP+) for third countries; U. whereas Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) states that men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family, and are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, both during marriage and at its dissolution, and that marriage is to be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses; V. whereas Article 14 of the UDHR recognises the right of every person to seek asylum from persecution in other countries; whereas the UN Convention on the Status of Refugees clearly states that all refugees are entitled to special protection and that no state may expel or return a refugee to a territory where he or she faces persecution or threats to life or freedom; W. whereas Article 18 of the UDHR recognises the freedom of thought, conscience and religion; whereas the number of incidents relating to freedom of religion or belief has risen sharply, inter alia as a consequence of an increasing number of conflicts with a religious dimension; 30.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 316/145 Thursday 12 March 2015 ",
        "X. whereas Article 25 of the UDHR recognises the right of every person to a \u2018standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family\u2019, in which motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance, and which includes medical care; whereas it is the 25th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is the most widely ratified human rights treaty; whereas UNHRC Resolution 26/28 calls for the next UNHRC Social Forum meeting to focus on access to medicines in the context of the right of everyone to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; whereas the World Health Organisation (WHO) constitution states that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition; Y. whereas the effects of climate change, such as increasing temperatures, rising sea levels and more extreme weather conditions, will intensify the challenges of global instability and, consequently, the threat of serious human rights violations; Z. whereas access to safe drinking water and sanitation is a human right that stems from the right to an adequate standard of living and is inextricably linked to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and to the right to life and human dignity; whereas approximately 2,6 billion people \u2014 half the developing world \u2014 lack even a simple \u2018improved\u2019 latrine and 1,1 billion people have no access to any type of drinking water; AA. whereas this report, while drafted in response to the EU Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World in 2013 adopted by the Council, is a forward-looking analysis of the EU\u2019s activities in the policy area in question; whereas Parliament, in its resolutions on the previous Annual Reports and on the review of the EU human rights strategy, has stressed the need for continued reflection on its own practices in relation to the mainstreaming of human rights in its activities, to the follow-up of its urgency resolutions on breaches of democracy, human rights and the rule of law and to the monitoring of compliance with clauses on democracy and human rights in all agreements concluded by the EU with third countries; Centrality of human rights in EU external policies 1. Recalls that the preamble to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union affirms that the EU \u2018places the individual and human dignity at the heart of its activities\u2019; 2. Calls on all the EU institutions and the Member States to place human rights at the centre of the EU\u2019s relations with all third countries, including its strategic partners and in all high-level statements and meetings; emphasises the importance of effective, consistent and coherent implementation of the EU\u2019s human rights policy, in line with the clear obligations laid down in Article 21 TEU and in the EU Strategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy; commends the new VP/HR for openly stating her forthright commitment to the implementation of these principles; 3. Stresses the importance for the Member States of speaking with one voice in support of the indivisibility, inviolability and universality of human rights and, in particular, of ratifying all the international human rights instruments established by the UN; calls for the EU to uphold the indivisibility and inviolability of human rights, including those enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in conformity with Article 21 TEU; calls for the EU to further promote universal human rights standards as the basis for its engagement with third countries and regional organisations, in both political and human rights dialogues and trade negotiations; 4. Welcomes the Commission's decision to place the rule of law at the heart of the enlargement process; urges the EU to monitor closely the implementation of provisions protecting human rights and the rights of people belonging to minorities, throughout the enlargement process; C 316/146 EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.8.2016 Thursday 12 March 2015 ",
        "5. Warns, however, of the unintended consequences of continuously expanding the list of human rights and including ideologically or politically controversial issues, as this could ultimately reduce general support for the very idea of the universality and indivisibility of human rights; 6. Points out that, in addition to human suffering, the EU should also take into account all the consequences of the non- observance of human rights where failure to respect human rights and lack of legitimate democratic participation lead to instability, corruption, failed states, humanitarian crises or armed conflicts, phenomena which undermine the EU\u2019s efforts in its development policy, and to which the EU or its Member States are obliged to react in the foreign and security policy domain; welcomes, in this connection, the EU\u2019s recent efforts to include human rights violations in its early warning matrix linked to crisis prevention; calls, however, for stronger preventive action, and urges the VP/HR, the Commission and the Member States to develop a human-rights-based crisis prevention element which should be added to the EU\u2019s comprehensive approach to external conflict and crises and should be included in the forthcoming revised European Security Strategy; 7. Takes the view that the EU, including its Delegations, should identify early warning signals, such as repression of minorities and human rights violations, that point to potential conflicts and humanitarian catastrophes; calls for the EU to develop best practices for promoting and protecting human rights in post-disaster and post-conflict situations, paying special attention to disabled people, women, children and other vulnerable groups, by providing data and taking relevant measures as regards concrete references to people with disabilities, the availability of disability-inclusive disaster risk reduction plans, training for all relevant service personnel and the proportion of accessible emergency shelters and disaster relief sites, with a focus on human rights mainstreaming in relief, recovery and reconstruction efforts, while respecting the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence and the needs-based approach to humanitarian assistance; 8. Encourages the EU to ensure that there is a synergy between the opportunities for support afforded by the Instrument for Stability, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) and the European Endowment for Democracy; 9. Expresses its deep concern at the increasing number of serious human rights violations resulting from terrorism across the world; refers to a 2014 report which indicated a 62 % rise in terrorist activity from 2012 to 2013 and an increase in the number of countries that experienced terrorism causing more than 50 deaths, from 15 to 24; urges the VP/HR and the European External Action Service (EEAS), with reference to the increase in terrorist activity, to cooperate better and more efficiently with governments in combating all forms of terrorism; 10. Holds that denials of genocide and other crimes against humanity, as well as acts of racism, xenophobia or religious hatred, constitute a clear violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and as such should be condemned; 11. Calls on the VP/HR, Federica Mogherini, and the EU foreign ministers to place regularly on the Foreign Affairs Council agenda the discussion of EU efforts to pursue the release of human rights defenders, journalists, political activists and others who exercise their rights peacefully; EU Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World as the reporting tool for EU human rights and democracy policy 12. Welcomes the adoption by the Council of the EU Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World in 2013; invites the new VP/HR to make a commitment for the future to participate in two dedicated annual debates in plenary sittings of Parliament on the EU\u2019s human rights and democracy policy, to present the EU report, and to respond to Parliament\u2019s report; 13. Considers it regrettable that the Commission did not give a written answer to Parliament\u2019s aforementioned resolution on the Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World 2012, and considers that such written answers are extremely important for interinstitutional cooperation in this area and cannot be replaced by the debate in plenary, which allows less time for reflection and for a systematic reply to all the points raised by Parliament; 30.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 316/147 Thursday 12 March 2015 ",
        "14. Commends the EEAS and the Commission for their comprehensive and clear reporting on EU action taken during the reporting period; reiterates, however, its view that the country reports in particular should allow an overview of key positive and negative trends and evaluate the efficiency of the EU\u2019s actions; notes that more thorough public reporting, based in particular on the priorities and indicators identified in the hitherto confidential EU human rights country strategies, would encourage greater consistency in implementing human rights conditionality and assessing the human rights impact of EU policies; 15. Maintains its view that the EU institutions should jointly strive to improve the format of the Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World with a view to enabling it to reach a large section of the public while conserving its comprehensive nature as an implementation report on the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy; reiterates its readiness to be part of active and constructive cooperation among the EU institutions in the preparation of future reports; reiterates its request that the Annual Report include a section on the implementation of the Action Plan by Member States; Implementation of the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan 16. Reiterates its appreciation of the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy, adopted by the Council in 2012, as a major milestone in breaking new ground in policy development and in reconfirming the EU\u2019s commitment to the Treaty obligation to mainstream human rights in all EU external policies \u2018without exception\u2019; 17. Recalls that human rights have become an essential component of the EU's external action and a real element of its identity in its bilateral, multilateral and institutional relations; 18. Appreciates the efforts made by the EEAS and the Commission to report back to Parliament on the implementation of the first EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy; calls on the VP/HR and the EEAS to involve the Member States, the Commission, Parliament, civil society and regional and international organisations in the review and consultations leading to the adoption of a new Action Plan, to take effect in early 2015; welcomes the discussions aimed at achieving better prioritisation of objectives in the new Action Plan, and at improving the clarity, effectiveness and coherence of this EU external policy tool, but warns against narrowing the scope of the Action Plan or lowering the level of ambition in terms of mainstreaming human rights across EU policy areas; 19. Encourages all parties involved in EU external action to take ownership of the EU's external policy on human rights and the various tools associated with it, and to ensure that human rights are taken into account across the board, inter alia by arranging for the officials concerned to receive regular training on human rights; 20. Expresses its particular concern over the implementation of the commitment made in the Strategic Framework to \u2018place human rights at the centre of EU relations with all third countries, including its strategic partners\u2019; urges, accordingly, studied attention by the VP/HR and the EEAS to implementing this commitment and to ensuring human rights and democracy mainstreaming in the EU\u2019s relations with its strategic partners in such central contexts as summit meetings and Council conclusions; further recommends that, whenever there is a gross breach of human rights by a partner country with which an agreement has been concluded, the EU take more effective steps to carry out the appropriate sanctions as stipulated in the agreement\u2019s human rights clauses, including possible (temporary) suspension of the agreement; 21. Calls on the VP/HR, in coordination with all the other Commissioners, to draft a programme that mainstreams human rights in various EU activities, particularly in the areas of development, migration, the environment, employment, internet data protection, trade, investment, technology and business; 22. Welcomes the fact that the VP/HR has publicly stated the need to review the EU\u2019s strategy towards all its strategic partners, including China and Russia, and calls on her to prioritise human rights in such countries during her tenure by clarifying that gross human rights violations are a threat to bilateral relations between the EU and its strategic partners; C 316/148 EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.8.2016 Thursday 12 March 2015 ",
        "Mandate of the EU Special Representative for Human Rights 23. Recognises the importance of the mandate given to the first ever EU Special Representative (EUSR) for Human Rights and congratulates the current mandate holder on the work done so far; encourages the EUSR to continue to enhance the EU\u2019s visibility and its engagement with the relevant multilateral organisations and regional human rights mechanisms (the UN, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the African Union and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation), to promote key EU thematic priorities reflected in the EU's Human Rights Guidelines, to work for the empowerment of civil society throughout the world, and to contribute to the mainstreaming, coherence, consistency and effectiveness of EU human rights policy and to striking the right balance between silent and public diplomacy; acknowledges the need for greater visibility for the role of the EUSR for Human Rights, who, while supported by the different services within the EU institutions in the interests of good coordination, needs to have own-initiative powers and the right to speak publicly; 24. Calls on the Council to adopt as a general principle the practice of including cooperation with the EUSR for Human Rights systematically in the mandate of future geographical EUSRs; 25. Requests that the position of EUSR for Human Rights be continued with a view to turning it into a permanent function, with adequate means to fully endorse the role, including the use of public diplomacy; Internal/external coherence in EU human rights and democracy policy 26. Stresses that EU human rights policy needs to be consistent in complying with Treaty obligations, ensuring coherence between internal and external policies and avoiding double standards; calls, therefore, for the adoption of Foreign Affairs Council conclusions on human rights with regard to strategic partners; calls, in this context, for the establishment of common thresholds for Member States and for EU officials in terms of the human rights concerns that they have to raise, as a minimum, with their strategic partner counterparts, while keeping in mind the circumstances of each country\u2019s situation; 27. Stresses that the EU's action regarding third countries has to be consistent for it to be credible and hence effective, and that discrepancies and inconsistencies make its action less effective and sometimes cause its views on human rights not to be heard; recalls that, in spite of the many problems encountered, consistency is still a priority for external policy and that it has to be at the heart of the mandate of all those involved in such policy; 28. Considers it essential, moreover, that the requirements regarding human rights set out by the EU in its relations with third countries apply equally to the Member States; recalls, therefore, that Parliament adopts an annual report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union, drawn up by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs; 29.

        "EU human rights policy tools Human rights country strategies and the role of EU Delegations 32. Commends the EEAS for its successful completion of the first cycle of human rights country strategies, which were developed with a strong emphasis on ownership at the EU Delegation level; considers regrettable, however, the continued lack of transparency regarding the content of the country strategies, in particular the failure properly to inform Parliament, and calls, once again, for the public disclosure of, at least, the key priorities of each country strategy, and for Parliament to have access to the strategies, in an appropriate setting, so as to allow a proper degree of scrutiny; encourages the EEAS to adopt indicators with which to evaluate their efficacy, and to treat the country sections of the Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World more explicitly as constituting implementation reports on the country strategies; recalls the EU\u2019s commitment to ensure that the human rights country strategies are taken into account at all levels of policymaking with third countries, including human rights and political dialogues; 33. Stresses the need for the EU Delegations to draft an annual report on their activities in the field of human rights; 34. Welcomes the nearly completed network of human rights focal points and liaison officers for human rights defenders in EU Delegations; calls on the VP/HR and the EEAS to develop clear operational guidelines as to their role in the Delegations so as to enable them to realise their full potential, to create credible standards and to avoid inconsistencies between EU Delegations; 35.

Reiterates its support for dedicated human rights dialogues as a tool of EU human rights policy, provided that they do not constitute an end in themselves, but are a means to secure specific commitments and achievements from the counterpart; recognises the value of engagement in human-rights-specific dialogue, in particular with countries with serious human rights problems; underlines, however, the need for the EU to draw clear political conclusions when the human rights dialogue does not lead to positive outcomes owing to the counterpart's lack of willingness to engage in good faith or lack of genuine commitment to reform, and to place emphasis on public diplomacy with a view to ensuring that the public credibility of the EU\u2019s human rights policy is not endangered; warns, furthermore, against diverting human rights discussions away from high-level political dialogues; insists that individual cases of human rights defenders who are at risk or in jail, and of political prisoners, be effectively raised by the EU in an accountable and transparent manner; calls, in the case of gross violations of human rights, for the issue to be placed at the core of political dialogue at all levels; C 316/150 EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.8.2016 Thursday 12 March 2015 ",

Urges the EEAS to develop a comprehensive review mechanism to help evaluate the dialogues in the light of their failure to achieve significant and tangible results; further urges the EU to strengthen its benchmarks with a view to helping to measure success and to make the dialogues more effective, which would contribute to bringing countries with serious human rights problems closer to international human rights standards; urges the EU, in the light, for example, of the failure of the EU-China human rights dialogue to achieve significant and tangible results, and of the recent developments in Hong Kong, to rethink its human rights strategy and to adopt a more coherent, unified and strategic approach to human rights; 40. Considers it regrettable that, owing to the variety of structures, formats, frequency and methods employed, and the confidential nature of these exchanges, there is no real mechanism for monitoring and reviewing such dialogues, and nor are there any progress indicators; recommends making the goals of each dialogue clear and reviewing the results in consultation with Parliament; 41. Urges the EEAS to continue to engage further with all the countries with which it currently has human rights dialogues in place by requesting concrete commitments from the respective authorities and regularly following up on the demands raised during consultations; EU Human Rights Guidelines 42.

Reiterates that the adoption of guidelines must not lead to the introduction of selectivity into the human rights system, as the principles of universality and indivisibility must remain central; calls on the Commission to define, in conjunction with Parliament and civil society representatives, the criteria for selecting the topics covered by such guidelines, so as to bring clarity to the selection process; 44. Calls on the Commission to complete the guidelines, which ought to set out objectives, criteria, means, timetables and indicators and include a regular review, by standardising their content and format and thereby making them clearer; recalls, in this respect, that Parliament recently recommended the \u2018effective and results-oriented\u2019 implementation of the guidelines on torture; 45.

Urges the EEAS and the Council to take appropriate action to implement and evaluate the EU guidelines at the country level; encourages the EEAS and the Member States also to engage in continued training and awareness-raising among EEAS and EU Delegation staff, and among Member State diplomats, so as to make sure that the EU Human Rights Guidelines have the intended effect in shaping actual policies on the ground; EU policies to support democratisation and elections 47. Stresses that democratic regimes are defined not only by the organisation of elections but also by respect for the rule of law, freedom of speech, respect for human rights, an independent judiciary and impartial administration; calls on the Commission and the EEAS to support ongoing democratic processes in third countries; emphasises, in this connection, the importance of following up on the reports and recommendations of election observation missions by using them as part of the EU's engagement in support of democracy with the country concerned and by mandating the chief observer to exercise a special role in follow-up monitoring of the implementation of the recommendations, as a coherent part of Parliament's comprehensive democracy support approach and with the support of Parliament's standing bodies; notes the positive role that can be played by EU election observation missions in ensuring the EU\u2019s credibility as a partner; 48. Calls for the EU to continue to work for the definition of best practices in this area in order to support and consolidate democratisation processes; encourages the development of both policy and operational tools to be applied in priority countries in order to integrate human rights and democracy support measures, including conflict prevention measures and mediation, into the EU approach in a coherent, flexible and credible manner; 30.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 316/151 Thursday 12 March 2015 ",

Considers that the performance-driven \u2018more for more\u2019 approach should guide the EU\u2019s relations with all third countries, that the EU should grant partner countries advanced status only if clear human rights and democracy requirements are met, and that it should not hesitate to freeze this status if those requirements are no longer fulfilled; 52. Calls for effective use of new technologies and the worldwide web to make information about human rights and democracy, as well as EU programmes, as accessible as possible to people all over the world; 53. Welcomes the pilot country work conducted so far by nine EU Delegations with a view to achieving increased coherence for democracy support in the EU\u2019s external relations, as initiated in the Council conclusions of 2009 and 2010 and as embedded in the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy in 2012; 54.

Stresses the importance of strengthening the role of women in promoting human rights and democratic reform, supporting conflict prevention and consolidating political participation and representation; also notes, in this connection, that the recommendations made in the reports of EU election observation missions concerning full and equal participation by women in the electoral process should be taken into account and acted upon; 57. Recalls that enlargement has been the EU's most successful democratisation effort and emphasises that negotiations with the Western Balkans remain the main instrument to help these countries establish fully fledged democratic societies; EU support for human rights defenders 58.

Calls for the EU to place a particular focus on the issue of jailed human rights defenders around the world and the need for the EU to collectively step up its action to secure the release of these individuals by, among other strategies, establishing a European Parliament internal working group that keeps itself up to date, through close collaboration with civil society, on cases of jailed activists worldwide; 61. Reiterates its call on the EEAS to continue to protect NGOs, human rights defenders, civil society activists, journalists and lawyers by enhancing the effectiveness of EU human rights dialogues and promoting EU thematic priorities and human rights guidelines; encourages, in this context, the organisation of campaigns aimed at reaching human rights defenders, including in the more remote areas of third countries, so as to help implement EU policy objectives; 62.

Stresses that, despite the progress already achieved as regards access to drinking water and sanitation, there are still approximately 2,6 billion people who lack a latrine and 1,1 billion people with no access to any type of drinking water; argues that this is due to a lack not only of resources but also of political will; calls, therefore, on governments to guarantee access to safe drinking water and sanitation, with particular attention to women and children; 209.

Emphasises the need for continued reflection regarding the most appropriate ways to maximise the credibility, visibility and effectiveness of Parliament\u2019s resolutions on breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law and the necessity of appropriate synchronisation between, and follow-up by, all the European institutions and by the European Endowment for Democracy; stresses, in particular, the need for institutional follow-up of issues raised in Parliament's urgency resolutions; C 316/170 EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.8.2016 Thursday 12 March 2015 ",
