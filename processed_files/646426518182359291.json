        "INTRODUCTION 1. The European Training Foundation (hereinafter \u2018the Foun\u00ad dation\u2019), located in Turin, was created by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1360/90 ( 1 ). The Foundation's purpose is to support the reform of vocational training in the European Union's partner countries. As such, it assists the Commission in the implementation of various programmes (Phare, Tacis, CARDS and MEDA) ( 2 ). 2. The Foundation\u2019s 2009 budget was 19,1 million euro, compared with 19,2 million euro the previous year. The number of staff employed by the Foundation at the end of the year was 123 as compared with 124 the previous year. STATEMENT OF ASSURANCE 3. Pursuant to the provisions of Article 287(1), second subparagraph of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union the Court has audited the annual accounts ( 3 ) of the Foundation, which comprise the \u2018financial statements\u2019 ( 4 ) and the \u2018reports on implementation of the budget\u2019 ( 5 ) for the financial year ended 31 December 2009 and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts. 4. This Statement of Assurance is addressed to the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with Article 185(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 ( 6 ). The Director\u2019s responsibility 5. As authorising officer, the Director implements the revenue and expenditure of the budget in accordance with the financial rules of the Foundation under her own respon\u00ad sibility and within the limits of authorised appropriations ( 7 ). The Director is responsible for putting in place ( 8 ) the organi\u00ad sational structure and the internal management and control systems and procedures relevant for drawing up final accounts ( 9 ) that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and for ensuring that the transactions underlying those accounts are legal and regular. The Court\u2019s responsibility 6. The Court\u2019s responsibility is to provide, on the basis of its audit, a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the annual accounts of the Foundation and the legality and regu\u00ad larity of the transactions underlying them. 7. The Court conducted its audit in accordance with the IFAC and ISSAI ( 10 ) International Auditing Standards and Codes of Ethics. Those standards require that the Court complies with ethical requirements and plans and performs the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the accounts are free from material misstatement and whether the underlying transactions are legal and regular. 8. The Court\u2019s audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the accounts and about the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying them. The procedures selected depend on its audit judgement including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the accounts or of illegal or irregular transactions, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments internal control relevant to the entity\u2019s preparation and presentation of accounts is considered in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. The Court\u2019s audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and, the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the accounts. 9. The Court believes that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for the opinions set out below.

        "Opinion on the reliability of the accounts 10. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the Foundation\u2019s Annual Accounts ( 11 ) present fairly, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2009 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its Financial Regulation. Opinion on the legality and the regularity of the trans\u00ad actions underlying the accounts 11. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Foundation for the financial year ended 31 December 2009 are, in all material respects, legal and regular. 12. The comments which follow do not call the Court\u2019s opinions into question. COMMENTS ON THE BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 13. The procedures for drawing up the budget were not sufficiently rigorous and led to a considerable number of budgetary transfers ( 12 ). Some of these transfers led to sucessive increases and decreases in the same budget headings ( 13 ). More than 0,7 million euro were transferred from Title I \u2014 Staff expenditure to Title III \u2014 Operational expenditure. This increased the amount carried forward to 2010 and reduced the amount to be repaid to the Commission. Contrary to the rules in force, the Governing Board was not requested to authorise the transfers when required ( 14 ). Moreover the budget presentation is not in line with the requirements of the Foundation\u2019s Financial Regulation ( 15 ). This Report was adopted by Chamber IV, headed by Mr Igors LUDBOR\u017dS, Member of the Court of Auditors, in Luxembourg at its meeting of 14 and 16 September 2010. For the Court of Auditors V\u00edtor Manuel da SILVA CALDEIRA President EN 14.12.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 338/151 ( 11 ) The Final Annual Accounts were drawn up on 14 June 2010 and received by the Court on 24 June 2010. The Final Annual Accounts, consolidated with those of the Commission, are published in the Official Journal of the European Union by 15 November of the following year. These can be found on the following website http://eca.europa.eu or http://www.etf.europa.eu/ Archive ( 12 ) 37 transfers of appropriations in 2009. ( 13 ) Budget heading 1 1 0 0 \u2014 salaries decreased and re-increased by no less than 9 decisions. ( 14 ) Two transfers from one Title to another exceeding 10 % of the appropriations for the year were not authorised by the Governing Board. ( 15 ) The budget shall show a summary statement of the schedule of payments due in subsequent financial years to meet budget commitments entered into in earlier financial years (Article 31(2) of the Foundation\u2019s Financial Regulation).

        "THE FOUNDATION\u2019S REPLIES 13. The Foundation 2009 budget planning and execution was affected by the delay in the revision of the Agency\u2019s legal base ( 1 ) and the last-minute suspension of a reserve of 2 million euro set by the European Parliament on Titles I and II of its budget. The Foundation enjoys a more stable perspective in 2010. It has already put in place tighter monitoring and control of budget transfers to limit the number of transfers and prepares measures to further enhance budget planning and forecasting for the 2011 financial year. The Foundation, in accordance with the Court\u2019s finding will follow a more strict interpretation of the Financial Regulation regarding the transfers. The Foundation will publish a payments schedule in accordance with Article 31(2)(c) of the Financial Regulation starting from the 2010 amending budget.
