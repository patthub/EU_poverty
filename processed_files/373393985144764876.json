The Presidency aims to reach a general approach on this proposal at the 18 December meeting of the TTE (Energy) Council. After the COREPER discussion on aspects relating to renewable energy on 27 October 1 , COREPER is now invited to address the entire draft Directive as reflected in the Annex, with a view to reaching agreement on it and submitting it to the TTE Council for acceptance as a general approach. 1 cf. doc. 7204/2/17 REV 2, which contains an overview of the reporting / iterative process and the indicative renewables trajectory. ",
        "7204/4/17 REV 4 AT/ns 2 DGE 2B EN On most of the key issues either a large degree of convergence has been achieved (for example on regional cooperation, the iterative process including the dates for submission of reports, and the Energy Union and Climate Change Committees), or a balanced compromise has been constructed (for example on the renewables trajectory and the gap filling mechanism). To facilitate the discussion on any remaining issues that delegations may wish to raise, the main issues are described below in the order in which they appear in the legislative text. 2. Main issues a) Early efforts The 'early efforts' definition in Art. 2(19) - defined as a Member State overshooting its 2020 or 2030 target - is used in the context of Member States' efforts in the area of renewable energy: early efforts may be considered when: - the Member States sets its national contribution (Art. 5(1)(d)(v)); - the Commission reacts to the draft NECPs (Art. 9(2)(a)); and - the Commission responds to insufficient ambition of those plans (Art. 27(1) and (2)) and to insufficient achievement (Art. 27(4)). The latest Presidency compromise specifies that a Member State's 'early achievement' of its 2020 target is also included (\"in or before 2020\"). b) Renewable energy and ambition + performance gaps Further to the COREPER discussion on 27 October, the levels of the two 'reference points' in 2023 and 2025 of the indicative Member State/Union trajectory were set (Art. 4(a)(2)(i) and Art. 25(2)), with some Member States arguing for higher or lower percentages. If the Union trajectory falls below these reference points, this triggers an obligation for additional measures by those Member States that had either insufficient ambition or that did not reach their own reference point(s) (Art.27(4)). ",
        "7204/4/17 REV 4 AT/ns 3 DGE 2B EN The same 'additional measures' must be taken by Member States in case they fall below the 'baseline' of their 2020 national target (Art. 27(4bis) 2 . One of the additional measures that Member States can choose from is the 'financial mechanism' in Art. 27(4), (4bis) and (4ter)), which the Commission should establish using implementing acts. A non-limitative list of 'relevant circumstances' may be used by a Member State in defining its planned national contribution for renewable energy (Art. 5(1)(d)), and the same elements may be used later by the Commission as a limitative list of 'objective criteria' to assess the level of ambition of an individual Member State in both the draft NECPs (Art. 9(2)(a)) and the final NECPs (Art. 27(1)), as well as in the context of a gap in the Union trajectory (Art. 27(4)); based upon that assessment, the Commission may subsequently address a non- quantitative recommendation to the Member State(s) concerned. Some Member States have requested more clarity on the methodology to be used by the Commission for the assessment based on these objective criteria. c) Reporting The main objectives and targets that must be included in Member States' NECPs are set out in Article 4, whilst the detailed provisions are in Annex I. For reasons of political visibility and balance of the five dimensions of the Energy Union, and because several delegations asked for having more double provisions in Article 4 and Annex I, each of these dimensions in Article 4 contains key provisions to be reported. It is recalled that also the biennial Progress Reports (Art. 15 - 22) contain similar reporting provisions to those already set out in Art. 4 and Annex I; thus, any relevant changes to Article 4 and/or Annex I should be duly reflected in these Articles. Several Member States request to have fewer reporting requirements, some request more. 2 Note: this 'baseline' provision refers to Art. 3(3) of the draft Directive on renewable energy, and - through that Article - to its Annex I containing the Member State's binding 2020 targets; the drafting in the Governance Regulation and the Renewables Directive should ensure that Member States are not subject to 'double punishment'. See also recitals 35bis and 35ter. ",
        "7204/4/17 REV 4 AT/ns 4 DGE 2B EN d) Interconnections Some Member States have requested strengthening the importance of the 2030 electricity interconnection target of at least 15% as set out in Art. 4(d), by proposing a mechanism that would ensure achievement of this target as well as calling for a link between a Member State's interconnection level and its obligations in the area of renewable energy. However, this was strongly opposed by some other Member States, which requested deletion or significant amendment of this provision as proposed by the Commission. As a result, the Presidency has seen no other balanced compromise option than maintaining the text of the Commission proposal. 3. COREPER is invited to discuss all outstanding issues raised by delegations and reach agreement on them, in preparation for the Council's upcoming agreement on the general approach. _______________________ p.m. Changes compared to the previous document (7204/3/17 REV 3) are indicated in bold underlined ; deletions are marked with [] or [ strikethrough ] .

        "7204/4/17 REV 4 AT/ns 6 DGE 2B EN (1) This Regulation sets out the necessary legislative foundation for a reliable and transparent Governance that ensures the achievement of the objectives and targets of the Energy Union through complementary, coherent and ambitious efforts by the Union and its Member States, while promoting the Union's Better Regulation principles. (2) The European Energy Union should cover five key dimensions: energy security; the internal energy market; energy efficiency; decarbonisation; and research, innovation and competitiveness. (3) The goal of a resilient Energy Union with an ambitious climate policy at its core is to give Union consumers, both households and businesses, secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy, which requires a fundamental transformation of Europe's energy system. This transformation of the energy system is also closely linked to the need to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment and to promote the prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources, notably through the promotion of energy efficiency and energy savings and the development of new and renewable forms of energy. That goal [ objective ] can only be achieved through coordinated action, combining both legislative and non-legislative acts at Union and national level. (4) The Commission's proposal was developed in parallel to and is adopted together with a series of initiatives in sectorial energy policy, notably with regard to renewable energy, energy efficiency and market design. Those initiatives form a package under the overarching theme of energy efficiency first, the Union\u2019s global leadership in renewables, and a fair deal for energy consumers. (5) The European Council agreed on 24 October 2014 on the 2030 Framework for Energy and Climate for the Union based on four key EU level targets: at least 40% cut in economy wide greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions, an indicative target of at least 27% improvement in energy efficiency , to be reviewed by 2020 with a view to a level of 30%, at least 27% for the share of renewable energy consumed in the Union, and at least 15% for electricity interconnection. It specified that the target for renewable energy is binding at Union level and that it will be fulfilled through Member States\u2019 contributions guided by the need to deliver collectively the Union target. ",
        "7204/4/17 REV 4 AT/ns 7 DGE 2B EN (6) The binding target of at least a 40% domestic reduction in economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 was formally approved as the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of the Union and its Member States to the Paris Agreement at the Environment Council meeting on 6 March 2015. The Paris Agreement was ratified by the Union on 5 October 2016 5 and entered into force on 4 November 2016. It replaces the approach taken under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol which will not be continued beyond 2020. Therefore the Union\u2019s system for monitoring and reporting emissions and removals should be updated in the light of this. (7) The European Council also concluded on 24 October 2014 6 that a reliable and transparent governance system, without any unnecessary administrative burden, should be developed to help ensure that the Union meets its energy policy goals, with the necessary flexibility for Member States and fully respecting their freedom to determine their energy mix. It emphasized that such governance system should build on existing building blocks, such as national climate programmes, national plans for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the need to streamline and bring together separate planning and reporting strands. It also agreed to step up the role and rights of consumers, transparency and predictability for investors, inter alia by systematic monitoring of key indicators for an affordable, safe, competitive, secure and sustainable energy system and to facilitate coordination of national energy policies and foster regional cooperation between Member States. (8) The Commission's Energy Union Strategy of 25 February 2015 states the need for an integrated Governance to make sure that energy-related actions at Union, regional, national and local level all contribute to the Energy Union's objectives, thereby broadening the scope of Governance \u2013 beyond the 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy \u2013 to all five key dimensions of the Energy Union. 5 Council Decision (EU) 2016/1841 of 5 October 2016 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (OJ L 282, 19.10.2016, p. 1). 6 Conclusions of the European Council 23 - 24 October 2014 (EUCO 169/14). ",
        "7204/4/17 REV 4 AT/ns 8 DGE 2B EN (9) In its Communication on the State of the Energy Union of 18 November 2015 7 the Commission further specified that integrated national energy and climate plans, addressing all five key dimensions of the Energy Union, are necessary tools for a more strategic energy and climate policy planning. As part of the State of the Energy Union, the Commission Guidance to Member States on integrated national energy and climate plans provided the basis for Member States to start developing national plans for the period 2021 to 2030 and set out the main pillars of the governance process. The State of the Energy Union also specified that the Governance should be anchored in legislation. (10) The Conclusions of the Council of 26 November 2015 8 recognised that the Governance of the Energy Union will be an essential tool for the efficient and effective construction of the Energy Union and the achievement of its objectives. They underlined that the governance system should be based on the principles of integration of strategic planning and reporting on the implementation of climate and energy policies and coordination between actors responsible for energy and climate policy, at Union, regional and national level. They also underlined that the Governance should ensure that the agreed energy and climate targets for 2030 are met; and that the Governance would monitor the Union\u2019s collective progress towards the achievement of the policy objectives across the five dimensions of the Energy Union. (11) The European Parliament's resolution \"Towards a European Energy Union\" of 15 December 2015 9 called for the Governance framework for the Energy Union to be ambitious, reliable, transparent, democratic and fully inclusive of the European Parliament and to ensure that the 2030 climate and energy targets are achieved. 7 Communication State of the Energy Union 2015 of 18.11.2015, COM(2015)572 final. 8 Conclusions of the Council of 26 November 2015 (14 459 /15). 9 European Parliament resolution of 15 December 2015 on \"Towards a European Energy Union\" (2015/2113(INI)). ",
        "7204/4/17 REV 4 AT/ns 9 DGE 2B EN (12) Therefore, the main objective of the Energy Union Governance should be to enable the achievement of the objectives of the Energy Union and in particular the targets of the 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy. These objectives and targets stem from the Union policy on energy and from the need to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment and to promote the prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources , as provided for under the EU Treaties. Neither of these indissociably linked objectives can be regarded as secondary to the other. This Regulation is therefore linked to sectorial legislation implementing the 2030 targets for energy and climate. While Member States need flexibility to choose policies that are best-matched to their national energy mix and preferences, that flexibility should be compatible with further market integration, increased competition, the attainment of climate and energy objectives and the gradual shift towards a low-carbon economy. (13) The transition to a low-carbon economy requires changes in investment behaviour and incentives across the entire policy spectrum. Achieving greenhouse gas emission reductions requires a boost to efficiency and innovation in the European economy and in particular should also lead to improvements of air quality. (14) As greenhouse gases and air pollutants largely derive from common sources, policy designed to reduce GHGs can have co-benefits for air quality that could offset some or all of the near-term costs of GHG mitigation. As data reported under Directive 2001/81/EC of the European Parliament and the Council 10 represent an important input for the compilation of the GHG inventory and the national plans, the importance of compilation and reporting of consistent data between Directive 2001/81/EC and the GHG inventory should be recognised. 10 Directive 2001/81/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on National Emission Ceilings for certain pollutants (OJ L 309, 27.11.2001, p. 22). ",
        "7204/4/17 REV 4 AT/ns 10 DGE 2B EN (15) The experience gained in implementing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council 11 indicated the need for synergies and coherence with reporting under other legal instruments, in particular with Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and the Council 12 , Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council 13 , Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008 of the European Parliament and the Council 14 and Regulation (EC) No 517/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council 15 . The use of consistent data to report greenhouse gas emissions is essential to ensuring the quality of emissions reporting. (16) In line with the Commission's strong commitment to Better Regulation, the Energy Union Governance should result in a significant reduction of administrative burden for the Member States, the Commission and other Union Institutions and it should help to ensure coherence and adequacy of policies and measures at Union and national level with regard to the transformation of the energy system towards a low-carbon economy. 11 Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and for reporting other information at national and Union level relevant to climate change and repealing Decision No 280/2004/EC (OJ L 165, 18.6.2013, p. 13). 12 Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32). 13 Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 January 2006 concerning the establishment of a European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (OJ L 33, 4.2.2006, p. 1). 14 Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 on energy statistics (OJ L 304, 14.11.2008, p. 1). 15 Regulation (EC) No 517/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases and repealing Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 (OJ L 150, 20.5.2014, p. 195). ",
        "7204/4/17 REV 4 AT/ns 11 DGE 2B EN (17) The achievement of the Energy Union objectives should be ensured through a combination of Union initiatives and coherent national policies set out in integrated national energy and climate plans. Sectorial Union legislation in the energy and climate fields sets out planning requirements, which have been useful tools to drive change at the national level. Their introduction at different moments in time has led to overlaps and insufficient consideration of synergies and interactions between policy areas. Current separate planning, reporting and monitoring in the climate and energy fields should therefore as far as possible be streamlined and integrated. (18) The integrated national energy and climate plans should cover ten-year periods and provide an overview of the current energy system and policy situation. They should set out national objectives for each of the five key dimensions of the Energy Union and corresponding policies and measures to meet those objectives and have an analytical basis. The national plans covering the first period from 2021 to 2030 should pay particular attention to the 2030 targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions, renewable energy, energy efficiency and electricity interconnection. Member States should aim to ensure that the national plans are consistent with and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. In setting out the national plans, Member States may build upon existing national strategies or plans. For the first draft national plan and national plan, a different deadline is provided as compared to subsequent plans, in order to provide Member States with adequate preparation time for their first plans after the adoption of this Regulation. Nevertheless, the Member States are encouraged to provide their first draft national plans as early as possible in 2018, in order to allow proper preparations, in particular for the facilitative dialogue to be convened under the Paris Agreement in 2018. (19) A mandatory template for the national plans should be established to ensure that all national plans are sufficiently comprehensive and to facilitate comparison and aggregation of national plans, while at the same time ensuring sufficient flexibility to Member States to set out the details of national plans reflecting national preferences and specificities. ",
        "7204/4/17 REV 4 AT/ns 12 DGE 2B EN (20) The implementation of policies and measures in the areas of the energy and climate has an impact on the environment. Member States should therefore ensure that the public is given early and effective opportunities to participate in and to be consulted on the preparation of the integrated national energy and climate plans in accordance, where applicable, with the provisions of Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 16 and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (\"UNECE\") Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters of 25 June 1998 (the \"Aarhus convention\"). Member States should also ensure involvement of social partners in the preparation of the integrated national energy and climate plans. (21) Regional cooperation is key to ensure an effective achievement of the objectives of the Energy Union. Member States should get the opportunity to comment on other Member States' plans before they are finalised to avoid inconsistencies and potential negative impacts on other Member States and ensure that common objectives are met collectively. Regional cooperation in elaborating and finalising national plans as well as in the subsequent implementation of national plans should be essential to improve effectiveness and efficiency of measures and foster market integration and energy security. (22) National plans should be stable to ensure transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investor certainty. Updates of national plans should however be foreseen once during the ten-year period covered to give Member States the opportunity to adapt to significant changing circumstances. For the plans covering the period from 2021 to 2030, Member States should be able to update their plans by 30 June [ ] 2024. Targets, objectives and contributions should only be modified to reflect an increased overall ambition in particular as regards the 2030 targets for energy and climate. As part of the updates, Member States should make efforts to mitigate any adverse environmental impacts that become apparent as part of the integrated reporting. 16 Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (OJ L 197, 21.7.2001, p.30). ",
        "7204/4/17 REV 4 AT/ns 13 DGE 2B EN (23) Stable long-term low emission strategies are crucial to contribute towards economic transformation, jobs, growth and the achievement of broader sustainable development goals, as well as to move in a fair and cost-effective manner towards the long-term goal set by the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, Parties to the Paris Agreement are invited to communicate, by 2020, their mid-century, long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies. (24) As is the case for planning, sectorial Union legislation in the energy and climate fields sets out reporting requirements, many of which have been useful tools to drive change at the national level, but those requirements have been introduced at different moments in time which has led to overlaps and insufficient consideration of synergies and interactions between policy areas such as GHG mitigation, renewable energy, energy efficiency and market integration. To strike the right balance between the need to ensure a proper follow-up of the implementation of national plans and the need to reduce administrative burden, Member States should establish biennial progress reports on the implementation of the plans and other developments in the energy system. Some reporting however, particularly with regard to reporting requirements in the climate field stemming from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (\"UNFCCC\") and Union Regulations, would still be necessary on a yearly basis. (25) Member States' integrated progress reports should mirror the elements set out in the template for the national plans. A template for the integrated progress reports should be detailed in subsequent implementing act(s) given their technical nature and the fact that the first progress reports are due in 202 3 . The progress reports should be carried out in order to ensure transparency towards the Union, other Member States and market actors including consumers. They should be comprehensive across the five dimensions of the Energy Union and, for the first period, at the same time put emphasis on areas covered by the targets of the 2030 Climate and Energy Framework. ",
        "7204/4/17 REV 4 AT/ns 14 DGE 2B EN (26) Under the UNFCCC, the Union and its Member States are required to develop, regularly update, publish and report to the Conference of the Parties national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases using comparable methodologies agreed by the Conference of the Parties. The GHG inventories are key to enabling the tracking of progress with the implementation of the decarbonisation dimension and for assessing compliance with the legislation in the field of climate, in particular Regulation [OP: act number XXX on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 for a resilient Energy Union and to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and other information relevant to climate change] 17 (\"Regulation [ ] [ESR]\") and Regulation [OP: act number XXX on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry into the 2030 climate and energy framework and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and other information relevant to climate change] (\"Regulation [ ] [LULUCF]\") 18 . (27) Decision 1/CP.16 of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC requires the establishment of national arrangements to estimate anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases. This Regulation should enable the establishment of those national arrangements. 17 OJ L [\u2026], [\u2026], p. [\u2026]. 18 OJ L [\u2026], [\u2026], p. [\u2026]. ",
        "7204/4/17 REV 4 AT/ns 15 DGE 2B EN (28) The experience in the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 demonstrated the importance of transparency, accuracy, consistency, completeness and comparability of information. Building on that experience, this Regulation should ensure that Member States report on their policies and measures and projections as a key component of the progress reports. The information in those reports should be essential for demonstrating the timely implementation of commitments under Regulation [ ] [ESR]. Operating and continuously improving systems at Union and Member State level coupled with better guidance on reporting should significantly contribute towards an on-going strengthening of the information necessary in order to track progress in the decarbonisation dimension. (29) This Regulation should ensure reporting by Member States on adaptation to climate change and the provision of financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing countries, thereby facilitating the implementation of the Union's commitments under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement. Furthermore, information on national adaptation actions and support is also important in the context of the integrated national energy and climate plans, especially as regards adaptation to those adverse effects of climate change related to the security of the Union's energy supply such as the availability of cooling water for power plants and biomass availability for energy, and information on support relevant to the external dimension of the Energy Union. (30) In order to limit administrative burden on Member States and the Commission, the latter should establish an online reporting platform to facilitate communication and promote cooperation. That should facilitate [] timely submission of reports as well as [] improved transparency on national reporting. The e-reporting platform should complement, build on and benefit from existing reporting processes, databases and e-tools, such as those of the European Environment Agency, Eurostat, the Joint Research Centre and the lessons learned from the Union's Eco-Management and Audit Scheme. ",
        "7204/4/17 REV 4 AT/ns 16 DGE 2B EN (31) As concerns data to be provided to the Commission by means of national planning and reporting, information from Member States should not duplicate data and statistics which have already been made available via Eurostat in the context of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council 19 in the same form as under the planning and reporting obligations of this Regulation and are still available from Eurostat with the same values. Where available and appropriate in terms of timing, reported data and projections provided in the national energy and climate plans should build on and be consistent with Eurostat data and the methodology used for reporting European statistics in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 223/2009. (32) In view of the collective achievement of the objectives of the Energy Union Strategy, it will be essential for the Commission to assess national plans and, based on progress reports, their implementation. For the first ten-year period, this concerns in particular the achievement of the Union-level 2030 targets for energy and climate and national contributions to those targets. Such assessment should be undertaken on a biennial basis, and on an annual basis only where necessary, and should be consolidated in the Commission's State of the Energy Union reports. (33) Aviation has impacts on the global climate as a result of the release of CO 2 as well as of other emissions, including nitrogen oxides emissions, and mechanisms, such as cirrus cloud enhancement. In the light of the rapidly developing scientific understanding of those impacts, an updated assessment of the non-CO 2 impacts of aviation on the global climate is already foreseen in Regulation (EU) No 525/2013. The modelling used in this respect should be adapted to scientific progress. Based on its assessments of such impacts, the Commission could consider relevant policy options for addressing them. 19 Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics and repealing Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1101/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical Office of the European Communities, Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 on Community Statistics, and Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities (OJ L 87, 31.3.2009, p. 164) .

        "7204/4/17 REV 4 AT/ns 17 DGE 2B EN (34) To help ensure coherence between national and Union policies and objectives of the Energy Union, there should be an on-going dialogue between the Commission and the Member States. As appropriate, the Commission should issue recommendations to Member States including on the level of ambition of the draft national plans, on the subsequent implementation of policies and measures of the notified national plans, and on other national policies and measures of relevance for the implementation of the Energy Union. Whereas recommendations have no binding force, as set out in Article 288 of the TFEU, Member States should nevertheless take due [ ] account of such recommendations and explain in subsequent progress reports how this has been done [ ] . With regard to renewable energy the Commission assessment shall be based on the objective critera, the Commission recommendations should remain of non-qualitative in nature and not include quantitative levels of national ambition for the year 2030 . If the Commission issues a recommendation on a Member State's draft national plan, it should do so as quickly as possible, having regard to, on the one hand, the need for the Commission to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess ambition at Union level, and on the other hand, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its national plan, and the need to avoid the risk of delay of the Member State's national plan. (34bis) Cost-effective deployment of renewable energy is an essential and primary parameter for assessing objective criteria. The cost structure of deploying renewable energy is complex and varies significantly between Member States. It includes not only simply the costs of support schemes, but, inter alia, the connection costs of installations, system backup, providing system security and costs that need to be borne when complying with environmental restrictions. Thus when comparing Member States based on this criterion, all costs related to deployment, whether they are borne by the Member State, final consumers or project developers, should be accounted for.

Should progress made by the Union towards these objectives and targets be insufficient for their delivery, the Commission should, in addition to issuing recommendations, [ ] propose measures and make use of relevant empowerments at Union level or Member States should take additional measures in order to ensure achievement of these objectives and targets (thereby closing any 'delivery gap'). Such measures should take into account early ambitious contributions made by Member States to the 2030 target [ ] for [ ] energy efficiency when sharing the effort for collective target achievement. Such measures should also take into account early efforts made by Member States to the 2030 target for renewable energy by reaching in 2020 a share of energy from renewable sources above its binding target or by making early progress in the implementation of its contribution to the Union's binding target of at least 27% of renewable energy in 2030. In the area of renewable energy, such measures can also include voluntary financial contributions by Member States to a financing platform managed by the Commission, which would be used to contribute to the most cost-efficient renewable energy projects across the Union , thus providing the Member State with the option to contribute to the EU target achievement at the lowest possible cost .

In addition, they should constitute for this period a mandatory baseline share that forms equally part of [recast of Directive 2009/28/EC as proposed by COM(2016) 767]. Consequently, in this period the share of energy from renewable sources in each Member State's gross final consumption of energy should not be lower than its baseline share. (35ter) If a Member State does not maintain its baseline share as measured over a one-year period, it should, within one year, take additional measures to cover this gap to its baseline scenario. Where a Member State has effectively taken such necessary measures and fulfilled its obligation to cover the gap, it should be deemed to comply with the mandatory requirements of its base-line scenario as from the moment in time when the gap in question occurred and both under this Regulation and under [recast of Directive 2009/28/EC as proposed by COM(2016) 767].
