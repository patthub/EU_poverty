        "1 PREFACE The European Union is implementing challenging commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8% in accord with the Kyoto protocol, and has established ambitious targets for renewable energies and energy end-use efficiency in its White Paper: Energy for the Future: Renewable Sources of Energy. In the past decade, renewable energy technologies have made significant progress in terms of performance, cost and reliability, thanks to vigorous research, development, demonstration and market introduction programmes at European, national and also regional level. Developments primarily rooted in environmental concerns are now penetrating all societal decision making and have led to a new, dynamic, and exponentially growing industry. Three major drivers are determining today\u2019s socio-economic framework for the impressive renewables\u2019 industrial and market developments. First, successful application of legally binding feed-in tariffs; secondly, liberalisation of the electricity market, and thus new possibilities for decentralisation of power generation. Third, and in the medium term, there is the undisputed need for massive re-powering the larger part of Europe\u2019s generation capacity. This will incur generally higher electricity costs, which reflect somewhat better the real costs (incl. externalities) of all the different energy technologies. Thus a more favourable market situation for sustainable technology choices will evolve, e.g. for massive renewable power generation. While technology development has been a key driver in the progress of renewables, first examples of significant penetration would have been impossible without appropriate, supporting policies including instruments such as introduction targets, carbon taxes, elimination of non-technical barriers, internalisation of external costs of energy, and harmonisation of market rules. The efficient end-use of energy is a parallel area where modern technology, policies, better public conscience of the issues and market forces, like the utilities\u2019 interest to exploit the potentials for avoidance of new transmission and generation capacity, have combined to achieve significant results. New integrated marketing concepts, like energy service companies, have been very successful lately, and organisationally break ground for the implementation of sharper physical efficiency concepts as well. This is of particular strategic importance for the New Member States of the EU, as the use of energy, including electricity, in these countries is still significantly less efficient than in the old Member States. The aim of this Status Report is to provide relevant, validated and independent information on renewable energy and the efficient end-use of electricity to decision makers and the public.

        "5 Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION Arnulf J\u00e4ger-Waldau The European Union's dependency on energy imports has increased from 40 % of gross consumption in the 1980s to 56 % in 2005 and this trend is accelerating [EST 2006]. The European Commission\u2019s Green Paper \"A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy\" states: Unless we can make domestic energy more competitive, in the next 20 to 30 years around 70 % of the Union\u2019s energy requirements, compared to 50% today, will be met by imported products \u2013 some from regions threatened by insecurity [EC 2006] . Record oil prices and speculations whether the oil price would peak at $ 105 in 2010, or whether it would be well above, has become a reality. This development has shifted the focus to a more abundant fossil energy resource, i.e. coal. In addition, the Gas Crisis at the beginning of 2006 has demonstrated that Europe is highly vulnerable with respect to its total energy supply. A possible solution is the diversification of supply countries as well as the diversification of energy sources, including renewable energies and a nuclear option. However, diversification of supply countries is not an easy task, as reserves are concentrated in just a few countries. The Green Paper quotes [EC 2006]: Today, roughly half of the EU\u2019s gas consumption comes from only three countries (Russia, Norway, Algeria). On current trends, gas imports would increase to 80 % over the next 25 years. The development of sustained economic growth all over the world, and notably in the so-called \u201cBRIC\u201d (Brazil, Russia, India and China) as well as the global need for rural development, will increase the total energy demand even further, potentially provoking evermore greenhouse gas emissions. CO 2 emissions from developing countries will exceed those of the IEA member states by 2010. In addition, World CO 2 emissions will increase by 1.8% per year to reach 38 billion tonnes in 2030. Therefore, ambitious reduction targets need to de addressed immediately . As 94% of man-made CO 2 emissions in Europe are attributed to the energy sector [EEA 2004], this presents unique research challenges and industrial opportunities for the global energy community. Global oil consumption has increased by 20% since 1994, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) assumes that global oil demand will grow by 1.6 % per year. However, the current actual growth rates in oil consumption are much larger. Instead of a 2.2 % increase, as predicted by the IEA, the 2004 world crude demand grew by 3.4%, the strongest pace in nearly 30 years and over three times the average growth rates of the last 25 years. The high oil prices and mild winters helped to reduce the growth rates in 2005 and 2006 to 1.3 and 1.2 % respectively [IEA 2006]. Most of the growth now comes from non OECD countries and China's growth rates were in average 7 to 8% for the period of 2000 to 2006. Yet, per capita oil consumption in China, which is already the world\u2019s second largest importer of crude, is still in its infancy. Environmental concerns are shared by a majority of the EU public nowadays. This adds to the list of weaknesses of fossil fuels and the safety worries over nuclear power, including its fuel system. These concerns include individual and societal ",
        "6 damage already caused and potentially to be expected by our current energy supply system, whether such damage is of accidental origin (oil slicks, pit disasters, nuclear accidents, methane leaks), premeditated actions (terrorist attacks, illegal waste disposal, etc.) or connected to normal emission of pollutants. At the same time, the need to stabilise atmospheric greenhouse gases in the 450 to 550 ppmv range leads to the necessity to decarbonise our energy supply. The crucial question which arises is: What are the technology options to realise such a shift? Renewable energies are a possible solution, but their current share of the global and European energy supply is still small and will require a continuation of their current high growth rates over the next two to three decades in order to reach a 40 to 50% share. However, such ambitious targets can only be reached, when at the same time the energy efficiency is increased. In the case of electricity end-use efficiency, every kWh of demand reduction corresponds to approximately 3 kWh of primary energy savings, as the average energy conversion efficiency for solid and liquid fuels to electricity is only 33%. What are the energy challenges we are facing? \u2022 Sustainability : De-coupling of economic growth from depletion of resources and global warming. \u2022 Security of Supply : Ensuring long term availability of energy sources. \u2022 Safety of the Energy Chain : Accidents, political stability, import dependence, public security \u2022 Growing Demand in Developing Countries : 2000 million people have not even basic electricity service. An electricity distribution grid outside of large cities will never be economically viable. This leads to the question what are the possible options to face these challenges. The answer leaves us with very few options to decrease the energy intensity and, as this is not enough, to increase the Union\u2019s indigenous energy supply. \u2022 Decrease Energy Intensity 1 (Mtoe/GNP) i) Increase Efficiency of Energy End-use (Domestic, Industry, Transport) ii) Increase Efficiency of Electricity Generation \u2022 Increase [indigenous] Supply i) New and Renewable Energies ii) Examine Nuclear Option The decrease of energy intensity by increasing energy end-use efficiency are important and cost effective ways to reduce GHG emissions, but energy efficiency alone cannot solve the problem, as our energy consumption structure \u2013 including heating, cooling, transport and electricity use \u2013 is a consequence of our lifestyle. Furthermore, the public in the industrialised countries is split over the issue of nuclear energy use. Therefore, the future of nuclear energy is uncertain, particularly in Europe. It depends on several factors, including a solution to the problems of 1 Energy Intensity is defined as energy units consumed per unit of gross national product produced ",
        "7 managing and stocking nuclear waste, the economic viability of the new generation of power stations, the safety of reactors in Eastern Europe, in particular the New Member States, and the global fight against nuclear proliferation. Renewable Energies are not facing these safety and security concerns and the European Union has abundant resources. Electricity from large and small-scale hydro, wind power and biomass are already a market reality, but is has to be noted that the future growth rates for hydro are rather limited, as the majority of resources are already tapped. Geothermal electricity is limited by its characteristics of local resources and reservoirs and within the European Union only Italy is utilising this at a larger scale at present. Photovoltaics is already the most cost effective solution for a large number of off-grid applications. The high growth rates of more than 40% for Photovoltaics in on-grid applications over the last few years already led to substantial cost reductions and this trend is expected to continue. Solar thermal electricity is in the phase to demonstrate its potential on an operational scale of 100 MW and more. Tidal as well as wave power need further research and development before they can be commercialised and add their contributions to a renewable electricity production. However, regardless of the type of renewable energy source there are obstacles of a structural nature to their implementation. The current economic and social system is based on centralised conventional sources of energy (coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear energy) and their distribution system. Due to the fact that the New Member States still have a higher final energy intensity (average ~ 670 toe/1000 \u20ac) compared to EU-15 (average ~188 toe/1000 \u20ac) [EST 2006a] there is a need to modernise the power mix and generally the electricity generation and distribution system. This can now be taken as a chance to integrate decentralised and renewable electricity generation capacities. However, the latter is also true for the whole European Union. According to the International Energy Agency\u2019s World Energy Investment Outlook 2003, the OECD countries will have to spend approx. US$ 4,000 b or US$ 133.3 b per year by 2030, in order to maintain and expand their electricity grid and power production capacities [IEA 2003]. The EU25, with 18.2% of the total world-wide electricity consumption (and a 29.9% share within the OECD), will have an investment need of almost US$ 39.8 b per year. About half of the costs are for new and refurbished power generation capacities and the other half is for transmission and distribution costs. Distributed generation like renewable energies can help to reduce investment in transmission costs. Due to the long life time of power plants (30 to 50 years), the decisions taken now will influence the socio-economic and ecological key factors of our energy system in 2020 and beyond. In addition, the IEA study points out that fuel costs \u2013 even under the moderate 2003 price assumptions \u2013 will be in the same order of magnitude as investment in infrastructure, increasing the scale of the challenge, especially for developing countries. The second main barrier is of financial nature. Renewable Energies need significant initial investment, as was the case for the other energy sources, such as coal, oil and nuclear energy. It should not be forgotten that most of these investments were either made by public companies or secured by public credit guarantees. The European Environment Agency reported that the total energy subsidies in the European Union (EU15) were more than \u20ac 29 billion in 2001 [EEA 2004a]. About 18% or \u20ac 5.3b were given to renewable energies, whereas the rest went to coal, oil, gas and nuclear. These figures are without external costs and for nuclear exclude the cost of not having to pay for full-liability insurance cover. In addition, the fact that some of Europe\u2019s nuclear companies are still state-owned or controlled, and arising liabilities have eventually to ",
        "8 be covered or are currently being covered by the taxpayers, are not taken into account as well. Therefore, the renewable energy market in the European Union cannot be expected to develop regularly without a support policy in the medium term on the part of the public authorities. Support measures stretch from direct subsidies in favour of renewable energy sources or the obligation on the part of electricity producers and utilities to purchase a minimum percentage of electricity produced from renewable sources of energy through to aid to research or financing mechanisms (interest subsidies, guarantee funds, excises or parafiscal tax on other sources of energy). The implementation of renewable energies into our energy supply and the substantial investments needed to do so, call for an integrated approach to utilise the different technologies and resources available as well as energy savings to minimise demand. No energy source alone can supply the future needs of mankind and even our conventional energy sources face the problem of fluctuating generation capacities. However, we have to bear in mind, that not any alternative energy system will be available when we need it in the coming decades, unless we start to change things now. ",
        "9 Chapter 2 ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES Sandor Szabo This chapter aims to give a systematic description of the status of renewable energy sources (RES) and technologies within the electricity system from an economic point of view. It strives for an exploratory assessment of the RES electricity and contains the most recent information and some cost projections on developments in the near future (up to 2010). At the beginning, the mainstream economic approaches on the determination of the production level will be introduced. One major conclusion of this economic theory part reveals that the size of the incumbent operators and the market concentration are at least as important from the reserve requirement point of view as the variability of certain technologies on the reserve requirement. Therefore, the additional reserve requirement most often requested for variable sources, i.e. renewable energies, is strongly debatable. The introduction of the relevant economic approaches is followed by an economic-strategic assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of three renewable energy technologies: Photovoltaics (PV), wind generation and biomass based electricity technologies. Finally the market trends are evaluated by the changes of their position in the electricity generation portfolio in the last decade, measured in the two dimensions of market shares and market growth. This latter analysis makes it possible to evaluate whether the current trends verify the statement of the strategic assessment. 2.1 Microeconomic Approach The determination of the production level in the microeconomic theory relies on the marginal costs (MC) of the different producers. In a competitive market, where the firms are price takers (the firm cannot change the market price by changing its output, because its share is negligible in the overall supply) the optimal level of output is determined where the firm's marginal cost becomes equal with the marginal revenue (the unit price). This is at the output level Q 1 . This guarantees allocative efficiency on the market since at this point the firm operates at its lowest average cost level. There are numerous companies on the market and their equilibrium output is determined by their marginal cost function. If companies can lower their marginal cost (because of technological development etc.) the market changes to a new equilibrium: at a lower price level bigger quantities are sold on the market. (see P 2 -Q 2 in Fig. 2.1). In the electricity power markets the equilibrium presented in Fig. 2.1 is not always attainable due to three main reasons: \u2022 Since the storage of electricity is expensive, the supply has to meet continuously the instantaneously changing demand. Therefore, the equilibrium output is always changing relative to the demand and to the output level of other producers, which in turn changes the firm's optimal output level. ",
        "10 \u2022 To achieve the above mentioned production level, the market has to be freely accessible (or at least at low transaction cost, i.e. no barriers to enter and depart). Contrary to this condition, the power generation has been characterised by sunk costs . Sunk costs mean that once the investment was made in power production facilities it is impossible or entails huge costs to transform the investment to other uses. Though this has been diminished by the emerging technologies that can be utilised efficiently at a small scale. \u2022 The power generation and distribution has always been characterised by certain levels of monopolies. The generation side is now in a transformation phase to a more competitive market, but the transmission part is still considered a natural monopoly . Natural monopolies are cases where due to physical reasons it is cheaper to have only one operator or infrastructure than competing ones; e.g. bridges, tunnels and until most recently grid systems. However, the development in the telecommunication sector shows that line infrastructures which were formerly considered a natural monopoly can be operated with competition. AC average cost : all the costs to the firm divided by the quantity of products. MC marginal cost : all the costs that can be attached to the increase of one additional unit of production. MR marginal revenue : the revenue from one additional unit of product sold. D Demand function : the competitive market buy huge quantities at the given price level compared to the output of one firm, therefore it is vertical and equals with the unit price. Fig. 2.1: Determination of the optimal power-output level in a competitive market The optimal production level for a monopolistic market is determined in a very different way. When a company has an impact not only on the output, but on the price level by changing the production level, the company will \u2013 following profit maximising criteria \u2013 produce less at a higher price (compare q m to q c and p m and p c where \"m\" stands for monopoly indicated by the red colour, and \"c\" for competitive market in Fig. 2.2). This behaviour means a departure from the allocative efficiency described in the previous paragraph. It entails not only the transformation of the consumer surplus to D = MR = P \u20ac/ MWh AC 1 MC 1 MWh P 1 Q 1 Q 2 AC 2 MC 2 P 2 ",

Despite the fact that this simplification entails some loss in the accuracy, it is a useful tool to determine the merit order of the different power generation technologies. The break even point is the output level where the production becomes profitable. This break even point is usually much greater for technologies characterised with high fixed cost (high up front cost) and with smaller variable costs (see Q 2 in Fig. 2.3) than for technologies with small investment costs but higher variable costs Q 1. Electricity generation from wind, solar and nuclear power are usually classified as power generation technologies characterised by high fixed and low variable cost, while the different gas-fuelled generation technologies are classified as low fixed costs but high operational cost types. However, the dynamics of the cost structure shows a departure from this conventional classification. Two simultaneous changes are present in the power generation asset and production markets. First, technological development leads to a gradual but continuous decrease of the still relatively high ",
        "12 investment costs for emerging technologies. Second, the discrepancy between the level of variable costs increases further between the technologies. This latter is caused by the more stringent environmental regulation, resource access problems and structural scarcities. Explanations: Break even point : The output level above which the given technology starts to produce a profit Fixed costs : The costs that are independent from the production level (they have to be paid even without production) Variable costs : The cost that changes with the production level proportionally Revenue : Unit of production sold multiplied by the unit price Loss minimisation : When the investment is made, and the product cannot be sold above the total cost, it is still worth producing if its price exceeds the variable cost, because the part of the investment can be recovered. Fig. 2.3: Determination of the break-even point The following two figures illustrate this development. Despite the fact that the cost/MWh calculations include a number of assumptions, i.e. average utilisation hours, international trade, distribution of reserve capacity costs, long-term contracts etc., the European average figures give a good estimate on the merit order. The 2010 solar and wind investment cost figures are based on business releases [Dga 2006, Ewe 2006], the base load and peak load prices are from exchange market on line information [Eex 2006, Mer 2006]. Figures 2.4 and 2.5 give a good insight into the cost structure of the different technologies relative to each other, and the changes in the merit order. However, in order to get a supply function the available electricity generation capacities for these technologies have to be included in the analysis. Figure 2.6 in the following sub-chapter uses the supply function when all the existing power capacities are available, as well as the three transformed supply functions for the case when some of the capacities are lost. Using these supply functions, the price fluctuations observed on the electricity spot markets (most recently in July 2006) will be partially explained.

        "14 2.3 Merit Order, Availability and Price Fluctuation on the Electricity Market One of the most often cited explanations why the share of the renewable energy sources should be kept to a limited share in the electricity generation portfolio is that they undermine system reliability causeing huge price fluctuation because of limited availability. That is where the stricter reserve requirement for RES comes in: in order to keep the system reliability at a predefined level, additional RES (mostly wind and solar) capacities have to cover the additional reserves when their production is down. The further expanded theory gives some insight of how these reserve requirements work in practice. The following figure explains the effect of capacity shortage on price fluctuations observed mainly at peak hours (see the latest data of July 2006 German and Italian day-ahead market price [Eex 2006, Mer 2006]). However, the price development also shows that the price fluctuations are already present on existing electricity markets, i.e. those without high RES portfolios. Certain weather conditions, like heat waves or long lasting droughts, can lead to effects like water reservoir shortages and non availability of hydro-peak power or cooling water shortage for thermo-power plants. These effects already cause capacity shortages that can only be covered from more expensive sources (see the rising arrows on the diagram). base load price full capacity hydro shortage wind shortage nuclear shortage peak load price 0,00 20,00 40,00 60,00 80,00 100,00 120,00 \u20ac / M W h 600 GW A va il a b il t y Fig. 2.6: Shortages and price fluctuation For base load electricity the price fluctuations are low because there is still a large amount of capacities available to substitute the absent capacities (see point B in the diagram). However, in peak hours the magnitude of price volatility can be much more pronounced (see point A). The missing capacities of cheaper options lead to the use of the more expensive entries in the merit order. As an example we assume a water shortage, which causes a B A ",
        "15 60 % shortfall of the available hydro capacities as well as a 10 % decrease in nuclear energy (due to cooling water shortage) and an additional absence of wind energy can cause huge cost increases (see in Fig. 2.5 the difference between the highest and lowest red arrows, i..e. approx. 50 \u20ac/MWh) . These assumptions are not theoretical, but very close to the actual situation in the summer of 2006. However, the wind power shortage causes the smallest price-effects out of these shortages. In fact the size of the incumbent operators is at least as important from the reserve requirement point of view as the variability of certain technologies. Therefore, the additional reserve requirement most often requested for variable sources is strongly debatable. The magnitude of the price fluctuation cannot be explained by the more extensive use of the expensive power generation sources in the case of capacity shortfalls. However, the dominant part of the price increase can be explained by the opportunistic behaviour of dominant players on the market. When some of the electricity producers are out of the market because of operational or resource problems the power shortages give the remaining generators the possibility to increase the price in the bidding process because of the lack of competitors to keep the price down by their cheaper offers. Therefore, more market participants, smaller market shares of the incumbent operators, stricter bidding rules play at least such an important part in the system reliability as the limited share of capacities with variable output. Output forecast, and changing system operation techniques also play important roles. These factors will be taken into account in the strategic analysis. After the description of the possible treatment of the renewable sources within the overall electricity production by the instrument of the mainstream economic theories, it is important to look at a strategic analysis on the renewable energy sources and their technologies. 2.4 The Strategic Assessment: SWOT Analysis There are many available approaches for a strategic economic assessment of electricity from renewable sources. It can take the form of financial or cost benefit analysis, impact pathway analysis (dose-response), analysis of external costs, analysis of strategic behaviour, etc. All these more sophisticated methods extend the scope of the mainstream economic analyses further. Besides the institutional and behavioural aspects, certain levels of environmental-social functions are integrated into the efficiency criteria (cost minimisation, resource optimisation). There are advantages and disadvantages for all types of approaches considered. The selection of one of these methods is giving emphasis to certain aspects of the product while neglecting others. The product oriented approach is justified on the following basis. While the services provided by the electricity are uniform \u2013 that is why for a long time the source of electricity was indifferent from an economic point of view, until the externality theory appeared \u2013 the effects of the different fuel sources are very different. The strength of a SWOT analysis (the name is the abbreviation of the keywords: Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats ) comes from its wide-ranging strategic scope. Such an anlysis tries to classify all aspects associated with the product market into four categories. The factors that uniformly favour or disfavour all technologies are omitted (i.e. green certificate systems, carbon value). It leaves policymakers and other stakeholders to weigh according to their experience. ",

On this basis the so called \" Boston Matrix \"can be composed (Fig. 2.8). The Boston Matrix analyses the opportunities of a product based on market growth and market shares of all competing products in the given market. The names of the four sections of the matrix are self-explanatory, however, some further description may be useful. In the \"Cash Cow\" quadrant power production technologies can be found that have a well established market share, however they cannot increase it significantly. The ruling strategy of these players is to realise the profit margins without huge investment and without further huge R&D spending. However some fundamental modification can change the position of these technologies and then they can progress to the \"Star\" position. Technologies in the \"Star\" quadrant attract new investors: besides the established market share investments are attracted by the promising growth rates. For those technologies in the \"Dog\" quadrant it is the opposite. For them it is hardly possible to find new financing for these products/production lines, and existing owners as well try to minimise losses and risk by selling their assets. The \"Question Marks\" quadrant is the most ambiguous of all the four. A strict selection process decides which pathways these technologies follow: a strong market penetration or disappearance (represented by the two arrows in the diagram). The ",

That is why the venture capital funds invest in these products/technologies first: while the portfolio is riskier it offers higher than average returns. Fig. 2.8: Boston-Matrix of the different power technologies The Boston matrix suggests that among the RES electricity sources wind generation is on the very edge of substantial market penetration, the PV demonstrates unprecedented growths while the other technologies are still in the embryonic phase. 2.6 Conclusions The determination of the optimal RES portfolio within the overall electricity generation system is a very complex task. The shape of the load curve, the cost structure of the generation units, their adjustability and their economies of scale as well as the market concentration play an important role in it. It is also a dynamic system and the system operation also has a major influence on these input factors themselves (i.e. more investment in certain production unit may decrease its capital costs, which in turn justifies higher share in the portfolio). The introduction on economic approaches highlighted the most relevant aspects of the determination of the production level for the different portfolio elements. One major conclusions of this economic theory part is the RES sources could already have much higher share in the production portfolio if in the present market concentration the incumbent generators would not be able to exercise their market power to block new entries in the market. It also points out that the size of the incumbent operators and the market concentration are at least as important from the reserve requirement point of view as the variability of certain technologies on the reserve requirement. Therefore, the additional reserve requirements which are most often requested for variable sources is strongly debatable.

        "22 More market participants, smaller market shares of the incumbent operators, stricter bidding rules play at least as important part in the system reliability as the limited share of capacities with variable output. The aim of the SWOT analysis was on one hand to identify those strategic segments of the market where the renewable sources can further enhance their advantages to increase their market share by achieve synergies, and on the other hand to find the vulnerable components that have to be supplemented by designing new policies, instruments or requires additional lobbying. The market strategy has to focus on five advantageous fields: \u2022 In the policies more emphasis should be put on the low or zero volatility of fuel prices which enhances the security; \u2022 Diversification on two levels; o increasing the range of fuel sources used; o potential of decreasing transmission losses by diminishing the distance between the production and the consumption of energy; \u2022 By the diverse ownership RES decrease the adverse effects of monopolies; \u2022 The positive public acceptance because of their green attributes: low or zero emission (in case of wind some additional campaign may required); \u2022 The huge potential of capital cost reduction which was sustained in the last decade. The variability of output level (often referred as \"intermittency\") requires some assistance that can alleviate the acceptance from system operators. More publicity and training should be provided in new system management techniques. This has to be combined with the following strategy: \u2022 All discriminations have to be prevented between the reserves needed because of the changing output level and the reserves required for the possible failures of large units. \u2022 Emphasis on the improvements achieved in balance of system services by RES sources; \u2022 Make the progress in predictability known by the all stakeholders: the increase in the reliability of forecast helps to include the RES in the system operation; \u2022 Prevent the image that the increase in RES electricity sources are the main cause of system failures by pointing out the real causes, which are the low maintenance and the bottleneck prolonged in grids and interconnections.

In the same period, the total EU-25 electricity consumption in the residential sector grew by 10.8%, from 690 TWh to 765 TWh with a growth rate of 1.8% from 2003 to 2004. It can be observed that electricity use grows at almost the same rate as the economy (GDP). Increasing electricity demand is due to many different factors, including: \u2022 More penetration of traditional appliances (e.g. dishwashers, tumble driers, air- conditioners, personal computers, which are all still far away from saturation levels); introduction of new appliances and devices, mainly consumer electronics and information and communication technology (ICT) equipment (Set Top boxes, DVD players, broadband equipment, cordless telephones, etc.), many with standby losses. \u2022 Increased use of \u201ctraditional\u201d equipment, i.e. more hours of watching TV, more hours of use of personal computer (driven by some tele-working, and increased used of internet), more washing and use of hot water. \u2022 Increased number of the same appliances in one household, mainly TVs, refrigerators and freezers. \u2022 More single family houses, each with some basic appliances, as well as larger houses and apartments (more lighting, more heating and cooling).

Some average measurements of household electricity consumption in Italy and Denmark (without the space and water heating uses) are 3,358 kWh/year for Denmark and 3,157 kWh/year for Italy [Pag2003]. In France, average electricity consumption excluding water and space heating, is about 2,500 kWh/year. Moreover, in France the observed mean electricity consumption, of electric water heaters amounts to 2,364 kWh/year [Sid 2006]. The average consumption in the EU-15 (total electricity consumption of the residential sector divided the number of households) is 4,343 kWh/year. 3.2 Air-conditioning appliances One of the main drivers in electricity consumption, and more important to electricity peak demand in the \u2018southern\u2019 countries (IT, ES, PT, EL and Southern FR), is a fast penetration of small residential air-conditioners (all products with less then 12 kW electrical power) and their extensive use during the summer months. At European level the penetration of small air-conditioners is still small (about 4% of residential space). However, in 2005 the penetration of small air-conditioners in some countries, such as Italy and Spain, reached penetration levels similar to the US with 20%. In 2005, the total \u2018residential air-conditioners\u2019 electricity consumption in EU-25 was estimated to be between 7 \u2013 10 TWh. For room air-conditioners (up to 12 kW output power), the Labelling Directive has been adopted by the European Commission and was published in March 2002 [EU 2002]. Although the full mandatory application of this Directive was fixed for 30 June 2003, the relevant test standard needed to serve as the reference document was missing. The new revised standard EN 14511, covering all products in the scope of the Directive, was not finalised before May 2004. 3.3 Major Household appliances In 2005, sales of major domestic appliances (MDAs) (i.e. refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, dishwashers, tumble driers, ovens, cookers and hobs) in the EU-15 were about stable compared to 2004 [Sor2006].

For domestic refrigerators, the energy efficiency index (EEI) 5 was defined in the \u201dCold Appliances\u201d labelling Directive, (EEI was set at 102 for the average model on the market in year 1992). Among the combined refrigerator-freezer, the best models on the market in the year 2005 were models rated A++ with an EEI below 30. For example: A A++ model with a 215 l fresh food volume and 60 l freezer (4*) volume has an annual consumption of 137.0 kWh/year compared to 522 kWh/year for the same size class C model. Just meeting the efficiency requirements would reduce the energy by a factor four! Until now there are only a limited number of models in A++ class (EEI below 30) \u2013 and still difficult to find in shops, while there are already several models in A+ class. Fig. 3.3 shows the improvement of the EEI from year 1992 to 2005. It is interesting to notice that new cold appliances sales in NMS and CC are almost identical to the EU-15 in term of efficiency.

In all countries the share of A and A+ appliances has strongly increased in 2005 compared with previous years. Large differences still exist between countries due to different national and regional policies and programmes. The lowest share of sales of A class appliances in the west European countries, covered by the GfK panel in 2004, were found in Spain (36.1%) and the highest share in the Netherlands (71.1% plus 19.2% in A+).

        "31 The major European policy measures already in place are the mandatory energy labelling, with A+ and A++ classes [EU 2003], and the CECED unilateral agreement [Cec 2005]. The CECED unilateral agreement contains the following commitments: participating manufacturers have stopped producing for, and importing in, the Community Market electric compressor-based household refrigerating appliances having an energy efficiency index 75 (corresponding to energy label class C) and above (except for chest freezers), and for electric compressor-based chest freezers having an energy efficiency index 90 (corresponding to energy label class D) and above, by 31st December 2004. The agreement also includes a \u201dfleet target\u201d: Each participant will reduce its own production - weighted average energy efficiency index- to a value of 55 for production and importation into the EU market by the year 2006. [Arn 2006] \u2022 Washing machines As far as the sales of washing machines are concerned, the share of A class appliances was already above 50% in 2002, in 2005 in some Member States (Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium) there is a large penetration of A+ appliances (not defined in the Labelling Directive but agreed among manufacturers), and the combination of A and A+ in these markets is approaching the 100% marker. The most remarkable market change from 2002 for refrigerators and washing machines has happened in the UK thanks to the Energy Efficiency Commitment. It is also interesting to note that class B has almost disappeared from the market, but there is an increased share of appliances not labelled. In 2005 there was not a significant improvement in the share of sales of A and A+ washing machines in the EU-15 (only countries covered by GfK), while in the New Member Sates the combined share of A and A+ models continues to grow. 2,7 17,7 5,7 22,5 2,6 11,2 0,5 3,8 2,5 17,3 3,0 3,8 36,7 6,5 38,4 6,7 44,5 0,9 4,9 3,5 7,6 3,2 18,2 1,7027,90 6,3 22,4 6,7 2,2 7,5 0,3 3,1 0,1 1,0 7,5 2,8 1,1 14,2 5,7 16,1 7,2 14,0 6,0 2,3 0,1 5,4 2,6 0,4 4,700,50 3,6 0,4 11,0 5,0 18,9 2,0 14,7 7,4 2,7 0,7 11,0 4,8 3,1 2,1 7,0 2,3 17,9 6,8 16,6 3,6 9,5 4,6 19,3 10,4 14,1 3,1 21,703,00 11,2 2,0 71,264,867,1 72,4 70,8 69,2 93,6 85,0 73,066,8 82,4 74,5 62,652,9 52,943,1 51,841,4 85,1 82,6 66,9 69,1 78,773,569,6065,10 78,374,0 8,4 10,3 0,8 2,8 8,8 12,1 2,2 10,5 6,0 8,3 13,4 20,412,4 2,4 6,6 4,5 10,9 4,5 2,2 7,8 4,9 12,9 1,5 4,8 2,2 3,5 0,6 1,2 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 Average EU-15 Average NMS&CC Austria Belgium France Germany Italy Portugal Spain Sweden UK Czech Rep Hungary Poland [ % ] +A A B C Others Fig. 3.9: Sales of washing machines: comparison for 2004-2005 sales, by energy class (Source GfK, [Sor 2005]) ",

The central element in the 2 nd CECED commitment is a reduction of the fleet energy consumption (this is the production weighted mean value of the energy consumption of all washing machines produced by the participants). The commitment calls for achieving a European production weighted average of 0.20 kWh/kg for the year 2008 (however already reached by 2004!) [Cec 2004]. On 31 December 2003 the participant manufacturers stopped the production and the imports of washing machines into the Community Market belonging to energy efficiency class D. \u2022 Dishwashers Dishwashers showed only limited efficiency progress between 2001 and 2005. In the year 2003 the average consumption per test cycle wash of a 12 place setting dishwasher was 1.197 kWh, down 10% from the average consumption in 2001. The best model on the market (already for some years) has an EEI of 1.05 kWh per wash cycle. This indicates that even with the present technology there is no significant energy saving potential (this also means that there is no A+ class). Remarkable progress in energy efficiency of new sale models took place between 2002 and 2005 in all EU-15 countries, especially in the UK and Italy. Also very impressive is the high A class market share in some of the New Member States. 6 For washing machines the EEI is expressed as the energy used per kg of soiled clothes in a 60\u00baC cotton cycle (kWh/kg).

The CECED agreement foresaw that participating manufacturers commonly agreed to stop producing and importing into the EU dishwashers which belong to the energy efficiency class D (for >10 place settings) or E respectively (for <10 place settings) by 31 December 2003. \u2022 Cooking Appliances There is a mandatory energy label only for electric ovens, which represent 97 % of the ovens sales in the EU-15 in 2005, with similar trends in the 10 New Member States. For free standing cookers, for which only the (electric) oven is labelled, the share of electric ones is 34.5 % and for gas ones about 44 %. Interesting to notice is that for hobs, the share in sales among electric and gas is 58.4 % electric and 37.4 % gas models, with almost 100% electric hobs in Germany and Sweden, and almost 100 % gas hobs in Italy. Hobs represent 43% of total sales in the EU-15 and about 20 % in the New Member States, followed by ovens with 26 % and 13 % respectively, and with 26 % and 66 % for free standing cookers. This does not include microwave ovens which have an increasing penetration, but are not yet used to cook major meals. Total electricity consumption for electric cooking is estimated to be 42 TWh (around 37 TWh electric hobs and 15 TWh electric ovens) in EU-15. The impact of the energy labelling is starting to be visible on the market. The best electric oven models on the market just meet the A class level (0.8 kWh for the test cycle), while a typical model has an energy consumption in the test cycle of 1.2 kWh. There is still a long way to go before the class A appliances will dominate the market, as in the case for dishwashers. [Sor 2006] ",

For VCRs the best appliances have a standby consumption around 1 W (eco-mode) and many have standby consumption around 2 W, however, it must be noted that VCRs sales are decreasing very rapidly. For DVD- players the standby passive of best appliances is below 0.5 W. More recently policy makers\u2019 attention has been drawn to the television on-mode consumption, due to the increase in the viewing hours and the size of the TVs. In order to compare on-mode consumption of TVs having the same size and features (TV consumption is strongly related to the size), an EEI has been developed by industry EICTA and experts. As shown in Fig. 3.15 the EEI as reported by EICTA has been slightly improved. 3.4.1 Digital TV services Another major driver for the increase in electricity consumption is the move to digital TV and broadband communication. The European Union is rapidly moving ",
        "37 towards the switch to digital TV and the phase-out of analogue broadcasting. This means that the current stock of analogue TVs will need converter boxes in order to function. At the same time, pay-TV is competing on the market with more sophisticated services and offers, resulting in even more complex set-top boxes, which show a worrying trend in rising energy consumption levels. In addition to the digital TV services supplied through satellite, terrestrial and cable (fibre or coax), there are new service providers starting to offer digital TV and video- on-demand through the telephone lines with DSL modems or using power line technology. These trends will accelerate the convergence between Information Communication Technology equipment and consumer electronics and have a big impact on energy consumption, because more than one system is always on in each household. In addition, an increasing electricity demand for each device can be observed as it gets more powerful. According to the Canalys research company, the number of households with digital TV in Western European countries was already over 50 million during the first half of 2005. This high number has been reached through the switch from analogue to digital by pay-TV providers and the seting up of free-to-air services in many Member States. The European Commission has indicated a switchover target of 2010, and the stronger than anticipated success of digital TV in several countries - including France, Germany and Sweden - means that many European countries will meet the target [Til2005]. Subscription for digital satellite TV at the end of 2005 reached about 15 % of Western Europe households [Lmp 2006]. There are different digital technologies in the national markets. Cable is dominating the market in Belgium and Switzerland while satellite is predominant in Austria and Spain. According to 'European Switchover Strategies' , a report from market research firm Informa Telecoms & Media, 44.9m European households will have access to DTT (Digital Terrestrial Television) signals on their main TV set by 2011 [Til 2006]. Other recent reports announced that 10 million DTT set-top boxes have been sold in the United Kingdom. Together with cumulative DTT set-top boxes sales in the rest of Europe, it is estimated that over 20 million DDT set-top boxes have now been sold. The number of DTT households in Europe increased from 8.2 million at the end of 2004 to 11.6 million by mid 2005 [Mou 2006]. 3.4.2 Policies In 1997, a European Commission working group identified the digital service system STB as the domestic electronic device with the largest potential to increase energy consumption in European households. To limit the potential growth in energy consumption a voluntary programme was introduced, the European Code of Conduct for Digital TV Services 7 , developed by a working group which includes all the stakeholders. The Code of Conduct sets out the basic principles to be followed by all parties involved in digital TV services, operating in the European Community in respect of energy efficient equipment. The graph below shows the average power consumption of new Set Top Boxes (STBs) that meet the Code of Conduct requirements. 7 http://energyefficiency.jrc.cec.eu.int/html/standby_initiative_digital%20tv%20services.htm ",
        "38 Fig. 3.17: Code of conduct requirements for power consumption for set-top boxes between 2001 and 2005; (source [Har 2006]) Research into proposed development showed that by 2010, the STB could push domestic electronic energy consumption in Europe above that of refrigerators and freezers. Compared to the average electricity consumption of existing set top boxes, two thirds of the consumption could be avoided if all set-top boxes would fulfil the code of conduct agreements. With potentially over 200 million of these boxes across the EU - equivalent to one per household \u2013 the necessary annual electricity supply for digital service systems could vary significantly. In 2010, 60 TWh/year would be consumed extrapolating from the current set top boxes in use compared to 20 TWh/year in the case of consequent use of equipment fulfilling the code of conduct requirements. 3.4.3 Broadband Equipment Another driver in the increase of consumption in households (and in the service sector in the network infrastructure and data centres) has been broadband communication. Detailed data on DSL usage in Europe is still being compiled. Broadband is one of the fastest among new communication technologies in Europe. The total number of broadband lines in the EU has quadrupled in just three years. In October 2005, 80 % of broadband subscribers in the 25 Member States of the European Union (EU-25) used DSL to connect to broadband Internet. Cable modems currently account for about 16 % of all broadband connections in the EU-25 [Com 2006]. In January 2006, broadband reached almost 60 million subscribers in the EU-25 and had a penetration rate of about 25 % of households. Growth in broadband use is mainly market-driven and is uneven across Member States [Com 2006]. Current projections show that the predicted uptake of the two key broadband WANs (wide area communication networks), DSL (digital subscriber line) and digital cable, will have a large potential impact on European household energy consumption. Even with the unlikely application of best practice in energy efficiency for all the network and end-user hardware, a simple broadband terminal for, say, 200 million EU ",
        "39 households by 2010 would increase annual domestic electricity demand by an estimated 6.6 TWh. This could effectively be doubled by associated LAN equipment. Figures on energy consumption for DSL modems vary significantly. In the UK, the largest national telecommunication provider, BT, has, through energy efficient procurement policy, provided basic, self-powered external DSL modems with a 4.0W power requirement. More typical devices in the open market and supplied by some other European telecommunication groups have a power requirement of nearer 10 W. With the latter, up to 87 kWh could be added to the individual household\u2019s annual energy overheads. Expectations are that broadband equipment will contribute to the electricity consumption of households in the European Union in the near future. Depending on the penetration level, the specifications of the equipment and the requirements of the service provider, a total European consumption of up to 50 TWh per year can be estimated for the year 2015. With the general principles and actions resulting from the implementation of the new Code of Conduct on energy consumption of broadband equipment the (maximum) electricity consumption could be limited to 25 TWh per year. To address the issue of energy efficiency whilst avoiding competitive pressures to raise energy consumption of equipment all service providers, network operators, equipment and component manufacturers helped the European Commission to develop the Code of Conduct 8 . The Code of Conduct sets out the basic principles to be followed by all parties involved in broadband equipment, operating in the European Community, in respect of energy efficient equipment. The Code of Conduct covers, both on the consumer side (end-use equipment) and the network side (network equipment), for services providing a two way data rate of 144 kb/s or above. 3.4.4 External Power Supplies Another component contributing to the increase of the energy consumption are the external power supplies. These external power supplies are used for many different types of electric and electronic devices, such as mobile telephones (the fast penetration is shown in the table below), digital cameras, cordless phones, notebook PCs, etc. For external power supplies a European Code of Conduct was introduced in the year 2000 to reduce the no-load losses, and recently also to improve the on-mode efficiency.

        "41 3.5 Residential Lighting Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) represent the most efficient solution available today for the residential market 9 . A suitable \u2018indicator\u2019 of the penetration of efficient lamps is the number of households, which have at least 1 CFL. Table 1.5: Estimation of the penetration levels in 2004 (source [Ber 2006]) Number of HH with CFLs [%] Lighting points/HH CFL's/HH [including HH without CFLs] AT 70 26 4 BE 70.5 26 2.5 DK 65 25.4 4.9 FIN 50 23.5 1 FR 52 18.9 2.26 GR 50 7 1 DE 70 32 6.5 EI 38 18 1.5 IT 60 18 0.8 LU 70 20 2 NL 60 40 4 PT 54 11.4 1.7 ES 15 25 2 SE 55 22 2.2 UK 50 20 2 CZ 70 10 2.9 CY 79 16 2 EE 20 6 0.25 HU 60 18 1 LV 18.8 20 0.42 LT 20 6 0.25 MT 50 15 1 PL 50 20 0.5 SK 60 15 1 SI 50 19 1 BG 7 10 0.2 RO 20 10 0.2 HR 39 14 1 The table shows that there are still a large number of households in the EU-15 which do not own a CFL, moreover only a few countries show a number of CFLs close to the cost-effective saturation level (about 25% of lighting points per households using a CFL). 9 CFLs are of two types, with an integral ballast (ballast inside the package) or pin-based. The first type dominates the market for the residential sector. Recently some pin-based CFL luminaires have appeared on the EU market for residential lighting, however, no sales figures are available. Of particular interest are the CFL based \u201ctorchieres\u201d, which could replace halogen based upright floor lamps, the latter using light sources up to 500W. There is also a certain use of linear fluorescent lamps, especially in some countries, e.g. the UK, and in specific rooms such as kitchens and garages. For the residential sector any linear fluorescent lamps even with a magnetic ballast could be considered an efficient solution if it replaces an incandescent lamp. ",
        "42 However, the recent drop in price had a beneficial impact on sales. In particular, two different types of CFLs are marketed: the short life (average life around 6000 hours) and the professional models (average life around 12000 hours). The first type is mainly marketed for the residential sector. Direct sales comparison between incandescent and CFLs and incandescent is not meaningful as CFLs have a longer life-time (6 times or more). Moreover it is difficult to gain access to sales data, and sales data available includes lamps not destined to the residential sector.

Total electricity consumption for the tertiary sector for the EU-25 was 628 TWh in the year 1999 and 726 TWh in the year 2004. The electricity in the tertiary sector has grown by 15.6 % in the period 1999 \u2013 2004 and by 2.0 % in the period 2003 \u2013 2004. For the tertiary sector (public sector, services and commerce) there is much less data available for individual electricity end-uses than for the residential sector, and only a few sources attempted to split the total electricity consumption among the different end-uses. Table 1.7: EU Tertiary Sector Electricity Consumption (source: Eurostat, JRC) Services [TWh] 2003 2004 2004 vs. 2003 [%] EU-25 655.18 670.03 2.27 EU-15 590.24 603.15 2.19 NMS-10 64.94 66.88 2.98 NMS-10+2 75.68 76.29 0.80 EU-25 + 2 665.92 679.44 2.03 In 2000 the ECCP compiled the following breakdown that was endorsed by the all the ECCP experts.

Lighting is by far the major end-use category in tertiary sector consumption, responsible for about 175 TWh or 26 % of total electricity consumption in the tertiary sector (this is lower than the EECP findings in the above figure). As far as non- residential buildings' lighting is concerned, this is dominated in energy terms by linear fluorescent lamps. T12 fluorescent lamps are the oldest technology of fluorescent lamps. These lamps have an efficiency of less than 75 Lumens per Watt. In the majority of cases there exists a T8 lamp that can be retrofitted into the same lighting point. Depending on whether this T8 lamp is a halo phosphor (e.g. TL-D Standard lamp) or a Tri-phosphor (e.g. MASTER TLD Super80 lamp) the lamp efficiency can be improved to between 80 and 90 Lumens per Watt. The T8 lamp now dominates the linear fluorescent market. The existing mix of lamps is still two-thirds halo phosphate phosphor lamps with the remaining third being three-band rare earth phosphor lamps which are currently increasing their market share year on year. Barrier coat technology has allowed the mercury content in current tri-phosphor lamps to be reduced to below 5mg. The average lamp wattage for T12 lamps is 65 W. The average energy saving per lamp when switching from T12 to T8 is 12 %. The total annual sales figure for T12 lamps in the European Union is 16 million lamps. This is more or less a stable market. The total sale of linear fluorescents is estimated to be 350 million lamps per year [Str2004]. There is a relatively new technology, T5 which has a higher efficiency and is designed to be fed only by electronic ballasts. However, the market penetration of T5 lamps is still limited, though increasing. There are about 207 million new installed lamps [Cel 2005], which tend to be of higher efficiency compared to already installed lamps. ",

There are two very different technologies for ballasts: the magnetic type and the electronic type. The latter has a much lower power loss and also allows operating the lamp at lower wattage for the same light output. There is a voluntary classification scheme for the combination of lamp ballasts introduced in the year 1998 by the lighting equipment manufacturers\u2019 trade association, CELMA [Cel 2004]. The classifications scheme 10 together with the minimum efficiency requirements for ballasts Directive 2000/55/EC, which came into effect in 2002, have resulted in a gradual market transformation. The Directive foresees two gradual steps for phasing out low and medium efficiency ballasts. The first steps took place in the year 2002 and phased out low efficiency magnetic ballasts (class D). The second steps took place in November 2005 and phased out Class C ballasts representing the largest share of the market. The EU Directive 2000/55EC aims to reach a market transformation by 31.12.2005 with the following values: \u2022 class A ballast 55%, \u2022 class B and C (sold until 01.11.2005) ballasts 45%. At the moment there are, however, no sale data available for the year 2005 to evaluate the impact of the second phase, the graphs below show the ballast market evolution up to the year 2004, when electronic ballasts reached a market share of 31%.

        "45 Lighting equipment efficiency is affecting only partially the total lighting consumption (measure is lm/W), as this is the result of the amount of light provided (measured in lux), and the lighting system's operating hours. Of particular interest is the introduction of technologies to reduce the light quantity (dimming) as function of day lighting, the operating hours in function of the occupancy. There are no data on the present penetration of occupancy sensors, and day-light sensor coupled with dimmable ballasts. A recent survey by the IEA has identified the following parameters for the OECD Europe [IEA 2006a]: \u2022 Average lighting power density 15.6 W/m 2 ; \u2022 Average energy consumption 43.1 kWh/m 2 per year; \u2022 Average operating hours 1,781. Some examples of advanced lighting for office buildings from the Green-Light Programme have reported for office buildings lighting power densities in the range of 7 to 10 W/m 2 . For other tertiary sector end-use equipment (e.g. central air conditioners, chillers, commercial refrigeration, pumps, etc.) there is even less information on market penetration of efficient equipment. Air-conditioners are estimated to consume about 80 to 90 TWh of electricity. Eurovent established classification for full load Energy Efficiency Ratio of each type of chillers. The classification follows the A to G approach used in the European Energy Label for household appliances, but the limits between classes have been defined for the existing chillers as listed in the Eurovent Directory [Sah 2006]. It is too early to see the influence of this classification on energy efficiency. However, the distribution shows that 7 % of certified chillers are in Eurovent Class A and in total only 5% of the certified chillers are in Eurovent Class G. Another large share is consumed by ventilation systems (including fans), which results in about 114 TWh in the tertiary sector. For office equipment not much data exists on the energy consumption nor on the market share of Energy Star labelled equipment nor on the rate of equipment with the power management features enabled. In the year 2003 a rapid penetration of LCD screens occurred, and was sustained in the years 2004 and 2005, which should have led to a decrease of the total monitor consumption. A German Survey has identified the ICT electricity consumption in the tertiary sector buildings to be 11% of total electricity consumption in this sector [Sch 2006] [Gru 2006]. This is in good accordance with the ECCP finding. The ICT sector is predicted to increase its share of the total electricity consumption (more equipment and more use of the equipment, in particular data centres are large electricity-using buildings). Non-domestic ICT consumption is expected to continue to increase by almost 40% between 2006 and 2020. Risks include expected increases in ICT equipment functionality and networking capabilities and barriers to the ability of the PC to enter low-power consumption modes such as sleep. For commercial buildings another interesting energy efficiency indicator is the total primary energy consumption (or the specific electricity consumption) per square metre. Although again there are no official statistics, some data have recently been collected by some experts, especially for Germany. From a monitoring exercise carried out in Germany the following data has been compiled [The 2004, Her 2006]. A number of highly efficient office and educational buildings have total primary energy below 100 kWh/m 2 per year, with lighting at about 10 kWh/m 2 and ventilation ",
        "46 at 10 kWh/m 2 . To reach this low energy consumption values such a building uses natural or passive cooling technologies (including ground loop heat pumps).

Total electricity consumption for the industrial sector for the EU-25 was 792 TWh in 1990 and 1,042 TWh in 2000 [EC 2004] and reached 1,089 TWh in 2004. The electricity in the industrial sectors has grown by 9.5 % in the period 1999 \u2013 2004 and by 1.7 % in the period 2003 \u2013 2004. Of this consumption, 707 TWh, or 65 %, was consumed by motor driven systems [EC 2003a, Eci 2004], which include compressors, refrigerators systems, pumps, ventilations, conveyors and other equipment. Motor driven systems are present in all types of industries. In particular, with more efficient electric motors the electricity consumption, for the process of converting electrical energy into mechanical energy, could be reduced by 10 to 20 %. Electric motor efficiency has been monitored through the CEMEP unilateral agreement, which has provided sales data for the most recent years on 4 and 2-poles three-phase industrial motors in the power range 1 to 90 kW. These are the motors responsible for the largest share of energy consumption, and are sold in large numbers. The existing CEMEP classification scheme allows for classification of motors into three classes 11 . The European motor manufacturers represented by CEMEP sell about 2 million 4- pole motors and 1 million 2-pole motors per year. Through a unilateral commitment, CEMEP manufacturers have managed to increase the market share of medium efficiency motors (EFF 2) and almost phased out the low efficiency motors (EFF 3). Another important piece of equipment to save electricity in motor systems is the Variable Speed Drive (VSDs) in all the fluid and motion applications where there is no constant flow or speed. It would be useful to collect sales data for VSDs for future reports. A report published by the European Copper Institute in 2004 shows the following energy savings for motor systems: Table 1.9: Energy savings for motor systems (Source [Keu 2004]) Savings potential (TWh/yr.)

These actions are evaluated on the basis of the annual electricity reductions they have delivered and will continue to deliver in the coming years. While the various energy efficiency indicators for end- use equipment are somehow \u2018relatively\u2019 easy to evaluate, it is necessary to build a detailed and dynamic stock model in order to evaluate the annual energy reduction. Important information needed to create the stock model is the present stock of installed appliances and equipment, and their energy consumption (in real life conditions not in the energy consumption test mode), the average life of a appliances and equipment, annual replacement rate and any change in ownership penetration, patterns of use, size, together with the key demographic indicators (e.g. number of households, people per household). Since only a certain percentage of installed equipment is replaced each year, the impact of energy efficiency policies tends to be relatively slow and modest at the beginning, though continually increasing over time. However, in a time span of 10 to 15 years, when almost the whole stock has been replaced and the full effect of the policy measure is visible, annual electricity reduction in the order of tens of TWh will be achieved for several types of appliances and equipment. The annual electricity demand reduction potentials resulting from each individual policy are calculated against the Business as Usual (BaU) scenario, which correspond to the most likely trend in consumption, if additional policies are not introduced. The BaU scenario includes the natural efficiency improvements (due to the autonomous market and technology developments), and the autonomous trends in sales. One of the possible policy actions is to accelerate the replacement rate of \u201cold\u201d installed equipment, thus reducing the time for the complete turnover of the installed stock. CECED in a recent report [Cec 2005a, Rud 2006] claims that by replacing the 188 million appliances in use which are older than 10 years, with the best on the market 44 TWh could be saved. Of course attention must be paid to old appliances being withdrawn from household and \u201cscrapped\u201d, as well as appliances being replaced with models of the same size. For some appliances, although there is a positive impact thanks to the policy action resulting in energy savings compared to the BaU scenario, there could still be a net increase in the electricity consumption, due to a larger penetration rate (this is the case for example for residential room air-conditioners, dishwashers, dryers). Another element to evaluate the result from a given policy is the possible competition between gas and electricity, and possible energy savings in terms of primary energy or CO 2 emission reduction. For example electric storage water heaters are decreasing their total electricity consumption, due to the fact that they are being replaced by instantaneous gas, thus resulting in primary energy CO 2 emission savings. Similar ",
        "48 benefits could be achieved by replacing electric hobs (resistive type) with efficiency gas hobs, and replacing conventional driers with gas models. Standby energy consumption in entertainment electronic and ICT equipment is growing at a worrying rate. This is because a lot of new equipment is added to the present stock (STBs, DVD players new TVs and surround sound systems, mobile telephones, broadband communication including home network). In addition, some old replaced equipment may still stay in use in different locations in houses (e.g. older TVs moving to children\u2019s bedrooms, together with the old VCRs). Some equipment which did not \u201ctraditionally\u201d have any standby consumption such as traditional white goods, start to have AC/DC converters, displays, modems, microprocessors, all devices that are likely to be always on and to add a few watts of standby consumption. While these additional features may be desirable and even useful to save energy in the operation modes, every step during the design phase has to be taken by designers and manufacturers to make sure that while in standby the added electronic devices draw as little power as possible and power management is always implemented to use as little electricity as possible and to switch off all the devices not needed. Moreover, although new TVs use significantly less standby power than older models as a result of the EICTA unilateral voluntary agreement introduced first in 1997, the simple number of appliances with standby power mode continues to increase. The net effect of these trends is likely to be a continuing increase in standby power use. TV reception platforms are rapidly moving towards digital broadcasting technology. As a result, set-top boxes (STBs) will be the source of significant new standby and on-mode power demand in the near future. Some STBs introduced on the market stay in on-mode all the time, consuming up to 20\u201330 W of power (this consumption tends to increase as more functionality is added to STBs). With the assumption of about 50 million advanced STBs (accessing pay per view services with recording and time shift capabilities) in households by 2010, this is an additional electricity consumption of 10 TWh per year in the EU-25. In addition, with the phase out of the analogue TV signal, simple converter boxes will be required by the legacy of the old analogue TVs. Converter boxes now on the market tend to consume about 10 W all the time. With the assumption of one converter box per household this will result in an additional 16 TWh per year. The EU Code of Conduct for Digital TV Systems, if successfully implemented halves this predicted consumption and will thus deliver about 13 TWh of annual electricity savings by 2010 compared to the business as usual scenario. A similar trend is also observed for broadband communication (mainly through DSL, but could also be implemented through cable and satellite STB, G3 mobile phones, and PLC) a number of new devices, such as modems, routers, switches, are being introduced and are often always on. Depending on the penetration level, the specifications of the equipment and the requirements of the service provider, a total European Union consumption of up to 50 TWh per year can be estimated for the year 2015. With the general principles and actions resulting from the implementation of new Code of Conduct the electricity consumption could be limited to 25 TWh per year, i.e. a demand reduction of 25 TWh against the BaU scenario. As far as the traditional white goods and other residential sector appliances and equipment are concerned electricity demand reductions per year in the order of 24 TWh to 30 TWh have been achieved in the last decade (CECED in the same period estimate an energy demand reduction of 34 TWh). In particular it is worth noticing that the demand will be reduced by 65 TWh to 75 TWh per year in 2010 compared to 1995 in total by the current polices already in place (appliances labelling, efficiency requirements, unilateral voluntary agreements, Code of Conducts, etc.). It is important to highlight that there is still a huge saving potential available if ",
        "49 further cost-effective 12 measures are implemented. In particular, larger saving potentials exist for reducing stand-by losses (20 TWh), which is also the sector with the highest consumption growth with the current polices (+50%). A large demand reduction potential is also available in residential refrigeration appliances (16 TWh), and residential lighting (10 to 20 TWh) With the current policies there will be a consumption increase for lighting of about 10%. The cost-effective technology CFLs is already on the market, but not yet used in all the cost-effective lighting points in households. Equally important to mention is the fact that with a prompt introduction of additional policies based on least-life cycle cost and accelerated replacement of additional appliances and lighting, the electricity of the residential sector could be reduced by an additional 60 TWh to 90 TWh per year by the year 2015 compared to the current policies' scenario. Another important piece of equipment for electricity consumption and potential savings is the electric motor , in particular the three phase industrial motor. Through the CEMEP unilateral agreement started in 1999 about 2 TWh was already been saved by 2005. The electricity reduction potential of the current agreement, when most of the motor stock is replaced (around 2012), will be about 6 TWh. The economic saving potential is still much larger and estimated to be at about 20 TWh by 2015. To achieve this cost-effective potential, a new policy action to phase out motors in efficiency classes EFF 2 is needed. The recent report [Eci 2004] has calculated the total electricity cost-effective savings in motor systems to 200 TWh , this will be achieved with the optimisation of the whole system. The \u201cBallast\u201d Directive will deliver electricity savings of about 5TWh by the year 2010, while the economic potential for non-residential lighting will be at least 20 TWh, if the whole lighting system is considered. The European GreenLight Programme (www.eu-greenlight.org) is promoting this concept and has already achieved remarkable savings (in the order of 100 \u2013 200 GWh) [Gre 2004]. Other important electricity savings in the non-residential building sector are in office equipment (hence the need of a more effective implementation of the Energy Star Programme), and in the cooling and ventilation systems (through the use of natural ventilation, and free cooling, as well the introduction of energy-efficient compressor based cooling and tri-generation). The results are summarised in the following table, which shows the potential electricity demand reduction up until 2015. The table compares two different reduction potential scenarios based on JRC estimates with the BaU scenario. Table 1.10: Potential Electricity Demand Reduction up until 2015 Electricity Consumption 2005 Realistic Demand Reduction Potential by 2015 compared to the Ambitious Demand Reduction Potential by 2015 compared to the 12 Most of the energy efficiency measures are cost-effective. This means that they will result in net money savings for the users, as the reduced electricity cost over the life time of the appliances will be bigger than any additional purchasing cost for the more efficient model. In many cases there is an increase in manufacturing costs to manufacturers, which can be passed onto the users or can be compensated by productivity gains (and in many case will decrease over time when the most efficient components are mass produced). Over the last ten years the EU white goods manufacturers have become more profitable, appliances cost less, and the efficiency has improved, this despite fears by manufacturers that the policy action introduced in the nineties could have had a negative impact. Therefore, it can be concluded that energy efficiency measures, and in particular standards and labels, are cost effective for society and reduce CO 2 emissions at a negative cost. ",

Also, Vincent Mahieu of IES-TAQ worked on the TTW (tank to wheel) and WTW integration aspects. Many institutions have published conflicting life-cycle analyses or WTW studies of biofuels, and the original intention was to compare existing studies. However, this proved impossible, due to the lack of transparency of most studies (regarding the input data used, the methodological assumptions) and incorrect methodology. Therefore, it was decided to make a fresh study, which both uses a rigorous methodology, and specifies all assumptions and input data, with references. Thus stakeholders are invited to examine the input data and contribute updates and corrections, rather than simply comment on the results. In this way the study continuously evolves and is attaining the status of a reference, being used by the European Commission and IEA studies. Wherever possible, primary data from industry sources were used. The study evolves by stakeholders reviewing the input data and suggesting improvements and updates. The last major WTW revision was made in March 2006 [Edw 2006], with new availability and cost sections as well as a wider range of biofuels. For every alternative fuel and power train, the difference in GHG emissions, fossil fuel use and cost-to-EU has been estimated between two realistic scenarios: expanded alternative fuel use and \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. The study also estimates how much biomass from EU sources could be converted to different biofuels at a given cost. The study considers all routes to alternative road transport fuels with a significant potential in 2010-2020. The main limitation to the introduction of biofuels is cost. As a first step for comparing the advantages of biofuels produced by different routes, the results of the study are expressed in terms of two figures-of-merit, representing the cost of replacing a certain quantity of fossil fuel, and the cost of avoiding a certain quantity of greenhouse gas. A Well-to-Wheels (WTW) analysis is a life-cycle analysis restricted to quantitatively well-defined aspects. Thus it excludes such factors as employment and effects on macro-economic domestic product. However, more complex factors, such as effect on local employment and economy, soil and water protection, ecological effects, implications for innovation and trade also need to be considered when formulating biofuels policy. ",
        "52 4.1.1 Method For every alternative fuel and power train, the JEC study estimates the difference in GHG emissions, fossil fuel use and cost-to-EU between two realistic scenarios: \u2022 Scenario with expanded alternative fuel use, \u2022 Reference \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d scenario. These scenarios must only differ in fuel use and production. Thus by-products from biofuels (e.g. rapeseed cake from biodiesel) must be balanced by an equivalent product in the reference scenario, representing the product they substitute (e.g. soybean meal).

We see that only some of the routes to \u201cadvanced\u201d biofuels offer cost savings compared to existing \u201cconventional\u201d biofuels, although they compete better in terms of GHG saving. Hydrogen pathways are expensive because of the high cost of distribution and vehicles in 2010-2020 scenario (5.75% market share assumed for costs). Ethanol from the straw-to-ethanol process appears to be already cheaper than fossil gasoline at an oil price of 50\u20ac/barrel. However, this point is faded to show our uncertainty on the costs of this process, which is not yet in commercial operation. Although we used yield and process input data from the constructors of a pilot plant, we were forced to estimate plant cost by scaling from a study on a different plant, for wood-to-ethanol [Woo 1999]. Each spot on the graph represents a way of making biofuel: the differences are in the use of by-products and how processes are heated (e.g. natural gas or straw, with or without cogeneration of electricity). 4.1.3 Conclusions \u2022 Burning of biomass for electricity (and/or heat), saves more GHG per tonne of biomass (or per hectare) than does conversion to transport fuels. It also works out cheaper, because of simpler plant. \u2022 The limited (and uncorroborated) data available on straw-to-ethanol indicate that this might be an economic option. Advanced biofuels from woody material would be cheaper than conventional biofuels if produced in a wood-pulp mill, but more expensive if one has to build a separate plant. \u2022 Bio-hydrogen is an extremely expensive option due to the high cost of compression and distribution. \u2022 Biogas from anaerobic digestion can be compressed as a transport fuel. This gives fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional biofuels, but is more expensive if one includes the cost of maintaining the distribution infrastructure. Biogas is more effectively used to replace natural gas. \u2022 Readers are invited to download the JEC study [3], to review the input data and assumptions, and to suggest updates or corrections. In this way the study evolves. Acknowedgements: The main authors of the WTT section of the JRC study are R. Edwards (JRC), and J-F Lariv\u00e9 (CONCAWE), with technical assistance from W.

        "54 4.2 Availability of Biofuels from EU Production Robert Edwards The Well to Wheel study also estimates how much biomass from EU sources could be converted to different biofuels at a given cost. In the North of Europe, ploughing up grassland to grow more crops for biofuels would result in a large release of carbon from the oil, and should be avoided. In the South, agricultural production is mostly limited by the availability of water. Therefore crops for biofuels are restricted to the existing EU arable area. The effects of biofuels on imports and agricultural prices are also assessed. As a baseline we used a DG-AGRI projection for agricultural production and markets up to 2012, assuming biofuels production remain at 2005 levels, as well as a constant demand for food crops, we then considered the possibilities and consequences of increasing biofuels production at the 2012 horizon. Considering land as the primary resource leads to difficulties because of the large variations in land quality and therefore potential yields. Instead we used cereal production as a proxy for yield postulating a constant ratio between the yield of cereal and the yield of other crops. The availability of waste biomass for energy is much higher than that for conversion to road fuels. This is because of the economic scale of the plants: heat and combined- heat-and power applications are economic on a small scale, and can exploit dispersed resources. In contrast, plants for converting waste to biofuels are complex and expensive: to be economic, they must be large to benefit from the economies of scale (100-200MWth at the least). Therefore the amount of biomass which could be converted to biofuels is much less than that which could be burnt for heat and/or electricity. 4.2.1 Conventional ethanol and bio-diesel The scenario for maximum possible production in the EU of conventionally produced ethanol and bio-diesel is summarised in the table below. The scenario assumes a production of 230 PJ/a of ethanol corresponding to 5.75% of the gasoline demand on an energy content basis (the EU Commission's target for 2010). This can be achieved with the sugar beet surplus (10.0 Mt/a) plus just under half of the surplus cereal production potential (26.4 Mt/a) (Table 4.1). The remaining notional cereal surplus of 29.2 Mt/a from the balance of the set- asides, the net land released by the sugar reform and yield improvements, is available for bio-diesel production. If the land corresponding to this cereal surplus were used for oil seeds production, 13.0 Mt/a of rape seeds and 3.5 Mt/a sunflower seeds could be produced (assuming a 80/20 land use ratio). The total oil seeds potential, including the 5.6 Mt/a of oil seeds already used today for bio-diesel production, corresponds to 311 PJ/a of bio-diesel equivalent to 3.5% of the total diesel fuel market including personal cars, commercial and heavy duty vehicles. It must be realised that this estimate assumes no change in the amount of oilseeds imported for food use. Overall, around 4.2% of the road fuels market can be covered by these conventional bio-fuels (in energy terms), equivalent to the substitution of 12.5 Mt/a of fossil fuels. Note that the net fossil energy saved is only 2.3% and the GHG savings only 2.1% because these fuels are only partly renewable. ",
        "55 The estimated cost for replacing fossil fuels with biofuels with the realistic grain/oilseed trading scenario is 409 and 231 \u20ac per ton and the cost of CO 2 avoided is 228 and 129 \u20ac per ton for the low and high oil price scenario respectively. This is the additional cost above that of the fossil fuel in the base-case. This scenario is, however, unlikely to happen, because it would require between two and three times more fraction of arable land devoted to oilseeds, leading to rotations which are more frequent than optimal, and/or growing rapeseed in rather unsuitable areas, driving up costs (a simple estimate based on linear supply flexibility indicates all-EU production at this level would increase rapeseed prices by 76 %!). Therefore, new import barriers would be needed to prevent imports undercutting EU-produced oilseeds and these are probably not compatible with existing trade agreements. Anyway, it would be cheaper for the EU to import oilseeds in exchange for cereals exports. The fundamental reason is that Europe is climatically better suited to cereals production than oilseeds (that is why EU already imports almost half its present oilseed requirements).

The vast difference in yields between different types of land makes a \u201c% of land\u201d meaningless. According to our figures, the extra crops required to bring about the required increase in biofuel production (assuming 5.75% replacement of diesel by bio-diesel and 5.75% of gasoline by ethanol on an energy basis) would replace 27% of projected EU 2012 cereals production, or roughly 22% of total arable capacity (not including set-asides) or roughly 19% of arable capacity including set-asides. \u2022 The EU does not have enough arable capacity on the existing arable land area + set-asides to reach this target in 2012 without increasing food imports (elimination of potential cereals exports is already included in our figures). 4.2.2 \"Advanced\" biofuels This includes ethanol from cellulosic material and synthetic fuels produced by biomass gasification and syngas-based synthesis processes. \u201cWood\u201d is short for \u201clignocellulose resources largest potential sources being farmed wood, perennial grasses and wood waste from forestry. ",
        "56 The potential for farmed wood (short rotation forestry or SRF) was estimated on the basis of the cereal surplus discussed above, assuming a substitution mass ratio of 1.57 t of wood per t of cereal (Table 4.2). The land producing the estimated 56 Mt/a surplus cereals could potentially produce 88 Mt/a of wood instead, with an additional 15.8 Mt/a from substitution of existing oil seeds. Wood waste availability was estimated on the basis of a recent detailed study of wood (mostly forest residuals) for energy. About one quarter of the total would be available cheaply (2.8 \u20ac/GJ) at pulp mills suitable for using the black-liquor biofuels route. Of the rest, we estimated that only 1/3 would be logistically available to other plants for making biofuels and then the price would rise to that of farmed wood, i.e. 4.1 \u20ac/GJ. That means a total of about half the energy-wood is available for making biofuels: about 26 Mt/a. This brings the total wood availability to just under 130 Mt/a. Wheat straw is the most concentrated source of cellulosic material. We used a GIS- based study which considered regional straw yields (see 4.3).

Biogas plants are capital-intensive relative to their output, particularly when upgraded gas is required e.g. for use as CBG. These plants cannot support high feedstock costs such as may be associated with long-distance transport. In Denmark, the EU country where the biogas industry is the most developed and where intensive agriculture and short distances provide a favourable environment, even fairly large scale plants can only be economic when co-processing waste from fisheries, slaughterhouses and dairies, for which they actually get paid. We chose the most economic example of biogas production for our availability scenario, on the basis that this would be how the industry is most likely to develop in the next 10 \u2013 20 years. This requires co-feeding of slurry and organic waste (either food industry waste or municipal waste). The potential road fuel production from this type of plant is limited to less than 100 PJ/a in EU-25 by the simultaneous availability of organic waste and large quantities of animal slurry. ",
        "57 Farmed crops can also potentially be used to produce biogas. However the high cost of such feedstocks is likely to make this option uneconomic compared to other alternatives. We have therefore elected not to consider it.

The second group of columns shows the result of maximising ethanol production, including \u201cadvanced\u201d processing of wood and straw as well as cereals.

Making DME (dimethyl ether; a diesel fuel with physical properties similar to propane) is more efficient, allowing more replacement at similar cost. \u2022 The target of 5.75% replacement of EU transport fuels by biofuels cannot be reached from EU resources using \u201cconventional\u201d biofuels, if one is to avoid the loss of soil carbon caused by increasing ploughed area. \u2022 \u201cAdvanced\u201d biofuels made from lignocellulose would allow replacement of biofuels from EU resources, but generally at higher cost \u2022 bio-hydrogen maximises the transport-km from given biomass resource, but is extremely expensive on a WTW basis 4.2.5 Expert Workshop to review availabilities data In order to review and improve the work of JRC on biofuels availability and cost in the frame of the JEC WTW study, a workshop was organized by R. Edwards and V. Mahieu (IES Emissions and Health Unit), with help from other partners in the study. Apart from representatives of the study partners, there were 18 experts on various aspects of biofuels availabilities and 14 participants from Brussels DGs. The Proceedings are available on the WTW web-page [Edw 2006] The title of the workshop was Availability and Cost of Biomass for Road Fuels in EU. It was held 3-4 May 2006, at the Borschette Centre, Brussels. In advance, R. Edwards prepared a detailed agenda which identified the critical points which limit the accuracy of estimates of biofuels availability. This included quantifying aspects of the following topics: \u2022 Soil carbon effects \u2022 Bio-energy Crops (SRF, switch grass, miscanthus, herbaceous) \u2022 Forest Residuals \u2022 Straw and other Agricultural Waste \u2022 Agricultural Crop Potential, Prices, Market / Imports Effects \u2022 By-products Issues \u2022 Compressed Biogas: Manure and Organic Waste Although some people were initially surprised by the availability and cost figures, there was very little disagreement when the input assumptions were examined. Differences between studies are mostly due to the different scenarios which were being studied: including or not including existing uses, time-frame, point on the cost- supply curve, use for biofuel or bioenergy/heat. In the case of biogas, the differences result from JEC study considering the whole WTW pathway (including distribution and use in the car) and not just biogas production. Advice from the experts was that obtaining definite figures in many areas of data uncertainty would be very difficult. No-one could improve directly on the input data from that used in the JEC study, although there were helpful suggestions for literature to be followed up. ",
        "59 4.3 Spatial Analysis of Straw Availability in the EU Robert Edwards, Marcel \u0160\u00fari, Thomas Huld and J-F Dallemand The IES Renewable Energies Unit is carrying out activities of spatial analysis in the field of bioenergy resource assessment. The amount of biomass available for energy use depends not only on the total resource, but also upon how much can be economically and logistically delivered to processing plants. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) have already proven their capability to contribute to the resolution of spatially-determined issues, and in the field of bioenergy the use of map- based assessments is emerging rapidly. At this stage of our activities, the module on the assessment of cereals straw resources for bioelectricity at European level is the more advanced in our group and an overview of the first results is discussed in the following text. Another module aiming at a harmonised comparison of European Union regions in terms of bioenergy (present use and potential for transport, heat and electricity) is under way. A module on Short Rotation Forestry is at planning stage (present use, acreage and yield per species, land suitability per crop, support schemes, installation/maintenance/harvesting/transport costs, etc.). There are several pathways of conversion of straw to energy \u2013 it can be burned for electricity and/or heat, or it can be converted to ethanol or other transport fuels. In our study we have focused on localisation of large electricity power plants as these are supposed to be the most economically effective. Starting from existing data and taking into account agronomic/environmental constraints related to straw harvesting, competitive use of straw and industrial/logistic constraints, the possibility to replicate \u201cEly clones\u201d (from the Ely power plant experience in UK which uses approximately 200,000 tons of straw per year) in regions of the EU has been quantified and discussed. 4.3.1 Data We have applied the existing European-wide statistical and GIS data (Eurostat production figures for wheat and barley CORINE Land Cover etc.) in order to assess the technical potential of straw from wheat and barley in the 25 European Union countries and 2 Accession States (Bulgaria and Romania). Besides Eurostat and GIS data we have collected a wide range of studies on straw-for-energy, including papers, national reports, regional case studies and direct communication with research and regional authorities. The support information was collected from the following countries and regions: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, and England. We focused on extracting the information on agrotechnical and environmental aspects of straw collection, competitive use of straw, technology options, transport costs and data from existing installations. 4.3.2 Methods First the straw production was calculated on Eurostat NUTS level 2, taking into account variations in yield. Not all produced straw is available for bioenergy. The first two constraints are environmental limitations and the competitive use of straw. ",
        "60 The environmental constraints should prevent collection of straw from fields where there are unfavourable soil conditions: low organic matter content, risk of degradation processes, limited water resources, and extremes of climate. However, as effects of systematic straw collection on environmentally sensitive soils are not well known yet, we have not considered them so far. There are several uses for straw which compete in some regions with energy applications. The main competitive use is cattle bedding/litter. Significant amounts of straw are also used in horticulture, mushroom production or for industrial processes. However the information published in various studies is inconsistent, and often based on an expert guess with lacking documentation of the methodology and terminology. It is generally accepted that cattle raising is the most important competitive use of straw. Based on the scattered data of available studies we have estimated the straw used per head of cattle from total straw produced per head of cattle in each of NUTS level 2 region and subtracting this estimation of competitive use resulted in a map of the net surplus of straw at the level of regions. In the next step, we used the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) data to spatially disaggregate this information onto a regular grid with a cell resolution of 5x5 km so that spatial analysis can be performed (Fig. 4.3). The area of wheat and barley was estimated in each 5x5 km grid cell, assuming that it is distributed uniformly on the fraction of the cell devoted to the CLC category 211 (arable land). Fig. 4.3 : Net availability of straw (tonnes per 5 \u00d7 5 km grid cell), estimated by disaggregating the net straw availability per region using CLC data (category arable land). ",
        "61 Another constraint on the availability of straw-for-energy is how much straw can be made economically and logistically available at the conversion plants. This requires knowledge of the optimum size of such a power plant. Then suitable locations for the plants can be hypothesized on the basis of the maximum transport distance, which depends on the net available straw density. The specific capital cost of a straw- burning power plant decreases as it is made bigger, but the cost of straw transport increases. The generating costs show a minimum with increasing plant size. Therefore the spatial density of net straw availability in the capture area of the plant affects the optimum plant size, and the cost of the electricity produced. Due to the logistics limitation, we decided to consider size of the world\u2019s biggest power plant that is in operation in Ely (UK). More information about the economical consideration can be found in the paper by Edwards et al. [Edw 2005]. 4.3.3 Results We chose the highest resource density to locate the first 120 MW th (38 MW el ) power station (see Fig. 4.3), then proceeded to find optimal locations of further power stations until their straw supply radius exceeded 50 km. The resulting map (Fig. 4.4) shows that in the region studied one could theoretically build about 67 Ely-sized power plants (most of them in France, UK and Denmark) with total capacity of 2.5 GW. Using this capacity the straw energy utilised would be 230 PJ (LHV thermal) (out of a total net straw availability of 820 PJ) generating about 21 TWh electricity per year. The generating costs for the locations identified for power stations were estimated to rise from 68 to 73 \u20ac/MWh as straw transport distance increased (Fig. 4.4). ",
        "62 Fig. 4.4: Theoretical localisation of ELY-size (38 MW) electricity generation power plants in the EU25+2 countries. 4.3.4 Conclusions and discussion It should be noted that this example of the spatial analysis \u2013 at this scale \u2013 has only the scope to find the maximum number of power stations, not to propose particular sites, which would require much more detailed local assessments of logistics. In this case we ignore the fact that some straw is already used by the existing power plants in the UK (1 installation) and in Denmark (11 installations). Fig. 4.5: Effect of resource density on electricity cost, assuming theoretical location of 38 MW electricity generation power plants. The most significant limitation for building big straw-electricity capacities (>50 MWel) is logistics imposed by the daily traffic of heavy trucks shipping straw close to the power station. In our study the 67 electricity-generation power stations have still left out 72 % of straw for small-scale applications. There is a range of smaller applications that could be considered further in the analysis. More of the available straw could be used in smaller CHP plants which can be economic where there is an existing need for the heat, or in heating boilers. There is still potential for technological improvements in converting straw to pellets/briquettes that would allow much wider use in small-scale applications. ",
        "63 4.4 European Biomass Data Collection J.F. Dallemand, M. Szabo, N. Scarlat The IES Renewable Energies Unit is engaged in activities of scientific and technical networking within the framework of the activities of the Scientific and Technical Reference System on Renewable Energies and Energy End-Use Efficiency 15 . Since bioenergy is a multi-disciplinary field based on a wide range of different technical expertise, scientific and technical networking is a key issue to discuss various options and build consensus at European level. An example of such activities is the JRC- EEA-CENER-CIEMAT Expert consultation on \u201cSustainable bioenergy cropping systems for the Mediterranean\u201d (Madrid, February 2006) [JRC 2006] where experts discussed bioenergy development in the South of Europe with regard to agro- environment, water supply, biodiversity and costs competitiveness. The Mediterranean region has specific environmental and farming characteristics, such as an arid climate, risk of soil erosion and a high climatic variability over the years. All of these might become more pronounced as an effect of climate change. On the other hand, this region has a high share of extensive farmland with a high nature value, that will need to be protected from intensification on the one hand, and from abandonment on the other. Bioenergy production will need to fit into this framework. At the same time, the requirements for energy crops are different to those for food crops (energy vs. nutrient value) which implies that other crops may be needed. It is not only high yields but also energy content and energy balance which should be considered. Agroenergy involves a whole system approach and evaluation of all the potential products (energy, biofuels, fertilisers, industrial products, etc.). Historically, biomass has not been produced for energy as it has been for food, so there is scarce information on yield figures, adaptability, varieties, etc. The identification of the most suitable bioenergy crops for the Mediterranean is thus a complicated issue and needs much further research as well as practical implementation in existing farming systems. Currently there are significant yield differences between experimental fields and practical applications by farmers at either small or larger scale. There is also still much RTD needed on plant breeding, selection of crops, and varieties which may improve the characteristics of crops suitable to arid Mediterranean conditions. A GIS approach would be useful for incorporating detailed pedo-climatic and socio-economic conditions and determining the most suitable crop mixes for each local situation. For oil production, traditional crops might be used as a first option, but novel biomass crops are promising, including: Cynara, Carinata, Castor bean, oil palm, and Jatropha . For these new crops whole crop usage favours the economics of the whole biomass chain. Regarding ethanol crops, the energy balance of some conventional crop-conversion routes is sometimes not favorable. New crops with high water use efficiency have to be considered. Examples of these novel crops are the Jerusalem artichoke, sweet sorghum, prickly pear and wild tobacco. Lignocellulosic crops were seen as crops that may be well suited to the climatic conditions, while still providing a high yield. However, for some crops, irrigation may be needed. There is a wide variety of short rotation forestry and herbs that can be used for bioenergy production. Compared to conventional systems, perennials can offer 15 http://streference.jrc.cec.eu.int ",
        "64 some advantages, such as reduced soil erosion, less need for fertilisation and pesticides, while increasing the carbon sink and organic matter. It was found that in general, there is a variety of biomass options for electricity/heat generation, but there are far fewer options to sustainably produce bioenergy crops as feedstock for liquid biofuels. This may change with the introduction of advanced biofuel conversion technologies. However, for many crops irrigation is a key factor for long-term stable yields, and the resilience of plantations of perennial crops. The optimal trade-offs between the quantity of water use, the time of irrigation and the yield will still have to be found out. This is crucial for bioenergy production in the Mediterranean. There is much research needed on finding measures to improve efficiency in relation to the input-output ratio of water and nutrients in the cropping phase, and the energy efficiency throughout the full chain, including the conversion step from biomass to energy. Overall there is a need to get an integrated picture of all environmental considerations in relation to the cropping systems, and the whole energy production chain. Today biomass subsidies are not linked to \u201csustainability standards\u201d (greenhouse- gas emissions, biodiversity, security of supply, rural economy, etc). More research is needed on what is sustainable, as well as how to measure and to certify it. From a broader sustainability perspective, costs and logistics of biomass production, collection, transportation and conversion will have to be considered. Important factors are the limited availability of land, the higher costs of bioenergy crops compared to residues, and the high variations in crop yields between years. Overall, combinations of suitable bioenergy crops and biomass residues might have to be used, i.e. bioenergy crops and by-products might well be complementary. Improvements in the logistics have to be studied, but they also need to be implemented in practice taking into account the area-specific circumstances. This implies an involvement of the appropriate stakeholders and of industry. In addition, detailed economic fact-finding studies need to be carried out, especially in relation to quantifying externalities. Overall, it was agreed that sustainable bioenergy chains can only be developed if interactions between sectors are taken into account. For sustainable bioenergy crop production in the Mediterranean, agro-environmental perspectives identified during the workshop were: \u2022 Firstly, to use productive, irrigated land for new energy crops as an alternative to intensive food production, instead of converting high nature value farmland to intensively-used arable land for bioenergy production. \u2022 Secondly, to help reducing water and other input use wherever possible; reduce the risk of soil erosion. This also includes the selection of the crops with low environmental impacts. \u2022 Thirdly, to develop biomass extraction as a complement to fire prevention measures on forest and scrubland. \u2022 Fourthly, evaluation and planning at different geographical levels is needed, taking into account a range of environmental aspects (biodiversity, water use, inputs, etc.), and the different farm and environmental realities. \u2022 Finally, co-operation between different sectorial authorities is crucial to integrate energy, environmental, and agricultural issues.

        "65 Other activities in preparation include an Expert Consultation on \u201cCereals straw for bioenergy in the European Union\u201d which was held at Pamplona (CENER, Spain in October 2006). The main topics discussed will be the agro-environmental impact of straw harvesting, the competitive uses of straw and the logistic/industrial constraints related to the use of straw for bioenergy in Europe. In France, according to INRA [Gos 2005], the national resource of cereals straw is estimated between 22 and 25 million tons. Assuming a yield per hectare of 3.5 tons, after deduction of competitive use, 8 million tons are still available for new uses. With a 50% abatement to preserve the soil fertility, this leads to an INRA estimation of 4 million tons available for bioenergy. In the case of Lithuania, according to the Lithuanian Institute of Agricultural Engineering [Kat 2006], if the present use of straw for energy is very limited, about 40% of straw yield (i.e. 400-500 000 tons at country level) is unused and could possibly be used for energy purposes. With 15% left on the soil, the competitive uses are estimated as: bedding, 40%, fodder 4%, and 1-2% for gardening, mushroom cultivation and other purposes. One of the objectives of the expert consultation in preparation is to collect, discuss and analyse regional figures in order to improve European/national estimates. Within the framework of the STRS RE and EEE activities, specific attention is paid to the collection of data and information leading to harmonised bioenergy data profiles, especially for the New Member States of the European Union. In 2006, the STRS on RE and EEE launched studies on methodological improvement of statistical data collection regarding biomass availability and use in the 10 New EU Member States. In the first stage the two reports have been prepared by the teams of Estonia [Soo 2006] and Lithuania [Kat 2006]. The core bioenergy indicators are presented below in Figures 4.6 to 4.9. 4.4.1 Estonia In Estonia, the main energy and biomass related policy documents are the Electricity Sector Development Plan, the Long-term National Development Plan for the Fuel and Energy Sector, the National Environmental Strategy and the Forestry Development Plan. For the country including 15 counties, 109 rural municipalities and 33 cities, the data on energy production are collected annually by the Statistical Office from all enterprises producing primary or secondary energy. Data are also collected from auto-producers of heat and electricity. Data on energy and fuel consumption are collected by a sample survey leading to yearly energy balance sheets. The present potential of biomass from agriculture can be estimated from the agricultural statistics collected by the Statistical Office (13 surveys conducted in 2004 including data on land use, sown area, production etc.). The national reporting system includes a public database of statistics available via Internet 16 . For Eurostat reporting, the statistics on biomass as energy source are presented in the Energy Questionnaire on Renewables and Wastes. In Estonia, the share of renewable energy sources in the total primary energy supply is relatively high i.e. 12.2% in 2004. Traditional forest biomass is the major source of renewable energy utilised in Estonia with a share of 11.6% (corresponding to 95% of the renewables). Black liquor constitutes 4.4% of renewables and other renewables (biogas, hydro and wind) 0.7% only. Firewood corresponds to the major share of wood fuels utilised in Estonia. The share of refined wood fuels, such as briquettes and 16 www.stat.ee ",
        "66 pellets, is still marginal (below 1%), in spite of the quite large production capacity. Black liquor is utilised in one pulp plant only. Regarding wood utilised as fuel, a great part of available volumes of traditional wood biomass is already used for energy production. The availability of wood fuel has thus become a main problem for new bioenergy projects. At short-term, an option could be a wider use of harvesting residues not used presently. At longer-term, energy crops, short rotation forests, straw and reed could be utilised. 3.26 0.72 0.67 0.49 0.06 0.01 -0.16 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 Mtoe Oil shale Liquid fuels Natural gas Wood fuels Fuel peat Other fuels Electricity Fig. 4.6: Structure of primary energy supply, Estonia (Source: Tallinn University of Technology) 287.1 208.1 102.2 27.7 2.2 0.6 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Firewood Wood waste Wood chips Black liquor Wood briquettes Wood pellets 1 0 0 0 t o e Fig. 4.7: Energy market (Estonia), Current energy use of biomass (2004) (Source Tallinn University of Technology) ",

For this reason, the Renewable Energies Unit started in 2006 a new activity of regional assessment of bioenergy production and potential. This activity is still at an early phase of methodological development. Among the objectives, we find the regional characterisation of the crops or crops associations feasible for energetic conversion as well as the assessment of the bioenergy potential in selected European regions. Specific attention will also be paid to the documentation of the bioenergy support schemes. The data collection will start with one region per EU Member State. The preliminary list of biomass resources for the Regional Biomass Resource Assessment Questionnaire can be found in the Annex. ",
        "69 Chapter 5 HEAT FROM RENEWABLE ENERGIES J.J. Bloem 5.1 Introduction The European Community aims to promote renewable energies, in order to improve the security of energy supply, improving competitiveness and promoting research and industrial development in Europe as well as improving our environment. As referred to in the recent Green Paper \"A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy\u201d, the international energy situation and Europe\u2019s dependence on imported energy remind us of the urgency to increase the production and use of alternative energies, including renewable energies [EC 2006]. Since 1997, the Commission is working towards the objective of 12% of renewable energies in the EU energy balance by 2010. While the EU has set legislation on the promotion of electricity generation from renewable energy sources (with an objective of the share of electricity produced by renewable energy of 21% by 2010) and for the promotion of biofuels (with an objective of 5.75% by 2010), the production of heating and cooling from renewable energy has so far not been the subject of specific EU legislation. Fossil fuels are dominating the market of heating of buildings and air-to-air heat pumps dominating the market of cooling of buildings. However in February 2006, the European Parliament adopted, with an overwhelming majority, a resolution and a report with recommendations by Mrs. Mechthild Rothe (MEP) asking the European Commission to table a Directive proposal to promote Heating and Cooling from renewable energy sources. A draft of this Directive might become available during the winter of 2006-2007. Although renewable energies heat technologies have been known for centuries, even before the industrial revolution, it has become of political interest again after the oil crisis in the 70s. The technologies presented below for application in the built environment are distinguished based on the primary energy source, e.g. solar radiation, the heat from the earth and the heat from burning biomass. In addition, each technology is characterised by its application (system or plant) size and technology, ranging from small domestic systems to large industrial or commercial systems for combined heat and power energy production. It is therefore often difficult to present data in a coherent way. The European Renewable Energy Council (EREC) recently drafted a resolution, the RES-H Joint Declaration, which calls for a more proactive approach and a policy framework by the European Commission [Ere 2006]. The main message is that 25 % 17 of the EU heating and cooling supply could be provided by renewable energies in 2020, if the EU sets the right policy framework in due time. In May 2006, the European Energy Commissioner Mr Piebalgs gave his strong political support to the launch of the European Solar Thermal Technology Platform, which he called \u201cvital to secure the competitiveness of our industry\u201d. 17 EREC is adjusting this number to 20% as the target for the year 2020. ",
        "70 5.2 Data on heat from renewable energies. Some basic knowledge on heat energy is needed to put the RES heat in the right perspective. According to Eurostat in 2003 the total end use of net heat and electricity was 32.1 EJ in Europe 32 \u2013 approximately 55% of the total energy use of 57.3 EJ (Fig. 5.1). For the same year the heat demand alone was estimated to be 21.7 EJ. Heat dominates energy end use. Despite its relevant share in the total heat demand, the domestic hot water consumption remains an unknown factor, as no recent and reliable survey regarding this consumption exists. A detailed assessment of this parameter at national and European level would contribute to a better understanding of the heat market. Renewable Energy Primary Sources share Solar Wind Geothermal Hydro Biomass w ood Biomass others+ w aste Fig. 5.1: About 50% of the RE share is to produce heat. Data Source: Elaborated data from Eurostat One of the major problems for statistics is that measured data on heat in the building sector are hardly available. Most of the information about domestic thermal energy is derived from empirical methods. Because of this lack of data and knowledge, heating from renewable energy has several barriers to overcome. Two running EC projects, K4RES-H and THERRA are trying to compile and assess more up-to-date information on renewable energies heat production and consumption. In addition the ECOHEATCOOL project uses databases of the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Eurostat as information sources. The comparison with national and/or Euroheat & Power statistics show that national information about district heat is not always properly transferred to international statistics, because of overlapping or restricted definitions. For example, district heat deliveries in Germany, France and Italy are not properly reported to the EUROSTAT database. As a result, the heat deliveries in the target area are substantially underestimated \u2013 by approximately one fourth (the domestic heat sector in the three countries accounts for 120 TWh out of a total of approx 550 TWh). ",
        "71 A frequently referred database is EurObeserv\u2019ER 18 , where data are collected from different sources, e.g. national agencies, industry associations and national statistics offices. The data in this chapter uses most recent data from the different industry associations. 5.3 Renewable Energies - Heat technologies In order to describe the different specific technologies clear definitions are required. An introduction how to measure heat is given in the Annex. 5.3.1 Definitions The term \"Renewable Heat\" covers all heat that is the result of a conversion process of renewable resources or that contain renewable resources (waste or hybrid power plants). It is important to describe the conversion processes or systems, including the conversion efficiency and the renewable energy input resource. A schematic impression of the conversion chain is given in Figure 5.2. Note that the auxiliary energy on the input side might have its origin from different resources as will become clear at a later stage. Input side Auxiliary Conversion Output side Primary resource Energy Efficiency [%] Mtoe or MWth Fig. 5.2: Schematic conversion chain The following heat resources are defined as renewable: solar thermal, geothermal, biomass (solid, liquid and gas and the bio-degradable part of municipal or industrial waste). A more detailed discussion on the renewable heat resources will be under the specific sections. Each of these technologies has specific conversion systems that might differ in size, conversion efficiency, etc. An important issue is the definition of the renewable heat on the output side that will be used for statistical purposes. Considered under renewable heat is the heat produced after the first conversion, thus not considering distribution or storage of heat. This is somewhat in analogy to electricity production in which case the useful fraction or distribution losses are not taken into account as well. Distribution losses might be reported separately. It has to be noted that Eurostat and IEA report only the figures on renewable energy heat from the input side. In the built environment one may distinguish, based on the resource, three technologies: 18 http://www.energies-renouvelables.org/ ",
        "72 \u2022 Solar Thermal , the heat from the sun. In the context of this document passive solar or solar cooling applications are not considered. Solar heat can be applied to domestic or industrial applications for the production of hot water, space heating, industrial processes like drying, cleaning, etc. \u2022 Geothermal , deep geothermal and shallow geothermal to exploit the heat from the earth. Renewable heat from geothermal systems is converted from the heat that is stored under the solid surface of the earth. Heat pumps are conversion systems often used in geothermal systems and will be addressed more in detail in the specific section. \u2022 Biomass heat from wood pellets, chips or logs and in some minor cases from biogas. Liquid forms are not considered in this document. In addition one may consider waste as a separate resource: \u2022 Waste : The biodegradable part of municipal or industrial waste is taken into account, although not all countries consider this form as renewable as being electricity or heat. Table 5.1 Application areas for RES \u2013 Heat in the built environment Residential (small size plants) Tertiary (large size plants) District and CHP (very large plants) Solar Thermal X X - Geo Thermal - X X Biomass X X X In the following sections the technologies are briefly presented and recent data available are given. 5.3.2 Solar Energy Solar energy technologies may be distinguished in: \u2022 Passive technology, e.g. building design, urban planning. \u2022 Active technologies e.g. solar thermal (and photovoltaics; out of the scope of this chapter). Passive solar energy technology by definition does not need auxiliary energy to perform and is related to careful design taking into consideration the location, climate and level of solar radiation. Already centuries ago buildings were constructed in such a way that thermal mass and solar radiation were matching the need for a comfortable environment to live and work in. It is during the last half century that an energy- careful design has received less importance due to the availability of appliances that provide and control a comfortable indoor environment. Note that electricity consumption for air conditioning units and hot water systems is increasing rapidly despite rising energy costs. Although a very important aspect of energy saving using solar radiation as primary energy resource, the passive solar technology is in general not considered as a renewable energy technology. Concerning solar thermal systems the market is doing very well. Solar thermal systems in the built environment are used for: \u2022 Domestic Hot Water systems (DHW), being the major application. ",
        "73 \u2022 Space Heating, mainly in Northern Europe \u2022 Space Cooling in the Mediterranean area The applied solar thermal technology can be distinguished in: \u2022 Flat glazed thermo-siphon systems of about 2 \u2013 3 m 2 can be found mostly in Southern Europe. \u2022 Flat glazed forced circulation systems of about 2 \u2013 6 m 2 are installed in Mid- and Northern Europe. \u2022 Evacuated Tube Collectors which have about 15% higher efficiency than the flat plate collector in south Europe and about 30% in northern Europe. \u2022 Unglazed collectors. Evacuated Tube Collectors take about 10% of the total collector sales in 2005 and are expected to become more popular. By far, most of the systems are used for Domestic Hot Water (90%). Other applications are space heating (in almost all cases these are combination systems) and pool water heating (mostly by unglazed collectors). Solar thermal data (Fig. 5.3 and 5.4 ) are available from the European Solar Thermal Industry Federation 19 (ESTIF) and are usually expressed in square metres (m 2 ) sold or installed area. The International Energy Agency's Solar Heating & Cooling Programme, together with ESTIF and other major solar thermal trade associations, have decided to publish future statistics in MW th (Megawatt thermal) and have agreed to use a factor of 0.7 kW th /m 2 to convert square meters of collector area into MW th Fig. 5.3 Solar thermal capacity in 2005. Source ESTIF In 2005, almost 1,400 MW th of solar thermal capacity (2 million m 2 of collector area) was newly installed in Europe \u2013 26% more than in the previous year. The traditional lead markets Germany, Austria and Greece, are responsible for about \u00be of the operational capacity in Europe and have all performed well in 2005. Some very good developments in several of the high-potential markets like France and Spain can 19 www.estif.org ",
        "74 be noted. At the end of 2005, the total capacity in operation in the EU and Switzerland was 11,175 MWth (15.9 \u00b7 10 6 m 2 of collector area) [Est 2006]. Fig. 5.4 Share of solar thermal market in 2005. Source ESTIF The Spanish implementation of the EC Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings [EU 2002a], with the new technical building code (CTE) [CTE 2006] includes an obligation to cover 30-70% of the Domestic Hot Water (DHW) demand with solar thermal energy. It is expected that this will support the boom in the solar collector market in Europe. In addition the European certification scheme, the Solar Keymark [Est 2005] for solar thermal collectors (EN 12975) and factory made systems (EN 12976) is more and more accepted, both by the industry and by public authorities. 5.3.3 Geothermal Energy Renewable heat from geothermal systems is converted from the heat that is stored under the solid surface of the earth. Heat pumps are conversion systems often used in geothermal systems. The technological developments of recent years have opened new ways to use the heat in the interior of our planet. The results achieved by scientists working on the European Hot-Dry-Rock research projects raise the expectation that electric power will soon be produced from geothermal energy throughout Europe at economically and ecologically acceptable conditions, not only in regions known for high ground temperatures. ",
        "75 In some regions of Europe geothermal power plants already contribute substantially to an environmentally friendly and sustainable energy supply, using existing technologies exploiting steam and hot water reservoirs. These sites are mainly in Italy, the Azores, other islands of volcanic origin in Europe and Iceland. In Iceland geothermal energy will be one of the two pillars upon which will be built a fully renewable energy supply. In South-East Europe, Turkey and the Caucasian region further huge, yet chiefly unexploited reservoirs may contribute to a sustainable energy supply. New ideas and technologies will secure a dependable supply of clean drinking water. Deep and hot aquifers can be used as a supply for energy and drinking water as well. Heat supply from geothermal energy in Europe is primarily realised by using hot water from: \u2022 Deep aquifers with temperatures up to 150 \u00baC for district heating, etc., or \u2022 Small to medium shallow, low temperature geothermal plants using heat pumps. Shallow geothermal also supports the use of solar energy for heating, through underground storage of solar heat from summertime until its use in winter, and offers many other opportunities of long-term thermal energy storage. In total, only a minuscule portion of the potential of geothermal energy is as yet explored and in use in Europe. Targets for a geothermal energy development are given in Table 5.2. Often these plants produce heat and power. For this reason data is given for heat and electricity. Table 5.2 Heat and electricity from geothermal.

Geothermal heat pumps, or Ground Coupled Heat Pumps (GCHP), are systems combining a heat pump with a ground heat exchanger (closed loop systems) or fed by ground water from a well (open loop systems). The ground heat exchanger may either be a horizontal pipe placed within a ditch or a vertical pipe placed within a borehole. The latter is termed as a Borehole Heat Exchanger (BHE ) . These systems use the earth as a heat source when operating in heating mode, with a fluid (usually water or a water-antifreeze-mixture) as the media transferring the heat from the earth to the evaporator of the heat pump, utilizing 20 European Geothermal Energy Council www.egec.org ",
        "76 in that way geothermal energy. In the cooling mode, they use the earth as a heat sink. For each kWh of heating or cooling output, they currently require 0.22 \u2013 0.35 kWh electricity, which is 30%-50% less than the seasonal power consumption of air-to-air heat pumps, which use the atmosphere as a heat source/sink [Gro 2006]. Note that the electricity required can have different resources too, which might be renewable, like in Scandinavian countries. Since the auxiliary consumption is more than 5% of the produced energy it needs to be reported. The European Heat Pump Association 21 (EHPA) represents the interests of the European heat pump industry. The introduction of ground coupled heat pumps in the built environment is investigated and stimulated through the EC - GROUNDREACH project [Ehp 2006] The ratio of useful energy over electricity consumption of a heat pump at given operating conditions is defined as the \u201cCoefficient of Performance\u201d (COP). The COP or energy efficiency of a heat pump depends on the temperature of the input water from the ground circuit, which depends on geological conditions (thermal and hydraulic parameters of the underground, climatic setting) and technical parameters (length and type of ground heat exchanger, material, type and quality of grouting, etc.). Other factors that affect the COP of a heat pump are the heating/cooling load, the type of the building heating/cooling system and the relevant supply temperatures.

With BHE as a heat source or sink, geothermal heat pumps can offer both heating and cooling at any location, with great flexibility to meet any demand. More than 20 years of R&D focusing on BHE in Europe resulted in a well-established concept of sustainability for this technology, as well as sound design and installation criteria. Use of geothermal heat pumps in Europe is limited to operation for heating mainly, corresponding to only a fraction of total residential heating demand. Sweden is market leader of the geothermal heat pump technology. Table 5.4 EU Geothermal Electricity Production (2004).

However biomass is a complex matter. As another source of indirect solar energy biomass is plant biomass (i.e. wood, residuals, processed waste, processed fuel) or animal biomass. Plants use solar energy during photosynthesis, and store it as organic material as they grow. Burning or gasifying biomass reverses the process and releases the energy, which can then be used to generate heat or electricity, or can provide fuel for transportation. One may distinguish solid, liquid and gaseous forms of biomass. In several countries municipal or industrial waste is considered under the biomass technologies, other countries treat it as a separate item in their statistics. Biomass includes wood-fuels, agricultural energy crops and residues, municipal waste, black liquor, commercial and non-commercial, liquid and gaseous biofuels. Woodfuels include fuelwood, forestry and mill residues, energy plantations like willow, poplar, eucalyptus etc. and charcoal and pellets made from such woodfuels. ",
        "78 Agricultural energy crops and residues include herbaceous and perennial plants like miscantus, reed grass, rapeseed, bagasse, straw, stalks, husks and dung and pellets made thereof. Biogas comprises an estimate of all commercial and non-commercial sources directly used or supplied to pipelines, fuel cells stations etc. Its calorific value is part of total biomass. Biogas includes landfill and sludge gas, digester gas, gasified biomass, etc. as sub-products of total biomass. There are several processes by which biomass is converted into a usable energy. The simplest, fairly inefficient and widely utilized in the developing world, is for the provision of heat, primarily for cooking and as a rudimentary source of lighting. Some of the new cooking-stoves are able to capture over 40% of the potential energy in wood, compared to the less than 10% conversion rate of traditional models. In colder climates especially in Scandinavia, Germany and Austria, domestic biomass fired heating systems are used fairly extensively. Some of these can achieve efficiencies of up to 70% with strongly reduced atmospheric emissions - considerable efficiencies over open fireplaces with chimneys due to the heat losses associated with chimneys. The Biomass Action Plan [EC 2005] recognises the importance of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants and district heating and cooling as an important technology to optimise the use of biomass. The heat produced is considered as an inevitable by- product of electricity production. CHP plants run on biomass, others on fossil fuel, with the common thread being increased efficiency. These cogeneration plants typically burn a fuel to create electricity but rather than just venting the \"waste\" heat into the environment they hold onto it and use it to heat buildings and water. Some industrial plants like paper mills can use the residual steam, after it has turned a turbine, instead of boiling water with an entirely different system. Cogeneration plants can be tailored to a variety of sizes, from micro-single farm operations to standard electric utilities that supply heat to a whole town.

        "79 To achieve the RES 12% target 74 Mtoe more are needed by 2010. Each sector has to contribute the following indicative additional amount of biomass energy: electricity 32 Mtoe, heat 24 Mtoe, and biofuels 18 Mtoe. This would lead to a total biomass accumulated energy production of 130 Mtoe in 2010. [EC 2005] Data on biomass heat is difficult to assess. An example is given in Table 5.5 for the heat production and consumption in 2003 in Europe and for individual countries. The data shows that Germany does not report heat from biomass or solar thermal, but only from geothermal and waste. The reasons may be manifold. Larger plants are often CHP plants connected to district heat networks. Smaller and often residential plants are seldom measured while data, if available, have to be estimated from fuel sales figures. According to Eurostat data [EST 2006a] about 10% of electricity and heat is produced by CHP from renewable energies, mostly biomass. According to the European Biomass Industry Association 22 (EUBIA), 98% of RES heat in Europe is produced from bioenergy. The wood energy barometer applied by EurObserver presents primary energy figures from wood energy but does not distinguish between electricity and heat. However the increased development of CHP plants is mentioned. For 2004 the international association for bio-energy professionals 23 (ITEBE) reports a wood energy production in EU-25 of 55.4 Mtoe (or 3.2% of the primary energy consumption), divided into 80.6 % for heating and 19.4% for electricity production. It is expected that by 2020 the biomass heat production might reach 100Mtoe, roughly double the 2005 figures. This remains, however, far behind the estimated target of 100 Mtoe in 2010, based on the White Paper target. The objective of the Biomass Action Plan [EC 2005] for heat from biomass is set at 75 Mtoe and more realistic. From some countries detailed data are available like Austria. The Austrian Energy Agency GmbH 24 reports that around 70% of Austria's domestically produced power came from renewable sources in 2005. About 11.2% of Austria's total primary energy supply came from biomass and 21% of heat production, according to International Energy Agency statistics. Europe's largest wood-fired power plant is situated in Vienna, supplying 5,000 households with electricity and 12,000 with heat. 5.4 Conclusion Moreover discrepancies in the use of definitions and reporting procedures when it comes to data collection at European level appear. The resulting misinterpretations are carried forward in energy modelling exercises which might lead to wrong conclusions and development of inappropriate tools for implementing targeted policies. The conclusion is that international heat statistics must be improved urgently. 22 www.eubia.org 23 http://www.itebe.org 24 www.energyagency.at ",
        "80 Chapter 6 PHOTOVOLTAIC SOLAR ELECTRICITY Arnulf J\u00e4ger-Waldau 6.1 Introduction In 2005, the photovoltaic industry continued its impressive growth and delivered world-wide some 1,700 MWp [Pvn 2006] of photovoltaic generators (Fig. 6.1). In the past 5 years, the average annual world growth rate was above 40%, making the further increase of production facilities an attractive investment for industry. An investment report published in 2004 by Credit Lyonnais Security Asia forecasts that the photovoltaics sector has a realistic potential to expand from \u20ac 5.6 billion 25 in 2004 to \u20ac 24 billion in 2010, corresponding to 5.3 GW p in annual sales [Rog 2004]. In the meantime the bank analyst Mr. Rogol estimates that even 10 GW of annual sales with a \u20ac 40 billion turnover of the sector could be reached in 2010 [Rog 2006]. 0,0 200,0 400,0 600,0 800,0 1000,0 1200,0 1400,0 1600,0 1800,0 United States 14,8 34,8 38,9 51,0 53,7 60,8 75,0 100,0 120,6 103,0 140 154 Rest of World 4,7 6,4 9,8 9,4 18,7 20,5 23,4 32,6 55,5 83,8 139 302 Europe 10,2 20,1 18,8 30,4 33,5 40,0 60,7 86,4 135,1 193,4 314 470 Japan 16,8 16,4 21,2 35,0 49,0 80,0 128,6 171,2 251,1 363,9 602 833 Total 46,5 77,6 88,6 125,8 154,9 201,3 287,7 390,2 561,8 744,1 1195 1759 1990 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Fig. 6.1: World PV Cell/Module Production from 1990 to 2005 (data source: PV News [Pvn 2006]) The IEA Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme reported in October 2005, that by the end of 2004 \"Total direct employment in the sector in the reporting countries may now exceed 50,000 persons, with rapid growth indicated in Germany and the USA \" [IEA 2005]. If the growth of Photovoltaics in the IEA PVPS reporting countries, as well as others like China and India are taken into account it is very likely that in 2005 the world-wide solar electricity industry already provided employment for over 70,000 people, about double the number estimated by the European Photovoltaic Industry Association (EPIA) in 2003 [Epi 2004]. 25 Exchange rate used: $ 1.25 = \u20ac 1 ",
        "81 Photovoltaic companies are attracting a growing number of private and institutional investors. The number of market studies and investment opportunities has considerably increased in the last few years and business analysts are very confident that despite raising interest rates the photovoltaics sector is in a healthy condition. 2005 and early 2006 saw an increasing number of very successful Initial Public Offerings (IPO) of solar companies. The 30 companies listed in the PPVX 26 (Photon Pholtovoltaic stock index) together have a market capitalisation of more than \u20ac 20 billion at the end of August 2006. The current solar cell technologies are well-established and provide a reliable product, with sufficient efficiency and energy output for at least 20 years of lifetime. This reliability, the increasing potential of electricity interruption due to grid overloads, as well as the rise of electricity prices from conventional energy sources, add to the attractiveness of Photovoltaic systems. About 90% of the current production uses wafer-based crystalline silicon technology. The top advantage of this technology is that complete production lines can be bought, installed and be up and producing within a relatively short time-frame. This predictable production start-up scenario constitutes a low-risk placement with high expectations for return on investments. The current temporary shortage in silicon feedstock was triggered by the extremely high growth rates of the photovoltaics industry over the last years, which was not followed by the silicon producers. Three developments can be observed at the moment: \u2022 Silicon producers have now reacted and are in the process of increasing their production capacities, which will ease the pressure on the supply side within the next two to three years. This indicates that they have recognised PV as a fully fledged industry that provides a stable business segment for the silicon industry, as opposed to being strongly dependent on the demand cycles of the microelectronics industry. \u2022 PV companies accelerate the move to thinner silicon wafers and higher efficient solar cells in order to save on the silicon demand per Wp. \u2022 Significant expansions of production capacities of existing manufacturers are under way and a large number of new thin film manufacturers try to enter the market to supply the growing demand for PV modules. Compared to 2004 thin film shipments increased by over 50% to 108 MW in 2005. In 2010 EPIA forecasts that 20% of the then 5.3 GW module shipments will be thin films [Unz 2005]. Similar to learning curves in other technology areas, new products will enter the market, enabling further cost reduction. After years of research and technology development, thin film production plants with a few hundred MW cumulative production capacities are now under construction. Equally, competitive technologies are amorphous Silicon, CdTe and CI(G)Se thin films. The growth of these technologies is accelerated by the positive development of the PV market as a whole and the current silicon wafer shortage. The expansions for the required scale-up to manufacturing units of 50 MWp annual capacity and more are under way and will now join the wafer silicon devices technology in satisfying demand [Fir 2005/6, Uni 2005/6]. It is interesting to note that not only new players are entering into thin film 26 The PPVX is a non commercial financial index published by the solar magazine \"Photon\" and \"\u00d6ko-Invest\". The index started on 1 August 2001 with 1000 points and is calculated weekly using the Euro as reference currency. Only companies which made more than 50% of their sales in the previous year with PV products or services are included [Pho 2006]. ",
        "82 production, but also established silicon-based PV cell manufacturers diversify into thin film PV. If thin film should supply 20% of the photovoltaic devices by 2010, the growth of production capacities must be about double as high as the rest of the industry, assuming that total PV growth continues at a constant of 32% per year, as predicted by the Credit Lyonnais Security Asia study. By then, Silicon wafer technology would deliver about 4,000 MWp per year, requiring 40,000 metric tons of Si-feedstock, about 40% more than today\u2019s entire world production capacities of semiconductor silicon (28,000 metric tons). Even the more conservative EPIA scenario of 27% growth would result in a silicon demand of 30,000 metric tons of Si-feedstock [Epi 2004]. These scenarios show that in order to maintain such a high growth rate, different pathways have to be pursued at the same time: \u2022 Drastic increase of solar grade silicon production capacities; \u2022 Accelerated reduction of material consumption per silicon solar cell and Wp, e.g. higher efficiencies, thinner wafers, less wafering losses, etc.; \u2022 Accelerated introduction of thin film solar cell technologies into the market and capacity growth rates above the normal trend. Further cost reduction will depend not only on the scale-up benefits, but also on the cost of the encapsulation system, if module efficiency remains limited to below 15%, stimulating strong demand for very low area-proportional costs. 6.2 World View In 2005 the photovoltaic market grew again by more than 45%. Most of the installations were sited in Germany, but additional markets like California, Spain and Italy added to it. The new industry policy for Photovoltaics in the People\u2019s Republic of China, and the ongoing consolidation of the PV industry by merger and acquisition, are hot topics for the market. The current silicon shortage and the related price rise of the wafers forced the solar cell manufacturers to sign long term supply contracts with considerable down payments to finance the capacity expansion. At the same time that new thin film production capacities are under construction, new thin film manufacturers are entering the scene and established silicon-based PV cell manufacturers diversify into thin film PV to reduce their exposure to future consequences of this development. The Photovoltaic world market grew again by more than 45% in 2005 to 1,759 MW. Like in the case of 2004, Germany was the largest single market with 603 MW followed by Japan with 291 MW and the US with 108 MW [Sys 2006, Jpe 2006, Pvn 2006]. The revised German Feed-in Law [EEG 2004] went into force on 1 August 2004. The transitional arrangement before, and the revision itself resulted in a dramatic increase in PV installations. The German Solar Industry Association estimates that new grid connected systems with a capacity of about 600 MW were installed in 2005. Photon reported systems installations with a total of about 710 MW [Pho 2006]. Even with the more conservative 603 MW installed photovoltaic systems (including off grid installations) Germany accounted for more than 93% of the EU 25. Despite the fact that the European PV production grew again by 50% and reached 470 MW, the extreme growth of the German market did not change the role of Europe as a net importer of solar cells and/or modules. The ongoing capacity expansions ",
        "83 might change this in the future. In February 2006 SolarWorld announced to take over the silicon wafer based solar business of Shell Solar [Sol 2006]. Between 2001 and 2005 PV installations in the European Union increased six-fold to reach almost 1.8 GW cumulative installed capacity at the end of 2005. More than 85% of the total PV installations in the EU were placed in Germany. With a three- year programme from 2002 to 2004, Luxembourg propelled itself to World Champion and leads the statistics in terms of installed PV with 52.4 Wp per capita. Due to a new legal situation, there was no significant addition of PV capacity in 2005. Nevertheless, if the enlarged European Union, as a whole, would have the same PV quota per capita as Luxembourg, 26.4 GWp installed PV or about 26.4 TWh (0.93% of total EU energy consumption in 2002) per year could be achieved. Q-Cells (DE) 9,4% Schott Solar 5,4% BP Solar 5,0% Suntech (PRC) 4,7% Motech (TW) 3,4% Shell Solar 3,4% Mitsubishi Electric (JP) 5,7% Kyocera (JP) 8,1% Sanyo (JP) 7,1% Others 23,5% 414 MW Sharp (JP) 24,3% 428 MW Fig. 6.2: Top 10 Photovoltaic companies in 2005 (total shipments in 2005: 1759 MW) [Pvn 2006] Please note that BP Solar, Schott Solar and Shell Solar have cell production capacities in more than one country. The second biggest market with 291.1 MW of new installations was Japan with a 8.3% growth rate compared to 2004. The lower than usual growth rate was mainly due to the completion of the Residential PV System Dissemination Programme in October 2005. This programme had supported the expansion of Japan's PV market for the past 12 years. 89% or 260.4 MW of the new installations were grid connected residential systems bringing the accumulated power of solar systems under the Japanese PV residential programme to 1095 MW out of 1,420 MW total installed PV capacity at the end of FY 2005 [Ikk 2005, Jpe 2006]. At the same time Japanese exports increased by 65% to 528 MW with 386.8 MW being exported to Europe [Jpe 2006]. The world market share of Photovoltaic devices manufactured in Japan decreased slightly by 2.6% to 47.4%, but four of the Top Ten companies are Japanese (Fig. 6.2). For FY 2006 the PV industry is confident that, even without subsidies, the residential market will show an increase due to the trend to fully electrified houses ",
        "84 and new Renewable Portfolio Standard with an increased amount of electricity generated from renewable energy sources. Sharp Corporation continues to dominate the PV scene with more than 24% market share and a production capacity of 500 MW/year in FY 2005, and it can be expected that this will not change in 2006 [Ikk 2006]. In addition, it is interesting to note that Sharp finally announced the start of their large scale thin film production in September 2005 [Sha 2005]. The ten largest PV manufacturers together held 76.5% of the market, whereas the rest was shared by over 30 different companies. The third largest market was the USA with 108 MW of PV installations, 65 MW grid connected [Pvn 2006a]. California and New Jersey account for 90% of the US grid connected PV market. There is no single market for PV in the United States, but a conglomeration of regional markets and special applications for which PV offers the most cost-effective solution. Until 2002, the US PV market was dominated by off-grid applications, such as remote residential power, industrial applications, telecommunications and infrastructure, such as highway and pipeline lighting or buoys. In 2005 the cumulative installed capacity of grid-connected PV systems surpassed that of off-grid systems. Since 2002 the grid connected market is growing much faster thanks to a wide range of \u201cbuy-down\u201d programmes, sponsored either by States or utilities. After the first Chinese (Taiwan) company MOTECH reached the top 10 list in 2004, Suntech Power (PRC) followed in 2005. On 2 August 2006, Suntech Power signed an agreement to buy the Japanese PV module manufacturer MSK [Msk 2006]. Suntech bought a two third stake in the 3 rd quarter of 2006, with the option to buy it completely in 2007. The People\u2019s Republic of China and Taiwan together produced 210 MW in 2005, almost tripling the 75 MW production of 2004 and surpassing the US production of 154 MW. The market in the PRC is still quite small, but is expected to grow drastically within the next few years. The goal is to supply 10% of the total primary energy in 2020 by renewable energy. To reach this goal the build up of a renewable energy and photovoltaics industry is supported by a renewable energy industry policy, as well as a feed-in law for electricity from renewable energy. Figure 6.3 shows the announced and estimated increase of production capacities by 2007. The figures are taken from press releases [Bps 2004, Kyo 2005, Mit 2004, Qce 2004, Sun 2005], company web-sites, public reports [Ikk 2005, Pvn 2006b] or extrapolated from the production increases of the companies during the last years. It has to be noted that the assessment of all the capacity increases is rather difficult as it is affected by the uncertainties given below. The announcements of the increase in production capacity in Europe, the US or China often lack the information about completion date compared to Japan. Because of the Japanese mentality where it is felt that a public announcement reflects a commitment, the moral pressure to meet a given time target is higher in Japan than elsewhere where delays are more acceptable. In the case of Sharp, the prediction is probably too low, taking into account their dominating role in the PV industry. Not all companies announce their capacity increases in advance. Therefore, this report might miss out on a major increase if it is well above normal predictions. Announcements of completion of a capacity increase frequently refer to the installation of the equipment only. It does not mean that the production line is really fully operational. This means, especially with new technologies, that there can be some time delay between installation of the production line and real sales of solar cells. In addition, the production capacities are often announced, taking into account different operation models such as number of shifts, operating hours per year, etc. ",

The given figure for Sharp is the one most likely to approximate actual production, whereas others might just give the capacity installed in the factory at the end of the year even though it is not yet operational. Despite the fact that only limited comparisons between the different world regions are possible, the planned cell production capacities for 2007 portray some very interesting developments. First of all, should the announced increases be realised, total production capacities will then stand at 5 GW of which roughly 600 MW could be thin films. The more than doubling of the 2005 silicon production figures has serious implications on the silicon feedstock demand and it is expected that not enough feedstock will be available to guarantee full operation of the 4.4 GW production capacity in 2008. Secondly, 11 companies have plans to increase their production capacities to 200 MW, or more by the end of 2007. Four companies even plan to have 400 MW and more (Sharp, Kyocera, Sanyo and Q-Cells) compared to only one company (Sharp) at present. It is very interesting to note that three out of the eleven companies aiming for 200 MW and more are from the People\u2019s Republic of China and Taiwan. This leads to a third observation. If the large increase in production capacity is realised in China, the share on the world market would increase from 11.9% in 2005 to about 20 % or 1 GW in 2007. This production capacity would be much more than the 450 MW of cumulative installed solar systems in the People\u2019s Republic of China by 2010, as announced at the International Conference for Renewable Energies in Bonn [Bon 2004]. It is obvious that the solar cell manufacturers in China intend to ",
        "86 continue the high export rate (90% in 2005) of their production to the growing markets in Europe, the US and developing countries. Europe is on track to fulfil its targets for 2010, which were however not as ambitious as the Japanese 4.8 GW one. In view of enlargement and the remarkable market growth these targets should be revised upwards. The introduction of the German Feed-in Law in 1999 and its renewal in 2004 [EEG 2004], led to a significant change in the frame conditions for investors and has been one of the major driving forces behind European growth. Since 1999 European PV production has grown on average by 50% per annum and reached about 470 MW in 2005. The European market share rose during the same time from 20% to 26.7%, whereas the US share decreased due to a weak home market and the Japanese share increased and stabilised around 50 \u00b1 3%. The European PV industry has to continue its high growth over the next years in order to maintain that level. This will, however, only be possible if reliable political frame conditions are put in place in the rest of Europe as well to enable a return on investment for the PV industry. Besides this political issue, a continuous improvement of the solar cell and system technology is required. This leads to the search for new developments with respect to material use and consumption, device design, reliability and production technologies, as well as new concepts to increase overall efficiency. 6.3 Market and Implementation in the European Union The market conditions for photovoltaics differ substantially from country to country. This is due to different energy policies and public support programmes for renewable energies and especially photovoltaics, as well as the varying grade of liberalisation of domestic electricity markets. A complete list of support schemes for Photovoltaics is given in the Annex. Between 2001 and 2005, installations of Photovoltaic systems in the European Union increased six fold to reach almost 1.8 GW cumulative installed capacity at the end of 2005 (Fig. 6.4) [Sys 2006]. In 2005, like in 2004, Germany was the largest single market with 603 MW, followed by Spain with 20.2 MW and France with a little over 6.3 MW [Sys 2006]. The revised German Feed-in Law [EEG 2004] went into force on 1 August 2004. The transitional arrangement before and the revision itself resulted in a dramatic increase in PV installations. For 2005 the German Solar Industry Association estimates that new grid connected systems with a capacity of about 600 MW were installed. Photon reported systems installations with a total of about 710 MW [Pho 2006]. Even with the more conservative 603 MW installed photovoltaic systems (including off grid installations) Germany accounted for more than 93% of the EU 25 (Fig. 6.4). Spain almost doubled from 2004, and for 2006 and 2007 projects with about 200 MW are already under construction or planned [Pho 2006a]. On 26 August 2005, the Spanish Government approved the Plan de Energ\u00edas Renovables en Espa\u00f1a (PER) for 2005 \u2013 2010. The objectives are to cover 12.1% of Spain's overall energy needs and 30.3% of total electricity consumption with renewable energy sources by 2010. The cap on PV of 150 MW set by the Royal Decree 436/2004, dated 12 March 2004, was increased to 400 MW by 2010. ",

After the end of the first quarter of 2006, applications with more than 1.3 GW were submitted to the \"implementing body\" Gestore del Sistema Elettrico (GRTN SpA.), 2.6 times more than the 500 MW cap up to 2012, but it is estimated that between 50 and 80 MW might be installed at most this year. France is the latest of the large European Member States to introduce an attractive and cost competitive feed-in tariff for PV installations integrated in a building. The new feed-in tariffs have been in force since 26 July 2006, but is only valid for new installations. The general tariff is 0.30 \u20ac/ kWh (0.40 \u20ac/kWh in Overseas Departments and Corsica) for 20 years. For building integrated PV installations there is a supplement of 0.25 \u20ac/kWh (0.15 \u20ac/kWh in Ov erseas Departments and Corsica). In addition, 50% of the investment costs are tax deductible and a lower VAT of 5.5% on system costs (without labour) is applied. Accelerated depreciation of PV systems is possible for enterprises. Regional support is still possible. The 5% tariff digression for new installations was cancelled. All tariffs (old and new) will be adjusted annually in accordance to the inflation during their duration. With a three year-programme from 2002 to 2004, Luxembourg propelled itself to World Champion and leads the statistics in terms of installed PV with 52.4 Wp per capita. Due to a new legal situation there was no significant addition of PV capacity in 2005. Nevertheless, if the enlarged European Union as a whole would have the same PV quota per capita as Luxembourg, 26.4 GWp installed PV or about 26.4 TWh (0.93% of total EU energy consumption in 2002) per year could be achieved.

        "88 Despite the fact that the European PV production grew again by 50% and reached 470 MW, the extreme growth of the German market did not change the role of Europe as a net importer of solar cells and/or modules. The ongoing capacity expansions might change this in the future. In February 2006 SolarWorld announced it would take over the silicon wafer based solar business of Shell Solar [Sol 2006]. But it has to be noted that the European PV industry is much more fragmented than competitors in the US and Japan (Fig. 6.5). Schott Solar (DE) 17,4% Deutsche Cell (DE) 8,1% ErSol (DE) 4,3% Shell Solar (DE) 3,6% Sunways (DE) 3,4% Isofoton (ES) 11,3% Antec (DE) 1,7% Q-Cells (DE) 35,3% 166 MW Helios (IT) 1,1% Photowatt (FR) 5,1% Photovoltech (BE) 2,6% BP Solar (ES) 3,6% Others 1,5% Eni Technologies (IT) 1,1% Fig. 6.5: Shares of the European PV companies in European production (2005: 470 MW, this corresponds to 26.7% of the world-wide sales) [Pvn 2006] The question regarding the number of photovoltaic systems installed where is getting more and more difficult to answer. Already last year the reported figures for the German installations in 2004 varied from an initial 360 MW reported by the German Solar Industry Association (BSW), and then revised to 500 MW, whereas Photon International reported up to 770 MW [Pho 2005]. The problem started with the end of the German interest reduced loan programme in June 2003. No method was in place to register the number of PV systems installed and the dramatic increase of installations after the revision of the German feed-in law, took everybody by surprise. The discrepancies in the reported data arise from the different data collection methods, ranging from installer surveys to grid operator surveys and inverter sales statistics. Unfortunately, the annual statement of the German grid operators (VDN) on the kWhs actually produced cannot be used either, as it is not available before October of the following year and in the last years it was even corrected after that. Therefore, it is difficult to verify the different numbers. ",
        "89 For 2004 VDN reported 556.5 GWh of electricity generated from photovoltaic electricity systems. To calculate the new installation from the actual electricity generated, the following assumptions are made: 1) The average production of a 1 kWp system is 800 kWh (850 kWh) per year. 2) The 2003 figures of 408 MW grid connected are correct. 3) In 2005 the system installations were equally distributed during the year. This means that for the calculation each kWp installed in 2004 contributes with 400 kWh (425 kWh) to the calculation. The calculation therefore looks as follows: The 408 MW installed at the end of 2003 produced 326.4 GWh (346.8 GWh). The new systems installed in 2004 have produced 230 GWh (209.7 GWh) which translates to 575 MW (494 MW) of new installations. This calculation indicates that it is very likely that the revised BSW numbers are close to the actual installations but still have an uncertainty margin. An updated list of support measures for Photovoltaics in the European Union Member States is listed in the Annex. As shown in the Annex, 15 out of 25 Member States already have introduced feed- in tariffs. However, the efficiency of this measure to increasingly exploit these countries\u2019 PV-potential varies considerably in function of the details in each national regulation. In those States where the tariff does not cover the expenses, impact is very limited. In some other States, there is a motivating tariff, but its effectiveness is limited due to \u2022 too early a fulfilled cap, \u2022 too short a period of validity for the guaranteed increased tariff, or \u2022 administrative requirements being too complicated or even obstructive. Only in those countries in which the tariff has been high, and a set cap realistic enough, have PV installations increased and competition in production and trade developed substantially. From the socio-economic data at hand, feed-in tariffs should be designed to potentially enable a pay-back of the initial investment within 10 to 12 years and should be combined with a built-in \u201csun-set\u201d. Such a decrease of the guaranteed tariff by a certain percentage each year compensates early technology users, enforces realistic price reductions if well designed, and offers a long-term perspective for investors and producers of solar systems. The New Member States and Candidate Countries still have much lower installation figures, despite good to very good solar resources, in some States with up to 1,600 kWh/kWp (Cyprus, Malta, Romania, Bulgaria, and South-east Hungary). Even in the Baltic States yearly average values of more than 800 kWh per year are possible for a 1 kWp system, which is comparable to Northern Germany [Sur 2004]. An important advantage for feed-in tariffs comes to light when analysing the effectiveness with which individuals are motivated \u2013 i.e. hundreds and thousands of private (domestic) investors, who have relatively easy access to grid connection, standardised accountability and last but not least, neighbourhood pride \u2013 an ideal situation for intrinsically decentralised PV-energy. Where local common action (at village or town level) or \u201clocally centralised\u201d investment gives better revenue, the market automatically plays its efficiency-enhancing role. Developments threatening ",
        "90 electrical grid stability in terms of demand (e.g., large increase of air conditioning units in the Mediterranean EU) could be compensated much more economically, ecologically and socially balanced by decentralised generation and injection \u2013 partly avoiding expensive grid reinforcements. In addition, jobs would be created regionally in installation and maintenance businesses. Stable political and socio-economically viable frame conditions do not only convince private and commercial investors to install photovoltaic power plants, but also stimulate the investment in new production capacities for solar cells and modules. Especially in Germany and Spain, the most dynamic markets in Europe, the production capacities for solar cells and modules have increased faster than in the other European countries (Fig. 19). Since the introduction of the feed-in law in Germany, employment in the renewable energy sector has more than doubled compared to 1998. The latest figures given by the German Environment Ministry in May 2006 count more than 157,000 people employed in this sector (including Services and R&D) in 2004 and estimate 170,000 jobs in 2005 [BMU 2006]. The Photovoltaic industry accounted for approximately 30,000 jobs in 2005 [Bsw 2006]. According to an industry survey, amongst renewable energy companies in Germany, every second company plans to increase the number of employees by 30 to 100% within the next 5 years. Photovoltaic companies are amongst the most optimistic ones and in total expect a doubling of employment by 2010. In 2005 Photovoltaics accounted for a turnover in Germany of \u20ac 3 billion and 70% of the added value remained inside Germany. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 S c h o t t S o l a r I s o p h o t o n Q - C e l l s S h e l l S o l a r P h o t o w a t t B P S o l a r D e u t s c h e C e l l E r S o l S u n w a y s P h o t o v o l t e c h O t h e r s A n n u a l P r o d u c t i o n i n [ M W p ] 1999 2002 2003 2004 2005 Fig. 6.6: Annual production of the European PV manufacturers with sales larger than 10 MWp in 2005 [Pvn 2006] It is interesting to note that since 1999, the majority of investments in solar cell production facilities in Europe were made in Germany and Spain \u2013 the two countries that offer the most stable and realistic legal framework conditions for citizens investing in a PV system. In 2005 the employment figures in Photovoltaics for the ",
        "91 European Union is estimated to be 40,000 to 42,000. These figures are estimated from the already 30,000 jobs reported for Germany [Bsw 2006] and 6,300 for Spain [IEA 2006b]. In 2005, the European Commission did an impact assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of support measures for renewable energies in the European Union. The results were published in the Communication from the Commission \"The support for electricity from renewable energy sources\" already states [EC 2005a]: The renewable energy sector is particularly promising in terms of job and local wealth creation . The sector invests heavily in research and technological innovation and generates employment, which to a very high degree means skilled, high quality jobs. Moreover, the renewable energy sector has a decentralised structure, which leads to employment in the less industrialised areas as well. Unlike other jobs, these jobs cannot be \u201cglobalised\u201d to the same extent. Even if a country were to import 100% of its renewable energy technology, a significant number of jobs would be created locally for the sale, installation and maintenance of the systems. A number of studies on the job creation effects have already been published and different estimates have been provided [Epi 2004a, Ere 2004, Ike 2005]. It is of no surprise that the studies quoted refer to the Photovoltaics industry. The German Solar Industry Association reported that despite the fact that more than 50% of the solar cells installed in PV systems in Germany are imported, 70% of the added value stay within the German economy [Bsw 2006]. Electricity generated with photovoltaic systems has additional positive benefits for the European economy in the long run. First, with increasing installations of photovoltaic systems, the generated electricity can help to reduce the import dependency of the European Union on energy imports. The already quoted impact assessment states: Rising oil prices and the concomitant general increase in energy prices reveals the vulnerability and dependency on energy imports of most economies. The European Commission\u2019s DG ECFIN predicts that a $10/bbl oil price increase from $50 to $60/bbl would cost the EU about 0.3% growth and the US 0.35% [EC 2005b]. For the European Union, the negative GDP effect would be in the order of \u20ac41.9 billion from 2005 to 2007. Further price increases would worsen the situation. The European Renewable Energy Council (EREC) estimates that \u20ac 140 billion in investment would be required to reach the 2010 goal of 12% renewable energy consumption [Ere 2004]. This would ensure fuel cost savings of \u20ac20 billion (not even taking into account the substantial price increases since 2003 27 [IEA 2006b] and reduce external costs by \u20ac30 to \u20ac77 billion. If we add th e employment benefits, the overall costs for society can be estimated to be positive compared to a negative result if no RES were introduced. There are several studies that examine the difficult issue of quantifying the effect of the inclusion of RES in an energy portfolio and the reduction in the portfolio energy price. This is in addition to the economic benefits of avoided fuel costs and external costs (GHG), money which could be spent within the economy and used for local wealth creation [Awe 2003]. Second, electricity from Photovoltaic systems is generally produced during times of peak demand, or economically speaking, when electricity is most expensive. In addition, photovoltaic electricity is produced at its best during those times when in the case of extreme heat and resulting water shortages thermoelectric power plants have to reduce their output due to a lack of cooling water. 27 Crude oil prices went up from US$26/bbl (June 2003) to over US$60 (August 2005), source: IEA ",
        "92 During the extreme heat wave in July 2006, peak prices paid at the European Electricity Exchange (EEX) spot market exceeded the feed-in tariff paid in Germany. The continuous expansion of the production capacities for solar cells is of particular importance in light of the export markets for solar systems to the rural areas in Asia, Africa and South America, where about 2 billion people are still without electricity. The Europeans should not lose this future market, also with respect to the possibility it offers for the labour market. In June 2004 the European Photovoltaic Industry Association (EPIA) published its recent photovoltaics roadmap and stated therein: \u201cFailure to act on the recommendations of this Roadmap will be a huge missed opportunity. Europe will suffer the loss of its current strong market position and potential major industry for the future. The PV industry can be of great importance to Europe in terms of wealth and employment, with 59,000 PV related jobs in the EU in 2010 if the targets are met, and a figure of 100,000 jobs would be realistic if export opportunities are exploited.\u201d According to EPIA, new PV production facilities create about 20 jobs per MW of capacity adding about 30 additional jobs per MW installed capacity in the wholesale, retail, installation and maintenance services sector. The later jobs are mostly located on a regional level near to the final customer. The goals set by EPIA in its roadmap are cumulative installed photovoltaic systems with 3.6 GWp electricity generation capacity in Europe by 2010 and the respective job numbers mentioned above would correspond to roughly 1.2 GW per year production capacity of cells and systems in the first case and roughly double in the export case. These figures look quite realistic if the planned expansions of production capacities in the order of 900 MW for 2006/7 in Europe are added to the realised production of 470 MW in 2005. A prerequisite for all such developments is that parallel to the public market introduction incentives, electricity generated by solar systems can be freely traded and attain preferential grid access. As PV systems contribute to the avoidance of climatically harmful greenhouse gases, it has to be ensured that electricity generated from solar systems be exempt from eco taxes, where applicable. In addition, one has to enable PV system operators to sell green certificates to CO 2 -producers. The European Union is on track to fulfil its own target of 3 GWp in terms of Renewable Electricity from Photovoltaics for 2010 \u2013 compared to Japan, which seeks to achieve 4.8 GWp (approx. 38 Wp per capita), however, this is not very ambitious. If the growth rates realised in the installation of PV systems between 2001 and 2005 could be maintained in the next years, the White Paper target would already be achieved in 2007 (Fig. 6.7). In 2010, total installations would then exceed 10 GWp or approx. 22 Wp per capita, which would still be less than the Japanese target of 38 Wp per capita. The adoption of the Japanese target would result in 17.25 GWp installed in 2010, which would generate around 17.25 TWh or 0.61% of total EU electricity consumption in 2002. The PV installation growth rate curve in the European Union exactly mirrors that of wind power, with a delay of approximately 12 years. The European PV industry has to continue its impressive growth over the next years in order to maintain its market position. This will only be achieved if reliable political framework conditions are created and maintained to enable return on investment for PV investors and the industry alike. Besides this political issue, targeted improvements of the solar cell and system technology are still required. ",

Since 1999 the European PV production grew on average by 50% per annum and reached about 470 MW in 2005. European market share rose in the same time from 20% to 26%, whereas the US share decreased due to a weak home market, while the Japanese share increased close to 50%. The German market was very strong again in 2005 and installations were in the range of 600 MW [Sys 2006]. A further increase of the market is expected in 2006. However, due to the limited availability of solar modules and the increasing demand in countries like Spain and Italy, the increase is expected to be \u201conly\u201d in the range of 10 to 15% or 660 to 700 MW. The current temporary shortage in silicon feedstock as a result of the extremely high growth rates of the photovoltaics industry over the last years, is showing its effects. Advanced production technologies, thin film solar modules and technologies like concentrator concepts are introduced into the market much faster than expected a few years ago. ",
        "94 The rising number of market implementation programmes world-wide, as well as the commitments made at the International Conference on Renewable Energies, Bonn in June 2004, will continue to keep the demand for solar systems high. In the long- term, the growth rates for photovoltaics will continue to be high, even if the economic frame conditions can lead to a short-term slow-down of growth rates. This view is shared by an increasing number of financial institutions, which are turning towards renewables as a sustainable and lucrative long-term investment. Increasing demand for energy is pushing the prices for fossil energy resources higher and higher. An increasing number of analysts predict that oil prices could well hit 100 $/bbl by 2010 [Cib 2005] or even exceed it, as stated by Matthew Simmons, member of the Energy Task force of US Vice-President Dick Cheney. If Oil-futures for 2012 and 10 year US treasury bonds (4.88%) are taken as a benchmark, the oil price will rise to at least $ 90/bbl (\u20ac 72) in 2012. Otherwise Oil- futures will be loss, which is highly unlikely. At the same time, electricity costs are on the rise and peak prices in July 2006 were higher than what was paid as feed-in tariffs. These developments work in favour of Photovoltaics as the cost gap is closing on both sides at the same time. PV system costs are still decreasing according to the learning curve and energy prices are rising at the same time. Therefore, the future for PV looks bright. Europe is on track to fulfil its 2010 targets. 2005 saw yet again a 50% growth of production volume in Europe and additional production capacities will become available over the next years. Japan is increasing its capacities at a similar pace. Should the current trend in the field of world-wide production capacity increase continue, Europe will only be able to increase its market share slightly from 26 to 29% even with the impressive growth rates of the last years. At the moment it is hard to predict how the market entrance of the new players in the United States, India and China will influence future developments of the markets. In 2010 Japan will still dominate the PV world-market with about 50% market share, but it is already obvious that China becomes a driving force in the photovoltaic manufacturing and will probably be close to reaching a 20% market share (Fig. 6.8). 1 10 100 1000 10000 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 M W p r o d u c t i o n p e r y e a r USA Japan Europe ROW Total forecasted on 2000 to 2005 growth White Paper Target Europe ~ 29 % ",
        "95 Fig. 6.8: Extrapolated increase of production capacities up until 2010 using the growth rates from 2000 to 2005 (Data source: PV News [Pvn 2006]) It is still true that Photovoltaics need significant initial investment, as was the case for the other energy sources, such as coal, oil and nuclear energy. It should not be forgotten that most of these investments were either made by public companies or secured by public credit guarantees. The European Environment Agency reported that the total energy subsidies in the European Union (EU15) were more than \u20ac 29 billion in 2001 [EEA 2004a]. About 18% or \u20ac 5.3 bil lion were given to renewable energies, whereas the rest went to coal, oil, gas and nuclear. These figures exclude external costs and for nuclear exclude the cost of not having to pay for full-liability insurance cover. In addition, the fact that some of Europe\u2019s nuclear companies are still state owned or controlled and arising liabilities will eventually have to be covered, or are actually being covered by the taxpayers, are not taken into account either. At the current time we can observe a continuous rise of oil and energy prices, which highlights the vulnerability of our current dependence on fossil energy sources and increases the burden developing countries are facing in their struggle for future development. On the other hand we see a continuous decrease in production costs for renewable energy technologies as a result of steep learning curves. Due to the fact that external energy costs are not yet taken into consideration, renewable energies and photovoltaics are still more expensive in the market than conventional energy sources. However, apart from conventional energy sources, renewable energies are the only ones to offer a reduction of prices instead of an increase in the future. ",
        "96 Chapter 7 SOLAR RESOURCE DATA AND TOOLS FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS Marcel \u0160\u00fari Solar resource information is needed in all stages of the development of a photovoltaic (PV) project. Reliable solar radiation statistics are required for system siting, design, and for financing. In most case, monthly averages, probability statistics or Typical Meteorological Years (TMY) are sufficient. This information is sufficient also for the manufacturing industry and for policy makers defining support programmes. On the other hand, siting of a multi-megawatt concentrating solar power or solar thermal power station needs time series of direct normal irradiance derived from high- resolution, high accuracy satellite data sources. Map-based time series of global irradiance are needed for analysis of grid electricity flows in regions with large PV capacities. Real-time data flow is required for large-scale operation and monitoring of PV systems and for the forecasting of solar electricity generation to optimise supply/demand patterns in the electricity grid. Development of PV projects benefits also from availability of other graphical data, such as temperatures, rainfall, wind, elevation, land use, electricity grid, or economical data. Geographical information systems provide added value by integration of these data with parameters of technology, thus allowing for spatial analysis. Many of those who search or use information on solar resource have difficulties with finding appropriate data, accessing and exploiting them due to various formats, protocols, units, observation periods, sampling or spatial resolution. Quality issues and uncertainty that relate to the methods of measurement and data processing are still not fully appreciated. It is often difficult to compare or combine information from various sources and raw data do not always meet the needs of users which are looking for more advanced information. In many projects, an uncertainty in data accuracy can make a difference between profit and loss from an investment. According to accepted terminology [Pag 1986], two terms for solar short-wave radiation are used in this chapter. The term irradiance denotes the solar power (instantaneous energy) falling on a unit area per unit time (Wm -2 ). The term irradiation denotes the amount of solar energy falling on a unit area over a stated time interval (Whm -2 ). Based on the previous analyses [Per 2001, Cro 2004, Wal 2006], this chapter provides a summarised and updated overview of the existing global or continental databases of solar resource and related climatic data, and tools for technical and economic assessment of photovoltaic systems. 7.1 Ground-measured site data and global datasets Solar radiation has been measured at ground meteorological stations since the mid 20 th century. The stations belong to the national weather services or networks that are ",
        "97 managed for specific purposes. Several institutions collect data from national files and archive them into global databases. Availability and pricing of data depends on the country or radiometric network, type of data and their use. Ground-measured solar radiation data are typically disseminated as daily sums or monthly averages; for a few stations also hourly or more detailed values are available. Ground stations, measuring solar radiation, are placed very heterogeneously within the world, and most regions are covered insufficiently to provide a representative picture of geographical and time distribution of solar resource (about 300 stations in Europe, [Esr 2000]). To overcome this limitation, other measurements, such as sunshine duration or cloud cover are used for estimation of global irradiation from empirical models. However, validity of these models is limited within a region for which they were calibrated. In most cases, only the global horizontal irradiation is measured (estimated), but in solar energy projects also direct and diffuse components are needed for calculations on inclined surfaces. Diffuse radiation is measured in a very limited number of stations (about 60 stations in Europe, [Esr 2000]), therefore it is often estimated by empirical models. Synthetic time series (Test Reference Years, Typical Meteorological Years, Design Reference Years) are constructed from observations and are thus available only for selected measuring stations. To get spatially-continuous data from measured or estimated solar radiation, interpolation techniques are used. In regions with sparse distribution of ground stations, such maps might be missing important regional climatic patterns. A typical relative accuracy of measurements at meteorological stations by a well-maintained pyranometer is 3 \u2013 5 %. The data accuracy obtained through the empirical estimations of global irradiation and its components is within the range of 20 \u2013 30 %. The accuracy of spatial interpolation close to the measuring locations might be within a limit of a few percent, however, uncertainty increases with a distance between the location of interest and the measuring stations, especially in hilly and mountainous terrain. Users should be aware that all the mentioned sources of errors cumulate. Important in decisions based on solar radiation data is not only understanding of overall root mean square error (RMS), but also of bias that indicates systematic under- or over-estimation. The reader is invited to read more about uncertainties in [Per 2001]. World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has compiled a CD-ROM with climatological normals, i.e. monthly and annual averages of measured parameters worldwide (the period 1961 \u2013 1990). For a few stations, also solar radiation data are available (see publications at http://www.wmo.ch/). A great deal of the worldwide measured data are collected, archived and published at the World Radiation Data Centre (WRDC) in St Petersburg, Russia. Although WRDC archive contains data from about 1,200 stations, the measurements are unevenly distributed in time and space. From 10 radiometric parameters, mainly global horizontal irradiation and sunshine duration can be retrieved (hourly, daily and monthly values). For much less stations, also diffuse irradiation can be retrieved. This archive is available online through two web sites. The data for the period of 1964 \u2013 1993 are stored on the server of National Renewable Energy Laboratory, USA (http://wrdc-mgo.nrel.gov/), and data for the period 1994 \u2013 2004 can be consulted on the web of the Voeikov Main Geophysical Observatory, Russia (http://www.mgo.rssi.ru/). The Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) is a project of the World Climate Programme \u2013 Water (WMO, UNESCO, ICSU) that aims at assimilation of the ground-measured surface energy fluxes (monthly means, mostly global radiation) from about 1,500 locations over the world into one database [Gil 1999]. The quality ",
        "98 of the measurements coming from various sources is rigorously controlled. The registered user can retrieve data from the GEBA web application (http://bsrn.ethz.ch/gebastatus/). The database is managed by ETH, Switzerland, and is available for scientific use; commercial exploitation is licensed to the Meteotest company (see below). Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) is a project of the World Climate Research Programme (WMO). It was established to detect changes in the earth's radiation fields which may cause climate changes. At 39 stations in important climatic zones, solar and terrestrial radiation is measured with instruments of the best accuracy available and at high frequency. The BSRN radiation measurements are used to validate the radiation schemes in climate models and to calibrate satellite algorithms. The data are archived at the World Radiation Monitoring Centre (WRMC), Switzerland, and are available to scientific institutions (http://bsrn.ethz.ch/). International Daylight Measurement Programme (IDMP) set-up by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) operates a network with 48 stations, specialised in high quality daylight and solar radiation measurements. The IDMP server is operated by ENTPE, France, but the accessibility of data from each station depends on the policy of the particular institution involved (http://idmp.entpe.fr/). 7.2 Satellite data and derived databases Satellite images, mainly from geostationary weather satellites (Meteosat, GOES, MSAT, etc.), are the second important source for developing solar radiation databases at global to regional scales. The main advantages are spatially-continuous (grid) data with consistent accuracy, measured by the satellites at frequent and regular time sampling. Spatial resolution of derived products is in a wide range of 1 \u2013 300 km. The relative accuracy of the estimations, measured by RMS, is approximately about 20 \u2013 25% for hourly values, 15 \u2013 20% for daily values, and less than 15% for monthly averages (with some seasonal variation, see e.g. [Lef 2006]). Unlike interpolated maps from ground stations, where the accuracy depends on their spatial distribution, the accuracy of satellite assessments is spatially more stable and practically without bias. Satellite-derived maps are more sensitive to errors in high mountains and high latitudes, due to low observation angles and complex interactions with terrain. Some global databases are a result of data assimilation and numerical weather modelling from both ground measurements and satellite images. The NCEP/NCAR and ECMWF are two examples. National meteorological services and international institutes use these data, as well as the products of other consortia, such as LSA-SAF and CM-SAF of the EUMETSAT organisation, for numerical weather forecasts and as input into general circulation models of the atmosphere. Closer to renewable energy applications, models such as e.g. Heliosat-2 [Rig 2004], Perez model [Per 2002], and SOLIS [M\u00fcl 2004] are developed to calculate high resolution and high quality solar radiation databases. These models are routinely applied, for example in the USA (State University of New York at Albany), Germany (University of Oldenburg, DLR), France (Ecole des Mines de Paris, ENTPE), Spain (CIEMAT), Italy (ENEA), Australia (Australian Bureau of Meteorology). Further progress, in terms of increasing spatial and temporal accuracy, improved calculation of radiation components, depends on improvements of existing algorithms, but also on the development of input data to models, such as aerosols, ozone, and water vapour.

        "99 The National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) are co-operating in a reanalysis to produce a 40- year record of global analyses of atmospheric fields for research and climate monitoring. This effort involves recovery, quality control and assimilation of data from all available observations [Kal 1996]. The global archive with the grid resolution of 210 km (at the equator) is available without restrictions, and it contains also flux parameters, including global downward shortwave radiation (http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/PublicData/). A CD-ROM was published, containing 13 years of selected climatologic data (daily and monthly values) from the NCEP/NCAR re-analysis with 2.5-deg grid resolution. Daily values are accessible also through SoDa portal (see below). The result of the two reanalysis projects of the European Centre for Medium- Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) \u2013 ERA-40 (1957 to 2002) and ERA-15 (1979 \u2013 1993) are commercially available at the resolution of 2.5\u00b0 \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 and higher through the extended web services (http://data.ecmwf.int/data/). A selection of maps can be downloaded from the ERA-40 atlas that contains surface and column-integrated fields describing the climate during 1979 \u2013 2001 (http://www.ecmwf.int/research/era/ERA- 40_Atlas/). To support renewable energy projects, the NASA's Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) data set has been developed by the project Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (POWER). The data set is freely available and it contains about 200 monthly averaged solar and other climatic parameters derived from data assimilation programs and satellite sources (ISCCP, GEOS, SRB, TOMS). It represents a 10-year climatology (1983-1993) interpolated to 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 grid regions (grid size of about 111 km at the equator) covering the entire globe. The data are considered accurate for preliminary feasibility studies of renewable energy projects and their purpose is to fill gaps where ground measurements are missing [Cha 2004]. The data are directly linked to design tools such as Homer and RETScreen (see below). The database HelioClim-1 has been developed at the Ecole des Mines de Paris, France, from Meteosat Prime satellite images at reduced (sampled) B2 resolution (grid cell of about 30 km \u00d7 30 km at the equator). The database consists of daily global irradiation for a period 1985-2005, covering Europe, Africa, southwest Asia and part of the South America [Lef 2006]. The higher resolution database HelioClim- 2 contains time-series of hourly irradiance calculated from Meteosat-8 satellite since February 2004. More about the HelioClim project at http://www.helioclim.org/ . For selected location the time series of the data can be retrieved from the SoDa web service (see below) on a free basis or at moderate costs. The Satel-Light server (managed by ENTPE, France) delivers data for Western and Central Europe of statistical type: monthly averages, frequency distributions of half- hourly values (http://www.satel-light.com/ ). The data can be consulted for free also in the form of active maps or in a form of a report for the chosen site. They represent a period of 1996-2000 and were derived from Meteosat images (solar radiation, and daylight) and ground measurements (temperatures). Solar Energy Mining (SOLEMI) is a service set up by German Aerospace Agency (DLR) that aims at providing high-resolution (2.5 km \u00d7 2.5 km) solar radiation data and maps from Meteosat satellites (http://www.solemi.com/). The solar radiation products, including high frequency time series and direct normal irradiance, are ",

Together with related GIS services (STEPS) they are used mainly in preparatory stages of renewable energy projects. 7.3 Systems integrating data and assessment tools Besides servers offering data, there are integrated information systems, where databases are supplemented by maps, software, and support services. Such systems are available online through the internet or on CD-ROMs. They enable better exploitation of basic data, and calculation of derived parameters for an assessment of solar energy projects. Meteonorm (http://www.meteonorm.com) is a global climatological database combined with a synthetic weather generator on CD-ROM. It contains a database of ground station measurements collected from various sources (Swiss Meteorological Institute, GEBA, WMO-CLINO, etc.). The main period of the measurements is 1961 \u2013 1990. Besides solar radiation it contains other climatologic data needed for solar energy and applied meteorology projects (temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation). This commercial software outputs climatologic averages and derived products for any point on earth, estimated by interpolation. The European Solar Radiation Atlas is a comprehensive publication, documenting state of the art in solar energy and applications in Europe at the end of 1990s [Esr 2000]. It was realised on behalf of the European Commission by a group of European institutions. The publication can be purchased at http://www.helioclim.org/esra/. It includes CD-ROM with theory on basics and solar energy applications, and homogenised input solar radiation and climatic data, based on the period 1981 \u2013 1990. The extended set of algorithms, software and digital maps provide for a range of PV, solar energy and other applications. Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS) is a research, demonstration and policy-support instrument for geographical assessment of solar resource and PV systems in the context of distributed energy generation [Sur 2005]. The server, operated by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, offers map-based query of basic statistics of solar radiation, temperature and other data for two regions: (1) European subcontinent (1-km grid, period 1981 \u2013 1990) computed from ground measurements, and (2) for the Mediterranean Basin, Africa and South-West Asia (2-km grid resolution, period 1985 \u2013 2004) developed by processing and spatial enhancing of the HelioClim-1 satellite database. The PVGIS databases and algorithms are developed in open source software and the web tools enable simple estimation of performance of PV and solar energy systems (http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/pv/). The server of the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) (http://rredc.nrel.gov/ ) delivers solar radiation data, derived products, overview maps and atlases, as well as a range of publications, algorithms, and source codes. Solar calculator PVWATTS can be used for performance estimates of grid-connected PV systems. It can be linked interactively to a dynamic solar atlas of USA that on grid cells of ~ 40 km by 40 km provides monthly averages of daily total solar resource available to flat plate photovoltaic modules and concentrators (http://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html ). The Solar Information Resource Service (SIRS) is another example of a service offered to those who own or plan a PV system (http://www.iedat.com/sirs-ny/sirs- ny.php3). The site is operated by NYSERDA, and provides mapped solar resource from geostationary satellites for the State of New York. It is updated on a monthly ",
        "101 basis, and accessible back to 1998. The SIRS is linked with the Clean Power Estimator service, allowing economical estimation and monitoring of PV systems. The Solar and Wind Energy Resource Assessment (SWERA) is a UNEP/GEF project that provides for free solar and wind resource data, country energy analyses, and geographic information assessment tools to public and private sector in developing countries. Currently, the SWERA website holds online information of 13 countries (http://swera.unep.net/). The SoDa Service (SoDa: Solar Data) offers one-stop access to information sources related to solar radiation and applications in various domains (http://www.soda- is.com). By means of a smart network it integrates climatic databases, and application-specific user-oriented numerical models and advanced algorithms located in various institutes in the world. The service does not centralise the data into a warehouse nor does it write software for applications. In the PV domain, the SoDa service co-operates with other web servers to construct and deliver requested products using the data and software maintained on remote sites, such as HelioClim, Meteotest, ESRA, Satel-light, NCEP/NCAR, etc. This co-operation is entirely automatic by the means of standard data protocols. On a commercial basis, new services, based on the use of satellite data, are being developed for planning and monitoring of existing installations, and calculating energy forecasts for electricity grid management (see e.g., http://www.spyce.de/, http://www.meteocontrol.com/, http://www.flyby.it/). 7.4 Project development software Besides systems offering data and simple tools, various software packages exist for development of PV projects. RETScreen International is a decision-support tool for evaluation of energy production and savings, life-cycle costs, emission reductions, financial viability and risk for various types of renewable energy technologies. The software is provided free-of-charge, and includes product, cost and climate databases, detailed user manuals and textbooks (http://www.retscreen.net/). The software is available in several languages, and provides users' access to climatic data from ground monitoring stations, or as an alternative, to the NASA SSE satellite-derived data sets. The development and support is managed by the Canadian RETScreen International Clean Energy Decision Support Centre with the aim of assisting in building capacities by disseminating knowledge to better analyse the technical and financial viability of projects, and thus to reduce costs of pre-feasibility studies. Homer is also a free-of-charge computer model for the evaluation of design options for both off-grid and grid-connected power systems for remote, stand-alone and distributed generation applications. The algorithms for optimisation and sensitivity analysis allow to evaluate the economic and technical feasibility of a number of technology options and to account for variation in technology costs and energy resource availability. The development of the software is supported by US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (http://www.nrel.gov/homer/). A range of commercial software packages are on the market, aimed for sizing, simulation, monitoring, and economic assessment of PV systems. Many of them include or provide an access to meteorological and PV-components databases. To mention some of them: PVSYST, TRNSYS, PV*SOL, INSEL, PV F-Chart, PV- DesignPro, etc. The main customers are engineers, project planners, researchers and education institutions. ",
        "102 7.5 Conclusions The existing data sources have limitations in terms of their spatial and temporal resolution, and suitability for a given application. Some data are difficult to access or directly use in PV projects, especially for developing countries. Due to the growing reliance on solar and other renewable energy technologies worldwide, a research task was formed under the International Energy Agency (IEA), Solar Heating and Cooling Programme, entitled \u201c Solar Resource Knowledge Management \u201d. It operates via an international consortium of experts who are involved in the analysis and processing of data from ground measurements and satellite imagery for developing large-area site- time specific data and maps of the solar energy resource. The goals are benchmarking and validating data products, improving access to data resources, and developing improved products and new services (http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/iea-shc-task36/). This chapter provides an overview of available global solar radiation and climatic data sources that are needed for photovoltaic projects. This brief summary must not be considered as exhaustive, the reader is invited to look for updates and submit comments at the online version http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/pv/solrad/. ",
        "103 Chapter 8 EUROPEAN POLICIES FOR THE PROMOTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGIES AND ENHANCED ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES Magda Moner Gerona Energy as a key to promote development Energy is a key issue to promote development, as explicitly referenced in the commission communication \"Green paper: A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive, and Secure Energy\" [EC 2006, EC 2006a]. In this section, following the energy-development approach, we analyze the European policies that promote sustainable development in developing countries by supporting renewable energies and raising the profile of energy efficiency in development programmes. Energy cooperation EU launched in 2002 an EU Energy Partnership Initiative 28 in order to promote cooperation between Europe and developing countries in the energy sector [EC 2002]. In the \"Energy cooperation with the developing countries\" communication [EC 2002a], the Commission of Council analyzes the energy situation in developing countries and then proposes a reference framework for energy cooperation. The energy initiative for Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Development (EUEI) particular focus its effort on poverty eradication by improving access to adequate sustainable energy services through several technical and institutional options, including rural electrification, decentralised energy systems, increased use of renewable energy, and enhanced energy efficiency 29 . Through the development of partnerships, the core of the initiative will support the spread of sustainable energy services in developing countries by: \u2022 Integrating energy as a general component of EU development aid programmes. \u2022 Developing institutional support and the necessary regulatory framework to give the beneficiary countries the capacities to implement their energy choices and to promote the use of locally available renewable energy sources. \u2022 Assisting to promote the necessary technical capacity \u2022 Providing improved access to renewable energy and energy efficiency technology as developed by EU industry. RTD efforts deployed in the EU 28 The European Union (EU) developed the Energy Initiative for Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Development in order to respond to unmet needs for energy services. http://ec.europa.eu/comm/development/body/theme/energy/initiative/index_en.htm The Initiative was launched at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in September 2002. http://www.un.org/events/wssd/ 29 This includes cleaner, more efficient fossil fuel technologies, technology for more efficient appliances, and more efficient use of traditional biomass.

The penetration of modern energy-efficient technology in developing countries requires basically three elements: \u2022 Creating a legal and financial framework, instruments, and/or economic incentives to ensure the implementation of technology \u2022 Providing access to capital for the necessary (often higher) investment in energy efficiency \u2022 Promoting local manufacturing The high priority given to energy efficiency in the EU, as expressed in the European Commission\u2019s proposal for the \u201cIntelligent Energy for Europe\u201d programme [Intelligent Energy] provides an excellent basis for cooperation with developing countries in this field. COOPENER 31 (Community cooperation with developing countries) focuses on sustainable energy services to overcome poverty in developing countries, contributing to the EU Energy Initiative. The supported projects of this programme enhance: \u2022 Local policies, legislation and market conditions 32 . \u2022 Local energy expertise 33 The community development aid programmes (Euro-Mediterranean Partnership 34 (MEDA) and European Development Fund (EDF) 35 ) complement the COOPENER programme (which has a limited budget).

The potential of renewable energy is increasing because of its benefits from the point of view both of the environment and of security of supply. Nevertheless, its share in developing countries is remaining limited, especially as, in the absence of specific policy measures, such as those taken by the EU to promote renewable energy (in general, the high cost of renewable energy is an obstacle to its expansion). In order to develop a long-term strategy for promoting PV in developing countries the European Photovoltaic Technology Platform 36 established in 2005 the developing countries working group (WG4). Rural areas The investment in electricity transmission and distribution of centrally generated electricity for rural area is too high since its sparse population and low potential electricity demand. Then, the potential of renewable energy is extremely attractive since in rural areas access to energy depends on decentralised electricity generation. Locally produced electricity from wind or solar power may offer the best solution to cover basic energy needs for light, communications, health services and initial production and commercial development. This aspect is particularly important in the context of poverty eradication. If properly integrated in rural development policy, renewable energy will also contribute to improving life in rural areas, thus hopefully contributing to reducing the incentives for migration from rural to urban agglomerations with all the associated social problems. The Alliance for Rural Electrification (AERE) 37 is an international non-profit organization founded in 2006 by the most important European Renewable Energy Industry Associations: the European Photovoltaic Industry Association (EPIA), the European Small Hydropower Association (ESHA), the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA), the European Biomass Industry Association (EUBIA) and the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC). ARE was created to respond to the outstanding need of providing a sustainable access to electricity to the developing world and to facilitate the involvement of its industry members within a rural electrification global dialogue, involving not only government and donor agencies but also manufacturers, rural entrepreneurs, end- consumers, local technicians, NGOs, utility companies and banks. Conclusion The EU has proposed different programmes, to work with developing countries towards creating the necessary conditions in the energy sector to achieve their national economic, social, and environmental objectives. 36 PV Platform is an EU initiative which aims at mobilising all the actors sharing a long-term European vision for photovoltaic; realising the European Strategic Research Agenda for PV for the next decade(s) and give recommendations for implementation; ensuring that Europe maintains industrial leadership. http://www.eupvplatform.org 37 ARE http://www.ruralelec.org/ ",
        "106 Chapter 9 OUTLOOK AND CONCLUSIONS Arnulf J\u00e4ger-Waldau The analysis of the progress and resource data on Renewable Energy and Energy End-use Efficiency revealed that a lot fragmented data and interpretations are available, but they lack a consistent quality system for data verification and clearly defined criteria for their visualisation, comparison and interpretation. Discrepancies have to be identified and resolved as well as better statistical methodologies elaborated. The Scientific Reference System task is to enhance the availability, quality and interpretation of renewable energy data and to serve as a one-stop-shop for policy and decision makers, serving them with unbiased, reliable inventory information on green energy -technologies, -potentials, -investments, -trends, - markets, and comparisons with modelling results. In the following, a few key results for electricity are summarised. 9.1 Europe With all the different political and legislative developments like the EU Directives, national and regional policies etc., where are we now to reach the goals of the White Paper [EC 1997]? \u2022 Figure 9.1 shows the development to reach the White Paper targets on renewable electricity and the actual status for 2005. The pathways towards the targets are logarithmic (linear in a logarithmic plot) in order to account for the typical form of growth curves of new technology business branches.

This reflects the fact ",
        "107 that not all installed power in one year contributes to the actual electricity generation. \u2022 PV: The installed rated peak power capacities of 2004 + 50% of the additional installations for 2005 are multiplied by 950 h of operation. 0,01 0,11 10 100 1000 1 9 9 5 1 9 9 6 1 9 9 7 1 9 9 8 1 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 6 2 0 0 7 2 0 0 8 2 0 0 9 2 0 1 0 G e n e r a t e d E l e c t r i c i t y [ T W h / y ] Biomass 14%/y Wind 28%/y PV 36%/y 2005: 1.5 2005: 82 2005: 70 2010*: 165 2010: 3 2010*: 160 Fig. 9.1: Pathway to reach the White Paper targets and values for 2005. In order to reach the revised targets biomass must increase to 19 %/year (11.8% until now), whereas wind could slow down to 14.5 % (35%). With the continuation of the current averaged 48%growth, PV could exceed the White book target by 2007 and reach 10 TWh in 2010. Wind has already reached the original White Paper target and photovoltaic is well on track to reach it already by 2007. For wind it can be even expected that it will reach the revised target of 160 TWh by 2010 and compensate for the shortcoming of electricity from biomass, where the target was revised downward. If the electricity generation from Photovoltaic systems continues to grow like the past, more than 10 TWh of electricity could be generated by Photovoltaic systems in 2010. As already pointed out earlier, the actual investment into a specific renewable energy do not primarily depend on the available resources, but on the policy measures taken to promote it. The leading role of Germany in the field of wind and photovoltaic is due to the already mentioned renewable energy law [EEG 2004], which was revised and went into force on 1 August 2004. Electricity from biomass faces multiple challenges, which reflect the diversity of fuelling options and technologies. However, as it is very close to the conventional energy conversion chain, its integration into the existing energy system could be easily managed with the targeted political support. The latter is required to realise advanced conversion technologies and the development of appropriate expertise and market infrastructure in dedicated energy crop production. This inevitably calls for a much better integration of the sustainability goals from bio-energy into the Common ",
        "108 Agricultural Policy and the realities of crop markets at the level of the producers. The biomass role is crucial and should not be \u201cgiven up\u201d: In a renewable energy scenario where different renewable energy sources are combined, regionally distributed biomass will play an important role in buffering the energy needs during times when intermittent energy sources like wind or PV have less output. However, effective use of biomass for energy purposes depends on the interactions between public policy in the fields of energy, agricultural, waste, forestry, rural development, environment and trade policy. Community institutions play a key role in all these policy areas. Specific attention has to be paid to the new Member States, taking into account the high and unexploited biomass potential that many of them have. Wind power is already a well-developed technology with a rapid growing, world- wide market. The technological advances during the last decade have made wind energy already cost competitive with conventional energy sources in regions with good wind resources. The sector is very innovative and further cost reductions are predicted with economy of scale and new developments; windmills without gearboxes are a good example, bringing down costs in production as well as operation and maintenance. The learning curve will slow down naturally, over the next 10 to 20 years. New market developments \u2013 offshore installations with larger turbines and building integrated installations with small turbines \u2013 as well as the expansion of wind into new world markets offer the chance that wind will indeed become a substantial part of tomorrows sustainable power supply. To realise this policy support to develop these markets and realise the necessary cost reductions is needed. Photovoltaics is right now transforming from a manufacture type production to a full fledged high-tech industry. This offers the possibility to make use of economy of scale in larger production plants and lower the costs of PV systems considerably. PV still offers a large potential for cost reduction through market growth and innovation over the next decades. Already now, PV offers cost competitive solutions not only for remote and off-grid locations but also for peak load electricity. E.g., during the extreme heat wave in July 2006, peak prices paid at the European Electricity Exchange (EEX) spot market exceeded the feed-in tariff paid in Germany. Ever more standardising building integration and grid connected PV is one of the main driving forces for market growth. To maintain this growth stable economic and political framing conditions are necessary to encourage private consumer and industry investments. For all these renewable energy sources it holds true, that all still differ in terms of commercial and industrial maturity. Some technical solutions are already economic competitive whilst others still need support measures to get them into the markets. Appropriate policies are needed to support research and development of promising options as well as market implementation and the fair access of renewable energies to the markets. An additional benefit of renewable energies was already highlighted in the first report on the White Paper and Action Plan Implementation [EC 2001] \u2013 job creation . The Commission presented figures of a study, which described likely job creation by the White Paper\u2019s targets, only considering the domestic market. The results suggested that around 530,000 jobs could be created between 1999-2010 across EU- 15 Member States within the renewable energy sector, considering operation and maintenance as well as construction and installation. This figure took already into account the jobs displaced from employment in conventional energies. It was ",
        "109 furthermore anticipated, that further work is still necessary, in order to provide more accurate information to decision-makers on job creation generated by RES investments. The recent developments concerning energy have put the topic high on the political agenda. In January 2007, the European Commission adopted new proposals for an ambitious energy policy for Europe. The guidelines are that European energy policy must pursue the objective of a sustainable, competitive and secure supply of energy. The following statements are taken form the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament from 10 January 2007 [EC 2007a]. To achieve the strategic energy objective means transforming Europe into a highly energy efficient and low CO 2 energy economy, catalysing a new industrial revolution , accelerating the change to low carbon growth and, over a period of years, dramatically increasing the amount of local, low emission energy that we produce and use. The challenge is to do this in a way that maximises the potential competitiveness gains for Europe, and limits the potential costs. Existing measures on areas such as renewable electricity, biofuels, energy efficiency and the Internal Energy Market have achieved important results but lack the coherence necessary to bring sustainability, security of supply and competitiveness. No one element of the policy provides all the answers \u2013 they must be taken together as a whole. Energy policy must be addressed by many different policy areas. For example, as mentioned above the social dimension of Europe's energy policy needs to be taken into account throughout all stages of designing and implementing the individual measures 7 and it will be necessary to develop the further use of oceans and seas to promote the EU's energy goals, given their potential to support the generation of energy and to diversify energy transport routes and methods 8 . The first step is for Member States to endorse a strategic vision and an Action Plan for the next three years: with the explicit aim of moving towards an international alliance of developed countries at least with a view of reducing global Greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 30% and making a significant contribution to reducing the EU's greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 20%. This will be backed up with careful monitoring and reporting of progress, as well as the effective exchange of best practice and continued transparency - through the regular presentation by the Commission of an updated Strategic Energy Review. The measures outlined will not only put the EU on the path to becoming a low carbon knowledge-based energy economy, but will at the same time improve its security of supply and make a progressively more significant contribution to competitiveness. 9.2 Global The world-wide growing energy and electricity demand could be supplied by renewable energies as shown in Figure 9.2. The main resources are geothermal and solar, which are sufficient to supply a world population of 10 billion people with approx. 300 GJ of energy per capita and year. Solely Europe and Asia, whose potential is only 100 GJ/capita and year, would be required to import energy. The UN World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg 2002 made a commitment to: \u201cIncrease access to modern energy services, increase energy efficiency and to increase the use of renewable energy.\u201d and \u201cTo phase out, where appropriate, energy subsidies\u201d [Joh 2002]. At the same time, the European Union ",

It paved the way towards an expansion of renewable energies worldwide, responding to the call of the Johannesburg Summit for the global development of renewable energy. It also kept up the momentum generated by the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition (JREC). Around 3,600 participants met in Bonn for renewables 2004 , amongst them official governmental delegations from 154 countries, including energy, environmental and development ministers, representatives of the United Nations and other international and non-governmental organisations, civil society and the private sector. All EU-30 countries and EFTA countries as well as the European Commission were represented. The Conference addressed primarily the issues of how can the proportion of renewable energies used in industrialised and developing countries be substantially increased , and how can their advantages and potential be better used . The conferences\u2019 outcome concentrated in particular on: \u2022 Formation of enabling political framework conditions allowing the market development of renewable energies, \u2022 Increase in private and public financing in order to secure reliable demand for renewable energies, \u2022 Human and institutional capacity building, and coordination and intensification of research and development. ",
        "111 The key results of this International Conference are the \u201cPolicy Recommendations for Renewable Energies\u201d [Bon 2004a]. These recommendations based on the current understandings on policies and decision-making are designed to promote renewable energies in the world. The document is based on experiences and lessons learnt from policies, programmes, projects and other initiatives in the public and private sectors worldwide. The diversity of challenges, resource opportunities, as well as financing and market conditions among and within regions and countries implies that different approaches are required. Thus, these non-binding recommendations provide decision- makers with a menu of policy options based on available experience and knowledge. Concrete actions and commitments by governments and other actors were united in an International Action Programme (IAP) [Bon 2004] that in its published version consists of 197 actions and commitments, partly of very important scale and wide- ranging practical importance. Governments, the UN, other international organisations including financial ones like the World-Bank and stakeholders from civil society and the private sector had contributed to the IAP and underlined its importance as part of the outcomes. All actions and commitments included were the voluntary result of a bottom-up approach. They reflect specific national and regional conditions, capacities of actors, specific sectorial objectives and overall development targets of the contributors. The follow up of the Bonn Conference was held on 8-9 November 2005 in Beijing. The \u201c2005 Beijing International Renewables Conference\u201d discussed the status of the global implementation of Renewable Energies. The outcome of the Conference was the Beijing Declaration which states [Bei 2005]: \"We emphasize the multiple benefits of increased energy efficiency and the use of renewable sources of energy for improving access to energy services, thereby contributing to the eradication of poverty as called for in the UN Millenium Development Goals (MDGs), increasing job opportunities, improving air quality and public health, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change, enhancing energy security, and offering a new paradigm for international co- operation.\" Last but not least one has to remind that the implementation of renewable energies into the world\u2019s energy supply and the substantial investments needed to do so, call for an integrated approach to utilise all different available technologies and resources as well as energy end \u2013use efficiency to minimise demand. No energy source alone can supply the future needs of mankind and even our conventional energy sources face the problem of fluctuating generation capacities. However, we have to keep in mind, that no alternative energy system will be available when we need it in the coming decades, if we do not start to change it now. ",

But the tariff negotiations are still ongoing. It is expected that they will be decided in October 2006. Key elements of the Law are: Electricity from all renewable energy sources will be supported with \u20ac 17 million per year. 10% are earmarked for PV, with the same amount added by the Federal States, because of their co-financing duty. The support will be constant for 10 years, with a degressive support for 3 more years and thereafter an obligation for the utilities to accept the electricity from a PV system for another 13 years. Some of the Federal States have investment support schemes. Belgium [Ode 2006] Green Certificates (with guaranteed minimum price): 0.15 \u20ac/kWh; Flanders from 1 January 2006: 0.45 \u20ac/kWh for 20 years. Additional support in Flanders depends on whether the PV installation is done privately, by an enterprise or a farmer. The support schemes used are investment subsidies, eco premiums, tax reductions and interest reduced mortgages. Cyprus Feed-in tariff: 0.224CYP\u00a3/kWh (0.391 \u20ac/kWh) for households and 0.196CYP\u00a3/kWh (0.342 \u20ac/kWh) for enterprises. If an investment grant is taken, the tariff is reduced to 0.012CYP\u00a3/kWh (0.21 \u20ac/kWh). Investment grants for households, other entities and organisations, not engaged in economic activities are limited to a maximum 55% of the eligible costs and the maximum grant is 16.5 k\u20ac (CY\u00a3 9.500). For enterprises, the grant is 40% of eligible costs and the maximum amount of the grant is 12 k\u20ac (CY\u00a3 7.000). Czech Republic New Law on the Promotion of Production of Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources went into effect on 1 August 2005. Producers of electricity can choose from two support schemes: \u2022 Fixed feed in tariff for 2006: Systems commissioned after 01/01/06: 13.2 CZK/kWh (0.466 \u20ac/kWh) Systems commissioned before 01/01/06: 6.28 CZK/kWh (0.222 \u20ac/kWh) \u2022 Market price + Green Bonus; Green Bonus for 2006 Systems commissioned after 01/01/06: 12.59 CZK/kWh (0.445 \u20ac/kWh) Systems commissioned before 01/01/06: 5.67 CZK/kWh (0.200 \u20ac/kWh) From 2007 onwards the annual price decrease for new installations should be 5% maximum. Denmark No specific PV programme, but settlement price for green electricity 60 \u00d8re/kWh (0.08 \u20ac/kWh) for 10 years, then 10 more years 40 \u00d8re/kWh.

Commercial installations are eligible to grants (30 to 55% of total system costs), while small domestic systems are eligible for a 20% tax deduction capped at \u20ac 500 per system (\u20ac 700 in 2007). For 2020 a target to reach at least 700 MWp (500 MWp mainland, 200 MWp islands) has been set. Hungary No PV specific measure, but feed-in tariffs for RES were set through the Electricity Act, which entered into force on 1 st January 2003. According to Regulation No. 105/2003. (XII.29.) GKM, the Electricity Suppliers are obliged to purchase electricity from producers utilising RES, if their capacity is over 100 kW. However, in the case of smaller plants, individual arrangements are possible. There is no differentiation between the renewable sources.

        "132 A5 Heat Measurement Principles and Technologies Introduction The measurement of a flow of thermal energy is based on the measurement of two physical properties, e.g. a flow and a temperature difference. The analogy with the measurement of electrical energy is illustrated in the figures below. The electrical energy [Wh] consumed in the resistance is calculated from the potential difference [V] measured between point A and B, and the flow of electrons, current [A] The equivalent to consumed thermal energy is calculated from the temperature difference between point C and D [\u00baC] and the flow of water [m 3 /s]. Electrical energy measurement Thermal energy measurement The measurement of thermal energy is in principle similar to electrical energy however due to the physical differences, like dimension of water pipes, complexity of installations, etc. it is in practice more difficult than electrical energy measurement. The accuracy of the measurements depends not only on the applied sensors and instruments but also on the correct place where the sensors are positioned. Renewable Energy Heat measurement Three technologies are considered under RES-Heat: \u2022 Solar Thermal \u2022 Geo-thermal and \u2022 Biomass. The applications of these technologies are mainly in the building and industrial sector and differ in the size of the plant: small solar thermal collectors for domestic hot tap water, to large geo-thermal district heating plants. Quantification of the produced heat by a plant is in principle the measurement of a mass-flow (usually water) and a temperature difference. A second way is an empirical method. The produced heat is derived from calculation that has no metrological inputs. Note that most data available for RES-Heat come from calculations and not from measurements. The reason is that enormous amount of small sized installations exist, like fire places, solar collectors and heat pumps which become too costly to measure individually. Heat counters, from the smallest domestic appliances to the largest industrial equipment with far more than 10 MWatt ratings, consist of three basic parts: C Water heater D A resistance B ",
        "133 1. Flow meter (water is used almost exclusively as heat transfer medium) 2. Temperature sensors (usually two parts to measure a temperature difference) 3. Processor (often also called integrator) An overview of measurement principle could be given. An initial attempt is given below. Measuring the energy flows As has been decided the measurement of the RE-H energy flow will take place after the conversion which means that all storage and transfer issues are neglected. Biomass is measured after the combustion, solar thermal after the collector and geothermal after the heat exchanger (direct system) or after the heat pump. Note that auxiliary energy supply within the conversion process is only considered when being more than 5 %. It is expected that only Heat Pumps will find consideration as auxiliary systems. The energy used to produce and transport biomass shall not be considered. Temperature measurement Sensors and instruments are available on the market that perform the same measurement but that can have a different accuracy or precision. To measure temperatures in a flow of water, usually thermocouples or platinum resistance (PT-) sensors are used. Thermocouple sensors are available for different temperature ranges each with its own accuracy. A PT100 temperature sensor can have a higher precision than a thermocouple. Note that the quality of the instruments and sensors are not related to the measurement itself. A PT100 temperature sensor can be measured in different ways (2-, 3- or 4-wires) with different accuracies. Transit Time Meter Basic Theory Measurements are made by sending bursts of signals through a pipe. The measurement of flow is based on the principle that sound waves travelling in the direction of flow of the fluid require less time than when travelling in the opposite direction. At zero velocity, the transit time or delta T is zero. If we know the diameter of the pipe, the pipe wall thickness and the pipe wall material the angle of refraction can be calculated automatically and we will know how far apart to space our transducers. The difference in transit times of the ultrasonic signals is an indication for the flow rate of the fluid. Since ultrasonic signals can also penetrate solid materials, the transducers can be mounted onto the outside of the pipe. Fast Digital Signal Processors and signal analysis guarantee reliable measuring results even under difficult conditions where previously ultrasonic flowmeters have failed. Doppler Flowmeter Basic Theory Doppler ultrasonic flowmeters operate on the Doppler shift principal, whereby the transmitted frequency is altered linearly by being reflected from particles and bubbles in the fluid. The net result is a frequency shift between transmitter and receiver frequencies that can be directly related to the flow velocity. If the pipe internal diameter is known, the volumetric flow rate can be calculated. Doppler meters require a minimum amount of solid particles or air in the line to achieve measurements. Thermal Mass Flow Meters These are based on an operational principle that states that the rate of heat absorbed by a flow stream is directly proportional to its mass flow. As molecules of a moving gas/liquid come into contact with a heat source, they absorb heat and thereby cool the source. At increased flow rates, more molecules come into contact with the heat ",
        "134 source, absorbing even more heat. The amount of heat dissipated from the heat source in this manner is proportional to the number of molecules of a particular gas/liquid (its mass), the thermal characteristics of the gas/liquid, and its flow characteristics. District heat metering The idea of district heating is to heat up a whole district from a central source through a distribution network. The heat is extracted from the distribution network by heat exchangers and the water is then subsequently returned to the central. The heat exchange between the district heating network and the building occurs in district heating substations. Heat meters are located in such substations and are divided into two main categories depending on their heat energy estimation frequency modes, which is either constant or flow rate dependent. In the district heating industry, heat meters, consisting among other things of a flow meter, are used for billing purpose. The district heating industry desires accurate and low cost flow measurements. The total cost for measuring, including the cost for the heat meter, the reading and the maintenance, represents a relatively large part of the total energy cost. small commercial ultrasonic flow meters were investigated. These commercial meters are commonly used in heat meters in small district heating subscriber stations. The results demonstrate that both temperature changes and installation effects introduce errors in the flow measurements. Renewable heat at the output side For Solar Thermal the technically produced energy will find a corrective by a general assessment of the energy consumption in the specific application (e.g. one \u2013 family house).

In the past decade, renewable energy technologies have made significant progress in terms of performance, cost and reliability, thanks to vigorous research, development, demonstration and market introduction programmes at European, national and also regional level. Three major drivers are determining today's socio-economic framework for the impressive industrial and market developments of renewable energies. First, successful application of legally binding feed-in tariffs; secondly, liberalisation of the electricity market, and thus new possibilities for decentralisation of power generation. Third, and in the medium term, there is the undisputed need for massive re-powering the larger part of Europe's generation capacity. This will incur generally higher electricity costs, which reflect somewhat better the real costs (incl. externalities) of all the different energy technologies. Thus a more favourable market situation for sustainable technology choices will evolve, e.g. for massive renewable power generation. While technology development has been a key driver in the progress of renewable energies, first examples of significant penetration would have been impossible without appropriate, supporting policies including instruments such as introduction targets, carbon taxes, elimination of non-technical barriers, internalisation of external costs of energy, and harmonisation of market rules. The efficient end-use of energy is a parallel area where modern technology, policies, better public conscience of the issues and market forces, like the utilities&#8217; interest to exploit the potentials for avoidance of new transmission and generation capacity, have combined to achieve significant results. New integrated marketing concepts, like energy service companies, have been very successful lately, and organisationally break ground for the implementation of sharper physical efficiency concepts as well. This is of particular strategic importance for the New Member States of the EU, as the use of energy, including electricity, in these countries is still significantly less efficient than in the old Member States. The aim of this Status Report is to provide relevant, validated and independent information on renewable energy and the efficient end-use of electricity to decision makers and the public. ",
        "The mission of the JRC is to provide customer-driven scientific and technical support for the conception, development, implementation and monitoring of EU policies. As a service of the European Commission, the JRC functions as a reference centre of science and technology for the Union. Close to the policy-making process, it serves the common interest of the Member States, while being independent of special interests, whether private or national. L B - NA - 22752 - E N - C "
