        "3 This pocketbook is the first edition of a new series of publications which provides you with a concise and balanced set of key data covering all statistical domains of Eurostat. Eurostat is the Statistical Office of the European Communities; it was established in 1953 in Luxembourg to meet the statistical requirements of the Coal and Steel Community. When the European Community was founded in 1958, Eurostat became a Directorate-General (DG) of the European Commission. Its role is to supply harmonised statistics first and foremost to other Directorates General and European institutions, in order to underpin the definition, implementation and analysis of Community policies, but also to the general public. Democratic societies do not function properly without a solid basis of reliable and objective data. On the one hand, decision-makers at EU level and in the Member States, be it local governments or businesses, need statistical data to make informed decisions. On the other hand, the public and media refer increasingly to statistics for an accurate picture of society. Eurostat gets most of its data from the national statistical authorities in the Member States. It then processes, analyses and publishes that data at a European level, following common statistical concepts, methods, and standards. Eurostat defines common methodologies together with the Member States, consolidates the data collected in each country, ensures that it is harmonised and as comparable as possible, and then creates European aggregates for the 25 Member States and the euro area. It then publishes most of this data and analyses on its website and in many cases also in the form of paper publications. The role of Eurostat has changed and developed in line with Community policies. For example, in recent years economic and monetary statistics, in particular a set of Principal European Economic Indicators (PEEIs), have been developed to provide a rapid flow of information covering the euro area to the European Central Bank, to aid monetary policy decision making. At the same time, Eurostat has supported and encouraged the development of statistical systems within the Candidate countries, Western Balkans, and European Neighbourhood Policy countries, driving a process of statistical harmonisation. For further information about Eurostat and about available statistics, please consult our website at http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat. The site offers you free access to nearly all of Eurostat's data as well as to methodological information and to all Eurostat statistical publications in PDF format. I hope this pocketbook will encourage you to access our website and to use Eurostat's data for your information needs and daily work.

        "7 C O N T E N T S & G U I D E The European statistical system The European statistical system comprises Eurostat and the statistical offices, ministries, agencies and central banks that collect official statistics in the European Union Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The European statistical system concentrates on European Union policy areas, although harmonisation has extended to nearly all statistical fields. The European statistical system is a network in which Eurostat's role is to lead the way in the harmonisation of statistics in close cooperation with the national statistical authorities. At the heart of the European statistical system is the Statistical Programme Committee, which brings together the heads of Member States' national statistical offices and is chaired by Eurostat. The Statistical Programme Committee discusses joint actions and programmes to be carried out to meet European Union information requirements. It agrees a five-year programme, which is implemented by the national authorities and monitored by Eurostat. For a list of contact details for the national statistical authorities please refer to page 204. Structure of the publication Key figures on Europe provides the general public with an overview of data that is available through the European statistical system. It belongs to the same family of compendium publications as the more extensive Eurostat yearbook. Key figures on Europe has been conceived as a publication to provide a balanced set of key indicators, presenting a broad cross-section of information that is available within Eurostat's dissemination database. The publication is part of Eurostat's new dissemination strategy, insofar as it will be distributed free of charge, accompanying the vast array of official statistics freely available on Eurostat's website (see below for more details). Key figures on Europe is divided into nine chapters, each of which contains information relating to a particular topic. Within each chapter each double page focuses on a subject: most start with a short commentary that provides contextual information (such as policy relevance), as well as definitions of the indicators presented, and warnings concerning the interpretation of the data. The standard structure employed for the majority of these double pages is to present a graph focused on aggregated European Union data, as well as a table with a selection of indicators/time periods for all Member States and other non-Community countries. The balance of the information presented within Key figures on Europe reflects to some degree the volume of information available under each of the themes within Eurostat's dissemination database, while also attempting to provide information that is of particular interest for members of the general public. Eurostat produce a broad range of more specialised publications, which may be accessed through the Eurostat home-page. GUIDE CH0.QXD 14/06/06 12:04 Page 7 ",
        "Data coverage The information presented within this publication was extracted from Eurostat's dissemination database during the third week of March 2006; data are generally available up until 2004 or 2005. Note that the space constraints associated with the format of this publication mean that time-series are generally not presented. Longer time series will generally be available when consulting Eurostat's web-site. Key figures on Europe presents information for the 25 Member States of the European Union (EU-25), the euro area, as well as the individual Member States. When available, information is also presented for the Candidate countries, other EEA/EFTA countries, as well as Japan and the United States. The EU-25 aggregate is only provided when information for all 25 Member States is available or has been estimated. A footnote is added when the data refers to a partial total that has been created from an incomplete set of country information (no data for certain Member States, or only data for an older reference period). The data for the euro area covers the 12 Member States that share the euro as a common currency: Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland. Data for the euro area covers all 12 participating countries, irrespective of when they joined the euro area; otherwise, a footnote is added. Symbols used for data An italic font is used in tables to show estimates and forecasts. The colon (:) is used in tables to represent data that is not available, either because the value was not provided by the national statistical authority or because the value is confidential. In figures (charts), missing information is footnoted as not available. The tilde (~) is used to indicate values that are not relevant or not applicable. 8 C O N T E N T S & G U I D E CH0.QXD 14/06/06 12:04 Page 8 ",

        "Gross domestic product (GDP) is a central measure of national accounts, which summarises the economic position of a country (or region). GDP can be calculated using one of three different approaches: - the output approach, which sums the gross value added of the various industries, plus taxes and less subsidies on products; - the expenditure approach, which sums the final use of goods and services (final consumption and gross capital formation), plus exports and minus imports of goods and services, and; - the income approach, which sums the compensation of employees, net taxes on production and imports, gross operating surplus and mixed income. GDP per capita in purchasing power standard (PPS) may be used to assess the wealth and competitiveness of a country. National currency GDP levels are converted into a common currency using exchange rates (purchasing power parities) that reflect the purchasing power of each currency. GDP per capita in a common currency, the purchasing power standard, therefore eliminate differences in price levels between countries, as well as allowing a comparison between economies of different absolute sizes. Please note that at the end of this publication, an annex presenting regional data includes information for GDP per capita in PPS. The real GDP growth rate is an annual growth rate of GDP in constant price terms. The calculation of the annual growth rate of GDP volume allows comparisons of economic development both over time and between economies of different sizes, irrespective of changes in prices. Growth of GDP volume is calculated using data at previous year's prices, based on a so-called chained index. 14 E C O N O M Y & F I N A N C E GDP -20246 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 EU-25 Euro area Japan United States Figure 1.1: Real GDP growth rate (% change on previous year ) CH1.QXD 14/06/06 12:05 Page 14 ",

        "The output of the economy is measured using gross value added, which is defined as the value of all newly generated goods and services (at basic prices) less the value of all goods and services consumed in their creation (at purchasers' prices). Gross value added is a basic indicator of the system of national accounts. The European system of national and regional accounts (ESA 95) provides many key indicators that can be used to assess macro-economic conditions, covering a wide range of subjects including: expenditure, income, savings, output, consumption, investment and the external balance of goods and services. The main aggregates of national accounts are compiled from institutional units (be they non-financial or financial corporations, general government, households, or non-profit institutions serving households). For national accounts purposes, these units are split according to their local kind-of-activity (KAU). A local KAU groups all the parts of an institutional unit in its capacity as producer which are located in a single or closely located sites, and which contribute to the performance of an activity at the NACE Rev. 1 Class level (4-digits). 16 E C O N O M Y & F I N A N C E ECONOMIC OUTPUT 90 100 110 120 130 140 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 Financial intermediation; real estate, renting & business activities Distributive trades; hotels, restaurants; transport, storage, communication Total industry Public admin., defence; education; health, community & personal services Agriculture, hunting, forestry & fishing Construction Figure 1.2: Gross value added in chain-linked volumes reference year 2000, EU-25 (1995=100) CH1.QXD 14/06/06 12:05 Page 16 ",

        "The economic climate information provided by business and consumer surveys is of particular importance with respect to its timeliness, as statistics are rapidly compiled and published and can be forward looking. As a result, the information gained from this type of survey often plays an important role as a first estimate of economic developments. Indeed, the results are used by analysts and policy makers, as the information is made available well in advance of results from more traditional statistical methods. Furthermore, given the close correlation between the general index for economic sentiment and quarterly GDP growth, the predictive quality of such surveys as a guide to the future evolution of GDP is also particularly noteworthy. Note that the surveys for different areas detail a number of indicators for each area, which are combined into composite confidence indicators that are expressed as a balance of favourable to non-favourable respondents. For more detailed information refer to page 92, where confidence indicators for industry, retail trade and services are presented. The relationship between GDP and economic sentiment (which is a composite indicator made up of four different measures of confidence covering industrial, consumer, construction and retail trade confidence), is clearly visible in the graph below. Business and consumer surveys within the European Commission are conducted by the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs.

        "A wide array of statistical indicators have been developed to measure labour productivity, of which, GDP per hour worked is one of the most relevant. It provides information on the productivity of the workforce of a national economy, and is particularly useful in terms of cross-country comparisons. GDP per hour worked is expressed in PPS (see page 14 for a definition of PPS) which eliminates differences in price levels between countries, while the use of hours worked as the denominator, rather than the number of persons employed, eliminates measurement problems associated with distinguishing between full and part-time employment. The data are presented in the form of an index in relation to the European Union average: if the index rises above 100, then labour productivity is higher than the EU-25 average. Labour productivity per person employed is an alternative measure of productivity used for economic activities. It is calculated by taking gross value added and dividing by the total number of persons employed. The indicator provides confirmation of the most labour and capital intensive areas of the European Union economy, as well as an insight into the rapid productivity growth of particular economic activities. 20 E C O N O M Y & F I N A N C E TOTAL LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY 0 25 50 75 100 Public administration, defence; education; health, community & personal services Financial intermediation; real estate, renting & business activities Distributive trades; hotels & restaurants; transport, storage & communication Construction Total industry Agriculture, hunting, forestry & fishing 1995 2005 (1) Figure 1.5: Labour productivity, EU-25 (EUR thousand per person employed) (1) Forecasts.

        "Many of the world's developed economies have, in recent years, experienced relatively low and stable interest and inflation rates (see overleaf for more information on inflation rates), as their financial authorities have adopted monetary policy aimed at maintaining price stability. Businesses and individuals are more likely to make capital investments (that require financing through loans) if interest rates are low and stable, as this reduces uncertainty. An interest rate is defined as the cost or price of borrowing, or the gain from lending; interest rates are traditionally expressed in annual percentage terms. Interest rates are distinguished either by the period of lending/borrowing, or by the parties involved in the transaction (business, consumers, governments or interbank operations). The convergence criteria (or Maastricht criterion rates) for European economic and monetary union, which were part of the protocol used for economic and monetary convergence when establishing the euro, are long-term interest rates. The data are based upon central government bond yields on the secondary market, gross of tax, with a residual maturity of around 10 years. There are a number of short-term interest rates, with the following maturities: overnight, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months and 12-months. Day-to- day money rates refer to deposits or loans on the money market with a maturity of just one business day. The rates shown are reference rates and are generally interbank rates. Central bank interest rates are key reference rates set by the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks (for those countries outside of the euro area). Central bank interest rates are also referred to as 'official interest rates'; they are the main instrument of monetary policy for central banks. 22 E C O N O M Y & F I N A N C E INTEREST RATES 0 2468 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 Euro area (2) United States Japan Figure 1.6: Central bank interest rates - official lending rates for loans (%) (1) (1) Annual averages.

        "Changes in the price of consumer goods and services are usually referred to as the inflation rate. Price stability is one of the primary objectives of the European Central Bank (ECB), with the inflation rate used as a prime indicator for monetary policy management within the euro area. The ECB has defined price stability as an annual increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) for the euro area of close to but below 2 % (over the medium term). For this purpose, the monetary union index of consumer prices (MUICP) covers the euro area countries, while Eurostat also publishes an aggregate index for all 25 Member States, the European index of consumer prices (EICP). HICPs are presented with a common reference year, which is currently 2005=100. Normally the indices are used to create percentage changes that show price increases/decreases for the period in question. HICPs cover practically every good and service that may be purchased by the household in the form of final monetary consumption expenditure. The different goods and services are classified according to an international classification of individual consumption by purpose, known as COICOP. At its most disaggregated level, Eurostat publish around 100 sub-indices, which can be aggregated to broad categories of goods and services (as shown in the graph below). 24 E C O N O M Y & F I N A N C E CONSUMER PRICE INDICES -4 -2 0 2 4 6 Inflation rate Housing, water, elec., gas & other fuels Transport Alcoholic beverages, tobacco Education Restaurants & hotels Health Miscellaneous goods & services Food & non-alcoholic beverages Furnish., household equip. & maintenance Recreation & culture Clothing & footwear Communications Figure 1.7: Harmonised indices of consumer prices, annual rate of change, EU-25, 2005 (%) CH1.QXD 14/06/06 12:05 Page 24 ",

        "This section refers to information that is compiled following the expenditure approach, where GDP is defined as private final consumption expenditure + government final consumption expenditure + gross capital formation + exports - imports. The relative importance of each of these items is usually given in relation to total GDP. In the system of national accounts, only households, non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) and government have final consumption. Private final consumption expenditure, or that performed by households and NPISH, is defined as expenditure on goods and services for the direct satisfaction of individual needs, whereas government consumption expenditure includes goods and services produced by government, as well as purchases of goods and services by government that are supplied to households as social transfers in kind. With respect to investment, gross capital formation consists of gross fixed capital formation, plus changes in inventories. Gross fixed capital formation is defined as resident's acquisitions less disposals of fixed tangible or intangible assets, assets that are outputs from production processes (or that are imported) that are themselves used repeatedly, or continuously, in production processes for more than one year. The final component of GDP, as defined by the expenditure approach, is the balance of external trade, which is equal to exports minus imports of goods and services. 26 E C O N O M Y & F I N A N C E GDP EXPENDITURE External balance of goods and services 0.8% Gross capital formation 20.1% Final consumption expenditure of households and non-profit institutions serving households 58.2% Final consumption expenditure of general government 20.9% Figure 1.8: Expenditure components of GDP, EU-25, 2005 (%) CH1.QXD 14/06/06 12:05 Page 26 ",

        "Government debt is a key element when assessing the government sector's financial position. Both the public balance and general government debt are reported on 1 April and 1 October of each year to the European Commission within the framework of the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP). These two indicators are also important measures that form part of the convergence criteria for European economic and monetary union (also known as the Maastricht criteria). The public balance is defined as general government net borrowing/net lending and is expressed in relation to GDP. General government comprises central, state and local government, as well as social security funds. Under the convergence criteria, the ratio of planned or actual government deficit (net borrowing) to GDP should be no more than 3 %. General government consolidated gross debt is also expressed as a percentage of GDP. It refers to the consolidated stock of gross debt at the end of the year. Under the convergence criteria, the debt ratio of general government consolidated gross debt to GDP, should generally be no more than 60 %. 28 E C O N O M Y & F I N A N C E GOVERNMENT DEFICIT AND DEBT 50 55 60 65 70 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 -6 -4 -2 02 General government debt (left-hand scale) Public balance (right-hand scale) Figure 1.9: Evolution of the public balance and general government debt, EU-25 (% of GDP) (1) (1) Public balance - net borrowing/lending of general government sector; general government debt - general government consolidated gross debt.

        "Disposable incomes within Europe have generally risen in the past 40 years; however, the same has not always been true of savings. Gross national disposable income is defined as gross national income + current transfers receivable from the rest of the world - current transfers payable to the rest of the world; savings are defined as gross national disposable income - final consumption expenditure. While most Europeans have become better off in recent years, this has not always translated into a higher ratio of savings to national disposable income. On the contrary, the majority of countries have seen savings as a proportion of disposable income fall, as consumer spending has risen at unprecedented rates, leading to concerns over the debt burden on households. Please note that at the end of this publication, an annex presenting regional data includes information on disposable income per inhabitant. The financial account deals with transactions among resident institutional units and between them and the rest of the world. It shows how the surplus or deficit on the capital account is financed by transactions in financial assets and liabilities. Thus the balance of the financial account (net acquisition of financial assets less net incurrence of liabilities) is equal in value to net lending/net borrowing, the balancing item of the capital account. The data for assets and liabilities is presented for both households and non- financial corporations. The classification comprises monetary gold and special drawing rights, currency and deposits, securities other than shares, loans, shares and other equity, insurance technical reserves, and other accounts receivable/payable. 32 E C O N O M Y & F I N A N C E SAVINGS AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS 0 10 20 30 JP IE NL CZ AT SI DK FI US BE EE SE PL ES SK DE LV IT FR LT EL UK PT Figure 1.11: Savings as a proportion of gross national disposable income, 2005 (%) (1) (1) Belgium, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Spain, France, Ireland, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States, forecasts; Cyprus, Luxembourg, Hungary and Malta, not available.

        "An enterprise that wishes to establish a presence in a foreign market can do so via a number of different routes. Often the easiest and most rapid choice is to export goods or services to the new market. However, many enterprises have complemented external trade by seeking to produce and often to sell their own goods and services in countries other than where they were first established. This latter approach is known as foreign direct investment (FDI), whereby the enterprise concerned either invests to establish a new plant/office, or alternatively, purchases existing assets of a foreign enterprise, for example, by way of acquisition, merger or takeover. Thus, FDI is a category of international investment made by an entity that is resident in one economy (the direct investor) to acquire a lasting interest in an enterprise operating in another economy. Such a lasting interest is deemed to exist if the direct investor acquires at least 10 % of the equity capital of the enterprise concerned. A direct investor may be an individual, an incorporated or unincorporated, public or private enterprise, a government, a group of related individuals, or a group of related incorporated and/or unincorporated enterprises. Outward flows (flows during the reference period) and stocks (stocks at the end of the reference period) of FDI (or FDI abroad) report investment by resident EU entities in an affiliated enterprise abroad. 34 E C O N O M Y & F I N A N C E FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT - OUTWARD Asia 13.5% Oceania and southern polar regions 3.1% Rest of the world 25.3% Africa 4.0% South America 5.1% Central America 7.8% North America 41.2% Figure 1.12: EU-25 stocks of foreign direct investment (FDI) abroad, 2003 (% of extra EU-25 FDI) CH1.QXD 14/06/06 12:05 Page 34 ",

        "The impact of demographic change within the European Union is likely to be of major significance in the coming decades. Probably the most important change will be the marked transition towards a much older population; an ageing society. Indeed, this trend is already apparent in many Member States. Total population figures refer to the population as of 1 January each year. The statistics presented should cover the total number of inhabitants of a given area (irrespective of their nationality). Data are usually based on the most recent census information, adjusted by the components of population change (births, deaths, and net migration). Population density is the ratio of mid-year population, as defined by the number of inhabitants, relative to the size of the territory in square kilometres (km\u00b2). Population change is the difference in population between two reference periods and is equal to the sum of natural population change (the number of live births minus the number of deaths) and net migration (a measure of the difference between those leaving a territory and those arriving). Population change may be expressed in terms of the number of persons, or alternatively as a growth rate.

        "Consistently low birth rates and higher life expectancy will transform the structure of the European Union's age pyramid in the coming decades. Life expectancy at birth has increased by eight years for both sexes over the last 40 years. Although life expectancy is six years higher for women than men (with higher male mortality throughout the life cycle), the gap has narrowed in the majority of Member States during recent years, perhaps as a result of more similar lifestyles. The ageing population is mainly the result of two demographic changes: decreasing fertility levels and higher life expectancy. The share of older persons in the total of the European Union will increase from 2010 onwards, as the post-war baby-boom generation approaches retirement. These demographic trends have economic and social consequences, and were addressed by a European Commission communication 'towards a Europe for all ages - promoting prosperity and inter-generational solidarity', which promoted active ageing and equal opportunities. The Lisbon Strategy pays particular attention to the demographic challenges that face the Union in relation to policies for economic growth and social cohesion. 40 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S POPULATION BY AGE CLASS 10 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 10 85 and over 75-79 65-69 55-59 45-49 35-39 25-29 15-19 5-9 Male Female Figure 2.2: Age pyramid, EU-25, 2003 (% of total population) CH2.QXD 14/06/06 12:06 Page 40 ",

        "The total fertility rate is defined as the mean number of children born to a woman during her lifetime. In developed countries a rate of about 2.1 children is considered to maintain a stable population in the long run, under an hypothetical zero net migration. Fertility rates in the European Union have generally been below this natural replacement level across most Member States for a couple of decades. Indeed, fertility rates in the majority of the Member States continued to decline over this period and only a handful of countries within the European Union report fertility rates anywhere near natural replacement rates. Live birth is defined as the total number of births excluding still births. The crude birth rate is the ratio of the number of births to the average population in a particular reference year (the result is generally expressed per 1 000 inhabitants). 42 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S BIRTHS AND FERTILITY 10.25 10.50 10.75 11.00 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 20 25 30 35 Crude birth rate (\u2030, left-hand scale) Live births outside of marriage (%, right-hand scale) (1) Figure 2.3: Birth rates and births outside of marriage, EU-25 (1) 1995, not available.

        "Social protection systems are highly developed in the European Union: they are designed to protect people against the risks associated with unemployment, parental responsibilities, ill health and invalidity, the loss of a spouse or parent, old age, housing and social exclusion. The model used in each Member State is somewhat different and some social protection benefits are provided by private social protection schemes, although they continue to be financed by government (at least partially). Indeed, the organisation and financing of social protection systems is the responsibility of each individual Member State, while the European Union provides legislation to cover people who move across borders from one Member State to another, particularly in relation to statutory social security schemes. Data on expenditure and receipts of social protection are drawn up according to the European System of integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS) methodology. This system has been designed to allow a comparison of social protection flows between Member States. Note that besides transfers in cash or in kind, total expenditure on social protection also includes other costs associated with running the services, such as administration, management and payment of property income. Expenditure on pensions is defined as the sum of disability pensions, early-retirement due to reduced capacity to work, old-age pensions, anticipated old-age pensions, partial pensions, survivors' pensions, and early-retirement benefits for labour market reasons. 48 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S SOCIAL PROTECTION Old age 41.1% Social exclusion n.e.c. 1.5% Sickness / health care 28.3% Disability 8.0% Family / children 8.0% Unemployment 6.6% Survivors (1) 4.6% Housing 2.0% Figure 2.5: Expenditure on social protection, EU-25, 2003 (% share of total benefits) (1) The survivors\u2019 function includes benefits that: provide a temporary or permanent income to people below retirement age as established in the reference scheme who have suffered from the loss of the spouse or a next-of-kin, usually when the latter represented the main breadwinner for the beneficiary; compensate survivors for funeral costs for any hardship caused by the death of a family member; provide goods and services to eligible survivors; survivors eligible for benefit may be the spouse or ex- spouse of the deceased person, his or her children, grandchildren, parents or other relatives.

        "Many of today's health care policies include not only cures but also prevention and early detection. A new programme of Community action for the period 2003-2008 was agreed in 2002. It has three main areas: improving health information and knowledge for the development of public health; enhancing the capability to respond rapidly and in a co-ordinated fashion to threats to health; and promoting health and preventing disease through addressing health determinants across all policies and activities. Health care expenditure, as a proportion of GDP is defined here as expenditure on sickness/health care, covering: cash benefits that replace in whole (or in part) the loss of earnings during temporary inability to work due to sickness or injury; and medical care provided in the framework of social protection systems to maintain, restore or improve the health of the people protected; the data presented come from the European System of integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS). Please note that this definition of health care differs from health care expenditure according to the System of Health Accounts for which data is not yet available at Eurostat. Practising physicians are defined as physicians who provide services directly to patients (i.e. seeing patients either in a hospital, practice or elsewhere) per 100 000 inhabitants; this indicator is used as a proxy for access to the health care system. A hospital discharge is registered every time a patient leaves because of finalisation of treatment, signing out against medical advice, transfer to another hospital or death. The number of discharges is expressed per 100 000 inhabitants and is the most commonly used measure of the utilisation of hospital services. 50 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S HEALTH CARE 500 600 700 800 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 Figure 2.6: Number of hospital beds, EU-25 (per 100 000 inhabitants) CH2.QXD 14/06/06 12:06 Page 50 ",

        "While civil marriages exist in each of the Member States, the relationship between civil and religious marriages is not always the same. In 14 of the Member States (Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) a religious marriage is recognised by the state as the equivalent to a civil marriage, as it is in Norway. The crude marriage rate is the number of marriages during a year expressed in relation to the average population, expressed per 1 000 inhabitants. Divorce is possible in each of the Member States, except for Malta. The oldest regulations were made in France and Luxembourg, where divorce was introduced in 1791 and 1794, in many other countries it was introduced in the 19th century. However, it was not until 1970 in Italy, 1975 in Portugal, 1976 in Scotland, 1981 in Spain, and 1995 in Ireland that divorce became possible. In most of the Member States, divorces are registered at a court. The Czech Republic, Ireland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain require proper provisions for dependent children before a divorce is granted. The crude divorce rate is the ratio of the number of divorces to the average population, again expressed per 1 000 inhabitants. 52 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S MARRIAGES AND DIVORCES 22 24 26 28 30 32 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2003 2004 Male Female Figure 2.7: Mean age at first marriage, EU-25 (years) CH2.QXD 14/06/06 12:06 Page 52 ",

        "Migration and asylum are highly political topics: the statistics produced in this area are used to monitor common asylum policy and harmonised immigration policies across the European Union. The data are also used to assess the inclusion of migrant populations and measures to prevent discrimination. With an ageing society and relatively low fertility rates, many commentators believe that economic immigration will be necessary for the European Union to overcome labour shortages in the coming years. One of the challenges facing the European Union will be the need for a dynamic immigration policy in order to address skills gaps in specific areas. In many of the Member States, migration is an important component of population change, which may redress the decline in population levels caused by low fertility rates. Net migration is defined as the difference between immigration into and emigration from the territory considered. Net migration is usually estimated on the basis of the difference between population change and natural increase. Eurostat produce corrected net migration figures by taking the difference between total and natural population increases. This assumes that any movement of population not attributable to natural change (births and deaths) is attributable to migration. Corrections due to population censuses or register counts which cannot be classified as births, deaths or migrations are also taken into account in the figures. 54 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S MIGRATION -1 000 -5000 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2004 1999 1994 1989 1984 1979 1974 1969 1964 Figure 2.8: Net migration, including corrections, EU-25 (thousands) CH2.QXD 14/06/06 12:06 Page 54 ",

        "The acquisition of citizenship is sometimes viewed as an indicator for the formal integration of migrants into their host country. The granting of citizenship usually requires a period of legal residence, together with other factors (for example, language proficiency). Citizenship may be granted to persons who have previously been citizens of another country or to persons who have been stateless. The Treaty of Amsterdam introduced a new area into the EC Treaty covering: the free movement of persons; controls on external borders; asylum, immigration and safeguarding of the rights of third-country nationals; judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, and administrative cooperation. Asylum applications refer to all persons who apply on an individual basis for asylum or similar protection, irrespective of whether they lodge their application on arrival or from inside the country, and irrespective of whether they entered the country legally or illegally. An asylum applicant is a person who has requested protection under: either Article 1 of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967; or within the remit of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and other forms of cruel or inhuman treatment (UNCAT); or the European Convention on Human Rights; or other relevant instruments of protection. 56 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S CITIZENSHIP AND ASYLUM 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 LU DE BE EL ES IE SE DK UK NL IT SI FI PL CZ LV HU Figure 2.9: Foreigners in total population, selected Member States, 2004 (% of total population) (1) (1) The Czech Republic, Ireland and the United Kingdom, 2003; Germany, Italy and Poland, 2002; Greece, 2001 and provisional value; Belgium, 2000; those Member States that are not shown, not available.

        "Consumer policy within the European Union is based on three key objectives: a high common level of consumer protection; effective enforcement of consumer protection rules; proper involvement of consumer organisations in European Union policies. The safety of consumer products is covered by a wide range of sectoral legislation, while consumer interests are also safeguarded by legislation on unfair commercial practices, misleading advertising, price indications, the conformity of goods, distance selling, doorstep selling, and e-commerce. Statistics on the final consumption expenditure of households cover expenditure incurred on goods or services that are used for the satisfaction of individual needs. Consumption expenditure covers the purchase of goods and services, the consumption of own production (such as garden produce), as well as the imputed rent of owner-occupied dwellings.

        "While comparisons of standards of living are frequently based on GDP per capita, such figures say little about the distribution of wealth. At the Laeken European Council in December 2001, a first set of 18 common statistical indicators of social exclusion and poverty were endorsed. These included a relative poverty threshold that was fixed at 60 % of national median equivalised income. This is calculated in stages: the total net income of each household is calculated by adding together the income received by all members of a household; an equivalised household size is determined by assigning weights to each member of the household (1.0 to the first adult, 0.5 to other persons aged 14 or over, and 0.3 to each child aged less than 14); for each person, the equivalised income is calculated by dividing the household income by the equivalised household size. Consequently, each person in the household is considered to have the same equivalised income. The at-risk-of-poverty rate is defined as the proportion of persons with an equivalised income that is below the threshold of 60 % of the national median income. This rate may be expressed before or after social transfers, with the difference measuring the hypothetical impact of national social transfers in reducing poverty. 60 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S LIVING CONDITIONS 0 10 20 30 40 IE PT SK EL ES IT EE UK PL DE LV BE CY LT FR AT HU NL DK LU FI SE SI CZ Before social transfers After social transfers Figure 2.11: Persons at-risk-of-poverty, 2004 (% of total population) (1) (1) During the transition to EU-SILC, indicators are derived from various sources and cannot be considered to be 100 % comparable; the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia and the United Kingdom, 2003; Malta, not available; excluding students aged 18-24 who live in households composed solely of students.

        "Labour market statistics are at the heart of many European Union policies. The Lisbon Summit in the spring of 2000 placed great emphasis on achieving full employment, with more and better jobs. One of the main goals of increasing activity and employment rates, besides their importance for the well-being of citizens, is to reduce the dependency ratio (the number of persons who do not work as a proportion of all persons), thus lowering the demand for social protection payments, and at the same time increasing tax and social security revenues. Activity rates represent the proportion of the population that are in the labour force, in other words, these statistics show the proportion of persons who are either in work, or who would like to be in work but at the time of the (labour force) survey were unemployed. Those who are not active include: persons not working in the reference week and who were in education, who took early retirement, who chose to stay at home to look after the house or the family, the permanently ill and disabled. Activity rates may be increased through a wide range of initiatives, for example, encouraging employers to offer the possibility of flexible working hours, ensuring adequate childcare facilities, or increasing the possibilities for lifelong learning. The total activity rate refers to persons aged between 15 and 64 years old. The (labour force) survey covers the entire population living in private households, but excludes those in collective households such as boarding houses, halls of residence and hospitals. 62 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S ACTIVITY RATES 0 25 50 75 100 DK SE FI NL UK PT EE DE LT LV SI AT FR SK CY CZ IE BE PL ES LU EL HU IT MT Male Female Figure 2.12: Activity rates, annual averages, 2004 (% of persons aged 15 to 64 years who are in employment or in unemployment) CH2.QXD 14/06/06 12:06 Page 62 ",

        "The European Employment Strategy (EES) was launched at the Luxembourg Jobs Summit in November 1997 and was evaluated in 2002, when it was revamped to align employment strategy more closely to the Lisbon objectives. The European Union has set itself an ambitious target of a 70 % total employment rate by 2010, while the Stockholm Council in the spring of 2001 subsequently added an employment rate target for persons aged between 55 and 64 years of 50 %. The total employment rate is calculated by dividing the number of persons aged 15 to 64 in employment by the total population of the same age group. The employed population consists of those persons who, during the reference week of the (labour force) survey, did any work for pay or profit for at least one hour, or were not working but had jobs from which they were temporarily absent; the data include family workers. Note that the final chapter at the end of this publication presents regional data for the employment rate. Flexible working conditions may stimulate employment and activity rates, for example, the possibility to work on a part-time basis. In the Labour Force Survey, the distinction between full-time and part-time employment is left to the respondent, since working hours differ from one Member State to the next, and from one branch of activity to the other. 64 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S EMPLOYMENT RATES 0 20 40 60 80 NL DE UK BE LU SE AT DK FR IT ES IE MT FI PT PL CY LV SI EE EL LT CZ HU SK Female Male Figure 2.13: Part-time employment rates, spring 2005 (% of total number of persons employed) (1) (1) Luxembourg, spring 2004.

Unemployed persons comprise those aged between 15 and 74 who were without work during the reference week of the labour force survey. Persons without work are those who had neither a job, nor were at work (for one hour or more during the reference week) in paid employment or self-employment; in addition, the unemployed have to be available for work and actively seeking work. Note that the final chapter at the end of this publication presents regional data for unemployment rates.

        "Increased labour market flexibility can be observed in relation to more opportunities for part-time and new forms of work; however, some of these may result in more insecure employment. There has been an increase in the number of temporary employees within the European Union, while some 3.8 % of European citizens declared themselves as having more than one job in 2005. The average number of hours worked per week corresponds to the number of hours a person normally works. This covers extra hours (paid or unpaid) which the person normally works, but excludes the time taken to travel from home to the place of work, as well as the time taken for meal breaks. Persons who have also worked at home are asked to include the number of hours they have worked at home. Apprentices, trainees and other persons in vocational training are asked to exclude time spent in school or other special training centres. Employees with temporary contracts are those who declare themselves as having a fixed term employment contract, or a job which will terminate if certain objective criteria are met, such as completion of an assignment, or the return of an employee who is temporarily replaced.

        "In an attempt to improve their competitiveness, a number of Member States have restructured the composition of their labour costs, such that non-wage and non-salary costs are reduced. By doing so many commentators argue that labour market flexibility is increased and there is a greater likelihood that new staff will be engaged more rapidly if economic fortunes improve. Labour costs are the expenditure borne by employers and they include employee compensation in the form of wages and salaries in cash and in kind, social security contributions, vocational training costs, and other expenditure (recruitment costs, working clothes, employment taxes). While wages and salaries account for the largest proportion of labour costs, the importance of social security paid by employers varies considerably across the Member States. Average hourly labour costs are expressed in euro, and the information may be broken down by economic activity, following the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE). These data are derived from the Labour Cost Survey (LCS), which uses the local unit (and not the household, which is used for the Labour Force Survey) as the survey unit. 70 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S LABOUR COSTS 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% MT DK CY LU SI (2) UK PT EL (2) LV (2) FI DE NL PL SK ES EE AT (3) CZ LT BE HU IT (4) FR SE (2) Other labour costs Social security paid by employer Wages and salaries Figure 2.16: Breakdown of wages and salaries, business economy (NACE C to K), 2004 (% share of total labour costs) (1) (1) Ireland, not available.

        "The structure and evolution of earnings are important features of any labour market, reflecting labour supply from individuals and labour demand by firms. Earnings, productivity, profits and consumption are all inter-related and may be leading determinants of economic growth and employment performance. The gender pay gap in unadjusted form is defined as the difference between average gross hourly earnings of male and female paid employees. Some of the underlying factors that may explain gender pay gaps include sectoral and occupational segregation, education and training, awareness and transparency: the European Union seeks to promote equal opportunities implying progressive elimination of the gender pay gap. Data on minimum wages and income distribution are transmitted by national ministries responsible for areas such as social affairs, labour or employment. Minimum wages are fixed hourly or monthly rates that are determined by governments. They are enforced by law and usually apply nationwide to all full-time employees. Note that minimum wages are gross amounts, before deductions for income tax or social security; hence, care should be taken when making any comparisons across countries. The inequality of income distribution is the ratio of total income received by the 20 % of the population with the highest income (the top quintile) to that received by the 20 % of the population with the lowest income (the bottom quintile); all incomes are equivalised disposable income (see page 60 for an explanation of this concept). Note that the final chapter at the end of this publication presents regional data for the disposable income per habitant. 72 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S EARNINGS 0 10 20 30 CY EE SK DE UK FI (1) CZ NL AT DK SE LT ES LV LU FR IE HU EL PL SI (2) IT BE PT MT Figure 2.17: Gender pay gap, 2004 (%) (1) 2003.

        "Opportunities to live and study abroad may contribute to cross- cultural understanding and personal development, with more than 100 000 citizens taking advantage of pan-European schemes each year. Improved compatibility between educational and training systems should facilitate individual mobility within the Union, an important factor for jobs and growth. Education statistics provide information on a variety of areas, including expenditure, personnel, participation rates, and attainment. The main source of data is a joint UNESCO/OECD/ Eurostat (UOE) questionnaire on education statistics. Much of the higher education system in the European Union is based on public funding, while in Japan or the United States funding is more diversified (with a higher contribution from private industry partners). Public expenditure on education includes the expenses associated with educational institutions (direct expenditure), and that associated with supporting students and their families with scholarships/loans, as well as funds for transferring subsidies to private establishments or non-profit organisations. Private expenditure on education comprises school fees, materials, transport to school (if organised by the school), meals (if provided by the school) and boarding fees (accommodation expenses). Expenditure per pupil/student measures how much central, regional and local government, private households, religious institutions and enterprises spend per pupil/student; it includes expenditure for personnel, as well as other current and capital expenditure. 74 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S EDUCATION EXPENDITURE 0 100 200 300 EU-25 Euro area Japan United States Primary education (1) Secondary education (2) Tertiary education (3) Figure 2.18: Education expenditure (1) As defined by ISCED 1.

        "One of the key aims of European Union education policy is to increase access to higher education, thus providing more students with modern skills to enable them to find work. Particular emphasis has been given to increasing the number of women students studying science related subjects, such as mathematics, computing and engineering. Data on the number of pupils and students enrolled in the education system cover all levels of education from primary through to postgraduate studies. The indicator on four-year-olds in education presents the proportion of children of that age who are enrolled in education-oriented pre-primary institutions (excluding nurseries and play centres where there is no qualified educational teaching). The pupil-teacher ratio in primary education is the number of full- time equivalent pupils divided by the number of full-time equivalent teachers. This indicator should not be used as a measure of average class sizes, as it does not take account of special cases, such as small class sizes for special needs or minority subject areas. 76 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S PARTICIPATION IN EDUCATION 0 25 50 75 LV EE LT SE DK PL MT HU PT IT SI UK IE FR FI LU BE ES SK AT EL NL CZ CY DE All fields (% of female students) Enrolled in science, mathematics & computing (% of female students in these fields) Enrolled in engineering, manufacturing & construction (% of female students in these fields) Figure 2.19: Share of women in tertiary education, 2003 (1) (1) Greece, 2002; Luxembourg, 1998, except for all fields; Belgium, data exclude independent private institutions; France, not available for science and engineering; Germany and Slovenia, ISCED 6 missing; Cyprus and Luxembourg, most tertiary students study abroad and are not included.

        "Levels of attainment and fields of education and training are classified according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97). In the last few decades, disparities in educational attainment levels between the sexes have been reduced throughout the European Union. Indeed, the situation has been reversed, and women have slightly overtaken men with respect to the number of qualifications they obtain. One European policy in the area of education is a drive to reduce the number of school dropouts and early school leavers, defined as persons aged 18 to 24 with at most lower secondary education and not in further education or training. In some countries, this vulnerable group counts for more than one third of the population of this age. The youth education attainment level is the percentage of young people aged 20-24 having attained at least an upper secondary education (ISCED level 3). Tertiary students are defined as those enrolled in tertiary education (whether or not it leads to an advanced research qualification). Note that data for Belgium exclude independent private institutions; data for Germany, Slovenia and Romania (2000) exclude ISCED level 6; data for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia exclude ISCED 5A second degrees and ISCED 6; in Cyprus and Luxembourg most tertiary students study abroad and are not included. Higher education qualifications appear to reduce the likelihood of unemployment, while unemployment rates among those aged 25 to 64 tend to be much higher for those that have only attained a secondary level of education. 78 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S YOUTH EDUCATION 05 10 15 Low Medium High Men Women Figure 2.20: Unemployment rates among persons aged 25-64 by educational attainment and gender, EU-25, 2005 (%) CH2.QXD 14/06/06 12:06 Page 78 ",

        "Despite increases in educational participation and attainment, the relatively low fertility rates recorded within the European Union in the past couple of decades have resulted in a comparatively short supply of skilled entrants into the labour market. On the other hand, there is a large stock of existing workers, some of which are characterised by lower skills (and employability). As a result, there are shortages at the top-end of the labour market, underlining the need for lifelong learning to tackle inadequate vocational qualifications. In this respect, lifelong training and education opportunities offer an important opportunity for individuals to improve their personal situation. Education, vocational training and lifelong learning play a vital role in the economic and social strategy of Europe. The European Council has adopted strategic goals and objectives for education and training to be attained by 2010. Training is often less regular and formalised than education and particularly difficult to map in statistical terms. Life-long learning refers to the proportion of persons aged 25 to 64 who stated that they received education or training in the four weeks preceding the (labour force) survey. Note the graph below includes information on formal (official and non-official programmes) and informal education and training, while the table on the next page excludes self-learning activities. 80 P O P U L A T I O N & S O C I A L C O N D I T I O N S LIFELONG LEARNING 0 20 40 60 Aged 25 to 34 Aged 35 to 44 Aged 45 to 54 Aged 55 to 64 Men Women Figure 2.21: Lifelong learning, participation in any learning activities, EU-25, spring 2003 (% of population participating in education and training) CH2.QXD 14/06/06 12:06 Page 80 ",

        "This chapter concentrates on business enterprises, covering activities from mining and quarrying through manufacturing to construction, distributive trades, hotels and restaurants, transport services, financial services and other business activities (such as real estate, computer services, accounting, legal services, advertising, labour recruitment, cleaning and security services). These statistics show developments for economic activities (through short-term business statistics, compiled with a monthly, quarterly and annual frequency) or structural changes (through structural business statistics, compiled with an annual frequency). The information presented in the opening pages of this chapter is based upon short-term business statistics. The index of turnover shows the evolution of the market for goods and services from industrial and service activities, in terms of the sales made. The index is not deflated, and so its objective is to measure market activity in value terms. Turnover includes all invoiced duties and taxes on the goods or services with the exception of the VAT invoiced to customers and other similar deductible taxes directly linked to turnover. Turnover also includes all other charges (transport, packaging, etc.) passed on to the customer, even if these charges are listed separately in the invoice. 82 I N D U S T R Y , T R A D E & S E R V I C E S GROWING AND DECLINING ACTIVITIES 0 2 4 6 Computer services and other business activities (NACE 72 and 74) Transport and communications (NACE 60 to 64) Motor trades (NACE 50) Wholesale trade (NACE 51) Retail trade (NACE 52) Hotels and restaurants (NACE 55) Figure 3.1: Fastest growing service activities, average annual growth rate of turnover, EU-25, 2000-2005 (%) (1) (1) Gross series, except for retail trade (NACE 52) where a working day adjusted series was used; estimates for 2005.

        "In order to improve the timeliness of the monthly and quarterly economic statistics, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission announced the Principal European Economic Indicators (PEEIs) in the spring of 2003. This set of indicators, of which there are eight short-term business indicators, are given the utmost priority in terms of timely collection, compilation, harmonised methodologies, dissemination and quality. Among the PEEIs for the industrial economy are the index of production and the index of domestic output prices. The industrial production index shows changes in output and activity within industry. It aims to show changes in the volume of output, through volume movements in value added. In practice, proxies are used for the compilation of the index, such as deflated turnover or production values, the physical quantity of production, or occasionally the level of labour, raw material or energy inputs. Domestic industrial output price indices (sometimes also known as industrial producer price indices) show the development of transaction prices across industrial activities: an output price index for services in the European Union is currently under development. Output prices may be used as an early indication of inflationary pressures within an economy. Industrial price increases/decreases are separated according to the destination of the product, between domestic and non-domestic markets, as determined by the residency of the third party that has ordered or purchased the product. 84 I N D U S T R Y , T R A D E & S E R V I C E S SHORT-TERM STATISTICS FOR INDUSTRY 90 100 110 120 130 Jan-06 Jan-04 Jan-02 Jan-00 Jan-98 Jan-96 Production index Domestic output price index Figure 3.3: Production and domestic output price indices, total industry (NACE Sections C to E), EU-25 (1995=100) (1) (1) Trend-cycle series for the index of production; gross series for the index of domestic output prices.

        "As with the index of production for industrial activities (shown on the previous page), the construction production index also aims to show changes in the volume of value added at factor cost; it is also one of the PEEIs. The index for construction may be split into an index for building and an index for civil engineering, according to the classification of types of construction (CC). Buildings are roofed constructions which can be used separately, have been built for permanent purposes, can be entered by persons and are suitable or intended for protecting persons, animals or objects. Buildings are themselves sub-divided into residential buildings (at least half of which are used for residential purposes) and non- residential buildings. Civil engineering works are all constructions not classified under buildings: for example, railways, roads, bridges, highways, airport runways, dams etc. It is particularly difficult to compile a production index for construction, given that it is difficult to measure output in physical quantities, as almost every project is unique in terms of the building being constructed and the site being used; equally it is difficult to obtain reliable output prices to use as a deflator in the event that output is measured in value terms. Because of this, a wide variety of approaches are used in different countries, including the use of hours worked as a proxy. 86 I N D U S T R Y , T R A D E & S E R V I C E S SHORT-TERM STATISTICS FOR CONSTRUCTION 90 95 100 105 110 115 Dec-05 Dec-03 Dec-01 Dec-99 Dec-97 Dec-95 Construction Building Civil engineering Figure 3.4: Index of production, construction, EU-25 (1995=100) (1) (1) Trend-cycle series; 2005, estimates.

        "Traditionally, business statistics were concentrated on areas such as mining, manufacturing and construction (industrial activities), including surveys aimed to measure output either in physical quantities or in value. However, more recent developments in official statistics have seen data collection efforts re-focus and an expansion into other areas of the business economy, namely, information relating to service sectors of the economy. There has also been development in specialist areas such as tourism (see the end of this chapter) and the information society (see chapter 8). Turnover indices for retail trade are compiled in both value and volume terms. The volume measure is more commonly referred to as the index of the volume of (retail) sales, which eliminates price effects.

        "The contribution of services to the European economy grows almost every year, and it is important that official statistics are able to provide information on this growing area. The knowledge- based economy and the demand for intangibles, either for consumption or investment purposes, as well as international outsourcing, has led to a major restructuring of many European economies, with a shift away from industrial activities towards services activities. This weightlessness that is inherent to many sectors of the economy provides new opportunities and with it competition both nationally and internationally. As a result, European business statistics have increasingly covered smaller, dynamic enterprises that have traditionally been excluded by official statistics. The index of turnover for other services (also a PEEI) shows the evolution of sales in value terms. Note that prices for some services have actually been falling, perhaps due to market liberalisation and increased competition (for example, telecommunications and other technology-related activities). In such cases, the rapid growth rates observed for turnover value indices for some activities would be even greater in volume terms. 90 I N D U S T R Y , T R A D E & S E R V I C E S SHORT-TERM STATISTICS FOR OTHER SERVICES 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 Dec-05 Dec-03 Dec-01 Dec-99 Computer services & other business activities Transport & communications Motor trades Hotels & restaurants Wholesale trade Figure 3.6: Index of turnover, selected service activities, EU-25 (2000=100) (1) (1) Trend-cycle series; motor trades (NACE 50), estimates for 2005; wholesale trade (NACE 51), estimates for October 2005 onwards; hotels & restaurants (NACE 55), transport & communications (NACE 64), computer services (NACE 72) & other business activities (NACE 74), estimates for July 2005 onwards.

        "The information collected by business and consumer surveys provides a rapid means of compiling simple statistics in advance of those collected through traditional statistical methods, as well as providing the opportunity to collect qualitative data. European business and consumer surveys are compiled by the Directorate- General of Financial and Economic Affairs (see http://ec.europa.eu/ economy_finance/indicators/businessandconsumersurveys_en.htm for more information). Confidence indicators are collected for industry, construction, retail trade, and services, as well as information on investment and consumer confidence. Figures are presented as seasonally adjusted balances, which are defined as the difference (in percentage point terms) between the number of positive and negative responses to each question. As can be seen from the graph below, the confidence indicators of the different economic actors within the European economy vary considerably over time, with confidence within industry and services most closely resembling the evolution of constant price GDP.

        "Structural business statistics describe the structure, conduct and performance of economic activities. The business statistics presented here are based on the enterprise as the type of statistical unit. An enterprise carries out one or more activities at one or more locations and may comprise one or more legal units. Note that enterprises that are active in more than one economic activity will be categorised under the NACE heading for which they generate their largest amount of value added - their principal activity. The information compiled serves the purposes of a variety of users, including: entrepreneurs and business leaders, who may wish to benchmark (compare the performance of) their own enterprise with the average performance of similar enterprises within their region, country, or another area where they may be considering expansion. Data may also be of interest to business and professional associations, trade unions, market researchers and the public administration. Gross value added at factor cost is defined as the monetary difference between the value of goods and services that are produced and the costs incurred for producing them (intermediate consumption), corrected for subsidies, taxes and levies. Value added is often referred to as the wealth created by enterprises, and can also be calculated as the gross operating surplus (one measure of operating profit) + personnel costs.

        "The rich variety of structural business statistics also provides regional information and, as shown on these pages, information by enterprise size-class. Enterprise size-class data may be used to study the relative productivity of enterprises, with productivity gains (perhaps resulting from scale economies) often apparent for enterprises that are larger. Indeed, in the majority of activities, large enterprises tend to employ a lower proportion of the total number of persons employed, while accounting for a higher proportion of total value added. Size-class statistics also cast light on the important role played by micro enterprises (those with less than 10 persons employed) in providing employment to a high proportion of the European Union's labour force. The number of persons employed is defined as all those who work for the enterprise, inclusive of working proprietors and unpaid family workers, as well as persons who work outside the unit (for example, sales representatives or delivery personnel). Unpaid family workers refer to persons who live with the proprietor and work regularly for the unit, but do not have a contract of service and do not receive a fixed sum for the work they perform.

        "Tourism grew rapidly in the latter part of the 20th century, however, this trend was reversed from 2001 for the next three years as concerns over terrorism attacks, health and safety epidemics, and natural disasters played a role in diminishing demand. In 2004 the number of nights spent in hotels and similar establishments of the EU-15 countries slightly increased again. Europe is still among the most visited tourist destinations in the world. The Internet has become an important factor within this area of the economy, as consumers increasingly make their own arrangements for travel and accommodation, often driven by significant discounts or alternatively by the opportunity to view a range of options for travel, accommodation and related activities before booking. The number of bed-places is defined as the number of persons who can stay overnight in beds set up in the establishments (ignoring any extra beds that may be set up at the customer's request). This indicator is used as a measure of capacity for any given type of accommodation. A tourist is defined as a visitor who stays at least one night in collective or private accommodation. A night spent is defined as each night that a guest is registered to stay in a hotel or similar establishment; his/her physical presence is not necessary. A breakdown of the nights spent in hotels is provided for residents and non-residents, the former are identified as having lived for most of the past year in a country/place, or having lived in that country/place for a shorter period and intending to return within a year to live there. Note that a significant proportion of tourism, using the definitions above, is accounted for by business customers. 98 I N D U S T R Y , T R A D E & S E R V I C E S TOURISM 0 200 400 600 800 1 000 1 200 1 400 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Figure 3.12: Nights spent in hotels and similar establishments, EU-15 (millions) (1) (1) Figures for Ireland 2003 have been estimated.

        "Approximately half of the European Union's land is farmed, highlighting the importance of agriculture in society. Utilised agricultural area (UAA) is defined as the area taken up by arable land, permanent grassland, permanent crops, and kitchen gardens - it does not include wooded areas or forests. Permanent crops are those not grown in rotation, occupying the soil for a long period and yielding harvests over several years, for example orchards or vineyards. Permanent grassland is land used (for five years or more) to grow herbaceous forage crops; it is usually used for grazing or mowed for silage or hay. Arable land is worked regularly, generally under a system of crop rotation, normally with annual crops like cereals; this category also includes temporary grassland (<5 years), melons and strawberries, seedlings, and crops under glass or cover. Wooded area is land with tree crown cover of more than 5 % where trees reach a height of at least 5 metres at maturity, or where tree crown cover is over 10 % (irrespective of height).

        "The recent reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) aim to achieve a more market oriented and sustainable agricultural policy for the European Union. Within the context of the Lisbon process, CAP reforms encourage a more entrepreneurial approach, which may require significant changes in culture and working habits. The Agriculture Council has adopted Community strategic guidelines for Rural Development for the Programming period 2007-2013, which include initiatives such as vocational training, support for young farmers, farm modernisation payments, financing to improve the quality of farm products and raise health and environmental standards, early retirement schemes, and advisory services for farm management. The farm labour force is defined as all persons (over the legal age limit) having provided agricultural work on and for the holding during the previous 12 months; work time is recorded as a percentage of a full-time equivalent (AWU: annual work unit). The family labour force includes the holder and the members of his family. The full-time regular farm labour force excludes seasonal workers. The farm holder is the legal or physical person legally and economically responsible for the holding. The percentage of female farm holders is quite different between countries, but it is generally still quite low. 102 A G R I C U L T U R E , F O R E S T R Y & F I S H E R I E S FARM LABOUR FORCE 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% BE CZ DK DE EE EL ES FR IE IT CY LV LT LU HU MT NL AT PL PT SI SK FI SE UK Males Females Figure 4.2: Share of female farm managers in the Member States, 2003 (%) CH4.QXD 14/06/06 12:08 Page 102 ",

        "Successive reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) have simplified rules and re-aligned farm support such that it targets areas of consumer concern, and agricultural production that focuses on meeting quality, environmental and food safety guarantees. The European Union has built up a significant body of law on food safety, animal health, animal welfare and plant health, including a Regulation which provided the legal basis for the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which was formally adopted on 28 January 2002. An increasing number of consumers appear willing to pay a premium for products that are grown/processed following traditional methods (quality labels guaranteeing the origin of certain products) or farmed using organic techniques. These issues may also be coherent with an agricultural policy that promotes sustainability to preserve the environment and natural resources. 104 A G R I C U L T U R E , F O R E S T R Y & F I S H E R I E S AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION -2 -1 012 2002 2003 2004 2005 Cattle (1) Pigs (1) Total whole milk (2) Figure 4.3: Evolution of selected livestock population and whole milk production, EU-25 (% change compared with the previous year) (1) Based on a volume series in thousand heads, as of December.

        "Many valuable habitats in Europe are maintained by extensive farming, and a wide range of wild species rely on this for their survival, but agricultural practices can also result in pollution of soil, water and air, and a loss of wildlife. In recent years, the role of farming in relation to the environment and rural development has come under the spotlight and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is increasingly aimed at reducing the negative effects of agriculture on the environment. Organic farming in the EU-15 has grown, on average, by around 21 % per annum since the mid-1990s. At the end of 2005, a proposal for a Council Regulation on organic production and labelling of organic products was put forward, with the aim of improving clarity in this sphere. The availability of financial support and other incentives for farmers to convert to organic production is designed to help this type of farming grow still further and to support associated businesses throughout the food chain. Rural development measures encourage, by offering financial assistance, reductions in the numbers of animals per hectare of land, uncultivated field boundaries, the creation of ponds or other water features, as well as the planting of trees and hedges. An initiative known as Leader+, sees the European Union, national governments and private bodies co-funding rural development projects, such as: introducing new farming techniques and rural crafts; helping establish food processing facilities on farms; assisting farmers in marketing their products; making additional improvements to animal welfare; renovating villages and rural facilities; encouraging tourism; promoting afforestation and forestry management. 106 A G R I C U L T U R E , F O R E S T R Y & F I S H E R I E S AGRI-ENVIRONMENT AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 BE CZ DK DE EE EL ES FR IE IT CY LV LT HU (2) MT NL AT PL (2) PT SI SK FI SE UK Renewable energy production Contractual work Tourism Processing of farm products Figure 4.4: Number of holdings with another gainful activity, 2003 (thousand units) (1) (1) Luxembourg, not available.

        "The European Union has approximately 160 million hectares of forests and other wooded land, just over 40 % of its land area. Contrary to most other regions of the world, the area of land in the European Union that is devoted to forestry is gradually increasing. Forestry often involves small enterprises or individuals whose forestry activities are commonly coupled with those of other economic activities: there are an estimated 15 million forest owners in the European Union, most of which are small-scale private owners. The majority of private owners have holdings that average less than 3 hectares, while the average size of public holdings is more than 1 000 hectares. As with agriculture, the European Union seeks to promote sustainable development and the protection of the natural environment. The Agriculture and Fisheries Council has requested that a Forest Action Plan is presented by mid-2006. Total roundwood production (or removals), comprises all quantities of wood removed from the forest and other wooded land. This volume measure is reported in cubic metres underbark (in other words, excluding bark). Total sawnwood production is that produced either by sawing lengthways or by a profile-chipping process, whereby the wood exceeds 6 mm in thickness. Products within this category include: planks, beams, joists, boards and rafters, be they planed, unplaned, or end-jointed. Cork is one of the most important non-wood forest products in the European Union, with approximately 1.7 million hectares of cork forests accounting for 80 % of worldwide production. 108 A G R I C U L T U R E , F O R E S T R Y & F I S H E R I E S FORESTRY 0 100 200 300 400 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Non-coniferous Coniferous Figure 4.5: Total roundwood, EU-25 (million m\u00b3 under bark) CH4.QXD 14/06/06 12:08 Page 108 ",

        "The common fisheries policy (CFP) was designed to deal with biological, economic and social dimensions of fishing. It was introduced in 1983 and can be divided into four main areas: the conservation of stocks; structures (such as vessels, port facilities and fish processing plants); the organisation of the market for fish in the European Union; and external fisheries policy. To ensure sustainable fishing, it is not only the quantity of fish taken from the sea that is important, but also their species, size, and the techniques used in catching them, as well as the areas where they are caught. This may be extended to more general protection of marine ecosystems, avoiding pollution and other forms of environmental damage. Restructuring within the fisheries sector has led to the European Union's fleet capacity declining, as quotas have been imposed to ensure a better balance between the number of vessels and fish. This has often resulted in a loss of employment in coastal areas which in many cases may face limited employment opportunities. The total annual catch of fishery products is measured in terms of the catch from all oceans and internal waters of the world; data are expressed in the live weight equivalent of the landings (in other words, as taken from the water, before processing). The total power of the fishing fleet is expressed in kilowatts; data generally refer to the fleet size on 31 December of each reference year. 110 A G R I C U L T U R E , F O R E S T R Y & F I S H E R I E S FISHERIES 0 2 000 4 000 6 000 8 000 10 000 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Figure 4.6: Total power of the fishing fleet, EU-15 (thousand kilowatts) Source: DG Fisheries and Maritime Affairs CH4.QXD 14/06/06 12:08 Page 110 ",

        "Statistics on international trade are an important data source for many public and private sector decision-makers at an international, European Union and national level. These data are extensively used for multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations, to define and implement anti-dumping policies, and to evaluate the progress of the Single Market. It is important to note that there are two main sources for statistics on international trade. On the one hand, there is External Trade statistics (ETS) which provide information only on trade in goods, collected on the basis of customs and VAT declarations. ETS provide detailed information on the value and volumes of international trade in goods per commodity. On the other hand, there is the Balance of Payments (BoP), which registers all the transactions of an economy with the rest of the world. The current account of the BoP provides information not only on international trade in goods (generally the largest category), but also on international transactions in services, income and current transfers. For all these transactions BoP registers the value of exports (credits) and imports (debits), the difference of which is usually referred to as the balance. A negative balance, that is a current account deficit, shows that a country is spending more than what it is internally produced and is therefore a net debtor towards the rest of the world. Trade integration of goods and services is the average value of debits and credits (summed together and divided by two) given as a proportion of GDP. This indicator is calculated for both goods and services, based on BoP data; if the values increase over time, then the reporting territory became more integrated within the international economy. It is normal that smaller countries will display a higher recourse to international trade, as they are more likely to import a range of goods and services that are not produced within the domestic market. 112 I N T E R N A T I O N A L T R A D E SHARE IN WORLD TRADE -6 -303 EU-25 Euro area Japan United States Goods Services Figure 5.1: Balance of goods and services, 2003 (% of GDP) (1) (1) EU-25, extra-EU trade flows; euro area, extra-euro area trade flows; Japan and the United States, trade flows with the rest of the world.

        "Balance of Payment statistics are of particular interest for analysing the services economy, as external trade statistics only cover goods. The provision of services tends to contribute an increasing share of the economic wealth of the European Union, and accounts for more than 50 % of GDP in each Member State. Nevertheless, the value of exports and imports of goods is approximately three times higher than that of services. Part of this imbalance may be due to the nature of some services: for example, the provision of services of proximity or alternatively professional services that are bound by distinct national legislation, making it difficult to trade many services across borders. Due to their intangible nature, trade in services is more difficult to record than trade in goods, with difficulties associated with defining the service, its value, and the flows associated with each service; as such, there may be some elements of under-reporting in the statistics that are presented. The three main categories that may be identified within the services account include transportation, travel, and other services (essentially other business services, financial services and royalties and license fees). 114 I N T E R N A T I O N A L T R A D E EXTERNAL TRADE OF SERVICES 0 25 50 75 100 Other business services Transportation Travel Financial services Royalties and license fees Computer and information services Insurance services Construction services Government services, n.e.c.

        "International trade in goods forms an increasing part of the world economy, with globalisation extending its influence and with growth in a number of rapidly developing economies, notably the well documented cases of China and India, but also some of the New Independent States (the former Soviet Union, excluding the Baltic States) where indigenous energy supplies are of particular importance. Extra-EU trade statistics cover the trading of goods with non- Community countries, whereas trade between Member States is usually referred to as intra-EU trade. Note that an important distinction is usually made when reporting EU-25 data, insofar as external trade data for these two entities is usually provided in relation to extra-EU trade only. As such, the data presented for the EU-25 treats this as a single trading block, and reports exports from the whole of the EU-25 to the rest of the world and imports from the rest of the world into the EU-25; at no stage is trade between Member States considered. External trade statistics report export and import values and volumes for goods using a product classification. The statistics for exported goods are recorded at their free-on-board (fob) value, which is their market value at the customs frontier of the exporting economy, including charges made for insurance and transport services up to the frontier. Import values are usually presented in terms of cost, insurance, freight (cif). All values are generally provided excluding import duties or other Community taxes. 116 I N T E R N A T I O N A L T R A D E EU AND THE WORLD MARKET FOR GOODS EU-25 exports Others 45.6% Canada 5.0% Japan 8.3% China (excl.

        "A positive balance of trade is known as a trade surplus and consists of exporting more (in terms of value) than one imports. On the contrary, a negative balance of trade is known as a trade deficit and consists of importing more than one exports. Neither is necessarily damaging in a modern economy, although large trade surpluses or trade deficits may sometimes be a sign of other economic problems. The EU-25 tends to register a negative trade balance. Imports are defined as goods which enter the statistical territory of the European Union from a third country and are placed under the customs procedure for free circulation (as a general rule goods intended for consumption), inward processing or processing under customs control (goods for working, processing or repair) immediately or after bonded warehousing; while exports are goods which leave the statistical territory of the European Union for a third country after being placed under the customs procedure for exports (definitive export) or outward processing (goods for working, processing) or repair or following inward processing. Note that about 65 % of the extra EU-25 trade flows are made by the five largest economies of the European Union, namely Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. 118 I N T E R N A T I O N A L T R A D E EVOLUTION OF EU TRADE -2000 200 400 600 800 1 000 1 200 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Balance Imports Exports Figure 5.4: Evolution of EU-25\u2019s trade, 2000-2004 (EUR 1000 million) CH5.QXD 14/06/06 12:08 Page 118 ",

        "External trade product statistics cover all movable and physical goods, including electricity. One of the most common classifications for studying aggregated product statistics is the Standard International Trade Classification of the United Nations (SITC Rev. 3); this classification allows a comparison to be made on a worldwide basis. The European Union runs a considerable trade deficit in terms of mineral fuels, lubricants and related products, while smaller deficits are registered for food, drinks and tobacco, and for other manufactured products. On the other hand, the European Union records a trade surplus for chemicals and related products, and for machinery and transport equipment. As such, a pattern emerges whereby the EU appears to be more specialised in exporting manufactured goods that often contain considerable know-how and expertise, whereas imports are concentrated among more basic, unrefined products of low unit value, that are either used as inputs for industrial activities, or alternatively provide relatively cheap products for European consumers (food, clothing and other manufactured goods that involve considerable amounts of labour input). 122 EU TRADE BY PRODUCT EU-25 exports 0 10 20 30 40 50 Machinery & transport equipment Other manufactured products Chemicals & rel. products Food, drinks & tobacco Mineral fuels, lubricants & rel. materials Other Raw materials Figure 5.6: Share of the product groups, 2004 (% of total trade) (1) (1) Extra-EU trade flows.

        "Intra-EU trade statistics report trade between EU Member States. Whereas extra-EU trade statistics are required for a common trade and customs policy, intra-EU trade statistics measure the integration of the Member States in a common single market. Note that countries that are near the centre of Europe are more likely to have a higher proportion of intra-EU trade than countries, that are geographically on the periphery of the European Union. Intra-EU trade accounts for the majority of trade within each of the Member States. Intra-EU trade statistics are collected directly from trade operators as a result of customs controls being abolished between the borders of the Member States during the creation of the single market. More than half of intra-EU-25 trade flows are made by the five largest economies of the EU, namely Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. 124 TRADE BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES 0 25 50 75 100 LU CZ SK EE PT NL HU PL LV BE ES AT DK LT SI CY FR DE IE IT SE UK FI EL MT Dispatches Arrivals Figure 5.7: Intra-EU trade as a proportion of total trade, 2004 (%) I N T E R N A T I O N A L T R A D E CH5.QXD 14/06/06 12:08 Page 124 ",

        "External trade statistics are expressed in current prices, i.e. the prices relevant to the reference period concerned. However, as the value of trade flows is determined by both the quantities sold and price variations, it is necessary to distinguish between these two elements. Unit value indices, which are calculated from trade transactions at a detailed level, can be used to approximate import and export price movements. This allows the measurement of movements in the volume of trade to be estimated in constant prices of a previous reference year. Terms of trade is an indicator of external competitiveness of a country. It is calculated as a change in the ratio of an export unit value index to an import unit value index, relative to the base year. An increase in terms of trade is a favourable movement: it means that a country can purchase a larger quantity of imports for a given quantity of exports. The movements in the volume of trade can be measured by the ratio of volume indices. This indicator shows how export volumes have developed in relation to import volumes. 126 I N T E R N A T I O N A L T R A D E EXTERNAL TRADE INDICES 90 95 100 105 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Terms of trade index Export unit value index Import unit value index Figure 5.8: EU-25 external trade indices (2000=100) CH5.QXD 14/06/06 12:08 Page 126 ",

        "Transport is defined as any movement of passengers and/or goods (freight) using a given network. Recent years have seen an increase in personal mobility, with car ownership rising in the majority of Member States, while the opening up of a single European market and just-in-time deliveries have driven rapid growth in road and maritime freight transport services. Each mode of transport has its own particular advantages in relation to a set of criteria covering issues such as capacity, speed, cost, safety, flexibility, energy consumption, and environmental impact. European transport policy aims to create a transport system that allows each mode of transport to play a role in a developing transport infrastructure, resulting in more efficient, cost effective and sustainable transport solutions. For the purpose of statistical comparisons between different modes of transport, standardised units are often used for measuring freight (in tonne-kilometres, which represent the movement of one tonne over a distance of one kilometre) and passenger traffic (passenger-kilometres, which represent one passenger travelling a distance of one kilometre). Inland freight transport is defined as that covered by road, rail and inland waterways. Inland passenger transport is defined as that travelled by passengers in cars, buses and coaches, and trains. Fatalities caused by road accidents include drivers and passengers of motorised vehicles and pedal cycles, as well as pedestrians: included are road accident casualties who die within 30 days of an accident. 128 TRANSPORT OVERVIEW 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 BE CZ DK DE EE EL ES FR IE IT CY LV LT LU HU MT NL AT PL PT SI SK FI SE UK 30 years and over Between 20 and 29 years Less than 20 years Figure 6.1: People killed in road accidents, selected Member States, 2002 (persons killed per million inhabitants) (1) (1) Austria, 2003; the Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, no breakdown available.

        "The majority of the growth in inland passenger transport within the European Union in the last three or four decades has been with respect to road transport. There has been a steady increase in car ownership within the European Union, with several Member States reporting an average of more than one car for every two inhabitants. The growth in the use of road networks has often outpaced the speed with which new, or improved, roads have been built. This has resulted in increased congestion, particularly evident around and within Europe's major conurbations. Although motorways constitute only a small part of the entire road network within the European Union, their length has more than tripled over the last 30 years. 130 ROAD TRANSPORT 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% BE CZ DK DE EE ES FR IE IT CY LV LT LU HU NL AT PL PT SI SK FI SE UK International National Figure 6.2: National and international road transport of goods, 2004 (% based on million tonne-kms of transport) (1) (1) Greece and Malta, not available.

        "During the last decade, the total length of transport infrastructure within the European Union increased for all inland transport modes, with the exception of railways, which experienced a slight decrease in its network length. Nevertheless, the volume of goods transported by railway increased, although by nowhere near the same rate as that recorded for road freight transport. The apparent stability of rail transport is slightly misleading however. In many Member States major investments are made to increase the high speed rail network. The performance on this network is increasing and high speed rail recently accounted for 20 % of the rail passenger transport in the EU-25. Rail transport statistics are reported on the basis of the territoriality principle, with each country reporting loading/embarkation, unloading/disembarkation for the movement of goods and passengers on their national territory. As such, comparisons between countries and across various modes of transport should preferably be made using tonne-kilometres or passenger- kilometres, rather than tonnes or numbers of passengers, where there is a high risk of double counting (particularly in relation to international traffic).

        "Alongside rapid growth in the use of road transport there has also been a substantial increase in the use of air transport in recent years. Some of this may be attributed to the deregulation of air transport markets, which resulted in increased competition and the development of low-cost air carriers. As a result, it is now relatively common for many Europeans to take several holidays within the same year and to visit a number of countries, often for short breaks. As with road transport one of the main concerns for the development of air transport networks is the capacity of the system, which in many cases has reached saturation, resulting in congestion for travellers (delayed flights, overloaded air traffic control systems, increased environmental impact, and air terminals that can no longer support the volume of traffic). The information presented in relation to air passenger transport refers to the 15 most used airports within the European Union, in terms of the number of passengers that embark and disembark. As may be expected, the volume of goods that is transported by air is relatively low in comparison to most of the other modes of freight transport. 134 T R A N S P O R T AIR TRANSPORT 0 25 50 75 Milano, Malpensa airport (IT) Kobenhavn, Kastrup airport (DK) Palma de Mallorca airport (ES) London, Stansted airport (UK) Manchester International (UK) Paris, Orly (FR) Barcelona (ES) Munchen (DE) Roma, Fiumicino (IT) London, Gatwick (UK) Madrid, Barajas (ES) Amsterdam, Schiphol (NL) Paris, Charles-de-Gaulle (FR) Frankfurt, Main (DE) London, Heathrow (UK) Figure 6.4: Top 15 airports (in terms of air passenger transport), passengers embarked and disembarked, EU-25, 2004 (million passengers) CH6.QXD 14/06/06 12:09 Page 134 ",

        "A great deal of the European Union's trade in goods is conducted through maritime ports, in particular that relating to bulky, low value goods that cannot be transported economically using other transport modes. Most of the international trade in goods of the European Union's Member States is transported by sea, passing through one of the major sea ports. Indeed, almost 90 % of the European Union's external trade (imports and exports combined) and more than 40 % of the internal trade between European Union Member States is transported by sea with over 3 000 million tonnes of freight loaded and unloaded in European Union ports each year. Maritime transport statistics are collected at the port level, where a port authority generally records ship and cargo movements. Note that the statistics presented for maritime transport do not include the transport of goods or passengers on inland waterways. More precisely, the information presented covers the movement of goods and/or passengers using seagoing vessels on voyages which are undertaken wholly or partly at sea. A sea passenger is defined as any person who makes a sea journey on a merchant ship (service staff are not regarded as passengers, nor are non-fare paying crew members, or infants in arms). 136 T R A N S P O R T MARITIME TRANSPORT 0 100 200 300 400 500 DK EL EE SE FI IT IE UK CY ES MT FR DE NL PL BE PT LV LT SI Figure 6.5: Sea passenger transport - outward flows, 2004 (passengers per 100 inhabitants) (1) (1) EU-15, Estonia, France, Italy, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, 2003; Cyprus, 2002; the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Hungary, Austria and Slovakia, not relevant.

        "A competitive and reliable energy sector is an essential part of an industrialised economy. The energy sector has been highlighted recently due to concerns over the security of supply caused by instabilities in the Middle East, disputes over pipelines for delivery, or adverse weather conditions that affect refinery output. With rapid growth in demand for fossil fuels from several developing countries, imbalances arose between supply and demand, leading to pressure on prices. This was most evident for oil prices during 2004 and much of 2005, with price increases stabilising thereafter, the effects of which were evident in higher prices for industry and consumers. As oil is one of the main fuels used to generate electricity, there were also knock on effects on electricity prices. Some protection against such price increases can be achieved through diversification, particularly for electricity generation, for example from renewable energy sources (hydro-power, solar or wind) or nuclear power; changing the product mix to avoid reliance on any one type of energy or any single country as a supplier. Electricity and gas tariffs vary from one supplier to another. They may be the result of negotiated contracts, especially for large industrial consumers. For smaller consumers they are generally set according to the amount of electricity or gas consumed, and a number of other characteristics that vary from one country to another. Tariffs also generally include fixed charges. Therefore, there is no single price for electricity or gas in any European Union country. In order to compare prices over time and between countries, two 'standard consumers' are presented, one representing domestic consumers and one industrial consumer. The actual price paid by real consumers will differ from these. All electricity price data are given in euro per kWh (excluding taxes) and correspond to prices applicable on 1 January of the reference year, a similar set of criteria are used for gas prices, except the unit changes to euro per GJ. 138 E N V I R O N M E N T & E N E R G Y ENERGY PRICES 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Average price for unleaded gasoline (Euro-super 95) Average price for automotive diesel oil Figure 7.1: Gasoline and diesel prices, EU-15 (EUR/litre) (1) (1) Arithmetic average of the individual Member States' consumer prices at the pump, including all taxes.

        "Energy intensity may be measured as the ratio between gross inland consumption of energy and gross domestic product (GDP) at constant prices (1995). Note that if an economy becomes more efficient in its use of energy, and its GDP remains constant, then the ratio for this indicator should fall. However, the economic structure of an economy plays an important role in determining the intensity, as post-industrial economies with large service sectors will, a priori, display low levels of energy intensity, while developing economies may have a considerable proportion of their economic activity within industrial sectors, thus leading to a higher value for the indicator. Any kind of extraction of energy products from natural sources to a usable form is called primary production, for example, from coal mines or oil fields. Note that the transformation of energy, for example, electricity generation in thermal power plants from coal or oil is not considered as primary production. Solid fuels cover fossil fuels such as hard coal, coke, lignite, and peat. Primary production of crude oil covers all production within national boundaries, including offshore production. The heat produced in a reactor as a result of nuclear fission is regarded as primary production of nuclear heat. Renewable energy sources cover the production of energy from biomass, hydropower, geothermal energy, wind and solar energy. Total gross electricity generation covers all types of power plants and is measured as the electricity produced at the outlet of the main transformers. 140 E N V I R O N M E N T & E N E R G Y ENERGY PRODUCTION AND INTENSITY 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 United States EU-25 Japan Figure 7.2: Energy intensity (kgoe per thousand EUR) (1) (1) Ratio of gross inland energy consumption to GDP (in constant prices of 1995).

        "Dependency on energy imports has increased from 40 % of gross consumption in the 1980s to around 50 % today. Increased globalisation and rising living standards are likely to result in higher demand for energy, for use in freight and passenger transportation, as well as to heat homes and power household appliances. As such, energy consumption may be expected to rise, unless steps are taken to reverse this trend. The main externality associated with energy consumption is environmental. Indeed, energy consumption accounts for nearly 95 % of man-made carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, according to the European Commission's Directorate-General for Energy and Transport. Gross inland consumption represents the quantity of energy necessary to satisfy inland demand of a national territory. It may be defined as primary production plus imports, recovered products and stock changes, less exports and fuel supply to maritime bunkers (for seagoing ships of all flags). Net imports of primary energy are calculated as imports minus exports; they exclude transit quantities (notably via gas and oil pipelines), except for electrical energy whose transit is recorded under foreign trade statistics.

        "Renewable energy has an important role to play in reducing CO 2 emissions. A sustainable energy policy is in part reliant upon increasing the share of renewable energy, which may at the same time help improve the security of energy supply by reducing the Community's growing dependence on imported energy sources. Renewable energy sources are expected to be economically competitive with conventional energy sources in the medium to long term. The proportion of electricity from renewable energy measures the contribution of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in relation to national electricity consumption, which comprises total gross national electricity generation from all fuels, plus electricity imports, minus electricity exports. The European Parliament and Council set indicative targets in 2001 for the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources, whereby 22 % of the EU-15\u2019s gross electricity consumption should be electricity produced from renewables by 2010; the target for the EU-25 is 21 %. These targets also represent an important contribution towards complying with the commitments made by the European Union under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol (see overleaf for more information). Renewable energy sources include renewable non-fossil energy sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydro-power and energy from biomass/wastes. The latter refers to electricity generated from the combustion of wood and wood wastes, other solid wastes of a renewable nature (for example, straw), biogas (including landfill, sewage, and farm gas) and liquid biofuels, and from municipal solid waste incineration. 144 E N V I R O N M E N T & E N E R G Y RENEWABLE ENERGY 0 100 200 300 400 500 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 10 11 12 13 14 15 Biomass-fired power stations (TWh, left-hand scale) Wind turbines (TWh, left-hand scale) Geothermal power plants (TWh, left-hand scale) Hydro power plants (TWh, left-hand scale) Electricity from renewable energy as a proportion of gross electricity consumption (%, right-hand scale) Figure 7.4: Electricity generated from renewable energy sources, EU-25 CH7.QXD 14/06/06 12:09 Page 144 ",

        "Industrialised countries that are signatories to the Kyoto Protocol, adopted in December 1997, are required to reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride) to, on average, 5.2 % below their 1990 level, by the period 2008 to 2012. For its part, the European Union agreed to an 8 % reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions, with reductions for the EU-15 Member States agreed under the so-called burden sharing agreement, which allows some countries to increase their emissions, provided these are offset by reductions in other Member States. Emissions of the six greenhouse gases covered by the Protocol are weighted by their global warming potentials (GWPs) and aggregated to give total emissions in CO 2 equivalents. The total emissions are presented as indices, which were set to 100 for the Kyoto base year. The index of greenhouse gas emissions therefore shows trends in emissions of the Kyoto basket of six gases. The indicator does not include ozone depleting substances with global warming properties, as covered by the Montreal Protocol. 146 E N V I R O N M E N T & E N E R G Y GREENHOUSE GASES 90 91 92 93 94 95 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Figure 7.5: Index of total greenhouse gas emissions, EU-25 (Kyoto base year = 100) (1) (1) Generally 1990 = 100.

        "Freshwater resources are renewed through natural processes (the hydrological cycle), whereby approximately 65 % of the precipitation (rain, hail and snow) falling on land returns to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration; the remainder recharges streams, rivers and lakes before flowing out to sea. Statistics on water resources are usually calculated on the basis of long term annual averages of at least 20 years, to take account of the fluctuations in rainfall and evaporation/transpiration from one year to the next. Evapotranspiration is the volume of water that is transported from the ground (including inland water surfaces - streams, rivers, freshwater lakes and glaciers) into the atmosphere by evaporation or by transpiration of plants. The internal flow is the volume of river run-off and groundwater derived from precipitation; in other words, precipitation less evapotranspiration. External inflow is the volume of inflow derived from rivers and groundwater that originate in a neighbouring territory. The sum of these two categories is called fresh water resources, which refers to the volume of water resulting from internal flow and external inflow. Outflow is the volume of water that flows from rivers and groundwater into the sea and into neighbouring territories. The total freshwater resources available is calculated as the sum of internal and external flows. The proportion of the population that is connected to public water supplies is defined as the share of the total population which is served by (public or private) economic units engaged in the collection, purification and distribution of water. 148 E N V I R O N M E N T & E N E R G Y WATER RESOURCES 0 25 50 75 100 CY NL FR DE DK BE HU SI IE CZ AT PL SK LT EE Figure 7.6: Population connected to public water supply, 2002 (% of total) (1) (1) Cyprus, Poland and Slovakia, 2003; Germany and France, 2001; Greece, Spain, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, not available.

There are three broad types of waste water treatment that are distinguished when collecting statistical information in this area: primary, secondary and tertiary water treatment. Primary treatment of waste water involves allowing suspended solids to settle, reducing suspended solids by at least 50 %. Secondary treatment generally involves biological treatment, with a secondary settlement procedure that should result in a biological oxygen demand (BOD) removal of at least 70 % and a chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of at least 75 %. Tertiary treatment goes a stage further and removes nitrogen and/or phosphorous and/or any other pollutants affecting the quality of the water. The population connected to urban wastewater collecting systems is that which are served by a sewer system, regardless of the availability of treatment facilities for the waste water. 150 WATER TREATMENT 0 25 50 75 100 DE (2) EE (3) ES (3) FR (2) IE (2) LV LT LU HU (3) NL (3) PL SI (3) FI (4) SE (5) Tertiary Secondary Primary Figure 7.7: Population connected to waste water treatment, by type of treatment, 2003 (% of total) (1) (1) Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Cyprus, Malta, Austria, Portugal, Slovakia and the United Kingdom, not available.

        "Waste treatment is defined as physical, thermal, chemical or biological processes which change the characteristics of waste in order to reduce its volume or hazardous nature, to facilitate its handling, or to enhance recovery of raw materials. Treatment of municipal waste can be classified into three principal categories: - landfill, which is defined as the depositing of waste into or onto land; - incineration, which refers to the thermal treatment of waste in a specifically designed plant, and; - recycling, which is a reprocessing of waste in a production process which diverts it from the waste stream. The disposal of waste can have a serious environmental impact: for example, landfill takes up land space, and may cause air, water and soil pollution. Incineration can also result in emissions of dangerous air pollutants, unless properly regulated. The amount of municipal waste disposed of through landfill may be measured in terms of the weight (kilograms) of disposed waste per inhabitant per year. 154 E N V I R O N M E N T & E N E R G Y TREATMENT OF MUNICIPAL WASTE 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Municipal waste generated Municipal waste landfilled Municipal waste incinerated Figure 7.9: Quantity of municipal waste treatment, EU-25 (kg per capita) CH7.QXD 14/06/06 12:09 Page 154 ",

        "Research and development (R&D) lies at the heart of the European Union's strategy to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010. In order to achieve this goal, many commentators argue that Europe needs to devote considerably more resources to research. Indeed, one of the goals set in Lisbon was for the European Union to increase its R&D expenditure to at least 3 % of GDP by 2010. The European Commission has been active in establishing a European Research Area (ERA), which is designed to overcome some of the barriers that are thought to have hampered European research efforts, for example, by addressing geographical, institutional, disciplinary and sectoral boundaries. Research and development is defined as comprising creative work undertaken on a systematic basis to increase the stock of knowledge (of man, culture and society) and the use of this stock to devise new applications. Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (often referred to as GERD) is composed of four separate sectors of performance: business enterprises, government, higher education, and private non-profit organisations. Expenditure data consider the research spend on the national territory, regardless of the source of funds; data are usually expressed in relation to GDP, otherwise known as R&D intensity. 158 S C I E N C E & T E C H N O L O G Y RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE 1.80 1.85 1.90 1.95 2.00 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 EU-25 Euro area (2) Figure 8.1: Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) (% of GDP) (1) (1) Estimates; 2004, estimates based on preliminary data.

        "Researchers are defined as professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems, and/or in the management of associated projects. While Europe has a long-standing tradition of excellence in research and innovation, there are concerns that European researchers leave the European Union to pursue and exploit their research efforts elsewhere. The European Commission has therefore placed renewed emphasis on the conversion of Europe's scientific expertise into marketable products and services, while also focusing on improving the mobility of European researchers, encouraging networks between researchers from different Member States, and promoting R&D as an occupation for women. The term PhD is defined as general tertiary programs which lead to the award of an advanced research degree, e.g. a doctor in economics. The programs are therefore devoted to advanced study and original research and are not based on course-work only. They usually require 3-5 years of research and course work, generally after a Master's degree. In that sense, indicators on the number of PhD students provide an idea of the degree to which countries will have researchers at the highest level. The data on the number of women researchers are presented in the form of head-counts and therefore do not take account of the differences that may exist between countries with respect to the propensity to employ on a part-time basis. 160 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HUMAN RESOURCES 0 20 40 60 80 SE LV LT PT EE SK PL EL ES HU SI IE CY FI (2) IT DK BE CZ FR AT (2) DE LU NL Figure 8.2: Women researchers (in HC), 2003 (% of total researchers) (1) (1) Malta and the United Kingdom, not available.

        "Information and communication technologies (ICT) is a fundamental feature of knowledge based economies and considered to be an important driver of current and future productivity improvements. ICT expenditure is crucial as it diffuses new technologies in the form of IT (information technology) equipment, services, and software. One disadvantage of this indicator is that some expenditure may be for final consumption and therefore may possess relatively low benefits in terms of productivity or innovation; a clearer measure would be ICT investment. A similar indicator is available for telecommunications, which presents annual expenditure for telecommunication hardware, equipment, software and other services, also in relation to GDP. Note that this expenditure, or market value data, is collected by the European Information Technology Observatory (EITO), which is a European initiative set-up by industry, but supported by the European Commission and the OECD, to collect and publish data relating to information and communications technologies.

Its main objective is to ensure that Europe's citizens, businesses and governments make the best use of ICT, in order to improve competitiveness, support growth and create jobs, as well as addressing key societal challenges. At the heart of the policy is a desire to ensure that social and geographical differences are overcome, thus creating an inclusive digital society that provides opportunities for all. Households are defined as having at least one member in the age group 16 to 74 years old. Internet access refers to whether anyone in the household could use the Internet at home, if desired, even if just to send an e-mail. The most commonly used technologies to access the Internet are divided between broadband and dial-up access. Broadband includes digital subscriber lines (DSL) and uses technology that transports data at high speeds. A dial-up access using a modem can be made over a normal or an ISDN telephone line, often referred to as narrowband. 164 S C I E N C E & T E C H N O L O G Y HOUSEHOLDS AND ICT ACCESS 0 20 40 60 Densely-populated area (at least 500 inhabitants/square kilometre) Intermediate urbanized area (between 100 and 499 inhabitants/square kilometre) Sparsely populated area (less than 100 inhabitants/square kilometre) 2005 2004 Figure 8.5: Internet access for households, breakdown by degree of urbanisation, EU-25 (% having access to the Internet at home) CH8.QXD 14/06/06 12:10 Page 164 ",

        "While ICTs have become available to a wider public, in terms of accessibility and cost, there remains a gap between users and non- users, often referred to as the 'digital divide'. This divide may be attributed to a number of factors, including a lack of infrastructure (particularly in remote, rural areas), or a lack of computer literacy/skills that may be necessary to take part in the information society, or a lack of awareness or interest in what the information society can offer. A computer is defined as a personal computer, powered by one of the major operating systems (Macintosh, Linux or Microsoft); handheld computers or palmtops (PDAs) are also included. The ordering of goods and services includes confirmed reservations for accommodation, participation in lotteries and betting, Internet auctions, as well as information services from the Internet that are directly paid for. Goods and services that are obtained via the Internet for free are excluded. To benchmark ICT-driven developments, Eurostat has established annual information society surveys on ICT use in enterprises and in households/by individuals from 2002 onwards. These surveys initially concentrated on access and connectivity, however, their scope has subsequently been extended to cover a variety of socio- economic breakdowns, so that regional diversity, gender specificity, age and educational differences can also be studied. 166 S C I E N C E & T E C H N O L O G Y INDIVIDUALS AND ICT USE 0 10 20 30 40 50 At home At place of work (other than home) At place of education At other places (e.g. airport, hotel, etc.) Figure 8.6: Place of Internet use, EU-25, 2005 (% of individuals who accessed the Internet during the last 3 months) CH8.QXD 14/06/06 12:10 Page 166 ",

        "The European telecommunications sector was historically characterised by public service, monopoly providers, often run in conjunction with postal services. Liberalisation moves began in the first half of the 1980's and, at first, concerned value added services or business users, while basic services were left in the hands of monopoly providers. By 1998, telecommunications were, in principle, fully liberalised across all of the then Member States. Although overall expenditure on telephony has increased, the proportion accounted for by ex-monopoly providers has generally been reduced, as fixed-line voice operations have shrunk, while mobile and data service providers have captured much of the growth experienced within the telecommunications sector. Eurostat data collection in this area is based upon a questionnaire that is sent to the national statistical institutes (NSIs), who then contact their relevant authorities for the data. Telecommunications turnover is defined, in value terms, as total sales from all telecommunication services, including leased lines, fixed network services, cellular mobile telecommunication services, interconnection services, and Internet service provisions. Subscriptions to public cellular mobile telecommunication systems also include active pre-paid cards. Note that an increasing number of people have multiple mobile subscriptions (for example, for private and work use). 172 TELECOMMUNICATIONS 0 100 200 300 LU SE CZ AT IT FI DK IE PT EE SI ES CY UK LT BE DE HU EL NL SK MT FR PL LV (1) Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, 2003.

        "One way of measuring the spread of the information society, is to study the proportion of persons employed within high-technology activities and knowledge intensive activities in relation to total employment; the data is sourced from the Community Labour Force Survey. Within the classification of high technology and knowledge intensive sectors, high- and medium-high technology manufacturing activities are defined as: chemicals and chemical products (NACE DG); machinery and equipment (NACE DK); electrical and optical equipment (NACE DL); and transport equipment (NACE DM), while knowledge-intensive services are defined as: water transport (NACE 61); air transport (NACE 62); post and telecommunications (NACE 64); financial intermediation (NACE J); real estate, renting and business activities (NACE K); education (NACE M); health and social work (NACE N) and recreational, cultural and sporting activities (NACE 92). An alternative measure, using external trade statistics, is to study the proportion of high-technology exports within total exports. Note that only extra-EU exports are considered when calculating this indicator for the EU-25 as a whole, while intra-EU and extra- EU exports are combined when calculating the indicator for an individual Member State. High-technology products are defined (using the Standard International Trade Classification - SITC Rev. 3) as products from the following categories: aerospace, computers and office machinery, electronics and telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments, electrical and non- electrical machinery, chemistry and armament. 174 HIGH-TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES AND KNOWLEDGE-INTENSIVE SERVICES 0 25 50 75 MT IE LU HU UK FR FI NL CY DE AT SE CZ DK EE PT IT EL BE ES SI SK LV PL LT 2000 2004 Figure 8.10: Exports of high technology products (% of total exports) S C I E N C E & T E C H N O L O G Y EU-25 - 2000 EU-25 - 2004 CH8.QXD 14/06/06 12:10 Page 174 ",

        "Patents reflect a country's inventive activity and also show its capacity to exploit knowledge and translate it into potential economic gains. In this context, indicators based on patent statistics are widely used to assess the inventive and innovative performance of a country. The current emphasis on innovation as a source of industrial competitiveness has raised awareness of patents. Patents are used to protect R&D results, but they are equally significant as a source of technical information, which may prevent re-inventing and re-developing ideas because of a lack of information. The use of patents is relatively restricted within the European Union - this may be for a number of reasons: including relative cost, the overlap between national and European procedures and the need for translation into foreign languages. These issues have been addressed by the European Commission that has sought for a number of years to introduce a Community patent (the latest attempt was launched in January 2006). Official statistics on patents are provided to Eurostat by the European Patent Office (EPO). From 2006 onwards the main raw data source will be the new international Patent Database PATSTAT held by the EPO and developed in cooperation with the WIPO, the OECD and Eurostat. PATSTAT is due to be released twice a year (March and September). Data refer to applications filed directly under the European Patent Convention or to applications filed under the Patent Co-operation Treaty and designated to the EPO (Euro-PCT). Applications are assigned to a country according to the inventor's place of residence, using fractional counting if there are multiple inventors to avoid double counting. To normalise the data, the total number of applications at the EPO is also divided by the population and expressed as applications per million. 176 S C I E N C E & T E C H N O L O G Y PATENTS 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 FI SE UK NL DE DK FR AT LU BE IE IT SI ES CY HU EL LV EE PT CZ SK PL LT Figure 8.11: European high-technology patents, 2003 (per million inhabitants) (1) (1) Data refer to requests for protection of an invention directed either directly to the European Patent Office (EPO) or filed under the Patent Co-operation Treaty and designating the EPO (Euro-PCT), regardless of whether the patent is granted or not; Latvia and the United Kingdom, 2002; Malta, not available.

        "Regional statistics cover a broad range of statistical areas, with information on, for example, demography, migration, employment and unemployment, education, health, agriculture, energy, industry, trade and services, tourism, transport, research and development and regional accounts. The concepts and definitions used are as close as possible to those used for the production of data at a national level. Regional statistics are used for a wide range of purposes, including the allocation of structural funds which aim to foster economic and social cohesion in the European Union. In this context, regional data are used as an objective base for selecting regions eligible for funding, and for ex-post analysis of the effects of European structural policies. To classify regional data, territorial units are grouped together according to the NUTS. This is a hierarchical classification, which subdivides each Member State into a number of regions at different levels. The NUTS regions are in general administrative units, reflecting the remit of local or regional authorities within a particular territory. This short annex presents the latest regional information available at the NUTS 2 level for a selection of key socio-economic indicators. Population density - the ratio of mid-year population, as defined by the number of inhabitants, to the given area of a territory, expressed in terms of the number of inhabitants per square kilometre. Population growth - the difference in population between two reference periods; equal to the sum of natural increase (births - deaths) and net migration (immigration - emigration); the information presented is an average annual growth rate for the period 2000 to 2004. GDP per inhabitant - national currency GDP levels are converted into a common currency using exchange rates (purchasing power parities) that reflect the purchasing power of each currency; GDP per inhabitant in a common currency, the purchasing power standard (PPS), therefore eliminates differences in price levels between countries, as well as allowing a comparison between economies of different absolute sizes. 178 R E G I O N A L S T A T I S T I C S REGIONAL STATISTICS - BACKGROUND AND DEFINITIONS CH9.QXD 14/06/06 12:10 Page 178 ",
        "179 R E G I O N A L S T A T I S T I C S Disposable income per inhabitant - income received, in the form of wages, operating surplus, rent, interest, dividends and social benefits, from which are deducted taxes, social security contributions and other current transfers; data are derived from household accounts and are presented in the common currency of the purchasing power consumption standard (PPCS) per inhabitant. Employment rate (%) - calculated by dividing the number of persons aged 15 to 64 in employment by the total population of the same age group; the employed population consists of those persons who during the reference week did any work for pay or profit for at least one hour, or were not working but had jobs from which they were temporarily absent. Unemployment rate (%) - unemployed persons comprise those aged 15 to 74 who were without work during the reference week, who were available for work, and who were actively seeking work (which involves having been in contact with a public employment office to find work, having been in contact with a private agency (temporary work agency, firm specialising in recruitment to find work, or applying directly to employers to find work).

        "STRUCTURAL INDICATORS During the Lisbon European Council of March 2000, the Heads of State of the European Union agreed to set a strategic goal for the next decade 'of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion'. They invited the European Commission to draw up an annual synthesis report on the basis of a set of structural indicators, to be used for assessing progress towards the Lisbon objectives. In its 2005 spring report to the European Council, the European Commission presented a new approach to the Lisbon strategy, focusing in particular on growth and jobs. The list of structural indicators covers six broad domains under the following headings: general economic background, employment, innovation and research, economic reform, social cohesion, and the environment. The list below presents those structural indicators that are included as part of Key figures on Europe. It provides information on the page number where each indicator may be found, and is structured according to the official order in which the structural indicators are presented.

        "SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS The European Union's Sustainable Development Strategy, adopted by the European Council in Gothenburg in June 2001, aims to reconcile economic development, social cohesion and the protection of the environment. As with structural indicators, a set of sustainable development indicators has been developed to help monitor, assess and review the sustainable development strategy. The indicators are organised under ten different themes that reflect different political priorities. Seven of them correspond to priority areas outlined by the 2001 European Commission Communication entitled 'A sustainable Europe for a better World' and the 2002 Communication called 'Global Partnership', while the remaining themes arose from an implementation plan agreed at the world summit on sustainable development. The list below presents those sustainable development indicators that are included as part of Key figures on Europe. It provides information on the page number where each indicator may be found, and is structured according to the official order in which the sustainable development indicators are presented.

        "CLASSIFICATIONS The following are excerpts taken from various classifications that are used within Key figures on Europe. A more complete listing of each classification may be obtained on the Eurostat web-site, by accessing the RAMON classifications server at: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon. COICOP Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP). This is used to classify the purpose of individual consumption expenditures incurred by three institutional sectors, namely households, non-profit institutions serving households and general government. Below is an extract of those COICOP headings that have been used in this publication. 01 Food and non-alcoholic beverages The food products classified here are those purchased for consumption at home. The group excludes: food products sold for immediate consumption away from the home by hotels, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, bars, kiosks, street vendors, automatic vending machines, etc. (11.1.1); cooked dishes prepared by restaurants for consumption off their premises (11.1.1); cooked dishes prepared by catering contractors whether collected by the customer or delivered to the customer's home (11.1.1); and products sold specifically as pet foods (09.3.4). The non-alcoholic beverages classified here are those purchased for consumption at home. The group excludes non-alcoholic beverages sold for immediate consumption away from the home by hotels, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, bars, kiosks, street vendors, automatic vending machines, etc. (11.1.1). 02 Alcoholic beverages, tobacco The alcoholic beverages classified here are those purchased for consumption at home. The group excludes alcoholic beverages sold for immediate consumption away from the home by hotels, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, bars, kiosks, street vendors, automatic vending machines, etc. (11.1.1). The beverages classified here include low or non-alcoholic beverages which are generally alcoholic such as non-alcoholic beer. 03 Clothing and footwear Clothing includes clothing materials, garments, other articles of clothing and clothing accessories, cleaning, repair and hire of clothing. Footwear includes shoes and other footwear including repair and hire of footwear. 196 A N N E X CH10.QXD 14/06/06 12:11 Page 196 ",

It does not include expenditures on educational materials, such as books (09.5.1) and stationery (09.5.4), or education support services, such as health care services (06), transport services (07.3), catering services (11.1.2) and accommodation services (11.2.0). It includes education by radio or television broadcasting. The breakdown of educational services is based upon the level categories of the 1997 International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED-97) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). 11 Restaurants and hotels Catering services, accommodation services. 12 Miscellaneous goods and services Personal care, electric appliances for personal care and other appliances, articles and products for personal care, personal effects n.e.c., social protection, insurance, financial services n.e.c., other services n.e.c.

        "ISCED This classification is designed to serve as an instrument suitable for assembling, compiling and presenting comparable indicators and statistics of education. LEVEL 0 - Pre-primary education Programmes at level 0, (pre-primary) defined as the initial stage of organised instruction are designed primarily to introduce very young children to a school-type environment, i.e. to provide a bridge between the home and a school-based atmosphere. LEVEL 1 - Primary education or first stage of basic education Programmes at level 1 are normally designed on a unit or project basis to give students a sound basic education in reading, writing and mathematics along with an elementary understanding of other subjects such as history, geography, natural science, social science, art and music. In some cases religious instruction is featured. The core at this level consists of education provided for children, the customary or legal age of entrance being not younger than five years or older than seven years. This level covers in principle six years of full-time schooling. Throughout this level the programmes are organised in units or projects rather than by subjects. LEVEL 2 - Lower secondary or second stage of basic education The contents of education at this stage are typically designed to complete the provision of basic education which began at ISCED level 1. In many, if not most countries, the educational aim is to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and human development. The programmes at this level are usually on a more subject-oriented pattern using more specialised teachers and more often several teachers conducting classes in their field of specialisation. The end of this level often coincides with the end of compulsory education. LEVEL 3 - (Upper) secondary education This level of education typically begins at the end of full-time compulsory education for those countries that have a system of compulsory education. More specialisation may be observed at this level than at ISCED level 2 and often teachers need to be more qualified or specialised than for ISCED level 2. The entrance age to this level is typically 15 or 16 years. The educational programmes included at this level typically require the completion of some 9 years of full-time education (since the beginning of level 1) for admission or a combination of education and vocational or technical experience and with as minimum entrance requirements the completion of level 2 or demonstrable ability to handle programmes at this level. 198 A N N E X CH10.QXD 14/06/06 12:11 Page 198 ",
        "199 A N N E X LEVEL 4 - Post-secondary non-tertiary education ISCED 4 captures programmes that straddle the boundary between upper-secondary and post-secondary education from an international point of view, even though they might clearly be considered as upper-secondary or post-secondary programmes in a national context. ISCED 4 programmes can, considering their content, not be regarded as tertiary programmes. They are often not significantly more advanced than programmes at ISCED 3 but they serve to broaden the knowledge of participants who have already completed a programme at level 3. Typical examples are programmes designed to prepare students for studies at level 5 who, although having completed ISCED level 3, did not follow a curriculum which would allow entry to level 5, i.e. pre-degree foundation courses or short vocational programmes. LEVEL 5 - First stage of tertiary education (not leading directly to an advanced research qualification) This level consists of tertiary programmes having an educational content more advanced than those offered at levels 3 and 4. All degrees and qualifications are cross-classified by type of programmes, position in national degree or qualification structures and cumulative duration at tertiary. LEVEL 6 - Second stage of tertiary education (leading to an advanced research qualification) This level is reserved for tertiary programmes which lead to the award of an advanced research qualification. The programmes are therefore devoted to advanced study and original research and are not based on course-work only. CH10.QXD 14/06/06 12:11 Page 199 ",
        "NACE The statistical classification of economic activities in the European Communities (NACE) is the classification that is used for the bulk of the information collected for business statistics; the classification currently in use is NACE Rev. 1.1. During the next year (2007) there will be major changes to all international classifications of activities, including ISIC (under the auspices of the United Nations), NAICS (the North American industry classification), and JSIC (the Japanese classification). Within Europe, Eurostat has worked together with National Statistical Institutes, other Directorate-Generals of the European Commission and business and trade associations, towards finalising a draft structure for NACE Rev. 2, which is consistent with ISIC Rev. 4. One of the most important changes, apart from this increase in international comparability of data will be the introduction of a new section in the classification to cover information and communications, as well as changes to reflect the growing importance of service activities. Below is an extract of those NACE headings that have been used in this publication. Section C: Mining and quarrying Subsection CA: Mining and quarrying of energy producing materials Subsection CB: Mining and quarrying, except of energy producing materials Section D: Manufacturing Subsection DA: Manufacture of food products, beverages and tobacco Subsection DB: Manufacture of textiles and textile products Subsection DC: Manufacture of leather and leather products Subsection DD: Manufacture of wood and wood products Subsection DE: Manufacture of pulp, paper and paper products; publishing and printing Subsection DF: Manufacture of coke, refined petroleum products and nuclear fuel Subsection DG: Manufacture of chemicals, chemical products and man-made fibres Subsection DH: Manufacture of rubber and plastic products Subsection DI: Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products NACE Subsection DJ: Manufacture of basic metals and fabricated metal products NACE Subsection DK: Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c.
