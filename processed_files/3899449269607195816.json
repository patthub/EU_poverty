        "3 2 Some of the following questions for interviewers are checks (e.g. for plausibility, survey participation requirements). These \u201cchecks\u201d will be formatted in the same way as normal questions. There are questions, where the interviewer is asked to show a card to the respondent (SHOW CARD XXXX). Show cards are visual aids from which the respondent chooses the answer to the survey question. For some questions, two versions of the same show card was interchangeably used. The first version shows the response categories in the order they are listed in this questionnaire, while the second version presents a reverse order of the answers (see Annex III). A.

The survey included interviews with almost 4,700 Roma and Travellers, collecting information on more than 8,200 individuals living in their households. By focusing on Roma and Travellers, the survey provides unique data and information that are not available from European general population surveys, which do not disaggregate on grounds of ethnic origin. The findings present a bleak but familiar picture of discrimination and deprivation. We hope they encourage policymakers to step up their efforts to ensure a better future for Europe\u2019s biggest minority group. "
