        "3 Income pooling and equal sharing within the household Eurostat is the Statistical Office of the European Union (EU). Its mission is to be the leading provider of high quality statistics on Europe. To that end, it gathers and analyses data from the National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) across Europe and provides comparable and harmonised data for the EU to use in the definition, implementation and analysis of EU policies. Its statistical products and services are also of great value to Europe\u2019s business community, professional organisations, academics, librarians, NGOs, the media and citizens. In the field of income, poverty, social exclusion and living conditions, the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) is the main source for statistical data at European level. Over the last years, important progress has been achieved in EU-SILC as a result of the coordinated work of Eurostat and NSIs. In June 2010, the European Council adopted a social inclusion target as part of the Europe 2020 Strategy: to lift at least 20 million people in the EU from the risk of poverty and exclusion by 2020. To monitor progress towards this target, the 'Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs' (EPSCO) EU Council of Ministers agreed on an 'at risk of poverty or social exclusion' indicator. To reflect the multidimensional nature of poverty and social exclusion, this indicator consists of three sub-indicators: i) at-risk-of-poverty (i.e. low income); ii) severe material deprivation; and iii) living in very low work intensity households. In this context, the Second Network for the Analysis of EU-SILC (Net-SILC2) is bringing together National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) and academic expertise at international level in order to carry out in- depth methodological work and socio-economic analysis, to develop common production tools for the whole European Statistical System (ESS) as well as to ensure the overall scientific organisation of the third and fourth EU-SILC conferences. The current working paper is one of the outputs of the work of Net-SILC2. It was presented at the third EU-SILC conference (Vienna, December 2012), which was jointly organised by Eurostat and Net-SILC2 and hosted by Statistics Austria.

        "7 Income pooling and equal sharing within the household Income pooling and equal sharing within the household What can we learn from the 2010 EU-SILC module? (Sophie PONTHIEUX (1) ) Abstract: The 2010 EU-SILC thematic module on \u201cIntra-household allocation of resources\u201d was aimed at investigating income organization, household members\u2019 contribution to common expenses, as well as access to and control over money within households. This paper is an exploration of this module. The first part is centred on the assumptions of income pooling and equal sharing founding the measurement of equivalent income and in turn inter-individual inequality and individuals\u2019 poverty risk. A tentative estimation suggests that these assumptions might be unfounded for about 30% of the households. The second part of the paper, focusing on not retired couples, examines the association between the extent of income pooling and couples\u2019 characteristics. A statistical analysis shows that income pooling is more frequent among married couples, couples with dependent children, or in which only one partner is economically active and less frequent among higher educated or richer couples. Going along, the paper points at various methodological difficulties and limitations when dealing with \u201cintra-household\u201d issues.

        "1 Introduction 9 Income pooling and equal sharing within the household 1. Introduction \u201cThe mainstream poverty research practice of ignoring the within-household distribution has, according to the critics, two adverse side effects. One, such measurement practice provide biased estimates of the extent of poverty in aggregate. Two, valuable information about the composition of the poor, and relative poverty risk, is ignored\u201d. These lines, written about 20 years ago by Jenkins (1991, pp. 460), could be written today with no need to change a word. It is not because nothing has changed: since the early 1990s, the question of the allocation of resources within households has attracted a vast amount of literature in economics and sociology (and economic psychology and socio-economics). Standard economics now most often acknowledge the household as \u201ccollective\u201d rather than \u201cunitary\u201d, agreeing that it is a combination of distinct individuals who may have different preferences, that the \u201chousehold\u201d decisions are not necessarily consensual and do not necessarily result in equal outcomes at the individual level. Sociology has shown from the 1960s that the household is a place of bargaining, power relations and self-interests that can be conflicting. A specific strand of literature focusing on the household income organization has shown that control over money and power in decision making may result in very unequal outcomes between the household members (Box 1 provides a brief overview of conceptual approaches to the household). But despite theoretical debates and advances of the last 30 years, standard indicators of poverty or inequality in economic well-being remain based on variables measured at the household level, assuming that all incomes are pooled and that all the household members reach the same level of material well-being (measured by equivalent incomes). This standard approach makes intra-household inequality virtually impossible - or at least very difficult - to assess. Hence statistics seem to be stuck in the so-called \u201cunitary\u201d model and the household remains largely a \u201cblack box\u201d: statistics measure the (monetary) resources that enter the household, can observe some outcomes of the household decisions at the household level; but what happens within the household, how individual resources are actually combined and the outcomes at individual level remain largely unknown(2). There are various reasons for this being so. Firstly, there is a long tradition of surveys aimed either at households (surveys on consumption, housing, wealth) or at individuals (surveys on employment, earnings); it is only recently that some surveys offer data collected both at the individual and at the household level. Secondly, collecting data at the individual level is complicated and costly in terms of money for statistical institutes as well as in terms of the burden it could be for the \u201ctargets\u201d \u2013 for example, imagine detailed questionnaires or diaries about your expenditures (what? how much? for whom?) over a period long enough to make this information useful\u2026 Thirdly, even when the information is collected with some degree of detail, as is the case for incomes, it is actually very difficult to know exactly who benefits from some of them \u2013 for example, for property or capital incomes, it would require to know exactly who the owner is but even knowing this would not solve the question of whether the owner shares these incomes or keeps them for him/herself; the limitation is the same in the case of some transfers aimed at the household, such as family benefits, for which one has to assume that they are used \u201cat the household level\u201d(3). What is at stake? If poverty measures are biased, \u201cstatistics\u201d have to find a way to improve the methodology on which the measurement of economic inequality and poverty is based. This is of particular importance for the assessment of gender or intergenerational inequalities and in turn for public policies. In terms of statistical methodology, this has numerous implications for the measurement of monetary poverty, since actually two crucial, and distinct, assumptions are made: that of income pooling, which justifies the use of equivalence scales; that of equal equivalent incomes for all the household\u2019s members \u2013 implemented as if equality was following income pooling while it may not be so \u2013 which (2) Until very recently and the development of individual questionnaires, the same comments are applicable to the measurement of material deprivations. (3) There is of course a margin for improvement: for example, taxes on incomes and wealth, systematically assumed to be that of the whole household, or inter-household transfers (especially alimonies), or some social benefits, could be collected at individual level when they are received/paid at individual level. But there, again, aside from the issues of costs and burden, it would not solve the question of whether individual incomes are pooled and equally (or fairly) shared within the household. ",
        "1 Introducton 10 Income pooling and equal sharing within the household justifies that the poverty threshold is computed on the basis of the distribution of equivalent incomes at the individual, not the household, level. For public policies, biased estimates of the extent and the composition of poverty could be misleading in the targeting of policy measures and the choice of appropriate policy tools. Particularly, under the assumptions of income pooling-equal sharing, social transfers, fiscal and redistributive policies do not need to be targeted at one or the other household member since the household response is assumed to be independent of the individual who receives / pays; but under any non-unitary approach the impact of a given benefit might differ depending on the individual of the household who receives it. As for means-tested benefits, which assume income pooling when tested at the household (or family) level, they might miss their targets or have unintended effects (Sutherland, 1997; Bennett & Sutherland, 2011). More generally, improving the measurement of poverty and inter-individual inequality would improve our understanding of the factors and consequences of inequality in terms of individual autonomy and economic dependence. The 2010 EU-SILC module, aimed at \u201copening the black box\u201d and progressing towards a better coverage of inter-individuals inequality, was precisely designed in reference to these issues. This was a challenging aim: the issues are complex, hence it is not easy to delimit the questions that would result in usable evidence\u2026 neither it is easy to interpret the data. The additional difficulty is to deal with an unusual level: not the household, not the individual, but the interaction of individuals within households; one specific requirement to be able to really go into the \u201cblack box\u201d is then to have all the relevant household members covered \u2013 as we will see, this was not always the case. Then launching the investigation on such a large scale as 27 countries(4), which are far from comparable in many ways - especially, for the issues we are dealing with, in terms of living standards but also in terms of institutional and legal settings which may impact the households\u2019 structures and their internal arrangements - was also a challenge in itself. In addition, it may be that variations in the formulation or even the meaning of questions and their understanding result in spurious cross-country comparisons. For all these reasons, the paper is as much about limitations as about results. The remaining of the paper starts with a short presentation of the module and the variables that will be used. Then the exploration is organized around two methodological questions: 1) To what extent do households\u2019 members pool their incomes, and are we correct or wrong when we compute poverty risk indicators and inter-individuals inequality assuming income pooling and equality within the households? 2) Does a general pattern of associations between individual/household characteristics and the extent of income pooling emerge from cross-country comparisons? Going along these questions, the paper will also point at various methodological difficulties when dealing with intra-household issues\u2026 and with EU-SILC. (4) Actually 29 countries: the module was implemented in all EU countries, plus Iceland and Norway who participate in EU-SILC. Only the EU member States are analyzed in the paper. ",
        "1 Introduction 11 Income pooling and equal sharing within the household Box 1 \u2013 Conceptual approaches to income pooling In economics , the unitary model of the household considers the household as if it was a single individual i.e. maximising one utility function under one budget constraint. For households to function \u201cas if\u201d individuals, two main assumptions are needed: individual preferences have to converge one way or the other, so that the household can be considered a single decision unit; the household members\u2019 resources have to be pooled so that there is only one budget constraint; income pooling then means that how the income is used depends only on the level of the whole/pooled income and the household\u2019s preferences. In this approach, individuals are then not discernible within the household which operates as a \u201cblack box\u201d. This model, challenged on methodological (especially Chiappori, 1992) as well as empirical grounds, is now generally considered as not satisfactory. Empirical results tend to show that the household\u2019s allocation of resources may differ depending on who receives an income ( cf. the emblematic paper of Lundberg et al 1997) - while, in principle, this should not happen since household decisions are expected to result only from the household budget constraint - the pooled income - i.e. to be independent from whose income it is. Since the 1980s, alternative, non-unitary models have been developed (see a survey by Donni and Chiappori, 2009). These models have in common to consider that each household member (most models consider two decision makers) has his/her own utility function, incomes are not assumed to be pooled, various distributional factors are expected to affect the relative power of the household\u2019s members, hence the household\u2019s decisions. In sociology (and other social sciences), the household is analysed as a place of bargaining, power relations and interests that can be conflicting. The theory of resources and exchange predicts that the household member with the highest resources - income, education, status - will have more power within the household (Blood and Wolfe, 1960). A distinction is made between \u201corchestration power\u201d as control over important decisions and \u201cimplementation power\u201d as control over daily/repetitive decisions which generally would correspond to time consuming tasks (Safilios-Rothschild, 1976). These early analyses were very influent in a strand of literature centred on the division of labour (especially domestic tasks and care- work) within the household. Another specific strand of literature, directly related to the thematic of the module 2010, focuses on money in marriage and couples\u2019 income organization (Pahl, 1983, 1989, 1995; Burgoyne, 1990; Vogler and Pahl, 1994). Pahl (1983) defined a very influential classification, based on in-depth interviews, reflecting what happens to money when it enters the household and gradations of control over money. This classification distinguished initially between four main systems: the \u201cwhole wage\u201d and the housekeeping allowance systems (two systems in which one partner controls the amount of household money), the shared or pooled system (both partners manage and use the money as they need) and the independent management system (each partner keeps separate control over their income). It remains a reference (see Vogler, 2005), widely used in quantitative sociology as well as in economics: almost all recent empirical work refer to it (e.g. Bonke and Uldall-Poulsen, 2007; Laporte and Schellenberg, 2011; Lyngstad et al ., 2011), and earlier work (Woolley and Marshall, 1994) suggest a way to use it as a measure of intra-household inequality.

        "2 Short presentation of the module and methodological points 13 Income pooling and equal sharing within the household 2. Short presentation of the module and methodological points This section focuses on the questions used to investigate the extent of income pooling and equal sharing and on the target population(s). 2.1 Main questions used in the analysis and some warnings The module includes two questionnaires, one at the household level, the other at the individual level, distinguishing individuals living in couple from other individuals. At household level, the core question (HA010) asks whether incomes are treated as fully collective, partly collective or completely private; another set of questions (HA020-HA070) seeks to identify who in the household is in charge of managing the common finances. At individual level, the main questions are about the extent of personal incomes kept from the common pool (PA010), whether the person has access to a bank account (PA020) and how she perceives her ability to decide about her own expenses (PA090). In addition, couples\u2019 partners were asked various questions aimed at measuring a balance of power in decision making (PA030-PA080)(5). Only three of all these questions are used in the paper; they are briefly presented here, as well as the reasons why the others were not examined. To examine the extent of income pooling we rely on two questions. The first one, used all along the paper, is the question about the household regime of finances, or pooling regime, which is asked at household level: (HA010) - Regime of household finances. Suggested wording: \u201cHow are the incomes you receive in your household dealt with?\u201d 1 We treat all incomes as common resources 2 We treat some incomes as common resources and the rest as private resources 3 We treat all incomes as private resources of the person receiving it 4 We do not receive any income in the household The proposed responses, derived from a classification proposed by Pahl in 1983, have become almost \u201cstandard\u201d in the literature on couples\u2019 arrangements for money. We will refer to them as \u201cfull pooling\u201d, \u201cpartial pooling\u201d and \u201cno pooling\u201d. Taken at face value, they have very different implications in terms of intra-household inequality: Full pooling would correspond to a situation in which all the incomes of all the household\u2019s members are pooled and used by any member for common or personal expenditures \u2013 i.e. all have full access to the pooled income whatever the individual contribution to the pool might be. It also means that all the household\u2019s members are subject to a unique budget constraint. Under the regime of partial pooling, the household\u2019s members contribute to the pool only up to a share of their own income and keep the rest (that they can use as they want \u2013 this not necessarily meaning that they spend it all on themselves) from the pool. A given household member has then access to only a share of the others\u2019 incomes, the share they have contributed to the pool and a priori only for common (or dedicated) expenses. No pooling means no income pooled at all, and that no household\u2019s member has access to the income of another \u2013 suggesting that the household\u2019s members have to organize for common expenses. In partial pooling and no pooling, differences in individual income levels or the share each one contributes to / keeps from the pool might be a source of inequality between the household\u2019s members or not, depending on the respective incomes of the household\u2019s members, the share they keep or pool and the arrangement for common consumption. At individual level, a \u201ccompanion\u201d question asks the persons the share of their own income they keep from the common pool: (5) There was also a set of optional questions on time-use and spending but only 12 countries opted to implement them (cf. European Commission, 2012). They will not be examined here. ",
        "2 Short presentation of the module and methodological points 14 Income pooling and equal sharing within the household (PA010) - Proportion of personal income kept separate from the common household budget. Suggested wording: \u201cWhat proportion of your personal income do you keep separate from the common household budget?\u201d 1 All my personal income 2 More than half of my personal income 3 About half of my personal income 4 Less than half of my personal income 5 None 6 The respondent has no personal income The question was to be understood as the share of own income \u201cnot put in the common pot\u201d which does not mean the same as the share of income spent by the person on herself. According to the assessment of the module (cf. European Commission, 2012) there seems to have been variations in the wording of the question which make difficult to assess whether its meaning was always actually understood in the same way (e.g. Poland: \u201cWhat proportion do you keep for your personal disposition\u201d, Latvia: \u201c\u2026. allocate to yourself only\u201d). But more than variations in wording, there are also countries where the question clearly did not have the same meaning: the worst case is that of France, asking the share of own income used for self-expenses (clothes, leisure, personal savings\u2026), which is clearly not the same as keeping one\u2019s income from the common pool; as for Austria and Ireland, the question was asked from the other point of view, i.e. the share of the income pooled (not the share kept) \u2013 in a way, it is the same meaning and should give the same (opposite) response as with the suggested wording except that since it is clearer, there is less doubt about the understanding than with other countries. All these small or large differences will result in limited comparability. The second methodological point is that of the extent of intra-household equality. There is no question in the module which would give a direct answer, so we will use as a proxy the question, at individual level, about the ability to decide of one\u2019s own personal consumption: (PA090) - Ability to decide about expenses for own personal consumption, leisure activities and hobbies. Suggested wording: \u201cDo you feel free (i.e. without asking the permission of other household members) to spend money on yourself for your personal consumption, your leisure activities and hobbies?\u201d 1 Yes, always or almost always 2 Yes, sometimes 3 Never or almost never The response will be used as a proxy for the perception a person has of her autonomy in deciding for herself; this would allow to identify households were some individuals feel more (or less) often free than others, as opposed to households where all share the same feeling. However, the understanding of the question is difficult to assess: some may have understood feeling free about \u201cwhat\u201d they can spend without asking for permission (under a given budget constraint) when others may have understood it uniquely in terms of budget constraint. There again, variations in the wording leave room for different understanding between the suggested \u201cdo you feel free\u2026\u201d and (Austria) \u201ccan you freely decide\u2026\u201d or between the suggested \u201cwithout asking the permission\u201d and (Estonia) \u201cwithout consulting\u201d or (France) \u201cwithout asking the opinion\u201d (cf. Assessment, European Commission 2012 p. 42). As for the questions not used: - at household level: we have not examined the questions on the management of common finances (HA020-HA070) not primarily related to our methodological questions. In addition, a quick look at the responses shows for some countries some puzzling discrepancies between the proportion of households who reported \u201cthere are no common household finances\u201d and that of households who reported no income pooling in response to HA010, suggesting a degree of confusion between \u201cno common household finances\u201d and no income at all hence nothing to manage. It would have been clearer to ask the question only to households having an income and reporting at least some pooling. - at individual level: question PA020 on access to a bank account was also left aside since it did not seem ",
        "2 Short presentation of the module and methodological points 15 Income pooling and equal sharing within the household of direct interest for our questions. A quick check of the responses shows huge cross-country differences: about 100% individuals interviewed report having access in Sweden, about 75% report not having access in Bulgaria. These extreme values probably combine a \u201cselected respondent\u201d effect on one side and a possible effect of a much less developed banking system in Bulgaria (the same for Romania). More generally, the responses would be difficult to interpret either in terms of income pooling or equal sharing without additional information on the possession of a personal bank account and the existence of a joint account (and joint between whom). As for questions PA030-PA080 on decision making by couples\u2019 partners, this is a whole, and different, subject in itself. 2.2 Target population and units of analysis While it is obvious that pooling and sharing can occur only between several individuals, defining the relevant targets among the remaining households and individuals is not so obvious. According to the module\u2019s guidelines, target households were defined as households with at least two persons aged 16+, target individuals as persons aged 16+, and target partners as persons aged 16+ living in target households having a partner living in the same household. This definition of targets did not seem optimal considering the issues under investigation: individuals aged 16+ include dependent children, defined as individuals living with at least one parent and aged either less than 18 or from 18 to 24 and not in employment (according to definition used for the household breakdowns implemented in SILC, cf. European Commission, 2009). Then one share of the individuals, all those aged from 16 to 18 and some of those aged from 18 to 24 are \u2013 if we are consistent with SILC standard household breakdowns \u2013 dependent children. We have considered that it was not relevant to count dependent children \u2013 i.e. individuals considered (by construction) to be fully dependent hence not expected to contribute any income to the common pool \u2013 to define target households. In addition, we differ slightly from the standard definition of a dependent child, since we do not consider as \u201cdependent children\u201d those who have a partner living in the household (because it cannot be assessed whether they are dependent on their parent(s) or their partner). Consequently, the analysis is limited to households with at least two \u201cadults\u201d, defining an adult as an individual who is not a dependent child. In turn, target individuals are re-set as \u201cadults\u201d. They will be referred to after as \u201ctarget households\u201d and \u201ctarget individuals\u201d. This change of target results mainly in the exclusion of single parent households, which count by definition only one adult (since they are defined as one parent plus her/his dependent children). For obvious reasons, the analysis takes into account only the households (and the corresponding \u201cadults\u201d) for whom the response to PA010 (pooling regime) is not missing; it also excludes the households who reported \u201cno income\u201d. Appendix 1 details the steps from the module\u2019s targets to the paper\u2019s targets. The analysis of income pooling regimes requires also being able to distinguish between household types. But the existing SILC variable \u201chousehold type\u201d (HX060) is not relevant, since it is only a breakdown by number of adults and dependent children, not distinguishing families from other types of households, neither partners from any two adults. We have then constructed a classification distinguishing couples from other households of 2 adults, nuclear families from extended families (e.g. couples or parents living with non-dependent children or with their own parents) and other types of households. There are some other family characteristics that could be especially interesting to investigate, such as \u201cblended\u201d or \u201cpatchwork\u201d families; but they are very difficult to identify in EU-SILC because there is no systematic distinction between natural and step children then it was not possible to consider them. It was also not possible to track family ties other than between partners and parents-children (siblings cannot be identified if they do not live with their parents). To finish, one has to keep in mind that, as mentioned above, the \u201cintra-household\u201d is a complicated level of analysis since it is a combination of individuals within a household. A serious limitation here comes from the fact that for significant shares of households in some countries, there was only one respondent at the individual level. This is, necessarily, the case of all countries using a \u201cselected respondent\u201d approach (Denmark, Finland, The Netherlands, Sweden and Slovenia) but there are also countries with many missing values in the individual questionnaires: France (no proxy), Sweden (among selected respondents) and The United-Kingdom (especially among older persons).

First steps in exploring the black box: pooling regimes and (in)equality within households 3.1 Pooling regimes 3.1.1 Assessment based on household level variable When asked about their organization for incomes (question HA010), a majority of households report that all incomes are treated as common resources (full pooling, FP). These households represent from a minimum 52% of the target households in Austria (AT), to a maximum of 88% in Romania (RO), the mean of the 27 countries being about 70% (Table 1). The remaining households are unequally distributed between those who report partial pooling, with a mean of 22%, and no pooling with a mean of 7%, again with noticeable differences between countries.

        "3 First steps in exploring the black box Income pooling and equal sharing within the household 18 Cross-country differences are difficult to interpret. No clear regional pattern emerges when countries are ranked according to the share of full pooling households (Figure 1); the highest shares are observed for in Southern/Mediterranean countries\u2026 but also in Belgium (BE) or Hungary (HU) and not in Portugal (PT). According to the literature, there are many reasons for pooling or not (infra), so the differences may reflect many things, starting with the households\u2019 structure (demographic \u2013 couples/with or without children / 3 generations and complex households, economic \u2013 especially the number of earners and the whole household income level), institutional/cultural features or national living standards (and not forgetting that the question may have been asked/understood differently depending on the mode of collection and collection instructions).

Responses at individual level Another way to look at the extent of income pooling in households consists in using the information collected at individual level with question PA010 on the share of personal income kept separate from the common pool. The proportion of adults living in target households reporting to keep none of their income from the common pool is on average 44%, against 39% reporting that they keep some and 9% that they keep none; the remaining (about 8% on average) corresponds to respondents reporting they have no income at all (Table 2). As was observed at household level, variations between countries are huge. However, some of them puzzling, even more since they are larger than that observed at household level: leaving France aside - for which we know that the meaning of the question was not the same, the very low level of individuals reporting to keep none of their income from the common pool in Slovenia (SI) and to a lesser degree Finland (FI), Malta (MT) raises questions. What is the link with the household pooling regime reported at household level? Logically, no individual living in a full pooling household should keep any of his/her income from the pool, individuals living in partial pooling households should keep some of their income and those living in no pooling households should keep all. Discrepancies were to be expected, but a comparison of tables 1 and 2 shows that they are large: the average percentage of households reporting full pooling is 70%, but the average percentage of individuals who report to keep none of their income from the pool is only 44%. The gap between the ",

To better assess (in)consistencies between responses at household and at individual levels, we use an indicator of \u201cconsistency\u201d equal to 1 if the individual\u2019s response is consistent with his household response 0 otherwise (e.g. an individual living in a full pooling household is expected to keep none of his income from the pool); we have considered that individuals reporting no income were always consistent with their household pooling regime (Figure 2).

While inconsistencies do not allow any definitive conclusion in terms of \u201ctrue\u201d pooling regime, they show at least that using household level information or individual level information does not result in the same picture. But cross-country differences in inconsistencies are somewhat disconcerting: do they result from the household respondent and/or the individual respondents having misunderstood the question? Do they signal that one or several individuals of the household misread the actual extent of pooling within their household(6)? And does the lower share of \u201cconsistent individuals\u201d in households who report no pooling indicate a reluctance to report that one does not contribute to the common pool? All these points would need be investigated further. 3.1.3 Households\u2019 pooling regimes defin ed by individual level variables Assessing households pooling regimes on the basis of individual level information requires a change of unit of observation: it is now not the individuals\u2019 responses we are interested in but their combination within their households and whether they are consistent within households (a different sort of consistency than above). The level of analysis shifts from that of the individual to that of the household. (6) Other results not presented here suggest that cross-country differences do not seem to be attributable to the number of respondents in the household: the gaps remain of the same extent when individual/households responses are compared only for households with more than one respondent at individual level \u2013 this verification being of course not possible for \u201cselected respondent\u201d countries. ",
        "3 First steps in exploring the black box Income pooling and equal sharing within the household 22 Within households consistency is assessed by the fact that all the household members report to keep all or some or none of their personal income (considering that individuals reporting no income are always consistent with what the others in their household report) accordingly with the pooling regime reported at household level. On the basis of the individuals responses, the household pooling regime will then be said full pooling if no individual within the household reports to keep some or all of his income, it will be said partial pooling if no individual reports to keep none or all of his income, and no pooling if no individual reports to keep none or some of his income. The household pooling regime is said \u201cnot consistent\u201d when the individual responses diverge - this of course can never happen in countries using a \u201cselected respondent\u201d since there is only one respondent by household, nor, in other countries, if there is only one respondent and missing values for the other household members.

The margin of error is computed as the share of individuals wrongly assumed to live in full pooling households in the total population. We use alternatively the shares of pooling regimes obtained from household level responses to question HA010 and that derived from individual level responses to question PA010. Using HA010, the proportion of individuals potentially subject to error based on household level information is then simply the proportion of individuals who do not live in a household reporting full pooling, including all the individuals of these households, not only target individuals, in all the households, not only target households. The households that are not in the target and the individuals living in these households are considered, by construction, not subject to any error. The pooling regime built on the basis of PA010 has no meaning if there is only one respondent in the household - hence the \u201cselected respondent\u201d countries are not taken into account. For the other countries, in the case of households with only one respondent, we have assumed for the computation that the distribution between correct and wrong assumption of income pooling was the same than that observed among the households with at least two respondents. Table 5 shows the proportions of households wrongly assumed to be full pooling households and the corresponding proportions of individuals it represents in the whole population. ",

Depending on whether the assessment is based on household or individual level information, the potential for error could concern from about 20% to about 38% households. This represents from about 25% to about 47% individuals who could in turn be wrongly assumed to live in full pooling households (there are again significant cross country differences with both measures). In terms of measurement of inequalities in economic well-being, the wrong assumption of income pooling would mean that there is no foundation to attributing to all these individuals their household equivalent income. This suggests that inequalities between individuals could be under estimated. As a result, and taking the information about pooling regimes at face value, individuals could be misclassified when considered poor/not poor with the current methodology. However, in terms of simple computation, the share of individuals wrongly assumed to live in full pooling households does not give the share of individuals wrongly assessed to be poor or not poor, it just gives the share of households for which the correct basis for computing an equivalent income might not be the household\u2019s whole income. There are other reasons for cautiousness: pooling regimes, either defined at household or individual level, have been taken so far at face value. This means assuming that, in full pooling households, all the (relevant) individuals can access and use the common pool for common but also for personal expenditures. But on second thoughts, is it really what goes on? If full pooling assessed at household level means theoretically full access to the common pot it does not necessarily follow that all the household members feel equally entitled to access and actually use the money from the pool. One may also have second thoughts about the approach based on individual level information; especially, keeping all one\u2019s income from the pool does not necessarily mean using it all only on personal spending or savings. And on the contrary, partial pooling and no pooling regimes could very well result too in equality, depending on the arrangement between the household\u2019s members. ",
        "3 First steps in exploring the black box 25 Income pooling and equal sharing within the household 3.3 Households pooling regime and intra-household inequality One way to assess whether intra-household equality follows \u201cfull pooling\u201d would be to have some available information, at individual level, about a relevant outcome. We will use question PA090 as such a relevant outcome and an indicator of potential intra-household equality. In this question, the persons were asked whether they feel free to decide always/sometimes/never about spending for themselves. 3.3.1 Individuals\u2019 perception of their ability to make decisions about their own consumption Firstly, we just look at the distribution of individuals\u2019 responses and whether they vary depending on their household pooling regime (using the household pooling regime assessed at household level). In their majority, respondents report to feel \u201calways\u201d free in their decisions about their own expenses: the mean percentage over the 27 countries is about 75%. Five countries are notably under this mean: Bulgaria (BG) and Romania (RO), with less than half the target individuals reporting to feel always free, and Greece (EL), Italy (IT) and Latvia (LV) with less than 60%. At the other end, the mean percentage of persons who report to feel \u201cnever\u201d free is only about 8% - much higher in the five countries indicated above (Table 6). Taking into account the household pooling regime shows that the share of individuals feeling \u201calways\u201d free tends to be always higher in partial pooling or no pooling households (depending on the country) than in full pooling households. This could signal that feeling entitled to use some money from the pool does not necessarily follows living in a full pooling household (taking full pooling at face value). But as mentioned previously, there can be different interpretations of what \u201cfeeling free to decide about one\u2019s own expenses\u201d means: one is that it means feeling entitled to make autonomous decisions (the intended meaning); the other is that it means feeling free of a budget constraint. Feeling free of a budget constraint is more likely for those living in better off households, so one could expect differences between individuals living in poor or not poor households. Feeling always entitled could result from many factors, but sociological work points at economic dependence as a factor of power balance between partners, so one can expect differences between individuals having an income of their own and those with no income.

Source: EU-SILC, UDB 2010 release 2, Population: Target individuals. Results shown in Table 7 tend to be consistent with these expectations: the share feeling always free is higher among individuals living in non-poor households than among those in poor households, and respondents who report (in question PA010) having no personal income feel less often \u201calways\u201d free to decide. This also suggests that the households\u2019 economic characteristics and regimes of pooling are not independent (infra). This first approach at individual level shows important inequalities between individuals in general - suggesting interesting directions of analysis - but it does not inform about the existence or extent of intra- household inequality, which can be assessed only by combining the responses of the household\u2019s members. In what follows, \u201cintra-household inequality\u201d is identified by the presence, within a same household, of individuals having different feelings about their ability to decide their own consumption(7). As mentioned above, one limitation is that \u201cfeeling free\u201d can be understood as not having to ask for permission or consult other household\u2019s members to make a decision (entitlement / autonomy) as well as (7) Having excluded dependent children from the population of target individuals allows avoiding the question of whether they should be entitled / feel free to decide of their own expenses without having to ask for permission.

Another limitation, of a different sort, is that \u201cintra-household statistics\u201d require available responses from at least two household\u2019s members (ideally, all the relevant individuals, i.e. target individuals). This automatically excludes \u201cselected respondent\u201d countries, but also all the households in which, for any reason, only one target individual was responding. This share of \u201cincomplete\u201d households is very different between countries (see Appendix 3), and may result in more or less reliable statistics depending on the country. Within a majority of households, the respondents (target individuals responding to PA090) appear to share the same feeling about whether they are free or not to decide of their own expenses (Table 8 part A). The share of intra-household inequality is nevertheless significant, with a mean proportion of about 23%.

For the other countries, we have imputed to households with missing values the same distribution between equal/unequal as that observed among the households counting at least 2 respondents. As for non-target households, they are considered (as was done in the computations for table 5) not to be subject to any potential error either about income pooling or about intra-household equality. As shown in Table 9, the shares of households for whom the standard methodology could be inappropriate, that is households who either do not pool all their incomes or who are suspect of intra- household inequality or both, reach a mean of 30%. The corresponding shares of individuals, those living in these households, reach a mean of about 40%. Going back to what is at stakes for statistics on poverty and inter-individual inequality, do these results help in any way? A central question is that of the relevant indicator for assessing whether the standard assumptions are (are not) correct: on the one hand, in some empirical work (mostly quantitative sociology and economic psychology) income pooling is taken at face value as meaning that all the resources of all the household\u2019s members are pooled and equally accessed (by relevant individuals (8) ) within the household. In full pooling households, every household member should then get his/her fair share (under a common budget constraint). Sorting out between pooling-sharing households and other households would then just require a direct question on the household\u2019s pooling regime. A side question is whether this direct question should be asked at household or at individual level \u2013 which, as we have seen, does not result in the same assessment. On the other hand, economists base their assessment of income pooling on the fact that the household consumption structure is indifferent to changes in the intra-household distribution of income. Checking for income pooling in this meaning would require additional information about the household\u2019s consumption, and being able to observe how it reacts to changes in the intra distribution of incomes - i.e. much more complicated than the direct question. However, Bonke and Browning conclude from an empirical comparison of these two approaches, that economists\u2019 and other social scientists\u2019 views of \u201cincome pooling\u201d result actually in the same thing : \u201c\u2026income shares has a significant and positive impact in consumption shares within non-income pooling households but not within income pooling households\u2026\u201d (Bonke, Browning, 2009:10). But if the direct question is a good tool to assess income pooling, the standard methodology goes one step farther since it assumes also that all the household\u2019s members are equal. Using the feeling of being able to freely make decisions about one\u2019s own consumption as a proxy, we find that substantial shares of households who are full pooling households are also suspect of intra-household inequality. (8) Empirical studies usually consider couples\u2019 partners. Here, by \u201crelevant individuals\u201d we mean essentially not dependent children \u2013 assuming that their parent(s) provide for their needs \u2013 i.e. the parents\u2019 choices take their child(dren) needs into account.

        "4 A statistical analysis of income pooling by households' type and characteristics 31 Income pooling and equal sharing within the household 4. A statistical analysis of income pooling by households\u2019 type and characteristics This last section is aimed at analysing the relationship between households\u2019 characteristics and the regime of income pooling in order to find whether some common pattern emerges from cross-country comparisons. It focuses on couples because almost all the existing empirical literature actually does not treat of any type of household but of couples. Here, the module provides a unique data set: the main findings in the existing literature are based on different datasets, different populations and the results are obtained using different methodologies. EU-SILC provides a set of harmonized data allowing (even though with some limitations) to apply a same methodology on a large scale. Compared to any type of household (i.e. a unit based on the dwelling) couples are specific in that they consist of individuals who have chosen to live together, who love and trust each other and expect continuity. This might not be the same in so-called \u201ccomplex\u201d households where people may live together out of need, but the actual composition of these households covers very different situations (some can be families, for example young adults staying with their parents because they experience employment or housing problems, or single parents living with other family members or conversely older parents living with their adult children for financial or care support, some can consist of unrelated household members). For various reasons, different types of households might opt for different types of arrangements. In general, full pooling is more prevalent among couples than among other households, among nuclear couples (i.e. the household includes only partners and their children) than among other types of couples (e.g. in three generations households), and also more frequent when the household includes children. Full pooling is also more prevalent in one breadwinner households (assessed either on incomes or earnings) and in the low quintiles of the income distribution, decreasing regularly at higher income levels; consistently, it is more frequent in poor than in non-poor households (the corresponding descriptive statistics are shown in Appendix 3). Turning to couples, our target population is that of couples in \u201cone couple\u201d target households. This restriction is to avoid the impossibility of attributing the household response precisely to one or the other(s) couple(s) when there are several couples in the same households (in fact it could be spurious in the case of one couple within an extended family \u2013 e.g. 3 generations households). We also exclude same sex couples (not by principle but because there is not enough observations in national samples). An additional condition was to have information on the couple\u2019s duration (PA110) and couple\u2019s duration consistent with the partners\u2019 ages; this condition resulted in excluding higher shares of couples in Sweden, Slovenia and United-Kingdom (see Appendix 4). Under these criteria, target couples represent on average 80% of all the target households (less in United-Kingdom, then Slovenia and Sweden), and 90% of all couples (Appendix 5 gives the detail by country). As for the methodology, the characteristics taken into account were selected according to the main findings in recent literature when the pertinent variables were available in EU-SILC (see Box 2). We mostly draw from Heimdal and Houseknecht (2003); Woolley (2003); Kenney (2006); Ludwig- Mayerhofer et al. (2006); Yodanis and Lauer (2007); Bonke and Uldall-Poulsen (2007); Laporte and Schellenberg (2011); Lyngstad et al. (2011) and also Treas (1993); Barlow (2008); Burgoyne and Morison (1997). ",

        "4 A statistical analysis of income pooling by households' type and characteristics 33 Income pooling and equal sharing within the household 4.1 Intra couple consistency? Before checking whether EU-SILC couples behave as the literature predicts, it is interesting to go back to the combination of individual responses to the questions about the share of personal income pooled or kept (PA010) and about the perceived ability to decide about their own consumption (PA090). One could expect greater equality within couples than on average. For the same reasons as exposed earlier (section 2.3.1), the analysis is limited to couples with 2 respondent partners, then \u201cselected respondent\u201d countries are not taken into account (and the same caution applies to countries with high shares of missing values). The results are reported in Table 10. Compared with the average obtained over all types of households, couples\u2019 partners appear more often consistent in their answers than the average members in any type of household: on average, the share of couples where the two partners consistently reported to pool all their income is about 59%, while it was only 46.5% over all the households (cf. table 4). As for the share of couples vs. all households reporting the same feeling of ability to decide about their own consumption, the difference is less pronounced: it was about 77% over all households\u2019 types (cf. table 8 part A), it is about 83% among couples \u2013 hence leaving 17% of them who do not report the same degree of freedom in their decisions about their own consumption. As for feeling \u201calways\u201d free to decide about their own spending, the mean proportion is lower than that observed over all the households (cf. table 8 part C), in general as well as in any pooling regime. This could mean that couples\u2019 partners consult each other more willingly than the average households\u2019 members do (caring more about their partner\u2019s opinion) \u2013 thus adding some difficulty in the interpretation of variable PA090.

        "4 A statistical analysis of income pooling by households' type and characteristics Income pooling and equal sharing within the household 34 4.2 Couples\u2019 characteristics and income pooling: descriptive overview In most of the dimensions examined, the associations between various characteristics and the pooling regime are as expected. The main results are briefly summarized below \u2013 but we do not comment the differences between countries even though some can be substantial (the corresponding tables, which indicate the ratio between the share of full pooling couples with a given characteristic and the average share of full pooling couples, are grouped at the end of the section). Marital status, household type, children (Table 11) As found in all empirical studies who take marital status into account, married couples appear with a higher propensity to full pooling than other couples (the sample sizes do not allow to distinguish between other types of partnerships by legal basis when they exist). The difference in full pooling associated to the marital status could not be examined for Cyprus (CY), Greece (EL), Lithuania (LT), Malta (MT) and Romania (RO) where the number of observations for not married couples was to small. As for the family type, nuclear couples (i.e. households counting at most the two partners and their children) tend to \u201cfullpool\u201d more often than extended families. Excluding retired couples, nuclear couples with children tend also to fullpool more often than couples without children. The same is observed for extended families. Financial ties with other households and past partnerships (Table 12) Full pooling appears less frequent among couples financially tied to other households (the indicator used is the existence of inter-households transfers). We have also tried to check whether past partnerships were associated with lower frequencies of full pooling. In the absence of direct information, the only indicator we could use is the existence of alimonies received or paid, but the small number of observations made it impossible for most countries. Over the remaining sub-sample, the results suggests a possible association between recomposed or blended families and a lower propensity to full pool Activity, earnings, woman\u2019s share of earnings (Table 13), As was to be expected, the proportion of full pooling couples is lower when both partners are active or in dual earner couples. Full pooling is more frequent among retired couples, suggesting a generation effect but also perhaps signalling lower incomes (see below). In dual earner couples; on average, the share of full pooling couples tends to be slightly lower when the woman\u2019s earnings represent more than 30% of the couple\u2019s earnings, which could suggest a link between \u201chigh\u201d earnings women and more independent finances, but no clear pattern emerges. Income, poverty status, wealth (Table 14) As was observed over all the population of households, the share of full pooling couples tends to decrease with the income level, the differences between income quintiles being more or less pronounced depending on the country. The results are consistent when the frequency of full pooling is examined by poverty status. To examine a possible link with wealth, we have used a dummy variable equal to 1 if the couple\u2019s income from capital and property is above the national mean, 0 otherwise; the share of full pooling couples is lower in the first case. Another tentative using home ownership was not conclusive \u2013 but it could result from the respective shares of owners/tenants (which are surprising in some countries), and from the fact that the variable in EU-SILC seems to group together owners and households using freely their dwelling.

        "4 A statistical analysis of income pooling by households' type and characteristics 35 Income pooling and equal sharing within the household Couple\u2019s duration and age (Table 15) Duration and age are complicated issues: the association between duration and full pooling could include some generation effect, and it is also correlated with marital status income and wealth effects. In addition, couples with a long duration are necessarily more likely to be older than the average \u2013 while it is not impossible to find recent couples among older individuals. As for age, it includes possible effects of experience \u2013 older persons are more likely than younger to have experienced past partnerships. However, on average, one can expect to observe higher proportions of full poolers among couples who have a long duration and older partners. For \u201cage\u201d, we have used a \u201ccouple\u2019s age\u201d defined as the mean age of partners and use a complementary indicator of age gap to distinguish couples in which the gap is greater than 5 years. By duration, the proportion of full pooling couples goes up until to 20 years (25 in some countries) then down then up again from 35 years. As mentioned above, this could be linked with a life cycle effect (children and accumulation of wealth) and/or generation effects. By age, the results are consistent with duration: the proportion of full pooling couples goes up then down then up. There could be an effect of experience (if past union dissolutions happen most often in the 45-60 age interval, where the share of full pooling decreases). Education, citizenship (Table 16) Given the strong social homogamy, most partners have close or equal levels of education; the education level is then defined for the couple, and we only distinguish whose partner (woman or man) has the highest level when education differs. The proportion of full pooling couples tends to be the lowest among the highest educated couples. In couples with different education levels, the proportion of income pooling appears lower when it is the woman who has the highest level than when it is the man in most countries. This could be analysed as reflecting the link between education and earnings potential, but also as reflecting a link between education and gender ideology. Differences between countries are difficult to analyse (in addition, there are sensible differences in the overall education levels between countries) As for citizenship, it could be used to assess whether different \u201ccultures\u201d are associated with different ways to organize the couple\u2019s income. We have defined \u201cnon-national\u201d citizenship as one of the partners not having the national citizenship. But this is only a weak proxy for culture, and in many countries, the share of non-national individuals is too low to be used (even inexistent). In the countries where the comparison could be done, the association with the proportion of full pooling shows no clear pattern. ",

Source: UDB2010 release 2 , Population: Target couples 4.3 Statistical analysis of the probability of full pooling in couples Many of the characteristics used in the descriptions above are correlated: for example, married couples have more often children, older couples are more often married and have in general higher incomes than younger couples and so on. Logistic regressions will allow checking whether full pooling appears significantly associated with some characteristics when others are kept constant, and whether it is the same associations in different countries. The analysis is done only for couples who are not retired and over a sub-sample of countries for which the sample size was sufficient in all the dimensions taken into account in the specification (with a low limit of at least 100 observations by cell). This left 15 countries. The specification is very simple, introducing only dummy variables: marriage, presence of dependent children, type of couple (nuclear vs. extended family), existence of inter-household transfers, couple\u2019s duration (five dummies), partners\u2019 \u201cage gap\u201d as defined above, couple\u2019s education level (three levels), whether it is the same for both partners, whether the woman has a highest level, couple\u2019s activity status (2 partners active vs. other combinations), income quintiles, capital and property income (as a proxy for wealth) and a control for citizenship. Table 17 shows the results of the estimations, summarized by the odds ratios (detailed results are in Appendix 6). Almost all the main effects appear with the expected sign. Other things equal, marriage is the characteristic which has the strongest (positive) influence on the probability of full pooling, then low income level, then having dependent children. Extended families have the expected negative effect, significant in all countries except Sweden (SE). Financial ties with other households have also the expected sign where their effect is significant ",
        "4 A statistical analysis of income pooling by households' type and characteristics Income pooling and equal sharing within the household 42 A short duration of common life (up to 5 years) has a general negative and significant effect and, regardless of significance, the effect of duration tends to increase the probability of full pooling - but there are important differences depending on the country. The age gap between partners has most often the expected effect but is significant only in Belgium (BE) and France (FR). The activity status and income level appear generally to play as expected and each are significant in most countries. The impact of education, wealth and citizenship are more disparate and disparities are difficult to comment at this stage of the analysis. All in all, these results suggest that some of the characteristics that might contribute to the probability to observe full pooling could be missing for some countries. A synthetic assessment of the model fit (pseudo R2) shows some variation between countries (the fit is lower in The United-Kingdom (UK), Ireland (IE), Estonia (EE) and Finland (FI) than in the other countries. This also needs further investigations.

        "5 The lid is open, now what? 43 Income pooling and equal sharing within the household 5. The lid is open, now what? As indicated in the introduction, this paper is as much about limitations as it is about results. Intra- household is a complicated level of analysis, and pooling and sharing are complex issues. In addition, different modes of data collection, varying response rates and some doubts about the correct understanding of the questions by the respondents make the analysis even more challenging. It is also worth highlighting the problem of questions asked at individual level, which are obviously of limited interest if there is only one respondent at individual level in the household; this is the case of all countries using a \u201cselected respondent\u201d method of collection, but also that of other countries where values are missing for substantial shares of observations. For all these reasons, it is sometimes difficult to make use of cross country differences as these might in fact reflect differences in structures and \u201ccultures\u201d but also possible \u2013 and sometimes confirmed - deficiencies in the data quality (meaning and understanding of questions, mode of data collection). As for the results presented here, which are preliminary, we will retain at this stage the following provisional conclusions: - the tentative measures of correct/wrong assumptions (with caution about their robustness given the uncertain quality and comparability of data) tend to reinforce the suspicion that assuming income pooling is a very strong assumption, that it is very likely that the household members are not necessarily equal (at least in terms of their ability to make decisions about their own consumption) and that intra-household equality does not necessarily follow full income pooling. These are serious incentives to investigate ways of computing alternative / complementary indicators, if not to correct the standard methodology. \u201cHow to do this\u201d remains an entire question. - as for couples pooling behaviour: the results from logistic regressions tend to confirm the main findings in empirical literature, but more information would be welcome (e.g. better information on family ties, including on children not living in the household; information on partners\u2019 former couple\u2019s experiences; information on partners\u2019 parents characteristics; ownership of property and capital, \u2026). These results also suggest that more dual earners couples, more family disruptions and re-compositions could lead to lower shares of full pooling households. This is a further incentive to investigate potential corrections in the standard measures of living standards and inter-individuals inequality or the development of alternative indicators. ",
