        "8 1.1 General Information The Republic of Armenia is located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia in the northeast of Asia Minor (Armenian Plateau), bordering Azerbaijan, Iran, Turkey and Georgia. With an area of 29,800 square kilometres, the country is about the size of Belgium. The capital city, Yerevan, lies on the Hrazdan River, and is home to some 1.1 million people. Yerevan is one of the world\u2019s oldest, continually inhabited cities in existence to this day. The next three largest cities are Gyumri (pop. 118,000), Vanadzor (pop. 82,800) and Echmiadzin (pop. 46,800). The majority of Armenia is mountainous (about 2,000 metres above sea level). One-third of the territory is pastureland. Forest and woodland cover 12% of the country, arid land some 18 percent, and permanent crops cover 3%. The highest elevation is 4,095 metres (Mt. Aragats) and the lowest point is 400 metres above sea level (Debed River). One of the largest mountain lakes in the world, Lake Sevan, is about 2,000 metres above sea level. The climate in Armenia is continental, with lower temperatures and more precipitation in higher elevations. In the central plateau, temperature varies widely with cold winters and hot summers. Armenian mountains are rich in iron, molybdenum, gold, lead, silver, clay, limestone, as well as semi-precious and ornamental stones. Armenia possesses strategic deposits of molybdenum. Armenia is a land-locked country with a population of 2.97 million people (47% men and 53% women). The country has a population density of 101 people per square kilometre (263/square mile). Armenia is the second-most densely populated of the former Soviet republics. Armenia\u2019s urbanisation rate is 0.5%. Ethnically, Armenia is a homogeneous country with 98% Armenians while the rest are primarily Yazidis, with some Russian ethnicity present. Religious devotion in Armenia is traditionally Christian. Armenia was the first country to adopt Christianity as a national religion, and antiquity shows this occurred around 301 A.D. Over 93% of the current populous claims to be part of the Armenian Apostolic Church. Catholicism exists in Armenia, as well as Sunni Islam, both practiced by a small fraction of Armenian residents. After the collapse of Soviet Union, many Armenians left the country. Since Armenia\u2019s independence, the population trend has been continually downward, decreasing by some 49,000 during the period 2011-2017 as more and more Armenians migrated. After the Velvet Revolution in the spring of 2018, emigration declined due to more positive expectations in the country. ",
        "9 Figure 1 : Armenia\u2019s population, thousand people Source: Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia Labour force In parallel with the reduced labour force (2011-2017) the level of economic activity also decreased from 63% to 60.9%. 2 This was mainly due to the slow economic growth, continued migration, reduced foreign direct investment, and some other negative macroeconomic factors. Although in the group of upper-middle income countries , Armenia\u2019s rate of economic activity is closer to the average of high-income countries. 3 Figure 2: Economic activity rate, % Source: World Bank Database, Labour Force Participation Rate, 2018 In the same six-year period, the share of people with a tertiary and postgraduate education in the economically active population increased primarily due to the reduction of the VET 4 education share. Meanwhile, the share of those without any professional education maintained a high share (about 50%). 2 Labour force analysis methods used by the Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia and the World Bank are different due to the fact that the former takes into consideration population aged 15-75 while the latter population higher than 15. 3 World Bank Database, Labour Force Participation Rate, 2018 4 VET includes graduates of preliminary and upper-secondary professional education. 3448.6 3260.3 3226.9 3156 3021.4 3026.9 3017.1 3010.6 2998.6 2976.2 2972.7 1989 1995 2000 2005 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 60.67 60.94 60.76 60.62 59.80 60.32 58.30 58.81 58.65 2011 2015 2018 High income countries Republic of Armenia Upper-middle income countries ",
        "10 Figure 3: Economically active population by educational level Source: The NSS database Migration to Russia for work is significant. According to the State migration service it accounts for about 230,000 people or about 20% of the working age population. Between 2011 and 2017, the unemployment rate decreased by only 0.6 percentage points down to 17.8% in 2017. This slim reduction was due to the decline of economically active population rather than increased employment. The majority of unemployed people (46%) with a general education (no special skills) face difficulties meeting today\u2019s labour market requirements. To compound the problem, many female tertiary graduates drop out of the labour market, implying a significant waste of scarce public resources. Only about half of the female population and just over a third of youth aged 15 to 24 are engaged in the labour market, thus contributing too little in terms of economic activity and government revenues \u2013 insufficient to compensate for the declining population. 5 Diaspora The Armenian Diaspora, estimated at around 10 million people, is spread over 85 countries with a major concentration in Russia (2.5 million), United Sates (1.5 million), France (0.45 million) and Georgia (0.25 million). In the beginning of the 1990s, the Armenian Diaspora played a crucial role in the process of rebuilding the homeland after the collapse of the Soviet Union, transportation blockade, power shortages and conflict with Azerbaijan. Beyond the humanitarian, development work and political support, the Diaspora played an active role in attracting foreign investments through leveraging its potential to attract global companies such as HSBC, Coca-Cola, Marriott, Hyatt, KPMG, National Instruments, and Synopsis. Since the 2000s, the Diaspora investment has led to many businesses being founded/co-founded in different sectors. Russia, USA, Argentina and Iran are the leading source countries for Diaspora investments. 5 World Bank \u2018Reducing Poverty and Improving Shared Prosperity Through Better Jobs, Skills, and Education\u2019 24 May 2017 ; https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/28328 48% 48% 47% 46% 48% 48% 48% 27% 26% 26% 24% 23% 24% 23% 25% 25% 27% 31% 29% 29% 30% 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 No specialization VET Tertiary and postgraduate education ",
        "11 1.2 Geopolitical And Political Landscape Located in the Caucasus region, Armenia is situated on the transcontinental land bridge between Europe and Asia. A landlocked country with Turkey to the west, Georgia to the north, and Azerbaijan to the east, Armenia boasts a history longer than most countries in the world. For much of Armenia \u2019 s history, part or all of the country has been controlled by each of its neighbours. Russia, which controlled Armenia most recently during the Soviet period, remains the most influential external power in the country. The post-Soviet transformation also catalysed the reinterpretation of the historical past and memory. Ethnopolitical conflicts in the South Caucasus region were decisive in the creation of new dividing lines and animosity; xenophobic rhetoric became rampant. This was the greatest political challenge for Armenia in the post-Soviet period, as the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict strongly influenced the political and economic transformation of the country. In Armenia, the development of the State was very slow in terms of institutionalising democratic structures and tackling endemic corruption. A semi- presidential system was formally established in 2005 based on an amendment to the 1995 constitution. A constitutional referendum was held in Armenia in December 2015. The amendments have radically changed the country\u2019s political system, shifting from a semi-presidential to a parliamentary republic. Under the new system, the prime minister was granted extended executive powers, including supreme command of the armed forces during war, whereas the president became a ceremonial figure. In April 2018, a peaceful movement opposed Serzh Sargsyan being elected Prime Minister according to the new Constitution which was meant to finalise the transformation of the political system to a full parliamentary republic. The movement was led by Nikol Pashinyan, the leader of Civil Contract political party (member of \u2018 Way Out Alliance \u2019 with nine seats in the Parliament). This movement, later to be called the Velvet Revolution, led to the resignation of Serzh Sargsyan and the Republican majority of the Parliament voted in favour of Nikol Pashinyan to become the new Prime Minister of Armenia in May 2018. The new government was formed in coalition with two other parties, its programme envisaged holding new parliamentary elections within a year. In the current Parliament, the following parties are represented: \u2022 My Step Alliance \u2013 88 seats in the Parliament, \u2022 Prosperous Armenia \u2013 26 seats in the Parliament, \u2022 Bright Armenia \u2013 18 seats in the Parliament. The new PM initiated a large-scale campaign against corruption, privileges for special groups and wasteful public spending. These initiatives are generally ",
        "12 expected to create a level playing field for businesses in the country and substantially improve the business climate. The Armenian government included the following key priorities in its programme to achieve this goal: 6 \u2022 Protection of external and internal security, guarantee of Artsakh\u2019s security and its maintenance, \u2022 Competitiveness of the economy: improvement of the creative potential, fair competition, export markets, tourism, high technologies, digitalisation etc., \u2022 Protection of human rights, \u2022 Democracy and the rule of law, \u2022 Consolidation of human, economic, financial, intellectual potential of all Armenians to promote development, \u2022 Government accountability and transparency and the rejection of corruption, \u2022 Separation of political and business sectors, \u2022 Encouraging education and healthy living, \u2022 Poverty reduction through labour and education. Geopolitical situation The geopolitical situation around Armenia is greatly influenced by the interplay of different interests of large global players. Russia, the United States, as well as European Union (EU) actively work to maintain and increase their influence in the region. In recent years, Armenia has also been increasing ties with Russia, especially in military and energy, while maintaining good relations both with the US and the EU. An inseparable part of Armenia\u2019s history is the Nagorno -Karabakh conflict which began in 1988. It is a territorial and ethnic conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Armenian populated region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia has good relations with Iran and Georgia, and economic cooperation with these countries are developing. With the other two neighbours, Turkey and Azerbaijan, relations are strained. The Turkish State denies the genocide of about 1.5 million Armenians committed by Ottoman Turkey between 1915 and 1923. Currently, there are still no diplomatic relations with Turkey and the border is closed. 6 Programme of the Government of the Republic of Armenia 2019 ",
        "13 There are no diplomatic and trade relations with Azerbaijan either. The so-called Minsk Group of OSCE, represented by the US, Russia and French diplomats is mediating between the two countries towards resolving the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict. In January 2015, Armenia officially joined the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) formed by Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. Kirgizstan is the 5th member which joined the EEU after Armenia. For Armenia, this means free-flowing commodities, services, labour and capital within the EEU area. Prior to the Trump administration, Armenia was one of the largest recipients of US assistance on a per capita basis. Armenia and the EU officially signed a Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in November 2017. For Armenia, this marks a substantial step toward developing western democratic reforms and closer ties with the EU. 1.3 Overview Of Armenia \u2019s Macroeconomic Performance Armenia\u2019s national income in GDP fell significantly in the years following independence, as the country suffered from economic hardships in the aftermath of the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. Throughout the 1990s, the military conflict with Azerbaijan and closed borders with Turkey, the loss of traditional export markets of former Soviet Republics, and the collapse of industry and agriculture, large- scale emigration, and unemployment all led to the country\u2019s economic deterioration. In the past three years, GDP has fluctuated between EUR 9-10.5 billion during, ranking Armenia in the 140s range in the world. Figure 4: Armenia GDP annual growth %, 2004-2018 Source: Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia As a result of the global economic crisis, the decline in GDP in 2009 was 14.1%, one of the steepest in the region. The economy recovered in the following year. By 2017 and 2018, Armenia had reached GDP growth rates of 7.5% and 5.2% respectively. Armenia is about average in terms of GDP per capita (PPP) compared to other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), but lower than CEE countries.

The Armenian GINI index is 32.5 (2016) which decreased by 5 percentage points compared to the 2004 figure of 37.5, indicating lower inequality in the country. The data reached an all-time high of 37.5% in 2004 and a record low of 28.0% in 2009. Figure 7: GINI index in Armenia Source: World Bank estimates Economic growth over recent years has had a positive impact on the poverty level in the country. The poverty rate has decreased over the decade from 2008 to 2017. The total percentage of people below the national poverty line in 2017 was 25.7% (compared to 27.6% in 2008) \u2013 out of which 1.4% are categorised as extremely poor. 9 Considering the Gender Equality Index, Armenia ranked 98 by 0.678 out of 159 countries in 2018. 10 Female participation in the labour market was 46.6% in 2018. Economy structure In the Armenian economy, agriculture (17% of GVA in 2017) plays a relatively important role. Manufacturing contributes about 11% of GVA, significantly lower than in more advanced economies (e.g. EU28). 11 As manufacturing firms tend to invest more in R&D than other sectors, the relatively limited scale of the sector is likely to lead to lower (compared to more advanced economies) technological innovation rates. In turn, this impacts on productivity, which is also relatively 8 See: http://hdr.undp.org/en/data 9 Report \u2018Poverty in Armenia 2008 - 2017\u2019, SCRA, p. 40 -41 10 See: http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2018.pdf 11 See: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Manufacturing_statistics_- _NACE_Rev._2#Country_analysis 0 10 20 30 40 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 ",

During the past 10 years, the Armenian economy has become more diversified, with significant growth in the share of the service sector in GVA, by almost 8 percentage points during the period 2003-2017. Figure 8: GVA structure in Armenia, % share Source: Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia International cooperation On 2 January 2015, Armenia became a member of the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). This membership provides Armenian products direct access to the Russian, Belarussian, Kazakh, and Kirgiz markets. As a WTO member since 2003, Armenia has the most liberal investment regime among EAEU countries, making it an attractive location from which to base international and regional operations focused on EAEU markets. The country has Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) access to the US, EU, and Japan, and a Free Trade Agreement with neighbouring Georgia which remains in force even after Armenia\u2019s accession to the EAEU. In November 2017, the EU and Armenia signed the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA) aimed at significantly deepening their relations. The new agreement is expected to improve the investment climate, stimulating growth and jobs and creating a better regulatory environment for businesses to grow. The United States and the Armenian Government signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) in May 2015, which provides a strategic framework and principles for dialogue on trade and investment. The Agreement provides high-level government engagement to meet and discuss issues of mutual interest, opportunities for trade and investment cooperation, and to ways protect business interests in both countries.

The share of equipment, machinery and technologies, pharmaceutical products, precious and semi-precious stones are increasing. In 2015 imports decreased in incredible rate -15.1%. This significant decline of imports of goods and services in 2015 is due to depreciation of Armenian Dram and reduced flow of personal transfers from Russia.

To ensure further development, Armenia needs to: \u2022 encourage domestic and foreign investment into the economy through continuous improvement of the country\u2019s business environment, rule of law and level playing field for all; \u2022 streamline and increase the efficiency of public administration and combat corruption; \u2022 increase private-sector competitiveness through efficient and targeted structural economic policies including SME and innovation support; \u2022 investment in human capital with a better alignment of quality, relevance and flexibility which is critical for boosting competitiveness, efficiency and higher value-added production. 7 9 8 9 2 0 9 7 0 1 , 0 4 5 9 7 3 1 , 0 6 9 1 , 2 8 7 1 , 3 9 9 2 , 7 5 5 3 , 0 4 9 3 , 2 9 1 3 , 4 4 8 3 , 5 9 4 3 , 4 8 7 3 , 9 5 1 4 , 4 6 4 5 , 1 3 8 42% 44% 39% 33% 22% 19% 16% 14% 36% 37% 37% 37% 36% 34% 42% 48% 50% 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 External public debt, million EUR External public debt, million US$ (% of GDP) ",
        "22 2 GOVERNANCE OF THE NATIONAL R&I SYSTEM 2.1 Institutional Framework: Policy Making And Execution Armenia \u2019s institutional set-up places innovation and science into two separate policy domains with clearly distinguished roles and responsibilities. Currently, two main policy documents exist that should provide a strategic framework for research and innovation policies in Armenia: \u2022 Strategic Programme for the Development of Science Sector (SPDSS), 2017-20; and \u2022 Initial strategy of the formation of innovation economy (ISFIE). The SPDSS is under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and Science (MES), whereas innovation and industrial strategy is under the remit of the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development (now the Ministry of Economic Development and Investments(MEDI)). Science The State Committee of Science (SCS) 12 of the Ministry of Education and Science is in charge of designing and implementing science policy. According to the statute of the SCS, the main goals are: (i) ensuring the normal operation of the science sector and its progressive development; (ii) preservation and development of science and the scientific-technical potential of the country, including its educational system of scientific personnel; and (iii) supporting the integration of science, education and industry. The oversight of the Committee is executed by the Minister of Education and Science who approves the statute, defines the priorities for the Committee operations, and approves the annual reports. The Committee is headed by the Chairman (appointed by the Prime Minister) who carries out both strategic and daily operations of the body. The Chairman is accountable to the Government of Armenia, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Education and Science. The National Academy of Science (NAS), with 35 subordinated research institutes, operates as a self-governing scientific organisation and has a special status. It is directly subordinate to the Government, and the President of the Academy participates in Government sessions. The Academy\u2019s basic funding comes from a specific State budget line. For additional funding and projects, the NAS, or the subordinated research institutes, can participate in competitive calls organised by the SCS. 12 http://www.scs.am/en/home ",
        "23 Innovation Science and innovation were placed on the policy agenda in 2000 with the adoption of the Law on Scientific and Technological Activity, which was followed by the adoption of several governmental decrees regulating science and technology activities. The MEDI developed the Concept on Innovation Policy and the State Support Programme of Innovation Activities for 2005-2010. These were approved by the Government in 2005 and were a basis for adopting the Law on State Support on Innovation in 2006. However, these policy documents did not receive sufficient funding for the implementation of the foreseen innovation support. There are also a number of sector development strategies (export-led industrial strategy, tourism, IT, agriculture) which set specific development objectives and measures for each sector including activities targeting technological upgrading and innovation. The MEDI has the lead for the industrial policy framework. The implementation of economic development and investment policies (covering exports, foreign investment, tourism, SME support, etc.) is supported by four main agencies: the Enterprise Incubator Foundation , the Small and Medium Entrepreneurship Development Centre of Armenia (SME DNC); and the Development Foundation of Armenia (under reorganisation to become the National Investment Foundation), and the State Committee of Tourism. In addition, the National Centre of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, 13 an agency reporting to the MEDI, is expected to support the generation of innovative ideas and their incubation and eventual commercialisation, as well as to provide scientific-technical information and library services. Due to limited resources, instruments and capabilities, the agency \u2019s activities are mostly focused on organising seminars, information sessions and training. Three other agencies under the MEDI \u2013 the Armenian Intellectual Property Agency (AIPA), the National Institutes of Standards and the National Institute of Metrology \u2013 also play a role in the innovation policy system. The Enterprise Incubator Foundation (EIF), established in 2002 within the framework of a World Bank project, supports the development of information communication technology (ICT) in Armenia through the creation of a productive environment for innovation, technological advancement and company growth. The EIF\u2019s responsibilities were widened to support innovation in high-tech sectors including ICT. Apart from its incubator and training tasks, the EIF seeks international funding for specific innovation support actions in Armenia and is the main implementing agency for large-scale development projects in the fields of high-tech development and innovation. It has established and operates the regional technology centres in Gyumri and Vanadzor. The Small and Medium Entrepreneurship Development Centre of Armenia (SME DNC) focuses on micro, small and medium-sized firms in all regions of the 13 http://www.innovcentre.am/en/ ",
        "24 country. The main support tools are information services, training, consulting and credit guarantee schemes to ease access to finance for rural businesses. Moreover, SME DNC is one of the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) 14 partners in Armenia. The EEN is an EU-financed international technology transfer and innovation network for SMEs. From an innovation policy perspective, the activities of SME DNC remain closer to those of a more general business support agency than one that is currently well placed to deliver technically more complex support or funding to business innovation projects. The SDG National Innovation Lab is established in the framework of the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in Armenia and the development of the Armenian National Development Strategy 2030. This is a joint initiative of the Government of Armenia and the UN Office in Armenia, and is the first-ever SDG National Innovation Lab dedicated to SDG implementation at a national level. The Lab aims to be a space for experimentation, collaboration, analytics and world- class human resource development, to unlock Armenia\u2019s development potential and accelerate implementation of the SDGs. Since 2017, the IT sector development became a responsibility of the Ministry of Transport, Telecommunication and IT . Under the new Government, a new Ministry of High Technology Industries is formed which will be responsible for the development and execution of high tech and innovation policies. Such developments underline the need for cross-ministerial coordination in order to structure efforts to boost technology development and dissemination in the economy and society. In short, different functions of business development and innovation advice are distributed across many organisations, which have specific missions and beneficiaries. Policies and strategies Development of Armenia\u2019s science sector is guided by the \u2018 Strategic Programme of Development of Science Sector of the Republic of Armenia in 2017-2020 \u2019, which is a set of measures and key indicators for promoting excellence in scientific and scientific-technical activities, and for creating a scientific research system competent in the international arena \u2013 primarily the European Research Area. This programme\u2019s objectives are: \u2022 Improvement of the science and technology management system, \u2022 Introduction of an efficient system for re-production of personnel engaged in scientific work, modernisation of science infrastructures, 14 http://een.ec.europa.eu/ ",
        "25 \u2022 Promoting research of a fundamental and applied nature, including knowledge used in economy and/or of dual importance, \u2022 Establishing preconditions to form a synergistic system of education, science, technology and innovation, \u2022 Primary development of Armenian studies, \u2022 Development of international scientific cooperation, ensuring smart specialisation platform in ERA. In the scope of the \u2018 Development Programme of the Republic of Armenia \u2019s Scientific and Technical Field for 2015-2019 \u2019 (decision N 54 on 25.12.14), the government prioritises the following fields: \u2022 Armenology, aiming to protect national interests, \u2022 Life sciences, aiming to improve the quality of life, \u2022 Efficient and safe energy, aiming to improve energy consumption efficiency and develop the field of renewables, \u2022 Key enabling technologies (nanotechnology, biotechnology and so on), IT and communication, aiming to raise the competitiveness of the economy in these fields, \u2022 Space, earth and nature sciences, aiming to ensure sustainable use of natural resources and manage disasters, \u2022 Fundamental research focused on the major problems of scientific-technical and socio-economic development, aiming to boost scientific progress, the creation of high technologies and their usage, innovation development and civil society. At the request of the State Committee of Science the policy mix peer review of the Armenian Science and Technology 15 (S&T) system was undertaken in the frame of the IncoNet EaP, a project funded by the EU FP7 Programme(2015). The aim of this policy review was to critically examine the existing S&T policy mix in Armenia and to provide policy advice from peers in EU and Eastern European countries, thereby increasing mutual understanding and learning. Five issues were considered: overall environment for research Research, Development, Technology and Innovation (RDTI), structural, strategic and legal framework for RDTI, financing of RDTI, human resources and international cooperation. The report states that research and teaching infrastructure was and still is a relevant part of the research environment in Armenia, but there is no strategic approach to the interfaces between the three sectors of the innovation system: 15 S&T Policy Mix Peer Review Armenia, Inco-Net EaP, 2015 ",

Moreover, the available data of the National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia(NSSRA) about the education, science and innovation landscape in Armenia is not detailed enough to serve the recent needs for evidence-based political decisions, to steer the innovation system and to benchmark and forecast governmental interventions. Thus, report indicates the importance of reliable and indicators and data, better coordination of different levels and with different goals (e.g. with the Ministry of Education, State Committee of Science, conference of university rectors, and others) and better marketing of Armenia\u00b4s intention to regain its role as a S&T power house. A lack of financial data on the the R&D, higher education and innovation sectors and insufficient monitoring of budget flows were identified as a major challenge to the wider Research, development, technology and innovation (RDTI) sector. A detailed look at the age distribution of researchers holding scientific degrees and currently involved in State programmes shows that, even without any other external influences, their numbers will be halved in the next two decades. Some initial attempts have already been made to support researchers, but key issues to make research an attractive career choice, such as a general balanced income system or career options, need to be considered more vigorously. Due to limited financial and human resources, a smart configuration of international cooperation based on Armenia\u2019s strengths seems to be an urgent requirement for strategic policy actions. However, according to this report, more international interaction is taking place, but it is not properly reported. Innovation strategy In line with the Government\u2019s procedures on national development strategy documents, a team of international and national experts, funded by the EU SMEDA programme, developed a concept for a national innovation strategy in March 2018. Based on Armenia\u2019s realities and best international practices , the concept recommends having differentiated approaches to tackle the innovation challenges in Armenia. The key features of the proposed concept are illustrated in Figure 18.

Pathway 2: Innovation for export growth , which foresees support for upgrading innovation capabilities in key export clusters in the Armenian economy. Pathway 3: Challenge driven innovation , which foresees stimulation of broad-based innovation partnerships (partners from business, civil society/users, public sector and research institutes and, ideally, international partners), aiming to develop innovative solutions to societal challenges. In a first \u2018jump start\u2019 phase, the broad outlines and priorities set in the current strategy paper will be further developed through a process of consultation and multi- stakeholder discussions that can be likened to the \u2018entrepreneurial discovery process\u2019 used in the EU to support the design and subsequent delivery of smart specialisation strategies for research and innovation. According to this framework, the strategy is based on a number of high-level \u2018necessary conditions\u2019: \u2022 An increase of public investment in science and innovation \u2013 the Government should set a clear medium-term target to increase the share of the budget allocated to science and innovation, as the current level of funding is sub- critical and is not sufficient to leverage additional private sector or foreign investment in favour of more innovative activities. \u2022 Investment and activities should be targeted in all three pathways towards partnerships which can develop a strong case for prioritising their technology field, cluster or societal challenge, and which set ambitious targets to achieve within an agreed timeframe. \u2022 The initiatives supported under each pathway should not only focus on quantified targets but also qualitative ones: innovation management, skills and capacities in the business, research, education and public sectors; as well as boosting innovation awareness in the broader society. \u2022 Enhanced coordination of policy at inter-ministerial level means and a shift towards joint implementation actions through the adoption of medium-term programmes. \u2022 The set of strategic initiatives proposed in this strategy are intended to help focus and structure donor activities to increase the medium-to-long run impact and sustainability of their interventions. \u2022 Improved administrative, strategic planning and capacity for agencies supporting business development, innovation and technology transfer, exports and foreign direct investment.

        "28 The concept was intensively discussed with the Ministry of Economic Development and Investment, State Committee of Science and PM, but later the approval of the document was stalled due to the political changes in the country. 2.2 Performance Of Innovation Ecosystem (Global Innovation Index) Armenia ranked 68 th in the Global Innovation Index (GII) in 2018. Ranks for knowledge and technology outputs, institutions and creative outputs (62 nd , 67 th and 48 th respectively) were higher than the country\u2019s overall rank. Business sophistication, infrastructure and human capital and research (88 th , 93 rd and 110 th respectively) rank considerably lower. However, the good rankings are skewed by a few \u2018high - performing indicators\u2019 suggesting that NIS is characterised by a few \u2018 pockets of excellence\u2019; while the low performing indicators point to significant gaps in \u2018necessary conditions\u2019 for a well -functioning NIS. 16 Low ICT take-up (usage, e-government, etc.), ICT service imports (ranked 92 nd ), and computer software spending (86 th ), which can be used as proxies for knowledge absorption, contrast with a strong (ranked 18 th ) in ICT service exports as a percentage of total trade (highlighted as a strength by the GII). This points to an ICT \u2018cluster\u2019 that is not linked to the rest of the economy and, thus, not reflected in broader capabilities. From an industry 4.0 (business digitalisation) perspective, the challenge is to improve ICT usage and productivity across the economy.

",
        "29 Despite a low innovation input sub-index (94 th ), innovation output ranks quite high (50 th ) leading to a strong innovation efficiency ratio (15 th ). This can be explained by the rich heritage of the science system and progressive developments in the ICT sector. The innovation output scores are boosted by an overall above average knowledge creation rank (38 th ) including a high relative level of patenting (and other forms of intellectual property) as well as scientific and technical articles compared to GDP (PPP USD). Again, the data on innovation outputs hints at some \u2018pockets of excellence\u2019 in the NIS, while other indicators suggest that knowledge impact and diffusion are weak. Rather than growing a few high-tech spin-off or start-up companies, the real challenge these indicators point to is the need for existing businesses to reinforce their produ ctivity and product development (\u2018value creation\u2019) position in their respective (global) value chains. The specific Armenian weaknesses are related to \u2018capabilities\u2019 (skills and know - how) and cooperation linkages, expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP (107 th ), graduates in science and engineering (90 th ), innovation linkages (99 th ) and knowledge absorption (94 th ). For the latter, the suggestion that Armenian businesses import new technologies is undermined by the low level of high-tech imports (104 th ). Two key indicators for innovation linkages point to a poorly functioning innovation ecosystem, with university/industry research (85 th ) and state of cluster development (86th) much lower than average.

As can be seen, Armenia\u2019s relative weaknesses lie in human capital and research and infrastructure. Elements of Armenian under-performance can be, in part, explained by missing or incomplete data such as intellectual property receipts as a share of trade, researchers as share of population and business expenditure on R&D. Innovation performance and outcomes can be measured by several indicators including those collected through surveys of business innovation activity and in overall terms by growth in value added in the economy (productivity) and well- being (income per head, reduction in share of population in poverty, improved social and environmental metrics, etc.). The National Statistical Service has recently completed a pilot survey applying the EU\u2019s \u2018 Community Innovation Survey 2014 \u2019 model questionnaire. 18 The survey results provide initial and useful insight into the extent and type of innovation activity in the Armenian business sector (in total 1489 companies replied of which 60% were based in Yerevan). Key findings of the survey include: \u2022 Overall, 9.4% of enterprises declared themselves t o be \u2018innovation active\u2019; however, this figure varied significantly by sector rising as high as 24.8% of enterprises in the scientific and technical service sector, 14.6% of manufacturing firms, 14.5% of mining firms, 13% of agricultural firms, 12.5% 18 A World Bank Enterprise survey from 2013 covering nearly 400 firms in Armenia and Georgia found much higher innovation rates for Armenia which performed relatively well when benchmarked with 10 Europe and Central Asia countries (including eight EU Member States). See chapter 4 in Kuriakose S (2013) for more details. ",
        "31 of financial and insurance firms and 11.4% of information and communication firms. \u2022 Only 4.3% of firms declared to have carried out product (only) innovation, 2.8% process (only) innovation, 6% product and process innovation, 3.5% organisational innovation and 5.1% marketing innovation. \u2022 Large and medium-sized firms tended to be more innovation active, for instance 24.5% of larger manufacturing firms, 29% of larger information and communication firms, etc. However, there were exceptions such as scientific and technical services and mining (26.8% of smaller innovation active firms) and financial services (14.3%). \u2022 Manufacturing firms dominate in terms of product innovation (38.4% of active innovators); the same is true of process and product innovators, where manufacturing firms account for between 30% and a third of total innovation active firms. Organisational innovators are more equally spread: retail trade (19% of total), hotel and catering (15.8%), scientific and technical services (18%), and manufacturing (28%). In terms of marketing innovation, the retail trade sector (30.2%) and manufacturing (37.6%) are the most active.

As can be seen, in overall terms Armenian innovation activity rates are much lower than the three Baltic States or even Croatia (the newest EU Member State). However, Armenian performance in \u2018p rofessional, scientific and technical activities \u2019 sector and, to a lesser extent, in mining and manufacturing sectors are close to the average for the EU28 benchmarks. In contrast, the innovation activity rate in information and communication is far from the rates witnessed in the EU countries and the same can be said for the financial, water supply, energy and construction sectors. While it should be kept in mind that the Armenian survey was a pilot, it does point to a significant \u2018innovation deficit\u2019 overall and in most sectors, however, when comparing by type of innovation, the gap is less significant \u2013 as can be seen in the following figure. 19 19 Armenia Innovation Mapping Report. 2018 ",
        "33 Figure 19: Comparison of rates of innovation activity by type of innovation Source: data for Armenia, NSS; Other countries: Eurostat The findings offer some grounds for optimism if policy measures can target selected groups of companies (e.g. manufacturing, ICT, \u2018fin - tech\u2019, energy, water, etc.) where innovation rates are low. Nevertheless, a key factor dragging down Armenian innovation activity rates is the relatively low share of manufacturing in the economy. The pilot survey also provides insight into the factors hampering innovation, with lack of funds within the enterprise or group being a main factor along with uncertain demand for innovative goods or services. Surprisingly, knowledge factors such as information on markets, finding partners for innovation, qualified personnel and lack of information on technology were generally not considered a hampering factor. Only eight of 238 innovative enterprises reported receiving public financial support. A key driver of Armenian enterprises\u2019 decision to introduce innovation with environmental benefits is the high cost of energy, water and materials (46% of firms). Considering the type of innovation expenditure, it is noteworthy that the majority of innovative firms are pursuing innovation through the acquisition of machinery, equipment and software (notably in small innovative firms); while in-house research and development on a continuous basis is only carried out by 47.6% of medium-large innovative companies and 24.5% of small innovative firms. A relatively small share of innovative companies (9.7% in total) are commissioning external R&D (e.g. from research institutes or other companies). The majority of enterprises implementing product and process innovation with a partner reported that the partner was located in Armenia (42 out of 68 companies) followed by Europe (15 companies). This points to a rather \u2018closed\u2019 innovation system (possibly due to cost or language constraints). 26 . 5 5 . 3 7 . 3 5 . 7 3 . 8 5 . 4 39 . 7 4 . 9 7 . 8 13 . 8 8 . 6 8 . 9 25 . 5 3 . 2 4 . 4 5 . 3 6 . 4 5 . 2 43 . 3 3 . 8 14 . 2 17 . 2 6 . 5 8 . 5 9 . 4 4 . 3 2 . 8 6 3 . 5 5 . 1 05 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 I nn o v a t i v e e n t e r p r i s e s P r o du c t i nn o v a t i v e e n t e r p r i s e s o n l y P r o c e ss i nn o v a t i v e e n t e r p r i s e s o n l y P r o du c t a nd p r o c e ss i nn o v a t i v e e n t e r p r i s e s o n l y O r g a n i s a t i o n i nn o v a t i v e e n t e r p r i s e s o n l y M a r k e t i n g i nn o v a t i v e e n t e r p r i s e s o n l y E s t o n i a C r o a t i a L a t v i a L i t hu a n i a A r m e n i a ",

According to the current medium-term expenditure framework plan (2019- 2021) the annual science budget will remain at AMD 14.3 billion (or EUR 25.1 million) level for 2019 and the next two years. Considering GDP growth forecasts, science expenditure\u2019s share in GDP will decrease.

The most technologically advanced countries typically have higher levels of spending on R&D compared to GDP. 21 One of the most well-known cases is Israel, which traditionally maintains one of the highest levels of spending in the world. 20 http://uis.unesco.org/en/country/am?theme=science-technology-and-innovation 21 Due to missing data on business expenditures on R&D for Armenia, GERD captures only R&D expenditures of Government (GOVERD) which artificially reduces the GERD/GDP indicators for Armenia. 0.25% 0.26% 0.28% 0.28% 0.26% 0.24% 0.22% 0.20% 0.18% 0.00% 0.05% 0.10% 0.15% 0.20% 0.25% 0.30% 05 10 15 20 25 30 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 In bln AMD in mln EUR Share in GDP ",

Moreover, the share of the GERD in GDP has decreased during the 2011-2016 period. The distribution of State funding by types of financing of scientific and scientific- technical activities (2015-2017) indicates that the largest share of the budget (73-77%) was allocated to \u2018B asic funding including premiums for scientific degree \u2019 .

Aiming to strengthen young professionals in the science field, the following initiatives are being implemented: \u2022 Two-year research assistance programme for young scientists (under 35 years \u2019 old); \u2022 Annual programme for encouraging PhD (under 35s) research; \u2022 Annual programme for encouraging young scientists (under 35s) working in State scientific programmes. A new evaluation scheme was introduced in 2013 according to which each scientific application has to be examined by two independent experts. Some 85% of the score is based on the average of the experts \u2019 scores and the remaining 15% is the professional assessment of the head of the research group and performers. About 1,714 scholars were involved in a scientifically independent system of expertise in December 2015, out of which 518 were scholars from abroad. While T opic funding\u2019s decision making relies on b oth the board expertise and independent experts, institutional funding depends only on the decision of board expertise. Target funding decision is being made not only based on the board expertise but also government resolution. Budget allocation by field of science In terms of scientific specialisation, data on the broad distribution of the State science budget by scientific field is presented below. The total budget in 2017 was EUR 25.1 million with three fields (natural sciences, engineering and technology, Armenology and humanities) absorbing 65% in total. ",
        "39 Figure 22: Armenian science budget (2017) by field of science Source: SCS While the data is not entirely comparable, it is instructive to compare government budgets 22 (see Table 6). Different patterns emerge across countries (this can be partly due to different classification methods but also reflects priorities). For instance, Estonia allocates 8% to transport and telecommunications R&D (digital agenda); 14% to health, 7% to environment (both in line with smart specialisation priorities) and close to 5% to \u2018 culture \u2019 (Estonian language and culture studies being given a high priority. Ireland has a relatively high share allocated to industrial production and technology and agriculture (reflecting the dual nature of the economy driven in part by FDI manufacturing operations and by agro- food production). Lithuania\u2019s distribution is less marked, but double the EU28 average is invested in agricultural research, energy (a national priority also receives a relatively high share) while cultural R&D is double the EU28 average. 22 Innovation Mapping Report, EU SMEDA, 2018 Natural Sciences 36% General 23% Engineering and Technology 16% Armenology and Humanities 14% Agricultural sciences 4% Social Sciences 4% Medical Sciences 3% ",
        "40 Table 6: GBAORD by socio-economic objective (2015) selected EU countries Source: Eurostat [gba_nabsfin07] Armenia \u2019s budget reflects the importance of \u2018Armenology\u2019 (similar to Estonia\u2019s emphasis on language and cultural preservation) and has a relatively high share (like Ireland) allocated to engineering and technology. In contrast, medical sciences seem to receive a relatively lower share (only Lithuania allocates less). A more detailed breakdown of the Armenian science budget would possibly clarify the share of, say, engineering and technology science funding that is allocated to specific technologies or defence-related R&D (presumably relatively important given Armenia\u2019s geopolitical situation) . 23 3.2 Private And International Funding Of R&D Investment funds and private development foundations are an important backer of innovation in Armenia. Innovative SMEs in the country can currently apply to two Armenian venture capital firms: Granatus Ventures and Smartgate. Granatus ventures was established in 2013, with the help of the Armenian diaspora and World Bank. The fund focuses on later-stage companies. Smartgate is a fully private fund which focuses on smaller-scale companies, providing up to EUR 85,000 in financing. Since late 2014, a total of USD 87.6 million in venture capital and grant financing has been infused into Armenian start-ups; USD 2.1 million in grants came from the World Bank and EU/GIZ via the Enterprise Incubator Foundation (55 deals with 50 companies), USD 20.5 million seed investments (39 deals with 24 companies), USD 45 million series A deals (6 deals with 5 companies) and USD 20 million series B deals of PicsArt company. 23 Ideally, it would be instructive to have more detailed data such as the distribution of budget by type of expense (research funding, maintenance, rewards, laboratory upgrade); distribution by type of recipient organisation (R&D institutions, academies, universities, etc.) and distribution by scientific sub-categories.

        "41 3.3 Main R&D And Innovation Funding Initiatives And Support Infrastructures Business R&D tax and financial incentives There are no special tax credits, custom exemptions, or incentives for R&D. There are no financial support schemes such as R&D subsidies or grants. Only one tax incentive supporting tech entrepreneurship has been introduced; namely a 0% income tax, 10% flat payroll tax for tech start-ups. The support scheme ended in December 2017, but is reported to have created about 700 new IT and high-tech start-ups over four years. R&D funding mechanisms State funding for research (managed by the SCS) is channelled through the science budget via four main financing mechanisms: \u2022 Financing the maintenance and development of science infrastructure (about 60% of total budget) which is allocated to State-owned research institutes; \u2022 Special purpose R&D, such as defence-related projects (about 11%); \u2022 Thematic funding based on calls for proposals from the research community (about 7%); \u2022 A small portion for collaborative and applied research (less than 1.5%). The portfolio of projects indicates that there is low engagement by the private sector in this instrument. Idea and innovation matching grants To foster business innovation, European Investment Fund (EIF) manages two types of grant competitions financed by the State and donors (U.S. Civilian Research & Development Foundation (CRDF Global), World Bank and European Union): \u2022 Science & Technology Entrepreneurship Programme (STEP) \u2013 supported by CRDF and co-financed by the State provides five \u2018 idea \u2019 grants annually to engineers, researchers, and scientists aimed at helping them take their innovative products to market, create new ventures, and to encourage effective partnerships with established companies (annual budget up to USD 75,000); \u2022 Innovation matching grants (in the frame of the World Bank \u2019s EIC project) with the total disbursed amount of USD 1 million (33 grantees which later attracted external investments of USD 13 million); \u2022 Innovation matching grants (supported by the EU-funded SMEDA project) with a total budget of EUR 750,000 (30 grantees in the first round of competition); \u2022 Innovation matching grants (supported by World Bank and SMEDA project). As can be seen, the implementation of such grant schemes largely depends on the availability of donor funding. ",
        "42 4 R&D PERFORMERS 4.1 Higher Education Institutions Armenia has a well-established system of tertiary education that encompasses 22 state universities, 37 private universities, four universities established under intergovernmental agreements and nine branches of foreign universities. Universities in Armenia have a high degree of autonomy in formulating curricula and setting tuition fees. With only a few exceptions, universities tend to focus almost exclusively on teaching and do not engage in, or encourage, research by staff. In the 2016/2017 academic year, the total number of faculties in State universities comprised 17,517 \u2013 out of which 945 (5% of the total) have a doctoral decree. There are no statistics on their engagement in research activities. The Government established the Competitive Innovation Fund (CIF) to modernise and enhance the financial system through integrating effective principles and mechanisms for funding the various institutions. The CIF acts as a policy mechanism triggering innovation and advances in higher education through competitively issued grants. During the period 2013-2018, 15 universities implemented 22 grant projects worth a total budget of EUR 7.6 million. Half of the projects were collaborations with private local companies. The last round of the grant allocation is planned in 2019. The activities on mainstreaming the CIF will be continued under the framework of the World Bank\u2019s new Education Improvement Project, however, after 2019, the future operations of the CIF remain unclear. Out of Armenia\u2019s universities, Yerevan State University topped the list of organisations involved in State science programmes in 2017 (5.8% of budget) followed by Armenian National Agrarian University (about 2%). State Medical University, National University of Architecture and Construction, and National Polytechnic University are in the second tier, receiving about 1% of the State budget each year. 4.2 Public Research Institutes Over the last three decades, research activity has fallen significantly. It is estimated that the number of scientists dropped from 25,344 in 1991 to about 5,000-6,000 24 currently, while the number of research institutes fell from 124 to 83 over the same period. The National Academy of Science (NAS) has 35 research institutes and scientific centres in five main disciplines: mathematical and technical sciences; physics and astrophysics; natural sciences; chemistry and earth sciences; and Armenology and social sciences. Aside from the NAS system, 47 institutes come under the the remit of the State, and the rest are private. 24 The range: SCS data and official statistics. ",

Private research institutes and scientific agencies absorb about 18% of the science budget. 4.3 Business Enterprise Sector There are no official statistics on business expenditure on R&D. However, expert opinion tends to conclude that most business R&D is done by foreign companies (MNCs) along with a few larger domestic firms (e.g. in mining, IT or precision engineering). A group of successful Armenian start-ups have emerged in the IT industry, such as Picsart which attracted USD 35 million in capital (including from Sequoia). Betconstruct is another start-up with Armenian origins takin gon global markets with its award-winning technology and services for online and land-based gaming. Large-scale acquisitions in the industry include that by Monitis (acquired by GFI Software in 2011), VMWare (acquired Integrien for around USD 100 million), and Oracle (acquired LiveLook aimed at becoming a regional R&D hub). The industry has attracted certain global brands such as Synopsis, which located a considerable part of its R&D functions in Armenia. Foreign enterprises comprise 35% of all of the company\u2019s operation in the field of ICT , leading to a high degree of internationalisation and significant exports. Along with the IT industry, engineering and especially the precision engineering industry has seen strong progress in recent years. The industry is still nascent (about USD 25 million in 2015) compared to the IT industry, but the presence and successful operations of global firms, such as National Instruments and IBM, indicate the positive growth prospects, encouraged by the State \u2019s forward-looking ",

This is partly explained by historical legacy. However, Armenians publish much fewer scientific publications in computer science (H-index of 15). This can be explained by the fact that the best human resources in computer science are deployed in industry due to a significant wage differential.

Figure 34: Company spending on R&D vs. university-industry collaboration on R&D, 2018 Source: World Economic Forum, Competitiveness Rankings 2018 Another critical challenge to Armenia\u2019s scientific landscape is the poor connection between scientific pursuit and the real needs and problems faced by businesses in domestic and global economies. Conservative research agendas based on the personal scientific interests of institutional heads, lack of cutting-edge topics, and lack of vision for solving business problems are major hurdles to progress. However, positive trends can be observed in the software, microelectronics, and engineering solutions sector in the form of intensifying R&D activities and capabilities in newly developing technologies. A group of companies \u2013 branches of multinationals \u2013 performs deep science-based R&D and develops corresponding capabilities. For example, Synopsis spends about 10% of the company\u2019s total spend on R&D through their Armenian subsidiary, has mentored 42 PhD students so far, and filed many patents based on research by Armenian engineers.

        "15 6 HUMAN RESOURCES 6.1 Education Overview Of The Armenian Population The education level in Armenia is comparatively high. Primary school enrolment covers all children, and this ensures a literacy rate of 100%. Gross enrolment to tertiary education was 52.2% in 2017 (UNESCO data). 29 However, the vocational training system is not well developed and the transition from school to employment represents a challenge for school graduates. International donors are currently implementing actions to foster vocational education and training in order to overcome this weakness. Education in general \u2013 and higher education in particular \u2013 is well perceived by families and society. The higher education system (university education) in Armenia still profits from the scientific and technical heritage of the Soviet period. However, various studies 30 report an erosion of the technical basis in higher education. More people are studying softer subjects and the standard of teaching in the natural sciences is deteriorating. Both the quality and the number of technical scientists is at risk, which will ultimately have an impact on Armenia\u2019s innovation potential. The Government has prioritised education as a major development challenge and a reform of the education system is thus high on the policy agenda. A number of initiatives exist to promote scientific and technical education. The ICT sector is a good example. Since 2008, the Union of Information Technologies Enterprises in Armenia 31 has been running the Armrobotics Programme. Armrobotics organises after-school activities in secondary schools, including modules such as design and testing of robots, research and learning projects. 32 Funding of education Armenia\u2019s higher education system struggles with efficiency and quality due to weak governance and problems with the funding system. Armenia\u2019s government expenditure on education was 2.3% of GDP in 2017 (AMD 128 billion) and only 0.22% was spent on higher education. The new Armenian government is planning to spend AMD 139 billion on education in 2019. 33 29 World Bank\u2019s WDI Online Database 30 EU SMEDA, ACR 2010, 2017 31 See: http://uite.org/index.php?lang=en 32 (Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Armenia, 2015), p.12 33 Government budget of RA 2019 ",

The majority of basic school graduates continue education in high school, while only 13% of them drop out. From 2018 onward, the law states that all basic school graduates have to continue their education either in high school, preliminary or middle vocational institutions.

Some 22 of the them are State-run universities. A comparison of the number of students with the quantity of higher educational institutions indicates a degree of fragmentation and below par performance by many educational institutions, especially privately-run establishments. In total, there were 81,600 (2016/2017) students enrolled (88% in State universities and only 11% in private ones). More than half (53.8%) of the enrolled students were women.

In terms of staff working in \u2018R&D institutions\u2019, a total of nearly 4,133 people were employed in R&D in 2017, and 85% were classified as research-specialists with a higher education degree (495 \u2018Doctors of Science\u2019 and 1 ,553 \u2018 Candidates of Science \u2019 which is equivalent to a PhD).

Similar to many other post-Soviet countries, Armenia has seen a significant drop in the number of people with a Doctorate among younger groups: 30-39 year- olds (105 PhDs); 45-49 year-olds (78 PhDs); and 65-69 year-olds (211 PhDs). This demographic hole in the scientific community is a result of the transition period in the 1990s when the Soviet \u2018science system\u2019 collapsed and the amount of resources committed to science and technology sharply decreased. The once- prestigious professions of scientist and engineer became marginalised as both career opportunities and remuneration diminished. Many scientists emigrated, while others changed professions to pursue careers in commercially more attractive areas. Thriving scientific institutions became ghost buildings or were used for commercial purposes. As a result, entire scientific schools, knowledge, and technologies were lost. However, as new technologies gradually proliferated and globalisation brought new opportunities, scientific and engineering knowledge became in demand once again. International collaborative projects started to provide more attractive professional opportunities for young researchers. This launched a gradual, positive trend in the interest in science and technologies, leading to a trickle of new blood into the system. ",

The breakdown of researchers by field of science provides further insight into scientific specialisation, with natural sciences dominating (54.2% of total, with biology and psychology alone accounting for 16.5% of total researchers and technical sciences with 15.4% of total researchers), followed by humanities (including presumably Armenology) with 14.3%.

The share of researchers in agricultural sciences, medical and social sciences deviate somewhat from the respective share in the science budget. The differences may be due to relative staff costs (e.g. respective share of PhD holders) although it is not possible to be sure based on the available data. Student and (post)graduate numbers by scientific field 35 also provide insight into current priorities and future potential for specialisation in certain technologies and sectors. Bachelor \u2019 s and Master \u2019s level studies are dominated by social sciences (close to 80% of Bachelor \u2019s and 70% of Master \u2019s level graduates in 2016).

The quality and availability of scientific (research) infrastructure is equally diverse with, on the one hand, buildings and research equipment that need to be renovated to meet modern requirements; and, on the other hand, facilities that operate at an internationally comparable level. The Armenian National Engineering Laboratory\u2019s (ANEL) infrastructural endowment and equipment, for example, seems to be sufficient for the tasks at hand. In addition, the accelerator project CANDLE (Centre for the Advancement of Natural Discoveries using Light Emission) at the Synchrotron Research Institute is an example of an ambition to upgrade Armenia\u2019s research infrastructure to be at the \u2018technological frontier\u2019. 35 Source: NSS, www.armstat.am ",

Launched in March 2008, it was the largest regional research network project launched and aimed to provide a sharp increase in the internet capabilities of research networks. It was based on the NATO\u2019s project \u2018 The Virtual Silk Highway \u2019 . BSI aimed to build a proper regional research and education network among South Caucasus and connect it to G\u00c9ANT2, integrating South Caucasus scientific potential to Europe and fostering collaboration between homogenous scientific communities. 37 The Institute for Physical Research of National Academy of Sciences of Armenia has been actively involved in over 40 international grant programmes within the last five years, including FP7, ISTC, INTAS, CRDF, NFSAT, Volkswagen, ANSEF and SCOPES. Currently, they have bilateral collaborations with France, Germany, USA, Italy, UK, Russia, Latvia, Bulgaria, Poland, Japan, Spain, Australia, Switzerland, Croatia, Canada, Taiwan, Greece and others. In particular, the CNRS LIA (French-Armenian International Associated Laboratory) has proved an especially fruitful international collaboration for Armenia (20 January 2009). Within the framework of the project, the target areas were particularly physics, chemistry, mathematics, humanities and social sciences. 38 Armenia actively cooperates with Russia. On 25 March 2005 , Armenia\u2019s Science Committee and the Russian Foundation for Fundamental Research signed a collaboration agreement. Armenia also has some joint laboratories with Russia, such as a joint laboratory \u2018X - rays optics\u2019 between the Institute of Applied Problems of Physics and Tomsk Polytechnic University, a joint lab between the Institute of Applied Problems of Physics and Kurchatov Institute (Moscow), and an international laboratory \u2018 Optics of photons and elemental particles \u2019 between the Republic of Armenia and Belgorod State National Research University. On 28 March 2018, during the meeting between Armenia\u2019s Science Committee and the Russian Foundation for Fundamental Research, another programme promoting cooperation between young researchers and scientists was planned.

        "28 7 FRAMEWORK CONDITIONS FOR R&I 7.1 General Policy Environment For Business Innovation can be hampered by barriers to entrepreneurial activity, access to finance or gaps in infrastructure (transport, logistics, digital networks, energy supply, etc.). Armenia has made progress in improving its business environment, but remains well below neighbouring Georgia in the World Bank\u2019s doing business (DB) survey. 40 Armenia\u2019s DB rank is 41 st among 190 countries with the ease of DB score 75.37, while Georgia ranked 6 th with 83.28 score. Armenia stands a bit above compared to the regional average of Europe and Central Asia at 72.34. Armenia\u2019s ease of DB score increased by 6.1% during the past four years, which indicates that the business environment has a developing pattern. Figure 39: Ease of doing business score, 2016-2019 Source: Doing Business, World Bank 2019 Armenia\u2019s rank is quite high in terms of how easy it is to start a business (8 th with a score of 96.21) and in the region trails only Georgia (ranked 2 nd with the score of 99.34). 40 Doing Business, World Bank 2019 70.95 72.44 73.31 75.3 2016 2017 2018 2019 ",
        "29 Figure 40 : Armenia\u2019s rankings on doing business topics Source: Doing Business, World Bank 2019 Weaker points appear to be the insolvency procedures, dealing with construction permits and protecting minority investors. Although improvements have been made to key infrastructure in recent years, there remain gaps in rural roads, water supply and sewage in rural areas as well as in energy supply. Further development and upgrading of the infrastructure is hampered by public budget constraints as well as by the need to maintain high defence expenditure. Although these basic infrastructures are not directly connected to the innovation support system, incomplete or inefficient transport, energy, water, etc. infrastructure impedes businesses from implementing an effective innovation process. In this respect, Armenia performs poorly on internationally comparable resource efficiency indicators, 41 suggesting a need for greater attention to \u2018eco - innovation\u2019 42 , including measures to ensure businesses are applying relevant waste minimising, energy and water efficient technologies 43 . 41 See for instance : https://epi.envirocenter.yale.edu/epi-country-report/ARM 42 Defined as any form of innovation aiming at significant and demonstrable progress towards the goal of sustainable development. This can be achieved either by reducing the environmental impact or achieving more efficient and responsible use of resources.

        "30 In terms of transport and logistics, however, the new international airport at Yerevan meets modern requirements, yet international connections and schedules are not optimal (from either a business or tourism perspective). Rail (passenger and freight) networks are sub-optimal and investment is required in both upgrading the network and management of services. 44 The connectivity factor is of utmost importance for a land-locked country with the added complication of several \u2018closed borders\u2019 with neighbours. Th e result is a poor relative logistics performance that hampers both existing businesses and technology start-ups in developing exports and strategic partnerships. Access to high quality (and affordable) digital infrastructure and services is an increasingly important pre-condition for doing business and for supporting the emergence and uptake of digital technologies. Armenia\u2019s position in international rankings on key digital economy indicators, while broadly acceptable (ACR 2017), could be improved 45 \u2013 particularly given the emphasis on an innovative ICT sector underpinning the related digital strategy. On a number of levels, Armenia can be considered as the regional leader in terms of banking regulation and finance. The central bank has worked to put in place a relatively modern and efficient banking sector. However, Armenia\u2019s banking sector remains relatively fragmented and high interest rates and weak corporate transparency hold back private investment in the economy (ACR 2014). This situation will certainly constrain investment in technology upgrading, which depends on access to bank credits. In terms of risk-capital financing aimed at \u2018high - potential\u2019 companies, despite the establishment of the first Armenian venture capital fund (Granatus Ventures) in 2013 and several investment initiatives for start-up companies, pre-seed funding remains limited and Armenia ranks 79 th in the world. There have been efforts to kick start a \u2018Fintech\u2019 ecosystem in Armenia, such as a \u2018 h ackathon\u2019 organi sed in 2016 by Microsoft Armenia in cooperation with Central Bank of Armenia and NASDAQ OMX Armenia. In terms of competitiveness, Armenia ranked 70 th in 2018 with a score of 59.9 (out of maximum 100), a slight improvement on 2017 \u2019s score (58.9) 46 and ranking (72 nd ). 44 See: https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/28298/armenia-transport- outlook.pdf 45 See for instance: https://www.internetsociety.org/map/global-internet-report/ 46 The Global Competitiveness Report, WEF, 2018 ",

        "32 Incubator Foundation will be responsible for operational coordination of this project. In Yerevan, there are also two private technoparks providing infrastructure and respective services to start-ups and international ICT enterprises. Viasphere Technopark is a commercial technopark operational since 2000. It includes several US-based subsidiaries developing information and communications technologies, while providing infrastructure for local ICT start- ups. It provides not just the physical premises, but also services from incubation through growth and management of technology companies, management and training, and international linkages. Free Economic Zones (FEZs) are another instrument to support the development of more innovative businesses, in a general sense. They aim to encourage FDI, develop new and advanced technologies, export promotion, employment creation and economic growth. Armenia\u2019s first FEZ opened in July 2013, as a joint initiative of the Yerevan Computer Research and Development Institute (YCRDI) (27,000 square metres of office space in the centre of Yerevan, suitable for R&D centres and laboratories); and the Mars manufacturing company (56,000 square metres of space for manufacturing and 11,000 for office space). Sitronics Armenia has invested USD 6 million in FEZ infrastructures notably the \u2018 Alliance \u2019 FEZ specialised in innovative technologies in electronics, precision engineering, and IT. The \u2018 Meridian \u2019 FEZ focuses on diamond cutting, watch and jewellery making. The Tumo Centre for Creative Technology is a free innovative after-school learning initiative for teenagers aged 12-18. The objective is to enhance youngsters\u2019 horizons and make available the necessary resources to realise their creative potential by helping unleash talents and gain competitive skills. Students advance their knowledge and skills in four main areas: animation, game development, web development and digital media. At the end of the two-year course, students undertake a challenging project in one of the focus areas. Microsoft Innovation Centre was launched in 2011, by the combined efforts of USAID, Microsoft Corporation and Enterprise Incubator Foundation. This was originally established in an attempt to improve skills and training in the workforce, and to train and certify local companies. However, it has become one of the most successful of Microsoft\u2019s centres in Central and Eastern Europe, already with around 10 start-ups, and a high level of Armenian participation in Microsoft\u2019s Imagine Cup, which is a student technology competition bringing together young technology specialists from around the world to generate solutions to key global challenges. IBM Innovative Solutions and Technologies Centre (ISTC), is a solid example of oublic-private partnership (PPP) in ICT innovation as a joint project between IBM, the Armenian Government and USAID (as resource partners) with the Enterprise Incubator Foundation as implementation partner. The aim of the Centre is to develop the educational capacity of Armenian HEIs in IT/high-tech, enhance their research potential, while creating a favorable environment for business formation. The ISTC is located at Yerevan State University. However, all ",
        "33 the resources are available for the faculty members and students of all Armenian universities and the private sector. ISTC focuses on two main activities: \u2022 Enhancement of IT education and R&D , which includes upgrading the curricula of Armenian HEIs, collaboration between local and US tech universities and R&D promotion and commercialisation. \u2022 Business aggregator , which involves helping Armenia\u2019s technical and managerial workforce to form viable teams by providing mentorship and access to financing, development and provision of customised software solutions for SMEs, and promotion of local technology products in global markets. The Engineering City, now under construction with a total budget of USD 20 million, is located on a 3 hectare area in Jrvezh, which will work with support from the Armenian Ministry of Economy, Enterprise Incubator Foundation Director, and National Instruments Armenia. The Engineering City will have exclusive laboratories with equipment worth several hundred thousand dollars. The equipment will be used by several companies. Around 30-35 companies will have individual buildings and nearly 50 will be able to develop their activities. The Convergence Centre for Engineering and Applied Science is a proposed PPP between a donor organisation, Armenian educational institutions and IT companies. It is aimed at significantly increasing the number and quality of Armenian engineers and technology professionals, and raising the quality of technology education in universities. The Convergence Centre is made up of: (1) a Shared Hub offering hands-on workshops, project-based instruction and applied research facilities, surrounded by (2) academic modules run by partner universities and companies, offering instruction in specific IT disciplines with coordinated access to the Shared Hub, and closely coupled with (3) small offices and incubator facilities offering low-cost space and venture acceleration services to start-ups and small technology companies. The Centre also has cafes, a gym, etc. that will allow it to become a functioning ecosystem. The lead initiator of the project is the TUMO Centre for Creative Technologies. Diaspora led networks The Foundation for Armenian Science and Technology (FAST), launched in 2016, aims at building an ecosystem that drives technological innovation and scientific advancement in Armenia and beyond. FAST intends to mobilise the scientific, technological, and financial resources of Armenian and international communities. FAST initiated the Science and Technology Angels Network (STAN) which started operating in February 2018. This initiative unites 18 investors and entrepreneurs of Armenian descent and from other countries who will not only provide Armenian start-ups financing and consulting, but also mentor them and help them establish business ties. ArmTech is a non-profit global network and recurring event officially adopted by the Republic of Armenia as its global high-tech industry platform. Conceived under the theme of \u2018 learning from the past and inventing the future \u2019 , it is ",
        "34 dedicated to further the success of Armenia\u2019s high -tech industry in a dynamic global free-market economy. Every year, the ArmTech Congress attracts industry professionals, high-level executives and interested parties from all over the world who get together to improve communications and cooperation with and within the Armenian high-tech industry. ArmTech Congress provides an opportunity to obtain business and professional information, and to connect with top industry representatives, government officials, major players in the financial and services sectors, and leading academics from Armenia, the US, Russia, European Union, CIS countries, the MENA region, and South-East Asia to strengthen cooperation and identify new partnership and investment opportunities. ARPA Institute is a non-profit tax-exempt organisation established in 1992 in Los Angeles, California. The principal objective of ARPA is to promote international cooperation and understanding within the world community through the provision of consulting, analysis, research and planning services in education, economics, policy, health and technology between the Republic of Armenia and the USA. The Armenian Engineers and Scientists of America, Inc. (AESA) is a non- partisan and non-sectarian philanthropic organisation focused primarily on addressing the professional, technical and scientific needs of fellow Armenians throughout the world. 7.3 Knowledge Markets And Science-Business Relations Patenting activity Figure 42 compares Armenia with benchmark countries in terms of the numbers of patents and growth dynamics in the period 2012-2016. Data from WDI indicates that Armenian researchers are less active in patenting. Negative CAGR shows that patenting has a decreasing tendency during that period. Among the reasons could be a low patentability of the majority of research, indicating its more fundamental nature rather than applied or technological nature. Another reason might be the lack of practice, incentives and culture of patenting. ",

The strength of any ecosystem depends on the intensity of both types of outputs which are closely related. In the context of this report\u2019s framework, commercial output includes products and services based on the application of advanced technologies as well as fees and royalties received due to technology transfer. One of the key measures of the level of commercial output produced by a country is the share of high-tech exports in total merchandise export. 292 168 198 0 109 141 139 69 12 8 10 1 4 6 10 3 304 176 208 1 113 147 149 72 National applicants Foreign applicants Total ",

The increase of this indicator closely correlates to the success of the technology- enabled transformation of the country\u2019s economy, and as such is one of the key performance indicators. 47 As for the export of high-tech services, no direct international data exists. According to EIF estimates, Armenia\u2019s export of IT services reached about EUR 301.6 million, accounting for 50% of software and services total output. This high percentage denotes the increasing role of IT in Armenia\u2019s exports and economy at large. An important aspect of Armenia\u2019s innovati on-based activities can be captured by measuring exports of creative and cultural services (Figure 46). Latvia and Estonia are among the top three with 1.3% and 1.5% shares, respectively. On the other hand, Azerbaijan is among the outliers with 0% of share. 47 A significant share of Armenia\u2019s high -tech exports is in services, and it needs to be factored in as an indicator for a more accurate estimation.

        "39 8 ARMENIA\u2019S INNOVATION CHALLENGES Armenia still produces globally competitive scientific research in different subject areas, but the transformation of scientific knowledge into commercial opportunities lags behind. Armenia has underinvested resources in building innovation and technology ecosystems in comparative terms. The operating efficiency of the system measured by ratio of the performance indicator relative to invested resources (including human, financial, and infrastructure) is high, but not sustainable in the long run. Strategic efficiency needs to take priority over operating efficiency. The former requires investing much larger resources in the emerging patterns of technological shifts. Armenia\u2019s enabling environment has yet to become largely conducive to technology development, innovation, and science-based development. There are important flaws and gaps, particularly in S&T and innovation policies as well as research capabilities in the areas that define the next technological revolution. The technology-enabled leap can be achieved only if those gaps and flaws are addressed quickly and efficiently. Armenian scientific and technological specialisation is undermined by a lack of critical mass of human and financial resources in selected key fields. This is due to fragmented research funding and an insufficient number of STEM graduates. Hard choices are required in terms of the focusing of limited government funding on selected scientific fields where Armenia can realistically \u2018excel\u2019. Business - education-research cooperation in selected advanced technology fields requires a long-term investment framework to generate real growth potential. While the current state of the Armenian science and innovation system is far from optimal, there are a number of positive developments that create a basis for science and innovation development in the country, in partcular: \u2022 Government programmes prioritising the high-tech sector; \u2022 Advancment in selected fields of science and relatively strong scientific output results; \u2022 Success in building a dynamic and internationally linked innovation ecosystem in ICT and, to some extent, engineering service sectors; \u2022 Networked and experienced diaspora in science, technology and business sectors; \u2022 Large-scale educational initiatives and positive attitude towards education.
