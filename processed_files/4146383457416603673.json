        "4 / European Institute for Gender Equality \u2014 Annual report 2013 Highlights of 2013 European Union House On 1 January, EIGE moved into its permanent premises. EIGE is now located in the very centre of Vilnius, in European Union House, sharing the space with the representation of the European Commission and the Information Office of the European Parliament. The new EU House will strengthen the visibility of the EU in Lithuania, will increase cost-effectiveness and create synergies. EIGE's Gender Equality Index In June 2013, EIGE officially launched the Gender Equality Index at the premises of the Council of the European Union in Brussels. It is the result of 3 years of work and of a long consultation process with many organisations and stakeholders. Despite 50 years of policies and actions at Euro- pean level, Member States have not managed to achieve gender equality. With an average score of 54.0 (where 1 stands for no gender equality and 100 for full gender equality), the European Union is only halfway towards a gender-equal society. EIGE\u2019s Resource and Documentation Centre At a dedicated event on 1 October, EIGE launched its specialised Resource and Docu- mentation Centre (RDC) during the Lithuanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The RDC consists of a physical and online library dedicated to resources on gen- der equality. An entry point situated at street level in the new premises, serves as a showcase for EIGE\u2019s publications and a space that can be used by different stakeholders for small events. The RDC provided access to more than 244 000 resources from all over the EU, including EIGE\u2019s own work. ",
        "Foreword by the Chair of the Management Board The year 2013 was truly memorable for the European Institute for Gender Equality. Not only did the Institute move into its new permanent offices in Euro- pean Union House in the heart of Vilnius, but it also established itself as an outstanding resource to support those working to achieve both de jure and de facto gender equality. This was first achieved thanks to the publication of the Gender Equality Index in June 2013. Scarcely three months later, the new Resource and Documentation Centre (RDC) was opened in Vilnius, and with a signifi- cant online presence, bringing together a treasure trove of resources to assist researchers and policymakers across Europe. The development of the Gender Equality Index has been one of the cen- tral tasks of EIGE since its inception. This new statistical tool is based on extensive collaboration among experts. It now allows the easy interpreta- tion of progress made by the individual Member States of the European Union towards the achievement of true gender equality. Given the com- plexity of gender equality, it was essential to develop a multidimensional tool. The new Gender Equality Index identifies six key domains, encom- passing the many facets of women\u2019s lives. The Index will continue as a live activity within EIGE\u2019s work programmes and we look forward to future work incorporating women\u2019s experience of the heinous crime of violence against women into the Index, while there will be further updates and refinements of the baseline data. The RDC provides an exciting and indispensable new service to policymakers, researchers and students of gender equality through its collection of data, tools, methodologies, good practice examples, books and other media on all aspects of gender equality. Like the Index, the RDC will continue to flourish and grow over the coming years, as it draws constantly from new data sources, in order to become Europe\u2019s optimal resource for expertise in gender equality. These outstanding achievements were complemented by a significant programme of ongoing work, developing new tools and methodologies; supporting the Presidencies of the Council of the European Union, including the Irish and Lithuanian Presidencies during 2013, through the review of progress at EU level on the implementation of the UN Beijing Platform for Action, the world\u2019s blueprint for gender equality, which underpins our collective work across Europe and the globe; gathering and sharing good practices; and fostering awareness of the key challenges which still exist and impact upon gender equality. Without the commitment and hard work of the Director, Ms Virginija Langbakk, and the full team of staff of EIGE, none of these goals and ambitions would have become realities. The year 2013 also brought changes in the composition of the Management Board, as nine Member States yielded their places on the Board to newcomers for the next three-year period. As one of those ",
        "newcomers, I should personally like to thank the former Chair and Vice Chair, Ms Eva Welskop-Deffaa and Mr Michel Pasteel, for their advice during the transition. I would particularly like to thank the Director, Ms Langbakk, and her team for the support they have shown both to me and to the new Board Members. As 2013 draws to a close, the European institutions and agencies are facing many of the financial challenges which have been experienced in many of the Member States in the past few years. We are collectively asked to achieve more with fewer resources. While this places a new burden on the teams working in the institutions and agencies, I am absolutely confident that EIGE team will continue to deliver to the highest standards in order to foster the advancement of gender equality. Those of us working in gender equality across Europe are already in full agreement on the importance of gender equality as an economic resource as well as a human right. We know that the achievement of de facto gender equality, including in economic engagement and decision-making, is essential if we are to maintain a thriving and sustainable EU economy with full employment and personal pros- perity in the future. We in EIGE \u2014 the Management Board, the Director, the team of staff and the Experts\u2019 Forum, together with the many contributors to the working groups and other collaborative forums \u2014 look forward to a further memorable year in 2014.

        "Foreword by the Director In the establishment history of the European Institute for Gender Equality the year 2013 celebrates several very special accomplishments position- ing our Institute at a level of development beyond its years. Proudly, we were able to share the fruits of our unyielding labour of our first three years in operation. I highlight three major achievements of 2013 that deserve a particular place of honour in EIGE\u2019s history that directly embody EIGE\u2019s mission: to become the European knowledge centre on gender equality issues in Europe. In January 2013 our office moved to new and centrally located premises in the uniquely developed European Union House. Located in this cost- effective set-up we benefit from active cooperation and synergies with the Representation of the European Commission and the Information Office of the European Parliament, and increased visibility in Lithuania. This innovative placement has proven quite advantageous, especially during the second semester, when Lithuania held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union by bringing to the Institute and its Resource and Documentation Centre (RDC) numerous visitors from the European Parliament and the Commission, and a large number of Euro- pean citizens. In June our highly qualified team of gender experts and statisticians behind the development of a complex and challenging three-year task successfully launched EIGE\u2019s pioneering Gender Equality Index for Europe. Decision-makers and practitioners will benefit from the capabilities of the Index as a tool, tailor-made for the European Union, which assesses and measures the progress made in bridging the gap between women and men. Every two years from its initial launch, through the Index EIGE will analyse the effectiveness of implemented policies in relation to the outcomes of EU policies on women and men. The doors of EIGE\u2019s RDC, including its online features and the physical library, opened in October. EIGE\u2019s RDC team gathered and made hundreds of thousands of resources on gender equality available online in a commendably short period. Not only can online visitors access a huge variety of digital resources, but local guests can also find our publications in our public ground floor Documentation Centre and upstairs in our specialised library. Another component of the RDC \u2014 EuroGender \u2014 is our virtual debate platform on gender equality, where practices and resources are shared. Equally significant is the rapidly growing and much-needed focus on the fight against gender-based violence. Our experts dedicated much diligence in developing three forward-looking reports in this area. The most noteworthy, released in March, focuses on female genital mutilation, and it was later complemented by a very well attended international conference held in Vienna, which has brought us several steps closer to eradicating gender-based violence in Europe. The year\u2019s achievements would not have seen the light of day without devoted members of staff who whole-heartedly believe in equality between women and men. Their solid and reliable level of expertise is greatly appreciated and valued. ",
        "Since commencement, EIGE has matured speedily, and this would not have been achieved without the guidance and support of our Management Board, and in particular the Chairs who shared the year, Mr Michel Pasteel and Ms Pauline Moreau, who took up this role in June, the representative of the European Commission, Mr Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea, and the members of the Standing Committee. The Experts\u2019 Forum, its working groups and our numerous supporters, among them external experts, deserve tribute for assisting us in the design and implementation of most of our 2013 achievements. The Institute would like to thank the European Commission\u2019s services in their entirety, and in particular Daniela Bankier and her team at DG Justice. This year was particularly exceptional for the European Institute for Gender Equality. We look forward to 2014 and the positive contribution we will make, supporting the EU in realising one of its funda- mental values.

        "European Institute for Gender Equality \u2014 Annual report 2013 / 9 What is the European Institute for Gender Equality ? The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) is a decentralised EU agency, an independent legal entity under European public law, estab- lished by Regulation (EC) No 1922/2006. EIGE was set up to become a specialised, solid and reliable European knowledge centre on gen- der equality issues, which brings unique added value for better-informed policymaking and raised awareness on the importance of advanc- ing gender equality in Europe. EIGE\u2019s founding act, Regulation EC No 1922/2006 (Article 2) assigns the Institute the following over- all objectives: \u2018\u2026to contribute to and strengthen the promotion of gender equality, including gender mainstream- ing in all Community policies and the resulting national policies; to contribute to the fight against discrimination based on sex; to raise EU citizens\u2019 awareness of gender equality by providing tech- nical assistance to the Community Institutions, in particular the Commission and the authorities of the Member States, as set out in Article 3 of the regulation establishing the European Institute for Gender Equality ( 1 ) .\u2019 The tasks assigned to EIGE are very specific and are not being addressed by any other EU body (such as the European Commission) or the Member States. How these tasks are realised is described in detail in EIGE\u2019s annual work programmes ( 2 ), which are adopted by its Management Board. Broader guidelines for the Institute\u2019s work are set out in its mid-term work programme.

In managing the day-to-day activities of the Institute, the Director works closely with and reports to the Institute\u2019s decision-making body, the Management Board. The Board consists of representatives of 18 Member States and one member representing the Commission ( 3 ) to secure the highest standards of competence and a broad range of relevant and transdisci- plinary expertise in the area of gender equality. Board Members are appointed for a three-year mandate and alternated in the same order as the rotating Presidencies of the Council of the European Union. In May 2011, due to the growing intensity and complexity of EIGE\u2019s operations, the Management Board established a subcommittee of the Board (Standing Committee) to assist the Institute and its Management Board in preparing strategic documents and facilitate administrative and budgetary decisions. On 1 June 2013, the Board\u2019s composition rotated, for the third formation, resulting in a change in membership of nine Member States as appointed by the Council of the European Union. The newly formed Board elected a Chair, Vice-Chair and Standing Committee members during its first meeting at the start of its third term. The Board issued, in agreement with the European Com- mission, the terms of reference for an external, independent evaluation of the Institute, which shall be implemented in 2014. The Experts\u2019 Forum consists of a nominated expert on gender equality designated by each Member State, together with three representa- tives appointed by the European Commission (European-level social partners and European- level non-governmental organisations) and two members appointed by the European Parlia- ment. The Experts\u2019 Forum is a mechanism for ( 3 ) While the Member States\u2019 representatives are appointed by the Council of the European Union on the basis of a proposal from the Member States concerned, the Commission appoints their member of the Management Board directly.

It ensures close cooperation between the Institute and the bod- ies in the Member States coordinating gender equality policy. EIGE\u2019s vision and mission Equality between women and men is both a fun- damental right and a common principle for the European Union, and mainstreaming the princi- ple of equality between women and men in all its activities is the agreed strategy for the European Union. The Institute\u2019s vision is: making equality between women and men a reality for all Europeans and beyond The Institute\u2019s mission is: to become the European knowledge centre on gender equality issues The Institute\u2019s legal and political framework is defined by the EU\u2019s firm conviction that equality between women and men is not only a funda- mental right, but is vital for the solidarity and indis- pensable development of European societies, in particular those facing present demographic and economic challenges. These principles and con- clusions are enshrined in a number of core docu- ments, such as the strategy for equality between women and men 2010\u201315, and the international commitments of the European Union, such as the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action ( 4 ). EIGE\u2019s mid-term work programme EIGE\u2019s first mid-term work programme (2010\u201312) focused on creating the administrative condi- tions, internal policies and rules, structures and systems that would enable the agency to deliver ( 4 ) In 1998, a decision was taken that the Council of the European Union would be responsible for providing information about the progress by the Member States in the area of gender equality in the critical areas of concern, as defined by the Beijing platform for Action. The Council would be also responsible for reviewing and evaluating this progress. expected results and act as a specialised, solid and reliable European knowledge centre on gender equality issues. Developing at high speed and with enthusiasm and commitment from staff, management and its stakeholders, EIGE did much more ( 5 ). EIGE has increased its capacity to provide reliable advice and has developed expertise on effective methods, tools and good practices to imple- ment gender equality policies. It has also set up mechanisms to collect and provide unified and comparable data on aspects of gender equality, to transfer this knowledge among Member States and to establish an institutional memory of policy options, good practices, methods and tools. In planning its second mid-term work pro- gramme 2013\u201315, and in line with the tasks set out in its founding regulation, the Institute sought to establish partnerships to strenghten its role as the centre of competence for gender equality knowledge and promoting gender equality. It also increased cooperation with institutions and bodies by sharing information about effective national policies and broadening the circle of beneficiaries of EIGE\u2019s work. EIGE crystallised its vision for its future work into two strategic objectives: \u2022 supporting better-informed policymaking at EU and Member States level; \u2022 increasing awareness among decision- makers and the public on progress and challenges in implementing European gender equality policies. EIGE\u2019s strategic objectives 2013\u201315 To support better-informed policymaking at EU and Member State levels, EIGE set out in 2013 to develop, for the benefit of policymakers, a harmo- nised, centralised source of reliable and compara- ble data with particular attention to information on gender-based violence. The database will also include the data collected during the review and update of the indicators of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action for Equality, Development ( 5 ) An overview of EIGE\u2019s reports and publications issued during the first years of EIGE can be found on EIGE\u2019s website.

To help improve the implementation of gender equality policies, EIGE will process and gradually make available effective tools, methods and good practices used for gender mainstreaming at EU and Member State levels. To contribute to raising awareness among deci- sion-makers and the public of progress made, and challenges in implementing European gender equality policies, the Institute organises and maintains the exchange and dissemin ation of knowledge on the functioning tools and meth- ods of gender equality work among the Mem- ber States, including enlargement countries and other stakeholders. The Institute\u2019s work is under- pinned by communication on gender equality research, findings and facts, presenting scientific and political trends with regard to gender equal- ity at EU and Member State levels. Cooperation with key stakeholders (the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Member States) is complemented by expanded contacts with national statistics offices ( 6 ), EU agencies, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the European social partners, research and information centres and European civil society organisations. EIGE\u2019s objectives in 2013 The past year was the first of EIGE\u2019s second mid- term work programme, and by the end of 2013 ( 6 ) The cooperation agreements with national statistical offices do not cover statistics covered by the statistical work programmes of the European Commission. EIGE achieved its planned objectives and com- pleted the development of the main tasks of its mandate: \u2022 the launch of the Gender Equality Index, offering users a broad range of indicators to measure progress on gender equality in Europe; \u2022 the roll-out of major functionalities of the RDC, gradually increasing users\u2019 access to a wide range of books, policy documents, grey literature and documentation on gender equality in Europe; \u2022 establishment of the online European Network for Gender Equality (EuroGender) platform, to facilitate the pooling of resources and increase awareness of the importance of gender equality for Europe. EIGE also initiated its work with the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), establishing contacts with candidate and potential candidate countries, and supported their efforts in building their capacity to prepare for their participation in EIGE\u2019s activities and EU membership. On gender-based violence, EIGE expanded its work in response to a request from the Com- mission including conducting the first study on female genital mutilation (FGM). EIGE\u2019s actions and results are detailed further down in this report. ",

In our fight against unemployment, improving job opportunities for women is a matter of fairness, but it is also good for society and good for the economy.\u2019 Herman Van Rompuy President of the European Council Halfway towards equality Equality between women and men is a funda- mental value of the European Union and is vital to its economic and social growth. To reach the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy for growth, address current economic and social challenges, secure social justice and achieve smart and sustainable development, it is acknowledged that gender equality must have a pivotal role in the political debate in Europe. The formula behind the Gender Equality Index. The need for a Gender Equality Index was ini- tially proposed by the European Commission in the roadmap for equality between women and men 2006\u201310 and subsequently included in the action plan of its strategy for equality between women and men 2010\u201315. EIGE undertook the task of constructing a composite indicator that reflects the multifaceted reality of gender equal- ity and is specifically tailored towards the policy framework of the EU. In June 2013, EIGE officially launched the Gender Equality Index in the premises of the Council of the European Union in Brussels. It is the result of three years of work and a long consultation pro- cess with many organisations and stakeholders. ",

Despite more than 50 years of gender equality pol- icy at EU level, the findings show that gender gaps are prevalent across the EU. With an average score of 54.0 ( Figure 2 ), the EU remains far from reaching its gender equality aim. The range across Member States, from 35.3 to 74.3, shows the broad scale of variation throughout the EU in the level of gender equality achieved overall. Nearly half of the Member States (13) are below the score of 50. Nevertheless, four countries \u2014 the Netherlands, Finland, Denmark and Sweden \u2014 are leading with scores between almost 70 and slightly above 74 out of 100. Figure 2. Scores of the Gender Equality Index by Member State ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT The Gender Equality Index is supplemented by six sub-indices at the domain level ( Table 3 ) and 12 sub-indices at the sub-domain level.

        "14 / European Institute for Gender Equality \u2014 Annual report 2013 Why a Gender Equality Index? \u2018I\u2019m very glad that EIGE has developed a Gender Equality Index. It enables each Member State to evaluate and compare amongst each other the progress they\u2019ve made in various fields of gender equality, as well as where progress is most needed. I hope this tool will be used extensively and that it will lead to better knowledge and, most importantly, to further progress in gender equality.\u2019 Mikael Gustafsson Chair of the Committee on Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality of the European Parliament The Gender Equality Index responds to the real need for a measuring instrument to determine the position of women and men in different aspects of life within the EU. UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE GENDER EQUALITY INDEX The Gender Equality Index: \u2022 is specifically tailored towards the EU gender equality policy framework and objectives; \u2022 adopts a gender equality approach instead of a women\u2019s empowerment approach; \u2022 relies on a more comprehensive framework of gender equality than other women\u2019s or gender equality indices; \u2022 measures gender gaps that are adjusted to levels of achievement, in order to ensure that gender gaps cannot be regarded positively where they point to an adverse situation for both women and men; \u2022 highlights gaps in data availability by identifying potential gender indicators, calling for harmonised, reliable data that is both disaggregated by sex and available for all Member States. Lowest level of gender equality is in decision-making The lowest score of the Gender Equality Index is in the area of power in political and economic decision-making, with an average score of only 38 at EU level. The greatest distance from gen- der equality is apparent in the representation of women and men on boards of the largest quoted companies, with an EU average score of only 23.3. Measures such as a quota system could improve gender equality in this area and lead to a positive effect on all other areas. Equal share of caring activities crucial to reaching the EU\u2019s employment target To reach the employment target set out in the 2020 growth strategy \u2014 at least 75 % employ- ment rate of the EU population aged 20\u201364 \u2014 the index shows that measures should be taken to improve gender equality in the time spent on unpaid caring and domestic activities. Women\u2019s participation in the labour market is limited because of their disproportionate involvement in caring roles. To ensure sustainable growth for Europe, it is important to ensure an equal share of hours spent on providing care between women and men. In parallel with creating new employment opportunities, it is crucial to improve childcare provision ( 7 ) and to intensify efforts to increase the involvement of fathers in childcare. Combating violence against women seriously hampered by data gaps EU institutions are committed to making the EU free from violence for all, but the Gender Equal- ity Index shows that there are no comparable sex-disaggregated data in this area at EU level. Because gender-based violence against women remains one of the most pervasive human rights violations of our time, one that is rooted in gen- der inequalities and reinforces them, the Gender ( 7 ) The \u2018Barcelona targets\u2019.

The different domains measured by the Gender Equality Index To provide more detailed data, the Index is sub- divided into six core domains ( work, money, knowledge, time, power, health ) and two sat- ellite domains ( intersecting inequalities and violence ). The satellite domains are related to the Index but cannot be included in the core Index because they measure an illustrative phenom- enon \u2014 that is, a phenomenon that only applies to a selected group of the population ( 8 ).

It is an important domain from a gender perspective, given the imperative to ensure better integration of work and family life for women and men. 22 Gender Equality Index \u2013 Main findings Figure 6. Scores of the Gender Equality Index by Member State in the domain of time, 2010 Women remain disproportionately responsible for care activities This domain reveals wide gender differences in time spent in care activities in the EU. Throughout all Member States, it is women who are disproportionally involved in caring activities, with extremely wide gen- der gaps between the time spent on caring and edu- cating children and grandchildren. As many as 41 % of women spent, on average in the EU in 2010, 1 hour or more on the care and education of children and/or grandchildren per day, compared with 25 % of men. Women are, throughout all Member States, also dis- proportionally responsible for cooking and housework \u2014 77 % of women compared to only 24 % of men, on average in the EU in 2010, were involved in cook- ing and housework every day for an hour or more. This translates into an average score of 45.5 out of 100, well below halfway towards gender equality. The Members States fare differently, from just 20.0 in Greece to 80.4 in Denmark. The unequal division of time extends to social activities Men were more likely than women, in all Member States but one, to participate in sporting, cultural or lei- sure activities on a regular basis. In 2010, on average in the EU, only 9 % of women were involved in sport- ing, cultural or leisure activities at least every other day compared with 12 % of men. The situation was more divided when it came to involvement in volun- tary or charitable activities with, on average in the EU in 2010, 15 % of women and 14 % of men involved in a voluntary or charitable activity at least once a month. Although inexistent in some Member States, in others gender gaps were evident towards both women and men.

Gender Equality Index \u2013 Main findings 25 Figure 7. Scores of the Gender Equality Index by Member State in the domain of power, 2010 Low levels of gender equality in political decision-making In political decision-making, the representation of women is very low, despite the strong policy focus in this area at EU level and in wider international frame- works (Beijing Platform for Action, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women). Women, on average in the EU in 2010, rep- resented 25 % of ministers, 23 % of members of par- liaments and 30 % of members of regional assemblies. This produces, on average in the EU, a score of 49.9 out of 100, ranging from 15.1 in Hungary to 91.5 in Sweden.

Women are greatly under-represented among board members of the largest quoted compa- nies (12 % on average in the EU in 2010) and among members of central banks (18 % on average in the EU in 2010) in the vast majority of Member States. This sub-domain is the one that bears the lowest score of the Gender Equality Index, 29 out of 100. The variability across Members States is high and ranges from almost 5 out of 100 in Cyprus and Luxembourg to 60.3 out of 100 in Sweden. This is an important finding, given the launch by the European Commission in 2011 of the \u2018Women on the board pledge for Europe\u2019 \u2014 a call on publicly listed companies in Europe to sign a volun- tary commitment to increase women\u2019s presence on corporate boards to 30 % by 2015 and 40 % by 2020, by means of actively recruiting qualified women to replace outgoing male members.

It is an agenda for women\u2019s empowerment that reaffirms the fundamental principle whereby the human rights of women and girls are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. Since 2011, EIGE has been supporting the Member States during their Presidency in monitoring the follow-up of the implementation of the BPfA in the EU. THE STRATEGY FOR EQUALITY BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN, 2010\u20132015 ( 10 ) \u2018The Institute will help the Commission and the Member States to report on the EU-level indicators established under the Beijing Platform for Action in areas of particular concern and to develop further indicators where needed (such as on women and the environment).\u2019 The Institute commissions studies and produces reports with recommendations to improve the implementation of the strategic object ives of the BPfA in the selected areas in the EU; maintains and regularly updates a database of agreed Bei- jing indicators and data at EU and Member State levels; and collects examples of good practice on specific topics. In its work during 2013, the Insti- tute was supported by Ireland and Lithuania, the European Commission and its High-Level Group on Gender Mainstreaming and EIGE\u2019s Working Group on Beijing Indicators. In 2013 the Institute published two reports ( 11 ) in support of the Presidencies of the Council of the European Union: ( 10 ) Actions to implement the strategy for equality between women and men 2010\u201315, accompanying the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee of the Regions \u2014 COM(2010) 491.

The European Parliament resolution on the fol- low-up to the BPfA (2000/2020(INI)) underlined the need for a more gender-balanced participa- tion in all decision-making levels in the media sector and therefore encouraged media organi- sations to take initiatives to attract more women journalists. The 2012 legislative proposal of the European Commission for a directive on improv- ing the gender balance among non-executive directors of companies listed on stock exchanges and related measures will potentially have an impact on the media sector.

Policies to promote gender equality in media organisations EIGE\u2019s report addressed women\u2019s participation in and access to expression and decision-making in media by analysing the proportion of women and men in decision-making posts in media organisations, both public and private, the gen- der composition of their boards and the existence of internal policies to promote gender equality in organisations. The research analysed the extent to which these media organisations have developed gender equality policies, monitoring mechanisms and specific initiatives to support women\u2019s career development. KEY FINDINGS ( 13 ) Persistent gender inequalities in the media sector In spite of an increasingly favourable European legal and policy framework for the advancement of women, the overall progress of gender equal- ity in the media sector is slow. The media sector continues to be male dominated despite the fact that women make up nearly half the workforce and account for more than half of tertiary level graduates in media-related courses. Persistent patterns of inequality in the form of under-representation, barriers to the advance- ment of women and a persistent gender pay gap remain still firmly embedded within the media sec- tor. Women and men continue to be segregated by functions at different levels of importance and/ or prestige (e.g. magazines vs newspapers), roles requiring different skills and competences (e.g. low representation in technical areas).

        "20 / European Institute for Gender Equality \u2014 Annual report 2013 Low representation of women in decision- making in media organisations The study found that the proportion of women involved in top-level decision-making in media organisations is still extremely low. This discrep- ancy reinforces the prevailing gender inequality and exemplifies a waste of highly qualified and skilled human resources. In media organisations across all management levels, women constitute around one third (32 %) of senior staff in decision-making positions. The number of women increases at lower levels of decision-making: at strategic level (chief executive officer) women occupy a mere 16 % of positions, while at the lower operational level the propor- tion of women reaches 33 %. Women Women Women Total (All levels) Operational (Level 2-4) Strategic (Level 1) Men Men Men 32 % 68 % 16 % 84 % 33 % 67 % Source: Data from 96 media organisations in the 27 EU Member States, collected from July to September 2012. On boards, women comprise just 25 % of the positions analysed in the media organisations in the EU. Women are better represented on the boards of public service broadcasters (29 %) than in private media organisations (21 %). Internal policies on gender equality are still rare in media organisations EIGE\u2019s research found that organisations that implement gender equality policies and meas- ures are more likely to have a higher proportion of women in strategic decision-making positions. Institutional mechanisms for the advancement of gender equality The second semester of 2013 also marked the first Lithuanian Presidency of the Council of the Euro- pean Union. It chose to review the BPfA indicators for area H on institutional mechanisms for gender equality in the EU Member States at national/fed- eral level. The review aimed to address the effect- iveness of institutional mechanisms in the EU Member States in order to progress more quickly towards de facto gender equality. Institutional mechanisms for the advancement of women represent one of the key areas of concern of the BPfA. They are crucial for the advancement of gender equality in all other areas addressed by the Platform of Action. In 2009, the EPSCO Council emphasised the need to enhance the status of the national bod- ies for the promotion of gender equality in order to bring gender equality to the forefront. The Council also stressed that the conditions neces- sary for an effective national institutional struc- ture for gender equality are that it is located at the highest possible level in the government, involves civil society organisations, can draw from sufficient resources and has the possibility to influence the development of all government policies. The European Commission\u2019s strategy for equality between women and men 2010\u201315 also highlights the need to take gender equality into account in all EU and national policies and implement gender mainstreaming as an integral part of policymaking, including through impact assessment and evaluation processes. EIGE\u2019s report ( 14 ) reviewed the progress made by the Member States in the period 2005\u201312 concerning institutional mechanisms for gender equality, including gender mainstreaming. The report builds on the conceptual and methodo- logical framework laid by the Finnish Presidency in 2006.

The EPSCO Council took note of the four indicators reviewed by EIGE, including a new indicator on the production and dissemina- tion of statistics disaggregated by sex. EU-LEVEL INDICATORS ON INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS Indicator 1. Status of the governmental body responsible for promoting gender equality Indicator 2a. Personnel resources of the governmental gender equality body Indicator 2b. Personnel resources of the designated body or bodies for the promotion of equal treatment of women and men Indicator 3. Gender mainstreaming Indicator 4 (new). Production and dissemi- nation of statistics disaggregated by sex KEY FINDINGS ( 15 ) The number of tasks assigned to the governmen- tal gender equality structures has been increasing, while resources and the status of governmental responsibility have stayed at the same level or decreased. Governmental bodies for gender equality and bodies for the promotion of equal treatment on various grounds exist in all Member States. ( 15 ) Detailed conclusions can be found in the report itself and the main findings document. These can be consulted via EIGE\u2019s website or found as referenced in this document. Notwithstanding positive trends in institutional settings over the last decade, the bodies respon- sible for gender equality are often marginalised in national governmental structures; split into dif- ferent policy areas; hampered by complex and expanding mandates; lack adequate staff, train- ing, data and sufficient resources; and experience insufficient support from political leadership. The number of independent bodies for the promotion of equal treatment between women and men more than halved in 2012 compared to 2005 The independent bodies for protection against discrimination on the grounds of sex are increas- ingly replaced by bodies for protection against discrimination on various grounds. Whereas acknowledging the heterogeneity of women and men in terms of age, class, disability, ethnicity/ race and sexual orientation is highly important, the consequences of downplaying gender as a structural dimension and underlying element of all inequalities cannot be ignored. Despite a slight improvement in the application of gender mainstreaming tools and methods, key methods are not institutionalised The analysis of gender mainstreaming methods and tools, such as training and capacity building, gender impact assessment, gender budgeting, and monitoring and evaluation, demonstrates that institutionalisation of gender mainstreaming proves to be weak because of the unclear or weak legal or administrative mandates to apply gen- der mainstreaming. Gender impact assessment is rare or not used at all in the majority of Member States, and is either an unknown concept or is still at an initial stage of application. Gender budget- ing has become a legal obligation in only eight Member States, out of which gender budgeting is widely used by the ministries in just three coun- tries. Comparatively few Member States carry out regular training and capacity building on gender equality, mostly for the employees of the govern- mental gender equality body. ",
        "22 / European Institute for Gender Equality \u2014 Annual report 2013 The political, social and administrative remit of gender equality has started shifting towards legal and procedural mechanisms addressing discrimination at the individual level The third trend is connected with narrowing down the broad political gender equality remit to a legalistic approach. Gender equality is more seldom addressed and promoted through pol- icies and institutions that tackle gender gaps and the disadvantages of certain groups of women, and is more often viewed as a human right requir- ing legal measures to protect individual citizens against discrimination. When gender equality is embedded in a human rights framework, it loses power and strength to address structural inequal ities and discrimination at a societal level. This approach marginalises gender equality as a polit ical goal and undermines gender equality as an important policy area in itself.

The report produced by EIGE offers the EU and national policymakers reliable and comparable information on the scale of the phenomenon and the approaches taken by the Member States to protect and support girls and women who are victims of FGM and those at risk. The research revealed that data on the preva- lence of FGM in the EU-28 is not systematically collected. Eight EU Member States have under- taken prevalence estimates of women and girls at risk and victims of FGM. The findings also revealed that administrative records which could serve as a proxy indicator of the prevalence of FGM (medical, child protection, and asylum and pros- ecution records) are not systematically used, the existing data are not collated centrally and access to data is often restricted. Although some policies have been developed in the EU Member States to address FGM, coher- ent and comprehensive approaches are rare. Such strategies can be best implemented in the framework of a national action plan on FGM (NAP). Alternatively, addressing FGM within a broader strategy on violence against women or a strategy for gender equality can be recom- mended.

The EPSCO Council conclusions from December 2013, paragraph 26, call on the Mem- ber States to: \u2018\u2026 strengthen expertise in gender equality and gender mainstreaming among public officials across different sectors, including through the provision of gender equality training on a regular basis, taking into account the needs of partici- pants, for example, by including a training module on gender equality and gender mainstreaming within the general training structure of the public administration.\u2019 Assuring the quality of gender training The gender training project has initiated dialogue among policymakers, trainers and researchers on the use of gender training for better-informed policymaking in the EU and Member States. Quality assurance of the competence develop- ment programmes stood out among the issues of concern. Addressing the issue, EIGE commis- sioned an expert opinion and organised an online discussion on EuroGender. Following the results of the discussion EIGE prepared a draft of guid- ing principles for gender training to be consulted with the Member States in 2014.

Institutional capacity and effective methods for gender mainstreaming Complementary to EIGE\u2019s report on area H of the BPfA in the context of the Lithuanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, EIGE carried out in 2013 a review of the institutional capacity and effective methods for gender mainstream- ing, with a special focus on gender impact assess- ment. The European Commission\u2019s strategy for equality between women and men 2010\u201315 emphasises the importance of mainstreaming gender equal- ity as an integral part of policymaking, including through impact assessment and evaluation pro- cesses. While gender mainstreaming has been adopted in most countries as part of the strategies to achieve de facto equality, EIGE\u2019s study on insti- tutional mechanisms for gender equality for the Lithuanian presidency of the Council of the Euro- pean Union and other reliable sources ( 24 ) report that certain Member States are not implementing gender mainstreaming sufficiently well and that its quality is uneven. Building on EIGE\u2019s report of the progress made by EU Member States in the period 2005\u201312 on institutional mechanisms for gender equality and gender mainstreaming ( 25 ), this complementary study ( 26 ) assesses the insti- tutional capacity for mainstreaming gender and the use of gender impact assessment in the EU Member States.

        "28 / European Institute for Gender Equality \u2014 Annual report 2013 KEY FINDINGS The European Union, and notably the European Commission, has been a very important driver for the implementation of gender mainstreaming in the EU Member States An important share of gender mainstreaming actions in the Member States has been supported with external funds, often EU funds. The rationale for gender mainstreaming and gender equality actions in EU Member States reveals different types of values Gender mainstreaming has been adopted almost globally and is being implemented as a strategy towards realising gender equality. However, the interpretation of what gender equality means varies across contexts. The final goal of gender mainstreaming seems to be understood either as a way to avoid an unequal policy impact on women and men or to ensure gender-neutral policies, or rather to redress existing inequalities through policies wherever possible. A wide variety of institutional mechanisms (structures, arrangements and methods) for gender mainstreaming is in place in the EU Member States Institutional arrangements (laws, policies) are heavily influenced by legal cultures in Member States. Strong legal provisions are not often trans- lated into relevant actions for the promotion of gender equality and gender mainstreaming. And policy implementation frequently remains gen- der blind. Gender mainstreaming is deployed across countries through a relatively wide variety of methods. Sex-disaggregated data is the most common and gender analysis the least used method. The use of certain gender mainstream- ing methods does not necessarily imply a gender mainstreaming strategy in place. Gender equality is frequently \u2018added on\u2019 in ways that do not lead to structural change The involvement of stakeholders, namely women\u2019s organisations, the availability of resources and a structural understanding of gender inequalities are the drivers behind increasing mainstreaming of gender equality in most advanced countries. Learning from experience \u2014 good practices To make the best use of existing experiences, to benefit from lessons learnt and to tackle recog- nised common obstacles it is fundamental to sup- port the exchange of knowledge and information and strengthen networking among stakehold- ers. Between August 2012 and November 2013, within a study on collection of methods, tools and good practices in the field of women and the media, EIGE collected, analysed and processed data and information on gender training, aware- ness-raising, and self-regulation and monitoring. Following the priority area selected by the Lithu- anian Presidency, EIGE worked on mapping and understanding the implementation of gender impact assessment (GIA) and collecting and dis- seminating examples of GIAs in the EU. In 2013, EIGE collected good practices in the area of women\u2019s entrepreneurship and reconciliation of work, family and private life. All good practices collected by EIGE are inte- grated into a database, which currently contains information on the following areas: (combating) domestic violence; (the fight against) FGM; gen- der training; women and the media. Benefits of gender equality To pinpoint potential benefits of gender equality and to reflect on strategic approaches and meth- odologies used for conceptualisation and meas- uring of some of those benefits, at the end of 2013 EIGE commissioned four background papers. The conclusions from the input from experts served as ground for the discussions on possible directions of EIGE\u2019s work on the benefits of gender equality ",
        "European Institute for Gender Equality \u2014 Annual report 2013 / 29 in 2014. Seeking to deliver robust and credible evidence on which policymakers can make deci- sions, EIGE wants to better understand the cir- cumstances under which women\u2019s economic participation and empowerment enhances growth, as well as other positive dimensions of increased gender equality. Gender stereotypes Following on from work carried out in 2010\u201311 on collected narratives on gender perceptions in the 27 EU Member States, EIGE created an online database to ensure a wider dissemination of the study. The database ( 27 ) contains more than 500 real life stories from all around Europe. On the same topic EIGE also published a discus- sion paper, A policy response to gender perceptions , which is also available on the website.

        "30 / European Institute for Gender Equality \u2014 Annual report 2013 Your gateway to gender equality knowledge \u2018The first step in creating any effective policy is to know from where we start. The Institute plays a major role here by collecting, analysing and disseminating comparable and reliable information on gender equality. An important part of this will be the new RDC that we are launching today. We, in the Commission very much welcome its goal to make \u201cthe right gender equality knowledge available at the right time to the right actors\u201d\u2019. Commissioner M\u00e1ire Geoghegan-Quinn, 1 October 2013, opening speech for the RDC In October 2013, EIGE\u2019s Resource and Documen- tation Centre (RDC) entered a new phase and celebrated its formal opening with a conference at the EU level attended by policymakers, rep- resentatives from the Member States, academia, social partners and NGOs.

EIGE\u2019s RDC ( 28 ) first went online in November 2012 with 26 000 resources. Following the for- mal opening of EU House in May, EIGE made the resources that had been added in the previous year accessible online on 1 October 2013. EIGE\u2019s RDC now contains more than 244 000 records. It includes policy documents, grey literature, online resources, databases, books and articles on gender equality, with a particular focus on gender-based violence. The collection is avail- able through a new, intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to find the ne cessary information or resource. In scope, the RDC expanded from covering one thematic area ( 28 ) http://www.eige.europa.eu/rdc. (GBV) to five: GBV; gender and media; gender and climate change; work\u2013life balance; gender mainstreaming. A pilot project on the collection of grey literature in these areas took place in 2013 covering the following Member States: Belgium, Germany, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Austria and the United Kingdom. The majority of the resources are presented through abstracts in English and are available in English, French and German. At present it is possi- ble for users to search and access resources, many of them online, in more than 14 EU languages. ",

Networking with the media The main goals of the Institute\u2019s Journalist The- matic Network (JTN) are creating partnerships, exchanging information and good practices and giving advice. The network consists of media experts from national news agencies (PT, LV), large daily papers (ES, IE PL, CY), large online news portals (EE, LT) and other experts with abundant expertise within communication in general, com- munication on gender equality, campaigning, public relations, networking and awareness rais- ing. The JTN provides about 20 % of the Institute\u2019s press coverage in a year where the launch of the Gender Equality Index alone stood for more than 60 % of all coverage. Largest coverage in the media was given to the Gender Equality Index. Additionally, the network provides valuable advice on how to present the Institute\u2019s latest findings. Via media the Institute not only reaches citizens in EU Member States but also some of the Institute\u2019s key target groups. In 2013, EIGE organised two meetings of its JTN, and devoted each one to the report EIGE pre- pared for the Presidency of the Council.

EIGE\u2019s communication events An excellent way of getting EIGE\u2019s messages across to important target audiences is to meet them face to face. In this way EIGE continued to reach out to key audiences via a large number of events. On 8 March , International Woman\u2019s Day, the Institute presented its work on FGM dur- ing an event at the European Commission in the presence of Commission Vice-President Viviane Reding. On that day a particular online campaign was given extra attention: the zero tolerance cam- paign against FGM (picture below ). On 13 June 2013, the Institute officially launched the first edition of the Gender Equality Index at the Council of the European Union in Brussels in the presence of approximately 300 gender equality experts and press. The conference \u2018EU Conference \u2014 Launch of the Gender Equality Index\u2019 was the largest and most important event for the Institute so far. The event was a media success: 115 articles were written about the launch and three TV sta- tions and one radio station covered the event. Also the online event was a hit: between 12 and 14 June 2013, EIGE\u2019s website had 5 502 unique visitors and the Gender Equality Index inter- face was viewed 3 171 times. During this time, EIGE published seven Facebook posts that were viewed by 19 121 viewers and shared by 199 peo- ple. The Index video on YouTube generated 837 views during these few days. After the official launch, and on several occasions during the Lithuanian Presidency, the Index was presented to the European Parliament. At vari- ous events, EIGE presented the Index to other EU bodies (the Committee of the Regions, DG Jus- tice, DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, Eurostat), EU agencies (Eurofound, FRA), a num- ber of national government representatives and gender equality bodies, representatives of the IPA countries, the OECD and a number of universi- ties and academic associations. The Index was also the topic of online discussions organised in EuroGender. The second large-scale EIGE event in 2013 was organised jointly with the World Health Organisa- tion/Europe and the City of Vienna: the interna- tional conference \u2018Eliminating Violence against Women in Europe \u2014 Intersectoral Approaches and Actions\u2019 on 25 and 26 November 2013 in Vienna ( 31 ).

Exchange of information and concrete cooper- ation plans were discussed with the Social Plat- form and the European Women\u2019s Lobby. EIGE also met the European social partners, and at one of these meetings, EIGE presented its work and the Gender Equality Index to the Women\u2019s Commit- tee of ETUC. In September of 2013, an agreement on cooper- ation between EIGE and the Women and Gender Equality Committee of the European Parliament (FEMM) was finalised. During the year, EIGE pre- sented its various reports, its annual work pro- gramme 2014 and the Gender Equality Index at several hearings of the FEMM Committee and dif- ferent events in the European Parliament. These events and many bilateral meetings with differ- ent MEPs increased EIGE\u2019s visibility and reference as an important resource in the area of gender equality. In November 2013 EIGE participated in the 2013 annual summit of the Women in Parlia- ments Global Forum (WIP), an event that attracted over 500 participants, which gave the opportunity to reach a wide audience and disseminate the Institute\u2019s work. During the summit, EIGE hosted a session focusing on the domain of power of the Index and future projections based on the Gender Equality Index. Internally, EIGE continued to refine its stakeholder management system, integrating a system for the distribution of its publications and lodging the stakeholder database in the online EuroGender platform, which was designed to enable crowd updates. The transition of the stakeholders\u2019 data- base to EuroGender enables the registered par- ticipants in the platform to update their profiles and information, simultaneously updating the database entry. Cooperation with other EU agencies Since 2010 EIGE has concluded a number of cooperation agreements with different organ- isations and in 2013, EIGE received and provided contributions to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, Eurofound and CEPOL work programmes. The memorandum of understand- ing with Eurofound was updated by a concrete action plan. Additionally, heads of agencies of CEPOL, European GNSS (GSA), EMCDDA and Euro- found joined the White Ribbon Campaign and published their statements during the campaign. Visits to EIGE The number of visits to the Institute in 2013 sur- passed all estimations with over 50 high-level vis- its from the EU Institutions and Member States\u2019 officials. The Lithuanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union during the second semes- ter provided a valuable opportunity to welcome many stakeholders to EIGE, from heads of state, commissioners, MEPs, deputy prime ministers, ministers, ambassadors, NGOs, EU agencies (Euro- found, FRA, Frontex), study visits and officials from outside the EU. This was also an important opportunity to estab- lish dialogue with countries outside the EU and present EIGE\u2019s work, in particular with the pre- accession countries to the EU. During the visits to EIGE, the next IPA project and the importance of having gender equality explicitly mentioned in the countries\u2019 proposal to the EU was discussed.

Description of the study: The study aims to map out the key administrative data sources on gender-based violence \u2014 and statistical products created from these sources \u2014 in the 28 EU Member States and analyse their relevance, reliability and quality. So far, there has been no overview available of the extent, scope and potential of administrative data collection on gender-based violence in the European Union Member States. With this study, EIGE intends to fill this gap. As the first stage, a comprehensive and detailed map of the existing administrative sources of data on this issue will be built. Based on the results of this analysis, the feasibility of the collection of comparable data at the EU level from the identified national administrative sources on GBV is assessed. Finally, the study provides recommendations for improving the statistical potential of administrative sources on GBV as well as a set of guidelines to harmonise data collection. This will constitute the first and the most essential step for a reliable compilation of comparable administrative data on GBV across the EU. Between January and December 2013, methodological guidelines developed by EIGE were implemented to map, describe and assess efficiently and effectively administrative sources of data on gender-based violence and statistics drawn from these sources in the EU Member States. The field research of the study in each country was carried out between January and April 2013. Analysis of results was developed between May and July. From this research, five databases were delivered in December 2013: database of administrative data sources in EU Member States; database of statistical products in EU Member States; database of legal definitions on gender-based violence in EU Member States; and database of literature and legislation on gender-based violence in EU.

Study on analysing methodologies to determine the economic costs of gender-based violence in the European Union Contract awarded to: Prof. Sylvia Walby, Lancaster University, United Kingdom Study launched: 2013; study to be delivered to EIGE in Q3 2014. Description of the study: The aim of this study is to engage a consultant/team to review, analyse and assess the methodological options in the existing literature and studies on the costs of intimate partner violence against women (IPV) with the aim of providing recommendations for the EU Member States on which approaches to use. Such research includes both direct and indirect cost categories, an analysis of available data and some rigorous methodological guidelines to permit, in the future, comparisons across countries, police, health and social services, including those borne by individuals, households, civil society organisations, businesses, governments and their administrative institutions (local, regional and national) and society as a whole. The study does not exclude in principle any sector or type of cost (monetary or non-monetary). An analysis of available data, taking into account existing EIGE studies and the FRA survey on violence against women, will determine the feasibility of the methodologies and approaches that can be recommended for measuring the cost of IPV (including former partners) against women in EU. Future steps: The information in this study is important for monitoring service provision in the area of GBV and policy development because there is a serious concern that the overall reductions in services, following cuts to budgets, will lead to an increase in the number of cases of gender-based violence.

        "54 / European Institute for Gender Equality \u2014 Annual report 2013 The report on the Gender Equality Index Report published: 2013 Description of the report: The report provides a detailed account of the development of the Gender Equality Index. It first sets out how gender equality can be summarised and mapped out from theoretical and conceptual positions. The report then shows how statistical methods are used to transpose this conceptual structure into a measurement framework. The construction of composite indicators is notably difficult and often criticised for its potential subjectivity. In order to provide as much transparency and objectivity as possible, the report on the Gender Equality Index thus provides as much methodological information as possible, allowing users to replicate the steps taken and justifying each decision from a conceptual and/or methodological viewpoint as appropriate. The report provides an extensive section describing the indicators used with the Gender Equality Index, before setting out its results overall and in each of the domains identified (work, money, knowledge, power, time, health). Further analyses, related to the wider context such as GDP or the structure of spending, are also touched upon. The report concludes with the key findings of the Gender Equality Index. Difficulties encountered: This project has been mostly developed internally by EIGE\u2019s researchers, with support from reviews and other studies. This results in a high-quality tool, however it also relies on having access to sufficient human resources. Future steps: The Gender Equality Index will be calculated for additional as well as more recent years, ensuring comparability over time. It will be complemented by further analyses, including on quality of work, violence against women and intersecting inequalities. The next report on the Gender Equality Index will be published in 2015.

Final report and databases were delivered in December 2013. Description of the study: The study mapped out the institutional mechanisms (structures and arrangements) for gender mainstreaming in the European Commission and the 28 EU Member States, including the regional dimension in MS with a highly decentralised administrative model. Additionally, it surveyed the methods used to mainstream gender equality across sectors in the EU. Special attention was paid to gender impact assessment as an ex ante evaluation of the potential impact of legislation and policies on gender inequality. This complex project produced a variety of outputs as outlined in the project document, including: a report on institutional capacity for GM, a survey of methods for GM, an online meeting report on institutional capacity and methods for GM in the EU, several databases on structures, arrangements, resources and methods for GM, a landmark conference in September 2013 on effective methods for GM with the Lithuanian Presidency in September, 28 country reports on the institutional capacity for gender mainstreaming, a think note on GIA and a database of resources for GIA, two workshops on GIA in October and November 2013, 11 relevant examples of GIA and GIA good practice guidelines. Main conclusions: At the level of the European Commission, the institutional mechanisms in place appear to be robust in terms of structures and arrangements, as well as in terms of the range of methods mobilised for gender mainstreaming. However, lack of consistent intervention logic underpinning the gender mainstreaming approach hinders progress and implementation appears to be fragmented, incoherent, isolated in a few areas and limited to a few policies. The assessment of the EU capacity for gender mainstreaming is done on the basis of the concerted action of a number of factors, including financial, human and methodological resources, access to gender expertise, institutional leadership, conceptualisation of inequalities, involvement of stakeholders, transparency, accountability, coverage of policy cycle, organisational culture and daily routines to integrate gender in regular work activities. As a result of the assessment, a mixed picture of different paces and stages emerges. Very different models are in place for the implementation of a \u2018gender impact assessment\u2019 in the EU. Across the board, the analyses that underpin GIAs in the selected countries and regions do not appear to be very robust, with serious gaps in the wealth of available knowledge about existing inequalities in the full spectrum of policy areas.

Starting from the development of specific qualitative criteria on women\u2019s entrepreneurship and consistently with EIGE\u2019s approach on good practices, the study will collect a number of practices with potential. Then, within a consultation meeting, the practices will be assessed and the most relevant examples will be identified as good practices. Furthermore, the study will provide a map of stakeholders working on women\u2019s entrepreneurship, a literature review and communication materials. The part of the study related to good practices started in November 2013 and lasted until May 2014. Difficulties encountered: The main challenge of the study is to identify the most relevant approaches in EU Member States in a limited period of time. National experts and senior researchers were involved to avoid the risk of missing some outstanding example. Anyway, the objective of the study was not to map all the best approaches but to identify some extremely relevant and effective examples, to promote capacity building and mutual learning among stakeholders. Future steps: The data resulting from this study, concerning resources, stakeholders and good practices, will be disseminated through EIGE\u2019s webpage on gender mainstreaming and included in EIGE\u2019s RDC. Dissemination will also be provided during EIGE events, as a peer review and European events on good practices and on women and the economy. ",

EIGE\u2019s work on gender training Gender training in the European Union: mapping, research and stakeholders engagement (phase II) Contract awarded to: GHK Consulting Limited, United Kingdom Study launched: In 2010, the project was implemented in two phases. First phase: mapping study, final report delivered in December 2012; second phase: in-depth study report, delivered on 13 November 2013. Description of the study: With this study, EIGE intended to increase the knowledge on gender training in the European Union, collect across the EU-27 and make available practical and resourceful information related to gender training, as well as to foster the discussion on the development and acceptance of the quality standards for gender training in the European Union. The initiative aims to capture and build upon a wide, at times fragmented, experience of the EU and lessons learned in the field of gender training, and contribute to a wider acceptance of gender training as a necessary tool for the effective implementation of gender mainstreaming strategy, creating a pool of practical information and facilitating the process of a critical reflection on the quality of such trainings. Additionally, the initiative brings together different actors and facilitates the transfer of knowledge between academia and the practitioners so as to increase the capacity of relevant practitioners in pursuing effective gender training programmes. One of the main aims of this tender was to develop an effective approach to identifying, presenting in a user-friendly manner, disseminating and exchanging good practices in gender training. ",
        "58 / European Institute for Gender Equality \u2014 Annual report 2013 Main conclusions: The research has shown the wide variation in the backgrounds and professional qualifications of gender trainers, and has also demonstrated a wide range of approaches towards designing gender training. In academic circles, the issue of setting at least minimum quality standards has long been discussed, but in practice no such standards exist. Furthermore, institutions and organisations commissioning gender training do not typically have reference frameworks that would help them to decide what training would be most effective for them. They also lack guidance through the process of finding and selecting high-quality training services, thus issues of quality assurance should remain high on the agenda. The study concluded that gender training needs to be considered and designed as a vital part of gender mainstreaming and a wider \u2018capacity-building strategy\u2019 that includes post-training activities, monitoring systems and changes in the organisation. Based on the insights of the mapping study, phase II of the project (carried out in 2013) aimed at a more profound analysis of gender training. It explored the factors underlying the effectiveness of gender training as a means of building the capacities of staff and as a tool for transformative gender mainstreaming. Greater attention was devoted to issues of quality, practical guidance and stakeholders\u2019 involvement in creating progress in the area. Future steps: The results of the study were presented to the representatives of the Member States in a meeting held in Vilnius in November 2013. Information from the final report will be published in 2014. All materials, databases and reports will be published online as one part of the Gender Mainstreaming Platform, integrated into the RDC, and will serve as an integral part of EIGE\u2019s future work on methods and tools for gender mainstreaming. EIGE\u2019s work on the benefits of gender equality (BGE) Conceptual framework and approaches for estimating the benefits of gender equality in the EU: rights-based approach versus the economic case for gender equality Contract awarded to: Prof. Jackie Jones, University of the West of England, United Kingdom Study launched: October 2013. The final report was delivered before the end of the year and further discussed with peer reviewers, EIGE\u2019s management and BGE project manager during a consultation meeting held on 30 and 31 January 2014 in Vilnius. Description of the study: The report analyses the rights approach vis-\u00e0-vis socioeconomic arguments to support policy action on gender equality at national, European and international levels. It compares the opportunities and limitations of the rights approach versus the use of instrumental approaches for furthering the gender equality agenda within the overarching EU socioeconomic priorities for the upcoming years (2014\u201320). Finally, the researcher highlights consistent progress over time driven by a progressive agenda in case-law, legislation and policies in this field but warns about a regression in rights brought about by increasing funding cuts and amalgamating and disbanding programmes, mechanisms and services specifically devoted to gender equality. Main conclusions: Human rights-based approaches are to be the basis of any action to promote gender equality in the EU. As a right, a value and a political commitment, gender equality is enshrined in fundamental legal texts and policy documents in Europe and worldwide. When rights are implemented and furthered, powerful drivers interact and shape their reach and impact on people\u2019s lives. ",
        "European Institute for Gender Equality \u2014 Annual report 2013 / 59 Social structures and customs, economic constraints, culture and religion, among other factors, dramatically influence the ways in which rights are actualised. Due to these complex interactions, gender equality advocates need to engage with current debates on socioeconomic rationales. Rights implementation through judicial action and individual claims \u2014 where multiple inequalities compete \u2014 has proved inefficient to bring about by itself large-scale change. Change in the direction of equality requires concerted action between political empowerment and policymaking and implementation, where core structural inequalities are reproduced and sustained. Change towards equality needs complementary approaches that combine the protection of individuals who suffer discrimination with specific mechanisms to tackle inequalities in a policy- relevant manner. Not being a minority issue, gender-based inequalities affect women structurally across all social groups and class divides. Great strides have been made in recent decades in promoting gender equality through dual approaches. In order to build on the achievements of the past, a dedicated body that provides a collective memory (databank) of best practice, tools and indices and the ability to target specific themes at strategic times at EU level on the basis of this expertise and knowledge is vital to fulfilling this goal. Future steps: The Institute will continue working on conceptual standpoints that, on the basis of rights, can reach out strategic issues within the current political agenda, focused at present on economic growth and employment. The work on the benefits of gender equality will combine the human-rights basis with different rationales and instrumental arguments that can support the integration of gender equality as a driver for the sustainability of an inclusive socioeconomic growth model in the EU. Notwithstanding the strategic importance of instrumental rationales towards gender equality, the backdrop of gender equality as a rights issue will remain the intrinsic motivation for EIGE\u2019s work. The BGE project foresees the publication of background papers and expert group meeting conclusions. Reform of parental leave system: equal non-transferable fully paid parental leave. A case study to estimate the overall benefits of specific policy reforms within the gender equality political agenda Contract awarded to: Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, United Kingdom Study launched: October 2013. The final report was delivered before the end of the year and further discussed with peer reviewers, EIGE\u2019s management and BGE project manager during a consultation meeting held on 30 and 31 January 2014 in Vilnius. Description of the study: The study carried out a review of a wide gender equality policy reform agenda in the context of the EU and the post-2015 global agenda. Researchers selected \u2018Equal and non-transferable parental leave\u2019 as the specific reform on which to focus the empirical part of the study. Additionally, the report includes a critical review of methodologies to estimate costs and benefits of gender equality in the context of policy and institutional overhaul and provides initial evidence of the expected benefits of equal and non-transferable parental leave in the EU MS. Main conclusions: There is international broad consensus on the relevance of achieving gender equality in the labour market. An overhaul of current parental care leave schemes in the EU can bring beneficial impacts at all levels: personal and organisational, as well as at macrosocial and macroeconomic levels. Benefits of this reform are based on a redistribution of care activities, gender roles, employment status and an overall shift of work\u2013life balance. By impacting the employment status of parents, equal and non- transferable parental leave can help to reduce the risk of children\u2019s poverty as well as substantially increasing female employment rates. In addition, a reform of the parental leave regimes in the EU MS can enhance family well-being and stability. Not least important, equal and non-transferable parental leave has the potential to improve productivity and competitiveness in companies as a result of the optimal use of human capital. ",
        "60 / European Institute for Gender Equality \u2014 Annual report 2013 EIGE can play an important role within the policy reform to implement equal and non-transferable parental leave by providing indicators related to international and EU frameworks to support the promotion of gender equality in families and the labour market. EIGE can contribute to strengthening synergies among policies by integrating different indicators (i.e. monitoring uptake rates of parental, maternity and paternity leave in conjunction with indicators on childcare services). In addition, EIGE can foster the better use and exploitation of administrative data on maternity and paternity leave allowances. Further collaboration between EIGE and Eurostat, in particular on quality of life and time-use surveys, could help to introduce the gender equality perspective into harmonised statistics. Difficulties encountered: At this point in time, when parental leave policies are still at a nascent stage, it is difficult to collect evidence of their wider benefits for individuals, families, communities, organisations and countries. However, initial evidence supports the hypothesis that, on average, longer involvement of fathers in the early stages of babies\u2019 development tends to persist throughout children\u2019s lives and leads to shifts in work\u2013life balance patterns within families and in the workplace, with a positive impact on women\u2019s employment and economic independence. Future steps: The study set out to explore the extent to which it was possible to collect evidence of the benefits of gender equality on a particular issue within the political reform agenda. It helped to prove the usefulness of a focus on specific areas instead of general statements on the benefits of gender equality unrelated to particular policy actions. Future studies on the benefits of gender equality will take into account the knowledge that this seminal study has brought to the project. The overall analysis put forward in this research note on the state of play of parental leave in the EU and its potential benefits to deepen equality at all levels will be published. The BGE project includes publication of these background papers and expert group meeting conclusions. Sectoral approach to the benefits of gender equality: the benefits of gender equality through expenditures on public infrastructures Contract awarded to: Prof. Gloria Alarcon, University of Murcia, Spain Study launched: October 2013. The final report was delivered before the end of the year and further discussed with peer reviewers, EIGE\u2019s management and the BGE project manager during a consultation meeting held on 30 and 31 January 2014 in Vilnius. Description of the study: The objective of this study was to develop a methodological approach for EIGE\u2019s work on the benefits of gender equality across sectors. As a cross-cutting issue integral to every area of work, rather than a stand-alone matter, gender equality is closely intertwined with substantive policy sectors, particularly those revolving around social policy, justice, employment and economic policy. Sectoral policies benefit from gender mainstreaming because it enhances knowledge about inequality and different population needs, allowing for better-targeted policymaking. The research paper on \u2018Sectoral approach to the benefits of gender equality\u2019 mapped out relevant policy areas for gender mainstreaming in the European Commission, aiming to identify those with more potential for collecting data on the impact of gender equality for the population at large. In addition, the paper describes a variety of methodologies for the analysis of the benefits of mainstreaming gender equality in specific policy areas, in particular subjective well-being and capability approaches. Finally, researchers applied the selected methodological option (capability approach) to a relevant policy area (infrastructures) and subarea of small dimensions (childcare facilities) with the aim of illustrating the practical application of such methodology and bringing about initial results on the benefits of gender equality for the chosen sector. ",
        "European Institute for Gender Equality \u2014 Annual report 2013 / 61 Main conclusions: As proved by national and international experience, taking into account the gender perspective in urban planning and public infrastructure has many benefits for society at large. Benefits of mainstreaming gender equality in infrastructures can affect the whole of society, as the infrastructures that deal with social reproduction do not only make life easier for women but also for men, allowing them to become caregivers. Infrastructures enhance well-being in people and support full citizenship of women, as the proper availability of urban, care and transport infrastructure can enable women\u2019s professional and personal development and safeguard women\u2019s autonomy and integrity. Specific social benefits of mainstreaming gender in infrastructure policies at the EU level could include an increase in the efficiency of public spending and in productivity by improving the functioning of the labour market and supporting the full utilisation of the caretaking capital of men. More than ever before, the specialisation of women in domestic and caretaking work lacks economic sense due to the loss of centrality of the family as the unit of production of goods and services, to the decline in family size, to women\u2019s increased life expectancy and, finally, to women\u2019s high level of education. Furthermore, urban care and transport infrastructure can be determinants for enhancing social cohesion and a more efficient use of time. Some investments in infrastructure, such as sports centres or recycling facilities, can also contribute to health and the improvement of environment quality. Difficulties encountered: The selected methodology (capability approach) for assessing the benefits of gender equality in the sector of infrastructures entails the use of surveys. The research paper includes the result of a small-scale survey with interesting findings. However, large-scale surveys can be significantly costly, precluding their use for studies at EU level with a limited budget. Future steps: This study has contributed to expanding the methodological options to explore the benefits of gender equality by including qualitative approaches based on well-being, happiness and the development of capabilities and human capital. The BGE project includes publication of these background papers and expert group meeting conclusions. The economic and social case for gender equality: feasibility analysis Contract awarded to: Prof. Tindara Addabbo, University of Modena, Italy Study launched: October 2013. A mid-term report containing the literature and review of datasets was delivered before the end of the year. A proposal for potential lines of work was delivered in January 2014 and discussed in a peer-review conference with EIGE\u2019s management, EIGE\u2019s BGE project manager and prominent experts on the economic case for gender equality in the course of a consultation meeting held in Vilnius on 30 and 31 January 2014. The final report was delivered at the end of April 2014. Description of the study: The objective of this study is to analyse the availability of data in the EU to develop the economic case for gender equality, as well as to explore what methodological options can be used for estimating the social and macroeconomic gains of gender equality across the EU. The study has carried out a literature review and a compilation of existing datasets on the different components of the economic case for gender equality. In a second phase during the first quarter of 2014, the study determined the feasibility of estimating the macroeconomic benefits of gender equality and presented proposals for a research agenda. ",
        "62 / European Institute for Gender Equality \u2014 Annual report 2013 Main conclusions: The feasibility study to estimate the economic case for gender equality has helped to frame and flesh out research hypotheses so they can be studied in depth in a future project to be launched in 2014. The literature review has clarified the macroeconomic and social case for gender equality and highlighted the transmission mechanisms between higher gender equality in specific dimensions and the selected outcomes (education, access to employment and apical positions, wages, social reproduction, leadership and political participation). Furthermore, with the aim of operationalising the ways in which the main drivers or transmission mechanisms work, the study provides a survey of the available datasets to measure relevant dimensions of gender equality and the outlined economic and social gains. As a result, a variety of research alternatives stemming from the literature review under consideration has been extensively discussed and reduced to a manageable number selected on the basis of data availability and strategic relevance. Difficulties encountered: The tender was initially relaunched to reach out to more suitable candidates with a proven track record on previous work in the realm of feminist economics. Future steps: Further to a consultation meeting to be held in January 2014, peer reviews will contribute feedback on the proposals emanating from the analysis of the feasibility of proposals to estimate the macroeconomic benefits of gender equality. After the presentation and discussion of methodological options and their comparative advantages, EIGE will launch an EU-wide scaling-up study on the macroeconomic and social benefits of gender equality within the context of EIGE\u2018s mandate and 2014 annual work plan. The BGE project includes publication of these background papers and the expert group meeting conclusions. Unforeseen studies \u2014 Study on international activities in the field of data collection on gender-based violence across the EU Contract awarded to: European Institute for Crime Prevention and Control affiliated with the United Nations (HEUNI), Finland Study launched: 2012. The report was published by EIGE in November 2013. Description of the study: The objective of the study was to produce an in-depth analysis at EU level by assessing the achievements of and setbacks to gender equality when implementing actions for reaching the strategic objectives of all 12 areas of concern of the Beijing Platform for Action. The time frame was since the last EU-wide review of the BPfA presented in 2009. The study considered the latest developments at the institutional level of the EU in the area of gender equality and the implementation of the BPfA at EU and national level in 12 areas of concern, and assessed trends, progress and major challenges in gender equality emerging from the EU-wide data since 2010. The overview used available sources of qualitative and quantitative data and information at EU level and, where relevant and if available, the information provided by the EU Member States\u2019 reports to the UNECE. Future steps: The results of this study will be integrated into the RDC and will serve as a basis for EIGE\u2019s future work on GBV. ",
