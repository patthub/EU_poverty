        "3 THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK \u2019s annual report on Africa, the Caribbean, the Pacific, and the Overseas Countries and Territories offers an overview of our work to fight poverty and develop economies through investment tools that support private and public sector projects. Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific are vastly different regions that face different challenges and need different solutions. What they have in common is a need for investment. This has been brought into sharp focus by the COVID-19 pandemic, but everything is connected: a lack of basic infrastructure impedes the development of companies which, in turn, is a barrier to improving quality of life. We need to keep investing in climate resilience, renewable energy, healthcare, sustainable transport, water and sanitation and telecommunications, as well as supporting the small businesses that drive economies forward. The European Investment Bank is helping African, Caribbean and Pacific countries create vibrant and sustainable economic growth. In 2020, our total signed deals in these regions reached \u20ac2.1 billion. We assist areas of society that are sometimes forgotten \u2014 young people, women and girls, in big cities or in small villages. We want to create opportunities for all to succeed. In this report, you can meet the people who are making a difference for themselves and for others. There are stories on the Bank\u2019s rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as healthcare challenges in Africa. We speak to Achim Steiner, administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, about the next steps for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and how the coronavirus pandemic is making institutions like ours work together to speed up development impact. There are stories about how we are supporting female entrepreneurs in the Dominican Republic and how we are part of a European effort to bring financing to farmers in Malawi. ",

        "6 2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN ACP AND OCT FOREWORD F or many of us, 2020 has been the most challenging year of our lifetimes. The COVID-19 pandemic has had grave consequences across the world. The loss of millions of people is by far the most serious consequence, but the effects of the pandemic on day-to-day life, on our economies and on global development will be felt for years to come. We must continue to work together in partnership. It is the only way that we can lessen the worst impacts of the crisis and emerge into a strong recovery. We are putting our financing to work as part of Team Europe to increase assistance around the world and develop more partnerships. In 2020, EIB signatures in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, the Overseas Countries and Territories and South Africa reached \u20ac2.1 billion, for 47 projects, across all sources of financing. For the ACP Investment Facility alone, the figure is over \u20ac1 billion. These figures are our highest on record in the regions. Of our total investment, 71% went to less-developed countries and fragile states. This too is a record. We also approved loans for projects for just over \u20ac3 billion. This is another record. The Bank also disbursed \u20ac963 million. This is the second highest yearly total. There are several ways in which institutions like ours can support recovery from a pandemic. In the healthcare sector, to help minimise the short-term impacts of COVID-19, the Bank has helped to finance vaccine research programmes. We have joined forces with the European Commission to support the COVAX programme to help everyone get access to vaccines. COVAX will offer affordable vaccines to as many as a billion people. We are also financing vaccine manufacturing, as well as providing funding to cover costs for staff and protective equipment. This work is building health resilience in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

        "7 FOREWORD We need to work harder on economic resilience and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Our experience in the fields of climate change mitigation and adaptation is significant, including not only large-scale wind and solar power generation, but also solar power kits in homes, small solar power parks in communities, and other off-grid power solutions. We also do a lot of work in energy efficiency and resilient water and sanitation infrastructure. The Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) regions are amongst the most threatened by climate change \u2014 ranging from environmental degradation to increased drought, flooding and coastal erosion \u2014 but they do not always have the resources to deal with these problems. The Bank can help to support these projects. This year, we are financing a large operation to tackle soil erosion in Nigeria, as well as several water projects in Malawi, Barbados and Burkina Faso. The most effective way to reduce poverty around the world is to support private sector development. In the ACP regions, the EIB therefore places a premium on supporting financial ecosystems and sharing knowledge of best practices to enhance them. We help provide the necessary financing for businesses of all shapes and sizes, from startups and microenterprises up to large corporates. Smaller businesses are the drivers of the economy and the principal job creators. Local financial institutions enable these companies to grow. They need support now, more than ever, as they deal with the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Special efforts also are needed to improve access to finance for people who are underserved: young people, rural populations and women. We seek to invest where we can achieve the most impact. For every euro lent to a woman, the impact on the community is multiplied many times over. We are seeing this extra impact in many instances, especially through our SheInvest initiative focused on Africa. We have invested over \u20ac1 billion to help women and girls in Africa since November 2019 under SheInvest, improving access to finance for female-owned businesses in particular. Likewise, our focus on digitalisation creates opportunities for young people, women and rural populations by connecting them to essential services, financing, and customers. The conditions to support private sector development have changed. If anything, the situation in 2020 has reinforced the point that public sector investment remains critical. It is here that the EIB and its partners, whether fellow European institutions, multilateral development banks or local and regional financial institutions, have had to demonstrate more flexibility. It is of vital importance that investment in emerging economies does not go down during this period, and the Bank has offered a lot of finance to countries in need. This has enabled initiatives that benefit the public good, such as investment in water and sanitation, clean energy and electricity distribution. This is not the time to be restrictive in development finance. The UN Sustainable Development Goals seek to improve lives across the world by 2030. This is not far away, and calls for more partnerships and more action. In a few months in 2020, we demonstrated what we can do together as part of Team Europe. The Bank has been investing in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific for almost 60 years. We are ready to do more than ever to improve lives, fight climate change, create opportunities for millions of women and men, and build a greener and smarter future, where pandemics and poverty can be addressed quickly by strong economies and resilient societies.

        "8 2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN ACP AND OCT HUNDREDS OF PROJECTS AND BILLIONS INVESTED FOR BETTER LIVES L ooking back over the story of our activities in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific in the era of the Cotonou Mandate (see page 64 for more information), I see intensive evolution. Since the ACP Investment Facility started operating in 2003, the Bank has financed 440 projects across 58 countries and ten regions. We have invested some \u20ac15.3 billion, of which \u20ac8.7 billion comes from the ACP Investment Facility revolving fund, and \u20ac6.6 billion from the Bank\u2019s own resources. We had already been active in these regions since 1963, but with the Investment Facility, the Bank was ready to do much more. The goal has been to use long-term financing to reduce poverty and help integrate ACP countries into the world economy. The pillars on which this is built are private sector development, vital infrastructure, regional integration and climate action. The Investment Facility met these goals and priorities successfully. It would have been impossible to achieve if we did not work with many partners and peers, follow the guidance of other European institutions and, crucially, adapt to the needs of people. Our work in 2020 is a good example of how we work together to help everyone. The Bank and the European Union joined forces under the Team Europe banner to fight the COVID-19 crisis and the economic downturn at the same time, inside and outside Europe. But this is not the only example. In the past, it was common to think of us as an investment bank that provided loans to countries and regions to install water pipes and power lines. These are things that we still do, but we have expanded over the years to meet new needs and development priorities. Global initiatives such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals have provided the Bank and other financial institutions with a new direction. The EU Consensus on Development, inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals, has similarly given us a wider focus to work with more partners and finance more projects. The Impact Financing Envelope has had a huge influence on our operations. Since its launch as a dedicated window of the Investment Facility in 2014, it has enabled the Bank to take on more risk and help more projects. Using Africa as an example, millions of people still have no electricity in their homes and businesses. Installing power lines and electricity infrastructure across the whole continent would be a herculean and costly challenge. That is not possible. So we are supporting a wide range of energy solutions. In areas that are beyond the reach of power lines, we are backing off-grid ideas, like the inexpensive home solar kits that have taken off around the world. The Bank has been able to provide financing for these types of projects through direct operations and investment funds alike, thereby bringing other investors on board. By filling a financing gap, we are also able to fill an energy gap. That is down to the Impact Financing Envelope. The same goes for supporting startups and small businesses in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. There has always been a clear need for financing here, but there has not always been an appetite for investing on the part of banks and other financial institutions. Venture capital is growing quickly, particularly in Africa, while we are also in the midst of a youth-driven wave of great ideas that tackle many local and regional problems. It is imperative that these entrepreneurs get financing and good advice. This makes sure ideas get off the drawing boards to help everyone in society. The Bank is in ",
        "9 HUNDREDS OF PROJECTS AND BILLIONS INVESTED FOR BETTER LIVES the fortunate position to be able to support companies from their inception, while they grow, and when they reach maturity. Boost Africa and the SheInvest initiative are good examples of this. Through these programmes, the Bank is able to place a premium on supporting both the young founders of the next generation of digital companies in Africa and female entrepreneurs. We cannot lose sight of the fact that climate change is the overarching issue facing the world today. Its effects are being felt everywhere, and most seriously in the ACP countries. The coming decade is crucial if we are to avoid the most catastrophic consequences. Under our Climate Bank Roadmap for 2021 to 2025, we have pledged to increase the share of projects for climate change mitigation and adaptation to 50% of overall lending. We are also ensuring that our activities are Paris-aligned and that we consider the climate in everything we do. The Bank has moved with the times. The Cotonou Mandate has enabled us to keep putting our financing to work where it is most needed. By creating the Impact Financing Envelope, we have reached more great projects, despite the higher risks. By making it a revolving fund under the ACP Migration Package, we were able to extend it to meet more investment needs. Also under the Migration Package, we were able to use the Investment Facility capacity to support more public sector projects. Together with the European Commission and EU Member States, we have boosted economies, reduced poverty and improved millions of lives, and we have done this together in constant dialogue through the Investment Facility Committee. We are looking forward to the next chapters of stronger cooperation in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. We will meet new challenges and help more people succeed.

        "27 PROJECTS IN FOCUS PROJECTS IN FOCUS COVAX: HELPING EVERY COUNTRY GET VACCINES COVAX is a ground-breaking global initiative to help African countries and other parts of the world get COVID-19 vaccines. The Bank, backed by the European Commission, is supporting COVAX through several financial instruments, including the ACP Investment Facility. Infectious diseases do not respect borders. To protect everyone, it is important that all countries can get vaccines. That is the mission of the COVAX initiative \u2014 jointly led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. Supported by the Bank and the European Commission, COVAX aims to ensure equitable access to a COVID-19 vaccine for everyone. Fair distribution of COVID-19 vaccines is key to tackling the pandemic and alleviating a dire situation in developing countries. The Bank is investing \u20ac400 million in the COVAX Advanced Market Commitment, the financing instrument that will support 92 low- and middle-income countries. \u20ac170 million of this investment is coming from the ACP Investment Facility. Nearly 100 countries have contributed to COVAX. COVAX will make sure the most vulnerable people in all countries can be protected in the short term, regardless of income. It will also accelerate development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines. It provides support for vaccination campaigns, including the freezers needed to keep vaccines at a cold temperature. UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS Half of low-income countries and a quarter of middle-income countries face a high risk of serious economic impact due to COVID-19. For many of those countries, the pandemic is one of the severest blows to economic growth on record. The World Health Organization estimates that 132 million could be added to the world\u2019s total of hungry people because of the pandemic. ",
        "28 2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN ACP AND OCT EQUAL ACCESS TO VACCINES A vaccine is one of the best tools to overcome the impact of the pandemic on health and the economy. COVAX is funding the development of a range of potential vaccines. It is supporting the expanded manufacture of vaccines and negotiating better prices. COVAX\u2019s investments enable manufacturers to expand manufacturing immediately, producing the vaccine even while it is being evaluated in clinical trials and before it has a licence. If the vaccine is successful, those doses will be available right away. The aim is to ensure that all countries can access doses at roughly the same time, which is essential to bring the pandemic under control and reduce its impact on economies, communities, individuals, trade and travel. In the acute phase of the pandemic, COVAX\u2019s focus will be on securing sufficient supply and resources to protect people most at risk \u2014 health and social care workers, the elderly and those with health conditions. Vaccines are already being delivered and allocated equally to countries, based on the World Health Organization\u2019s Fair Allocation Framework. STRENGTH IN UNITY The Bank\u2019s loan is backed by a guarantee from the European Commission under the European Fund for Sustainable Development, which promotes development aid primarily in the European Union neighbourhood and Africa.

        "29 PROJECTS IN FOCUS THE OTHER MEDICAL EMERGENCY The main tuberculosis vaccine currently used is almost a century old, and losing effectiveness. The Bank is supporting research on a new tuberculosis vaccine, which targets countries in sub-Saharan Africa that are affected by high numbers of cases. Tuberculosis has been a global emergency for the past 30 years. Approximately a quarter of the world\u2019s population carries the infection and are therefore prone to get ill, and cases are concentrated primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a big problem in developing countries, where poverty and government instability hurt programmes that can control it. But most of the biotechnology sector is ignoring it. Not Leander Grode, managing director of Vakzine Projekt Management. \u201cI\u2019m working on the number one single killer and, therefore, the most dangerous infectious disease in the world,\u201d he says. There is a big need for safer and more effective tuberculosis vaccines. The main vaccine used today, BCG, is about 100 years old. The Bank signed a \u20ac30 million loan under the Impact Financing Envelope with Vakzine Projekt Management to finance late-stage research on VPM1002, the company\u2019s new vaccine designed to prevent tuberculosis in babies. A COMPLICATED BATTLE Many people who take the old vaccine still end up catching tuberculosis. The company hopes its new drug offers more protection. The Bank\u2019s loan is part of a larger deal that includes \u20ac15 million to support a medicine for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. In Africa, tuberculosis is the most common illness among people who have contracted HIV. For much of 2020, the Bank has been searching for companies that need support for vaccine research and development related to the pandemic. But we never stopped supporting other infectious disease projects. Tuberculosis has been around for 200 000 years. The fight in this field is still a work in progress. Tuberculosis and COVID-19 spread in similar ways, from one person to another through tiny droplets released into the air by coughs and sneezes. Like the coronavirus, tuberculosis causes big problems in the lungs if untreated, but it also attacks the brain, kidneys and spine. If people think the coronavirus is insidiously smart, they should see how tuberculosis operates, says Sina Br\u00fcckner, a project manager working on Vakzine Projekt Management\u2019s new vaccine. \u201cTuberculosis is a very smart disease, very much adapted to humans,\u201d Br\u00fcckner says. \u201cIt is very difficult to fight and can cause many health problems. People starve, they get very thin, they can\u2019t eat. Compared to the coronavirus, fighting tuberculosis is much more complicated. It\u2019s a completely different level.\u201d ",
        "30 2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN ACP AND OCT LEARNING TO REFOCUS ON VACCINES Funding is one of the biggest hurdles to the development of new tuberculosis vaccines. This type of vaccine mainly helps developing countries, so it is not a big money-maker for pharmaceutical companies, unlike cancer drugs, which have higher potential financial returns. And yet there remains a big need for finance agreements from the European Commission or European Union countries to help companies like Vakzine Projekt Management. The Bank would not have been able to support this project without the Impact Financing Envelope, as it is riskier than what we normally would do. The loan is a venture capital agreement that will be repaid based on the trials and market performance of the medicine. If the medicine doesn\u2019t work out, the loan can be written off, but it is essential that we keep supporting projects like this one. There is a real financing gap for clinical research in infectious diseases, and investments for high-threat pathogens are too often reactive. Vakzine Projekt Management is a subsidiary of the Serum Institute of India, the largest vaccine maker in the world. The company was founded by Cyrus Poonawalla, who has said his goals are to make medicine affordable for the developing world and to vaccinate as many people as possible. Vakzine Projekt Management\u00b4s new medicine will be targeted primarily at sub-Saharan African countries that have high numbers of tuberculosis cases. The clinical trials will take place in Uganda, Gabon, Kenya, Tanzania and Lesotho. Grode, Vakzine Projekt Management\u2019s managing director, says the future finally looks brighter for vaccine research into tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, and this is partly because of the coronavirus. \u201cCOVID changed the story,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are realising that we can\u2019t afford to wait for the diseases and then try to treat people with new medication. The future of the world lies in better vaccinations.\u201d The United Nations has made the end of the tuberculosis epidemic one of its priorities under SDG 3 (good health and well-being). This project\u2019s potential contribution to that ambition is vast. \u2022 A new way to fight an ancient disease \u2022 Putting developing country priorities first \u2022 Innovative financing for tuberculosis and HIV research ",
        "31 PROJECTS IN FOCUS EUROPEAN SUPPORT FOR MALAWI\u2019S FARMERS Malawi\u2019s economy is reliant on agriculture, but it is held back by a lack of structure and diversification, and is beginning to feel the effects of climate change. The Kulima promoting farming in Malawi programme is a European Union initiative that is helping to address that, and the Bank is putting its finance to work to support it. It is difficult to overstate the importance of agriculture for the people of Malawi. At the last count, the sector accounted for 63% of export earnings and 65% of employment. Poverty remains rife in the country, and there is a notable urban/rural divide. Agricultural production for export is dominated by a small group of larger companies, but most of Malawi\u2019s producers are smallholder, family-run farms who do not have access to commercial value chains. As things stand, this is just one of several challenges the agricultural sector and its employees face. The European Commission and the Bank are supporting a programme to help address this, by providing grant and loan financing with a view to bringing resilience and inclusiveness to agriculture in Malawi. The Kulima Access to Finance programme is helping to diversify Malawi\u2019s agriculture sector, and improve lives in rural areas. ",
        "32 2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN ACP AND OCT THREE MAIN GOALS Kutukula Ulima m\u2019Malawi means \u201cpromoting farming in Malawi\u201d in the local language, Chichewa. This is the origin of the name of the Kulima access to finance programme, which is providing finance for small businesses as well as technical assistance and advice on best practice for Malawi\u2019s agriculture sector. Kulima has three major objectives. These are to increase agricultural productivity and diversify production in an inclusive, sustainable and climate-friendly way, to establish and develop agricultural value chains and the creation of opportunities for employment and income generation, and to strengthen governance across the sector. The aim is to support the producers and the buyers, manufacturers, and distributors. Because all of them have the potential for growth. NEW PLANTS AND NEW PRACTICES \u201cKulima is financed by the European Development Fund and is receiving \u20ac100 million in grant funding from the European Commission because it is supporting the backbone of Malawi\u2019s economy,\u201d says Joost Bakkeren, of the agriculture team at the European Union Delegation in Lilongwe. Kulima is already making a difference on the ground. Bakkeren points to the fact that Malawi\u2019s main crops are tobacco, sugar cane and tea, but under the programme, the country\u2019s banana industry is also being revitalised, with 13 different varieties being grown on study plots. By putting funding and know-how to work for more crops, the country\u2019s food security situation will be improved. Training programmes on the ground are equipping Malawi\u2019s farmers with the skills to get more from what they are already doing by providing them with training on farming as a business. Over 20 000 smallholder farmers and 376 small businesses have already taken advantage of this. UNLOCKING MONEY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES At a local level one of Kulima\u2019s most important ambitions is to establish and improve links between all players in the value chains. This includes connecting small businesses with sources of financing, but the agricultural sector is underserved by local banks as it is seen as too risky. The Bank is playing an important part here. Under the Kulima programme, local banks have access to an EIB credit line and are supported by technical assistance, which will help the banks to develop and provide tailored financial products for clients involved in the sector, while those clients will also benefit from advice on how to further develop their business. To help achieve this, the Bank is lending Ecobank Malawi \u20ac12.5 million to support projects that help companies to develop, create jobs and bring farmers into the formal economy. Our loan will help Ecobank to serve companies all along the agriculture value chain, improving incomes for smallholder farmers. But in order to do this, you first have to become visible to your clients and potential clients. As things stand, Ecobank\u2019s client base is heavily tilted towards residents of Malawi\u2019s cities, where the bank\u2019s eight branches are located. There\u2019s a lack of penetration in rural areas. Ecobank are addressing this in two major ways. \u201cWe are in the process of rolling out agency banking with companies that have shops all over the country,\u201d explains George Phuza, Country Head of Credit at Ecobank Malawi. This will enable customers to access banking services without making the trip to a branch. ",
        "33 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS PROGRESS The second strand is a mobile banking app. Digital platforms for financial services have been successful in Africa, not least because of the relative difficulty in travelling around. \u201cThis technology is at the heart of our expansion drive,\u201d says Phuza. \u201cIt is a more cost-effective way to reach more customers than having a wider branch network, and the platforms we are using are of international standards. They have shown themselves to be robust and advantageous.\u201d Ecobank is also taking steps to be more inclusive. In December 2020, the bank launched a programme called \u201cEllevate\u201d. This aims to bring financial services to companies that are fully or majority owned by women, employ a large proportion of women and manufacturers of products that benefit women. CUSHIONING THE PANDEMIC BLOW The digital platforms Ecobank is putting in place can only be of benefit in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Phuza says that the situation has affected Ecobank as an institution, but he is also optimistic that business will return once national restrictions are removed. On a broader level, as Bakkeren points out, part of the Kulima programme was repurposed to serve as a COVID-19 response for agriculture in the country, by funding new digital services for farmers and providing personal protective equipment for 425 essential field workers, whose tasks were needed to prevent hold-ups in the production process. There are challenges ahead for the agricultural sector in Malawi, but it is far too important for the country and its people not to meet these. Investment is required to protect natural resources and the environment. The right infrastructure needs to be put in place to create a climate-smart, resilient and diversified agricultural sector. Investment is also required to evolve from subsistence farming to farming as a business. Developing cooperatives and providing skills will help with this, but it still requires partnerships and funding arrangements between government, financial institutions and the private sector. Younger people in rural areas will be more inclined to stay if their incomes are better, but they also need access to essential services such as financial products as well as healthcare, electricity and mobile services. These require targeted funding. Kulima has demonstrated it can adapt with the times in the short term. The programme is also looking at the long term, and supporting a modern, evolved and vibrant agriculture sector in Malawi. \u2022 Improving food security in Malawi \u2022 A true European initiative \u2022 Multifaceted support for farmers and small businesses ",

        "35 PROJECTS IN FOCUS A WIN-WIN FOR WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS Empowering female-led businesses is essential for sustainable economic growth. The Bank is doing exactly that across the ACP regions. In these pandemic times, it is also important to support those who are providing finance to underserved population groups and small businesses. Marta Soda Perdomo makes over 650 cakes and small pastries every day, Monday through Saturday. She starts at five o\u2019clock every morning, and usually sells out by midday. After that, she goes to the market and buys ingredients for the next day. Her dough is prepared from scratch. She does not like the flavour of processed products. It seems that her customers do not, either. Kilsy Angelina Abreu Montas started making jewellery some years ago. When her friends and family started asking if she could make some for them, she began to think of it as a means to support herself and her son, who has special needs. She always liked fashion and bright colours. She started out making simple necklaces, but has branched out into bracelets and keyrings. Although she works from a template, she uses different materials, meaning that every piece she makes is unique. Both Perdomo and Montas received loans from Banco Adopem to help set up their small businesses. Perdomo is the main earner in her family \u2014 her husband helps distribute her pastries \u2014 and is raising five children. \u201cThis is the result of my effort,\u201d she says. \u201cBanco Adopem supported me when I needed it most. They believed in my project and they help those who are starting out with very little. Being poor does not mean losing dignity.\u201d In 2020, the EIB signed a \u20ac7 million local currency loan with them under the ACP Microfinance Facility. \u201cWe have always maintained this service for the most impoverished sections of the population, from passive financial products like bank accounts, to microloans that seem small, but can change lives,\u201d explains Mercedes Canalda de Beras-Goico, Banco Adopem\u2019s President. SUPPORTING THE JOB CREATORS Tropijugos started operating in 1983. Based out of the capital, Santo Domingo, the company takes advantage of the Dominican Republic\u2019s tradition and climate for growing fruit and vegetables: they prepare, package and freeze local produce for export markets, including grated coconut, coconut milk, mango, yams and sapote, all destined for customers in the Caribbean, the United States of America and Europe. Today, the company employs about 110 people, over half of whom are women. Tropijugos had ambitions to evolve further in 2020, notably in increasing production and sales of a new fried breadfruit product. The company received financing to do this from Banco Ademi, a longstanding EIB client, with which we signed a new \u20ac10 million local currency loan, also under the ACP Microfinance Facility, last year. ",
        "36 2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN ACP AND OCT \u201cOur mission is the sustainable development of our customers and to have a positive impact on the most disadvantaged sectors of Dominican society,\u201d explains Banco Ademi CEO Guillermo Rondon. In 2020, times were harder than they usually are, for banks and companies alike. For Banco Ademi, this meant a drop of 32% in loans disbursed, but it also meant showing flexibility for clients. As the COVID-19 crisis started to bite, Tropijugos requested a grace period on loan repayments to help deal with cashflow in the face of reduced business. Banco Ademi agreed to this, which allowed the company to absorb the worst effects and keep pushing ahead with its ambitions. Pandemic or not, going on a journey with clients is Banco Ademi\u2019s way. \u201cWe have clients who received their first loans as subsistence microenterprises but are now job-creating companies with large incomes,\u201d says Rondon. \u201cWe see this in garments and textiles. We had clients whose companies were one or two people, using basic production methods. Fairly quickly, they become garment factories, producing merchandise with state-of-the-art equipment and employing 50 people.\u201d FLEXIBILITY AND TECHNOLOGY Investing in technology pays off for their clients, but it also plays a key part in Banco Ademi\u2019s offer to its 175 000 clients across the Dominican Republic. Rarely has this been brought into sharper focus than it has been during the pandemic, and it affects the bank\u2019s female clients in particular. With schools, childcare services and sports facilities forced to close during the pandemic, women have been burdened by extra domestic tasks on top of running their businesses. This brings an added pressure on top of the societal and structural obstacles women business owners face, from difficulties in acquiring properties and collateral, through to barriers in accessing formal services and business training. This is also part of Banco Adopem\u2019s mission. They have around 400 000 clients across the Dominican Republic, which is about 10% of the entire economically active population. Canalda says that 67% of the bank\u2019s clients are women, and 35% of them live in rural areas. \u201cWe respond to this by having programmes that are tailored to women and take their needs into account, but it also goes further. We look at what sector of activity they are in, where they live and what services they can access. That is how we can best serve our clients.\u201d By being flexible, Banco Adopem is well-placed to support women entrepreneurs like Marta Perdomo and Kilsy Montas. The bank has had to temporarily close 25 branches during the pandemic. No businesses are immune from its effects, whether they are financial institutions or microenterprises. \u201cEspecially in the case of female clients, adding all of these obstacles together creates a serious challenge for running a business,\u201d Rondon says. Banco Ademi\u2019s response has been to restructure repayments so that operating is less onerous, and clients have more time to deal with their tasks, while also extending new loans to help them steer their business through the downturn. Digital platforms are also enabling clients to manage their loans more quickly and easily, saving time and money. These have also been factors for Banco Adopem. \u201cAt this stage, our challenges are to relaunch our ccustomers\u2019 business activities with new, attractive products and better conditions as well as incorporating simple and robust digital platforms at the bank and customer level,\u201d explains Canalda.

        "37 PROJECTS IN FOCUS LOCAL CURRENCIES FOR LOCAL ADVANTAGES Under the West Africa Microfinance Facility, the Bank has also agreed a \u20ac4 million local currency loan to Vital Finance in Benin. Like in the Dominican Republic, small companies in Benin are the ones suffering most from the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, but as we saw in the cases of Banco Ademi and Banco Adopem, financial institutions are affected too. Local currency lending is very useful in this context. By removing the institution\u2019s risk when it comes to foreign exchange rates, an element of volatility is eliminated from the equation. The institution can then offer stable small loans to small companies, and is free to ensure that the right financial products are in place and are accessible for their clients. Those clients may be a one-woman operation, looking to make a better life for themselves and their family, or a larger company, looking to grow and take on more employees. What is important is that the conditions are in place to give them the best chance to thrive. Through our microfinance loans, we are playing a part in that. \u2022 Using local currency lending to change lives \u2022 Helping female business owners thrive \u2022 Backing the job creators of tomorrow Together, the Banco Ademi and Banco Adopem operations are helping to sustain about 400 000 jobs in the Domincan Republic.

Multi-beneficiary investment loans often take the form of credit lines, which can be drawn down by financial institutions in order to give smaller loans to their customers. Equity operations typically involve much smaller amounts of money than our other investments, and target microfinance and venture funds, which support very small businesses and startups. Subordinated loans and quasi-equity operations are provided by the Bank to enable clients to have longer-term financing as a basis to attract other investors to their projects. ",

        "43 PARTNERSHIPS PARTNERSHIPS We are the European Union\u2019s bank. Our shareholders are the European Union\u2019s Member States. These states shape our approach to the projects we finance, while also helping to steer policy. It would be impossible to finance such a range of projects without the backing of EU countries and the European Commission. This applies to both Investment Facility operations and those from our own resources. We work with other institutions as well. In this section, we explain how the Bank partners with others to increase development work in many different ways. TEAM EUROPE The Bank has a key role to play in supporting European Union policies inside and outside Europe. In ACP countries, the Bank follows EU policies and the objectives set out in the Cotonou Agreement. In 2020, the Bank was an instrumental part of Team Europe\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting many projects around the world, notably in sub-Saharan Africa. The Bank engages in discussions at the strategic and technical levels with the European Union\u2019s External Action Service. Likewise, we frequently work with the European Commission\u2019s Directorate- General for International Cooperation and Development (DEVCO), now known as the Directorate- General for International Partnerships (DG INTPA), the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN) and a number of other directorates to enhance our work in ACP regions. In particular, we identify synergies for co-financing and grants. Cooperation with the European Commission and External Action Service is also extensive in each country. Placing our local offices within European Union delegations\u2019 offices in countries outside the European Union, and the overall expansion of Bank offices, has resulted in much closer cooperation with public officials and local clients. The Bank has been involved in several elements of the Africa- Europe Alliance for Sustainable Investment and Jobs, notably the task forces on digital economy, sustainable energy and transport; sectors where we have a strong history of investment. The idea behind the alliance is to create a comprehensive continent-to-continent free trade agreement between Africa and the European Union. ",
        "44 2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN ACP AND OCT EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT FINANCE INSTITUTIONS The European Development Finance Institutions Association is made up of 15 different institutions from the European Union and European Free Trade Association countries. The European Investment Bank and the other European development finance institutions cooperate through joint financing, mostly in the context of two initiatives: THE EUROPEAN FINANCING PARTNERS INITIATIVE This initiative is a co-financing vehicle, established by the Bank and several other European development finance institutions in 2003. It supports sustainable private sector development in ACP countries and strengthens cooperation between financiers and the Bank, and enables them to co-finance individual debt or equity operations. As of 31 December 2020, the initiative has received endowments totalling over \u20ac1.4 billion from its 13 members. Through the ACP Investment Facility, the Bank has committed \u20ac598 million. The latest tranche was a \u20ac50 million contribution, approved in December 2019. After cancellations, a total of \u20ac352 million was made available, with \u20ac281 million committed to 36 projects. The bulk of these commitments have been to financial intermediaries (37%), telecommunications infrastructure (18%) and industry (15%). Nigeria and Kenya have benefited most from the funds. INTERACT CLIMATE CHANGE FACILITY This facility was set up in 2011 by the Bank and the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement. It uses the same model as the European Financing Partners initiative, and supports renewable energy, energy efficiency and clean technologies in emerging countries by providing long-term financing. The Bank has committed \u20ac100 million to the \u20ac942 million fund through the Investment Facility. The Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement and 11 other European development finance institutions have contributed the rest. The Bank replenished its allocation to this facility in 2020 with an additional \u20ac50 million. The existing Bank commitments are valid until October 2022. As of 31 December 2020, 15 projects in the ACP region with a value of \u20ac198 million have either been approved or are under appraisal. The Bank is participating in five (of which two have already been approved and disbursed) of these projects through the Interact Climate Change Facility, committing \u20ac18.1 million. In addition, the Bank is exploring co-financing of other renewable energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa alongside the development bank of the Netherlands, FMO, the private sector development bank of France, Proparco, and other institutions. The bulk of climate change projects are in the wind (35%) and solar (49%) sectors. MUTUAL RELIANCE INITIATIVE The Mutual Reliance Initiative is a joint programme from the EIB, KfW and AFD. Established in 2013, it sees one institution take on the mantle of lead financier of a given project, and apply its standards and practices to the project, with the agreement of the others. This reduces the administrative burden on the project and enables it to proceed more quickly because essential tasks are carried out by one partner and not all partners. 27 operations have adopted the Mutual Reliance Initiative ",
        "45 PARTNERSHIPS approach since completion of the pilot phase. Four operations had to be withdrawn as the investment project stalled or the lenders\u2019 financing approach changed. The Bank is participating in 14 of the remaining 23 operations. The Bank is involved as lead financier in seven of these, including water sector projects in the Seychelles, Tanzania and Zambia, an electricity project in Mozambique and port infrastructure development in Kenya. Overall, the Mutual Reliance Initiative builds stronger ties with our partners AFD and KfW, and improves the effectiveness of European finance outside the European Union. The initiative facilitates the relationship with project promoters and inspires the design of other cooperation frameworks such as with the African Development Bank. PEER INSTITUTIONS In the context of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement, the multilateral development banks are committed to boosting financing for the Sustainable Development Goals, and the global fight against the climate crisis, by attracting finance from the private sector. This commitment has now focused on a more nuanced approach towards investment quality and high common standards. In 2020, the development banks released their first joint report on financing of these goals. This is part of a joint effort from the banks to devise a new, harmonised methodology to measure and report on SDG contributions. While the multilateral development banks are focusing on the mobilisation of finance from public and private financiers, this exercise also looks at the standards outlining how that money is used, the best strategic use of scarce concessional finance resources, the targeting of the poorest and most vulnerable people, and how the different SDGs are interlinked. The aim is to ensure no one is left behind, while also enhancing our understanding of project impact. We are playing a significant role in migration issues. The Bank can contribute further to the European Union Agenda on Migration and help with other international efforts to build resilience in the face of economic shocks and crises, including the hardships that arise from the forced displacement of people. The EIB focuses on the long-term investment needs of countries of origin, transit and destination of migrants and forcibly displaced people. We are not trying to curb or stop migration. We are working to support sustainable economic growth. Thus far, the Bank has played a key role in steering the multilateral development bank community in the areas of migration and forced displacement. The MDB Coordination Platform on Migration and Forced Displacement is helping to create more impact together on migration issues. The platform is managed by the European Investment Bank and the World Bank. The member banks have improved cooperation in four main areas: common frameworks, data and knowledge sharing, operational coordination and financial instruments. Coordination among development banks is particularly intense for climate action. The Bank tracks climate finance using definitions developed in cooperation with peer institutions. Five voluntary principles have been agreed upon: 1) committing to climate strategies; 2) managing climate risks; 3) promoting climate-smart objectives; 4) improving climate performance; and 5) accounting for climate action. As part of those efforts, the development banks are developing a common approach to meeting goals set out in the Paris Agreement. ",
        "46 2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN ACP AND OCT FINANCING WITH PARTNERS Trust funds Given the increasing importance of trust funds in financing for development, the Bank has set up a number of new ways to use donor funds for projects outside the European Union. The trust funds provide funding for technical assistance across the lifespan of projects, making them more appealing and less risky for the Bank and for other investors. The Bank\u2019s Partnership Platform for Funds provides a scalable structure to govern new trust funds and simplify the procedures. Currently the platform has six funds. The largest is the Economic Resilience Initiative Fund, which concerns projects in North Africa, the Middle East and the Western Balkans. The other five funds are active in the ACP regions, and are outlined below. The Water Sector Fund was established at the end of 2017 and has received commitments of \u20ac3.3 million from the Netherlands. This fund provides technical assistance to water projects in poor and emerging countries. The fund is looking at solutions such as promoting solar-driven water systems, enticing small entrepreneurs into water provision services and involving local institutional investors in clean water projects. By the end of 2020, the fund had approved four technical assistance operations: one in Niger, one in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe, and two in Malawi. The Niger project is vitally important for local people, and is explored in more detail below. One of the Malawi projects is especially notable because it explores the use of renewable energy to run water pumps. This technology could have significant implications globally by cutting emissions and increasing resilience in water supply. It is hoped that the fund can attract other donors so that financial instruments like loan guarantees and equity investments can be used to support water projects as well. The Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform supports private sector investment in climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, which remain underfunded on a global scale. The Luxembourg government has made \u20ac70 million available as subordinated funding, which will in turn entice other investors to participate in projects. It is hoped that other donors will also contribute to the platform. The platform is involved in three different funds that are active in the ACP regions. The Land Degradation Neutrality Fund is a $300 million facility, devised to reverse land degradation and rehabilitate territory, which will then be used for sustainable forestry and agriculture. The platform is also supporting the $250 million Climate Resilience Solutions Fund, known as CRAFT, which supports private sector solutions for climate adaptation projects around the world. Also benefiting from the platform\u2019s financing is the Access to Clean Power Fund, which has a target size of $200 million, and will contribute to the electrification of underserved homes and businesses through supporting small companies that provide renewable energy solutions ranging from off-grid to captive generation. All of these funds have also received financing from the Bank. The Financial Inclusion Fund was devised by the government of Luxembourg and is managed by the Bank. It was formally launched in November 2019. The Bank has a longstanding partnership with the country, especially in microfinance and financial inclusion. This fund supports technical assistance programmes and capacity building for microfinance institutions across Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, as well as Asia and Latin America. 15 operations have been approved. The fund provides financing where it is most needed: microenterprises and small businesses, notably those owned and run by women and young people, and those located in rural communities. Poor households, micro-entrepreneurs and small enterprises have trouble getting loans on good terms, particularly in remote rural areas. By supporting financial institutions, this fund will bring these services to more people. Luxembourg is currently the sole donor to the fund, with a contribution of \u20ac4.5 million. ",
        "47 PARTNERSHIPS The City Climate Finance Gap Fund , or Gap Fund, was established in 2020 to offer technical assistance for cities around the world and help them meet climate goals. It turns their ideas about climate action into strategies and finance-ready projects, and ultimately attracts more investment. The urban focus is important, as cities in developing countries are growing quickly, and it is estimated that $93 trillion worth of sustainable infrastructure will need to be built by 2030 to help control global warming. The Gap Fund is made up of two financing blocks, one managed by the European Investment Bank and Germany\u2019s development agency, Gesellschaft f\u00fcr internationale Zusammenarbeit, and the other by the World Bank. Both blocks provide technical assistance for project pre-preparation and preparation in climate change mitigation and adaptation projects in renewable energy, water supply and wastewater treatment, sustainable transport and energy efficiency. The Gap Fund has received pledges of a total of \u20ac55 million from Germany and Luxembourg. Out of this, the Bank is managing \u20ac23 million through a dedicated trust fund. The International Climate Initiative Fund , known as the IKI Fund, was set up in 2019 by the Bank and BMU, Germany\u2019s Federal Ministry of the Environment. With total pledges so far of \u20ac17 million, the IKI Fund provides grant financing for projects in climate change mitigation and adaptation around the world. These grants can take the form of technical assistance or financial instruments, notably partial portfolio guarantees and investments in junior tranches of layered funds. The overall aims of the fund are to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase partner countries\u2019 resilience to the effects of climate change by making projects in these fields more attractive to the Bank and other investors. Focus areas for the IKI Fund are sustainable transport, renewable energy and energy efficiency, as well as lowering the risks posed by climate change for agriculture, water and wastewater systems, energy, transport, coastal areas and rivers. The EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund provides grants for infrastructure projects in sub- Saharan Africa intended to reduce poverty and improve economic growth. The grants can support projects financed by the Bank as well as other investors. Its focus areas are energy, transport, water and information and communication technologies. By far the largest EIB-managed trust fund, this infrastructure fund was established in 2007 and received donor pledges of \u20ac813 million, supporting 123 operations. It has two major sectors of activity. The \u20ac483 million regional envelope helped fund cross-border and national infrastructure projects in the energy, transport, water and information and communications technology sectors. A separate \u20ac330 million envelope supports renewable energy and energy efficiency projects that are in line with the United Nations Sustainable Energy for All initiative. This fund is no longer accepting grant applications. ",
        "48 2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN ACP AND OCT IMPROVING WATER SUPPLIES IN NIGER Investing in water and sanitation projects across the ACP regions has long been a priority for the Bank, but the sector has many challenges. Improving the water supply in Niger\u2019s western border region is a perilous task. Militants have been active in the area for years and violence is common along the border with Mali and Burkina Faso. But Niger needs help to improve its water supply. The availability of clean drinking water is low by global standards, with large disparities between urban and rural areas, many of which are threatened by drought and desertification. Clean water is, of course, a necessity for healthy societies and economies. In the Tillab\u00e9ri region near the western border, 92% of the population lives in rural areas and there is a chronic shortage of clean water, especially during the hot season when temperatures often rise above 40 \u00baC. The Bank is working with the Niger water authority to find solutions for these problems, backed by the Water Sector Fund (see previous page) and supported by the Dutch government. Niger is one of 18 countries in sub-Saharan Africa on the World Bank\u2019s list of fragile regions. These are the places that require the most urgent investment in basic infrastructure. The EIB has signed loans to help improve water and sanitation in Niamey, capital of Niger. ",
        "49 PARTNERSHIPS A NECESSITY FOR DEVELOPMENT IN FRAGILE REGIONS Niger\u2019s water problems are still growing. In T\u00e9ra, a city of 30 000 inhabitants, only 40% of residents are connected to a functioning public water system. In 2018, Niger\u2019s water authority, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Patrimoine des Eaux du Niger, opened ten boreholes and installed a water treatment plant to supply T\u00e9ra and nearby areas with potable water. A year later, the water source dried up and the water treatment plant was forced to close. The country\u2019s water authority needs a tenfold increase in clean water provisions over the next 20 years just to keep up with T\u00e9ra\u2019s rapidly growing population. \u201cThe goal is to find a definitive solution to the city\u2019s water problems and provide water to nearby villages,\u201d says the managing director, Amadou Mamadou Sekou. ADDRESSING WATER SHORTAGE The impacts of safe water supplies go beyond health. Access to basic water services can help stabilise the political and security situation in Niger and reduce the number of people moving to Niamey, the capital or within the region. Economic and social development in the Tillab\u00e9ri region will help prevent radicalisation in a high-priority area for the government of Niger and the European Union. The Bank and Niger water officials are exploring two plans to improve water in T\u00e9ra. The first option is to rehabilitate the water reservoir outside the city. A second option is to treat and convey water from the Niger River, over 100 km to the east. This would also supply water to villages between T\u00e9ra and the Niger River. The Bank will also explore using solar energy to reduce operational costs. DONOR FUNDS FOR NIGER WATER DEVELOPMENT The Water Sector Fund is financing a study to identify the most sustainable technical solution. Karin Roelofs, head of the Water Division in the Dutch Foreign Ministry, says providing access to drinking water in countries like Niger is a priority for her team. \u201cInvestment in local infrastructure is needed to secure water supplies to secondary cities like T\u00e9ra,\u201d Roelofs says. \u201cBy working with the EIB through the Water Sector Fund, we are able to link such priorities to the Bank\u2019s financial and technical capacities.\u201d \u2022 Technical assistance to help improve water supply in remote areas \u2022 Exploring sustainable infrastructure \u2022 Improving security and quality of life ",

        "51 PARTNERSHIPS GRANTS AND LOANS WORK TOGETHER AFRICA INVESTMENT PLATFORM The Africa Investment Platform was created to provide grants for projects in sub-Saharan Africa from 2016 to 2020 under the European Fund for Sustainable Development. Infrastructure projects such as renewable energy and transport are eligible, as are small businesses and agriculture initiatives. In response to the European Commission\u2019s increased focus on blending grants and loans, the Bank secured grants for five operations in sub-Saharan Africa focusing on infrastructure and agriculture value chains. Further applications to the Africa Investment Platform received by the end of 2020, which is the deadline for funding under the current multiannual financial framework, are included in this platform\u2019s priority pipeline. However, given that blending funds for some regions have been exhausted under the current multiannual framework, there are a number of projects in the Bank\u2019s pipeline that are coming to maturity at a time when the availability of grant funds is uncertain, despite these projects being in line with European Union priorities. Under the European Fund for Sustainable Development guarantee, three funding applications were approved covering investments in sub-Saharan Africa. Further applications are expected to be launched under the 2021-2028 multiannual financial framework. With the agreement of the European Commission and the donors, returning funds in the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund, the predecessor to the Africa Investment Platform, will be available in the medium to long term to support projects in sub-Saharan Africa. CARIBBEAN INVESTMENT FACILITY This facility supports sustainable economic growth in the region by unlocking finance for infrastructure projects in transport, water and sanitation, energy and telecommunications. There are currently two EIB-led operations in the Dominican Republic that benefit from this facility\u2019s grants. One agreement to support an energy distribution and loss reduction programme was signed in 2015 with the European Commission for \u20ac9.33 million, and another grant supports post- disaster and climate change resilience intervention. The agreement for the latter operation was signed in December 2018 with the European Commission for \u20ac17 million in the form of technical assistance and an investment grant. Co-financing opportunities are also being sought with the Bank or other finance institutions. INVESTMENT FACILITY FOR THE PACIFIC This supports inclusive and sustainable growth in the Pacific region. It focuses on infrastructure projects dealing with climate change and green investments in the areas of energy, transport, water and sanitation, the environment and telecommunications. The facility also provides funding for small businesses. At present, the Bank, as lead financier, has two technical assistance operations under this facility for a total grant amount of \u20ac10 million. In Fiji, the technical assistance programme\u2019s goal is to make the island\u2019s power supply system more climate-resilient and also provide a project preparation study for hydropower development on the Qaliwana river. The latter operation was relaunched with the government of Timor-Leste in 2019 for project preparation and implementation. ",
        "52 2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN ACP AND OCT WORKING WITH THE UNITED NATIONS The Bank has two main streams of cooperation with the United Nations. We work with a number of UN agencies on broad and global thematic issues such as climate goals and the Sustainable Development Goals, and then cooperate with them in specific sectors and individual projects on the ground. Examples of this include working with the World Health Organization on the best ways to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, but also how to prevent and deal with future pandemics, and a formal partnership with Unicef to increase access to quality education for children, while also reducing the impact of climate change on them. In 2020, the Bank strengthened its relationship with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to work more closely on issues relating to sustainability awareness bonds, as well as recovery operations after the crisis in ACP countries. UNDP is playing a major role in encouraging development banks and institutions to help increase private sector finance, which further supports the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2020, the Bank and UNDP agreed to scale up support for countries facing emergency situations arising from natural disasters, pandemics and conflict. For more on how we work with the UNDP, see our interview with the agency\u2019s administrator, Achim Steiner, on p.53. The Bank has a longstanding partnership with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). We work together in the field of industrialisation and the development of associated value chains. In the ACP regions, this has been most prominent in Ethiopia, where the government has requested that the Bank finance two projects of significance for the national industrialisation strategy: Modjo Leather City and Agri-Business Parks. In the case of the former, UNIDO would work on the value chain aspects under funding from the European Commission. Other UN bodies that work with us include the UN Office for Project Services, the UN Capital Development Fund, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), UN-Habitat, and the UN Refugee Agency. ",
        "53 PARTNERSHIPS \u201cTHE WELL-BEING OF PEOPLE AND THE PLANET\u201d AN INTERVIEW WITH ACHIM STEINER ON THE UNITED NATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT Achim Steiner was appointed administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 2017. In this interview, he tells us how the agency is playing a vital role to fight the pandemic in some of the world\u2019s poorest regions, explains how his organisation and the European Investment Bank work together on the Sustainable Development Goals, and outlines how technology will be a key driver for Africa\u2019s future. What do you see as the UNDP\u2019s role, and how is this evolving? We operate across 170 countries on all continents with a workforce of 17 000 people. Since the outset of the pandemic we have been supporting governments, and learning from them, to prepare, respond and recover better. That includes everything from helping countries procure vital medical supplies to digital support to keep the lights of government on. We have continued to deliver on the ground in some of the toughest places in the world despite the constraints. We have colleagues in Saa\u2019na, Bangui and Mogadishu. The challenges can be onerous! We are now ramping up support for developing countries to move towards a green economy. This capacity is illustrated by our Climate Promise. The Climate Promise is being implemented in 118 countries, and is the world\u2019s largest offer of support for the enhancement of countries\u2019 climate pledges. We are helping developing countries to move away from fossil fuels and embrace clean, renewable technologies \u2014 towards a green economy that creates new jobs. In the wake of this pandemic, we have the opportunity to reimagine the economies and societies we want \u2014 the future of development. And we are seeing opportunities to accelerate innovative forms of governance, digital transformation, and green economies, while ensuring that social protection and equity are not something we only think about during crises. Since 2012, the European Investment Bank and UNDP have worked together on several operations \u2014 one notable example is the Ukraine early recovery programme. How have these experiences been, and how can they transfer to new operations in other regions, for instance in Africa? Our partnership model for Ukraine on early recovery focused on making investments in critical infrastructure in conflict-affected areas \u2014 including water and power supply systems as well as educational and health facilities, which were affected by decades of underinvestment and neglect. This can serve as an example to expand our collaboration in Africa, where UNDP has several early recovery and stabilisation initiatives, such as those in Lake Chad and the Sahel. The Bank announced its aim to provide new financial and technical support in 11 Sahel countries to back sustainable agriculture, clean energy, water, infrastructure and private sector financing. And UNDP has finalised its offer for the Sahel, with four pillars that are closely aligned with the areas that the Bank also identified as priorities. ",
        "54 2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN ACP AND OCT After an initial memorandum of understanding signed in 2016, our organisations explored further ways of working together in 2020. Has the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated partnerships? The pandemic has urged us to find innovative and rapid solutions to respond to countries\u2019 demands. In 2020, UNDP and EIB teams explored cooperation opportunities in more than 32 countries in three strategic sectors: strengthening the health sector, investing in digital infrastructure in Africa, and accompanying the green recovery. The challenges we are facing \u2014 COVID-19 and climate change \u2014 are of unprecedented scale. For a common framework to achieve the required transformational change, it will be essential for the EIB and UNDP, and more broadly Team Europe and the UN system, to work together. How has the COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the importance of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals? The COVID-19 pandemic is starting to reverse decades of progress made in human development and highlighted massive inequalities. Half of the world\u2019s population lacks access to essential health services and 3.6 billion people are still offline. Indeed, entire countries are being left behind when it comes to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. But we now have the opportunity to \u201cbuild forward better\u201d. This crisis has laid out \u2014 in the starkest way possible \u2014 just how interconnected our world is. A \u201cPeople\u2019s Vaccine\u201d is also the fastest way to end this pandemic. We must act in borderless solidarity to defeat the virus with a focus on people, planet, prosperity and peace. The pandemic is likely to change our approach to development. We see a significant shift towards renewable energy, economic diversification and technological adaptation, led by the private sector. UNDP is helping countries to reimagine the post-COVID-19 future, and fundamental structures are being set up to strengthen fiscal space at a time when resource flows diminish. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals were born out of an analysis of the major risks that all economies and societies are facing \u2014 and the need for integrated approaches that advance the well-being of people and planet hand-in-hand. Digitalisation was already hugely important for growth across Africa before the pandemic struck. Do you see it further changing and improving lives in the coming years? Technology can be a catalyst for transforming African economies and service delivery, as we have seen during the pandemic. It has helped to deliver health services, increase access to and quality of education and improve productivity in agriculture. Digitalisation is progressing fast in the financial sector and some countries, such as Kenya, are global leaders in mobile money. Leapfrogging in digitalisation is a must for Africa not only to take advantage of global development megatrends for its own economic transformation but also to avoid lagging behind. Governments have to facilitate these positive trends by developing the necessary infrastructure, including the provision of stable power supply, affordable broadband, digital skills development and improving access to capital, especially by startups. ",
        "55 PARTNERSHIPS UNDP is engaging with these issues from both a programmatic and policy perspective. Building upon our digital strategy, we\u2019re harnessing technology and innovation to deliver better results in the communities where we work and seeking opportunities to put transformative technologies in the hands of the poor and marginalised. An example here is the UNDP Accelerator Labs initiative. In Rwanda, our team worked with health authorities to deploy robots in COVID-19 treatment centres. The robots help to minimise contact between health workers and COVID-19 patients and to disinfect key locations like hospitals. Which other sectors do you see as growth areas for Africa? There are several sectors that are about to take off and have very high potential. The Africa Continental Free Trade Area, an agreement that could create a single market of 1.2 billion people, will create many openings. It will bring benefits to women, who represent 70% of cross-border traders in Africa. Agriculture and manufacturing could be critical here too. Technology and diversification will play important parts. In addition, moving away from fossil fuels in the medium to long term and prioritising a shift towards renewable energy, especially solar, makes practical sense from both an economic and environmental point of view. For regions like sub-Saharan Africa where half of secondary schools have no power \u2014 this new momentum will literally turn on the lights. For others, renewable, clean energy will help to increase access to services like affordable broadband \u2014 the \u201cnervous system\u201d of tomorrow\u2019s green economy. On a practical level, how can the EIB and UNDP\u2019s partnership improve development impact? How can it help both organisations as we seek to achieve our common goals in developing countries and fragile contexts? Our complementarity is clear. We share a framework for action \u2014 the Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 and bring to the table different sets of expertise and networks. UNDP, as the UN\u2019s development agency, help countries to develop institutional capabilities and build resilience in order to sustain development results. The EIB, as the European Union\u2019s lending arm, leverages the financing required for transformational change through various engagements with the private and public sectors. Together, we have a powerful combined offer of financial and policy support to ensure developing countries play a comprehensive role in a fair and inclusive global green recovery. UNDP and the EIB have also joined forces to define new standards at the global level. To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, we need $2.5 trillion of additional annual investment in developing countries. No amount of public funds and grants can bridge this gap. Cooperation between institutions like the EIB and UNDP contributes to building the right structures to crowd-in private sector finance so that everyone can help to shape a global green economy. ",

        "57 HOW WE WORK IN AFRICA, CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC HOW WE WORK IN AFRICA, CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC The European Investment Bank is one of the largest multilateral lenders in the world. We are active in around 160 countries, investing in projects that support sustainable development, create jobs and reduce poverty. The European Union sets high environmental and social standards, and we spread these values broadly. BEYOND LOANS The Bank stands apart in four areas: Long-term financing adapted to each project: We use five indicators to determine funding conditions: extension of the typical maturity, match with the asset\u2019s lifetime, local currency funding (which can account for up to 40% of the Investment Facility), grants and innovative features in the financial product. Technical assistance: We not only provide financing but also often contribute to improving a project\u2019s characteristics in business, developmental, social, environmental or corporate governance terms. Mobilising other financing: Our involvement in a project attracts other investors, particularly among European financial partners. Flexibility: We continually develop financing instruments to ensure our lending best meets borrowers\u2019 needs and addresses parts of the economy not supported by the private sector. Examples include the ACP Migration Package, the ACP Infrastructure Package, sustainability awareness bonds, climate awareness bonds and the Economic Resilience Initiative. ",
        "58 2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN ACP AND OCT SOURCES OF FUNDING The Bank has various instruments to finance different kinds of operations in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. In general, our own resources are used for the public sector, mainly in the form of senior loans given to large infrastructure projects. These funds can also be used for intermediated loans given to banks, which then give out many smaller loans to clients. The envelope for our own resource lending is backed by guarantee agreements between the Bank and the individual EU countries. The ACP Investment Facility is geared towards private sector investment. In addition to senior and intermediated loans, we also carry out equity and quasi-equity investments, junior and subordinated loans, and provide guarantees, interest-rate subsidies and technical assistance. The Investment Facility\u2019s resources come directly from the EU Member States under the 9th, 10th and 11th European Development Funds. The Impact Financing Envelope is a separate window of the Investment Facility, and is used for higher-impact projects that bring about higher risks with higher returns. It reaches initiatives that go beyond the financial, geographical or sectoral scope of other instruments. It can also be used for loans to financial intermediaries in riskier markets, or for projects in riskier sectors. GOVERNANCE: THE INVESTMENT FACILITY COMMITTEE The Investment Facility Committee was set up in 2002. It is made up of representatives from each EU state and the European Commission. Representatives of the General Secretariat of the Council, the European External Action Service, and the United Kingdom are also invited to this committee\u2019s meetings as observers. The chairwoman of the committee is the Finnish representative, Anne af Ursin. The Bank supports the committee with technical and financial expertise, and by providing secretariat services. The committee sets policy and strategic matters concerning the Bank\u2019s activity in ACP states and Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs). Members also give opinions on financing proposals from the Bank\u2019s own resources and committee resources prior to their submission to the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors. The committee guides and supports the Bank in its financing for a broad range of projects in ACP states and OCTs. The Investment Facility Committee has an important role in the project approval process, and provides an excellent forum in which the Bank can have in-depth discussions on non-EU activities with Member States, our partners at the European Commission, and the observers to the committee.

As a public institution, the Bank must be open about the ways we make decisions and implement European Union policies in partner countries. We are accountable to citizens and must remain credible. Our guiding principles are openness, good governance, participation and democratic accountability. Since 2014, we have been publishing data in line with the International Aid Transparency Initiative standard, an initiative to improve the transparency of development activities. In 2014, we also launched our public register. It contains the social and environmental project assessments of our operations. ",
        "60 2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN ACP AND OCT THE RESULTS MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK Since 2012, the Bank has used the Results Measurement (ReM) Framework to track the impact of projects outside the European Union. The framework helps us understand our contribution to European Union and country objectives, and it allows us to understand the difference that European Investment Bank involvement makes compared to what local markets can offer. The framework strengthens our appraisals of projects and helps us monitor the whole project cycle. At the beginning of the project cycle, we identify indicators for the project and outline the expected results. We then monitor the project at different stages of its life. For infrastructure projects, for example, we measure the results when the project is complete and we do this again three years later. A more detailed framework is used for projects financed under our Impact Financing Envelope. Since this framework was introduced, about 800 projects have gone through ReM assessment at appraisal. Financial sector projects and some infrastructure projects approved under the framework are now reaching completion. As far as possible, we have harmonised ReM indicators with those of other international financial institutions to simplify clients\u2019 reporting requirements for co-financed operations. We have also harmonised indicators with the European Commission within the framework of the European Union \u201cblending platform\u201d for development projects that require a mix of grants and loans. We work continuously with other development agencies and financial institutions to improve the coordination and harmonisation of results indicators. From 2021 onwards, the ReM framework and the 3 Pillar Assessment (the Bank\u2019s impact assessment for operations within the European Union) will be incorporated into one Additionality and Impact Measurement (AIM) framework. The idea is to harmonise project indicators across all regions, and make them easier to compare. The new framework will take into account the different economic and social contexts in which the Bank operates, and further make sure that the projects we support match our goals and improve lives across all regions of activity.

Rates the quality and soundness of the operation based on the expected results. Rates the expected Bank financial and technical contribution beyond the market alternative. THE REM FRAMEWORK A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING: WORKING WITH THE GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT NETWORK The Bank is investing in in-depth research on selected projects or portfolios to deepen its understanding of impact at the level of final beneficiaries. For example, in a pilot programme carried out in partnership with the Global Development Network, the Bank assembled a set of researchers from Africa and the Caribbean to carry out impact studies of private sector projects in Africa, focusing on impact investment. The network brought in globally renowned experts to provide technical advice to the programme and to ensure that the studies are carried out with the maximum rigour and using up-to-date methods. This approach has boosted the capacity of the research communities in Africa and the Caribbean, and has been a valuable learning experience for the Bank and its clients. So far, the programme has supported researchers from Ethiopia, Rwanda, Senegal, Mali, Cameroon, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and The Gambia, and four studies from the first of three cycles have been published on the Bank website, with further studies to be published in 2021. The researchers\u2019 findings bring a different perspective on our understanding of our development impact, and therefore can help the Bank to improve its effectiveness in development. EIB investment helped to install wind farms in Cape Verde, bringing electricity to more people and businesses on the archipelago. ",
        "62 2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN ACP AND OCT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND INTEREST-RATE SUBSIDIES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE Blending loans with grants, including grants for technical assistance, enables the Bank to bring its expertise to projects and to provide guidance on how to finance them. On the local level, the Bank\u2019s technical assistance programmes develop the skills of our local partner banks, which can then work directly with small businesses or microenterprises. The value of technical assistance is also evident in the public sector, where our guidance helps the implementers of public infrastructure projects conduct feasibility studies, flesh out detailed designs or assess a project\u2019s environmental impact. 21 operations were signed under the ACP Cotonou Subsidy envelope in 2020 for a total of \u20ac28.7 million. Notably, these include initiatives in sub-Saharan Africa supporting women\u2019s economic empowerment, digitalisation and the Clean Oceans Initiative. Nine operations were approved for a total of \u20ac11.4 million. These include water and sanitation programmes, digitalisation and support for startups and entrepreneurs. INTEREST-RATE SUBSIDIES Interest-rate subsidies are explicitly called for in the Cotonou Agreement and are vital to making some public sector projects bankable. Like other blending instruments, interest-rate subsidies relate in particular to concessionality requirements imposed upon many ACP countries. Restrictive borrowing conditions apply under debt-relief programmes like the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative, a group of 39 developing countries with high levels of debt and poverty, which are eligible for special assistance. Accordingly, interest-rate subsidies address debt sustainability to bring real added value. The Bank takes into account the correct concessional rules to avoid over-subsidising projects. In 2020, 19 operations were signed in the ACP regions, including the OCTs, adding up to a total subsidy of \u20ac34 million. 21 operations were approved, for a total of \u20ac48 million, also including the OCTs.

Global Partners also implements ACP activities under special mandates. In addition, staff in the projects directorate, the general secretariat, mandate management department, transaction management and restructuring, monitoring, equity and microfinance, trust funds and blending and legal services help ACP operations succeed. At the end of 2020, there were 109 staff members working on ACP operations. They are based at the Bank\u2019s Luxembourg headquarters and in the external regional offices and desks in the ACP regions. The Bank\u2019s external representations play several vital roles. They promote and facilitate the Bank\u2019s mission and activities, covering institutional relations, business origination and follow-up through the project cycle, and manage relationships at all levels in the public and private sectors. The Bank has six regional representations covering West, East and Central Africa, Southern Africa and the Indian Ocean region, the Caribbean region and the Pacific. The representation in Addis Ababa covers Ethiopia and relations with the African Union. The first two Bank desks for the ACP region were set up in 2017 in Barbados and in Dakar to strengthen our local outreach. When possible, the Bank shares space with the European Union Delegation. Such arrangements are in place for Abidjan, Addis Ababa, Nairobi, Santo Domingo, Yaound\u00e9, Barbados and Dakar.

Financing under these agreements is provided from the European Development Fund \u2014 EU countries\u2019 budgets \u2014 and the Bank\u2019s own resources, which we raise on international capital markets. The Bank is entrusted with the management of the Investment Facility, a revolving fund that meets the financing needs of investment projects in the regions with a broad range of flexible risk-bearing instruments. To support projects further, the Bank provides grants in the form of interest-rate subsidies and technical assistance. Under the Cotonou Agreement (signed in 2000, revised in 2005 and 2010) our main objectives are poverty reduction, sustainable development, and the integration of ACP countries into the world economy (Article 19.1). The agreement further provides that we aim at achieving rapid and sustained job-creating economic growth, developing the private sector, increasing employment, improving access to productive economic activities and resources, and fostering regional cooperation and integration (Article 20.1). In line with the EU Consensus on Development, the UN Millennium Development Goals and now the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the Bank\u2019s activities in the ACP support projects that deliver sustainable social, economic and environmental benefits while ensuring strict accountability for public funds.
