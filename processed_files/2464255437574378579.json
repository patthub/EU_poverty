        "UPDATED DRAFT Macroeconomic relevance of energy IMPORTANCE OF THE ENERGY SECTOR In Croatia, according to national statistics, the weight of the energy sector in total value added was slightly above the EU average in 2012 at 2.1% compared to 2%. At the same time the share of total employment that the energy sector accounts for is double that of the EU27 average, at 1.2% against 0.6. According to EurObserv'ER, in 2013, the share of direct and indirect renewable energy related employment in total employment of the economy in Croatia was at about 0.22%, below the EU average of 0.53%. Source: European Commission, based on EurObserv'ER and EUROSTAT TRADE BALANCE OF ENERGY PRODUCTS Croatia's energy trade deficit is significantly larger than that of the EU28 average and it has slightly increased between 2006 and 2014. The largest component remains the oil trade deficit, however the gas trade deficit has also increased over the period. In spite of the growing energy trade deficit, the country's current account has turned from a deficit of almost 7% to a small surplus of about 1% in 2014 following a sharp import contraction.

        "2 Towards an Energy Union - Croatia 1. Energy Security, solidarity and trust ENERGY MIX The energy mix of Croatia is slightly different than the EU28 average, with a lower share of solid fuels and a higher share of petroleum, gases and renewables. Compared to 1995, the share of petroleum and products decreased (from 52% to 43% of the gross inland energy consumption), while the share of solid fuels and renewable energy increased, by 6 and 3 percentage points respectively. The share of gases increased slightly, from 30 to 31% of the energy mix. Gross inland energy consumption in 2013 Source: European Commission, based on EUROSTAT IMPORT DEPENDENCY Croatia has an import dependency similar with the EU28 average for fossil fuels. The import dependency is much lower for gas, although it increased over the last 8 years. Croatia has a long tradition of gas production by which it covers slightly above 60% of its annual domestic demand. It has to be noted that domestic consumption varies significantly depending on the period of the year and that, in winter, national consumption is significantly higher than domestic production. This variability has to be taken into consideration when assessing Croatia's security of supply. The overall country supplier concentration index is relatively low. However, the energy trade deficit, expressed in percentage of GDP, is high, above the one of the EU28. ",

In electricity, there are several Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) planned in Croatia, including two electricity clusters, a high voltage transmission line between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and a high voltage transmission line between Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia. Considerable investment is expected. In gas, 3 projects out of 33 key security of supply infrastructure projects listed in the European Energy Security Strategy (EESS) are relevant for Croatia: the LNG terminal in Krk and connecting pipelines (which would open across European North-South corridor), the reverse flow enabling gas flows from Croatia to Hungary and IAP, a new interconnector part of the Balkan Gas Ring and connected to the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP).

There is currently no commodity exchange or gas hub. Wholesale gas trading is based on bilateral contracts.

The decomposition shows that while heat and electricity taxation are extremely low, the transport fuel taxation is much higher than the EU average. This difference was somewhat reduced in 2012, as transport fuel taxation as a % of GDP in Croatia were reduced by more than 20% compared to the 2005 levels. Consequently the overall energy and transport taxation as a share of GDP became more aligned with the EU average. ",

Post-2020 Energy and Climate policy Strategy COMPREHENSIVE MEDIUM TO LONG-TERM STRATEGY (post-2020) FOR CLIMATE AND ENERGY \uf0b7 Croatia has not yet established a medium to long-term climate and energy strategy for the post-2020 period. The Energy Strategy, adopted by Croatia in 2009 , includes both energy and climate-related objectives and covers the period up to 2020. \uf0b7 A comprehensive Low Carbon Development Strategy for the period until 2030, with a view to 2050, is planned to be adopted in 2015. The strategy is expected to set targets and measures necessary to achieve medium-to-long-term energy and climate-related objectives. \uf0b7 In 2014 the Croatian Parliament has adopted a new legislative package on energy efficiency including the Energy Efficiency Act . The Ministry of Construction and Physical Planning drafted a proposal of the \"Long-Term Strategy for Mobilising Investment in the Renovation of the National Building Stock of the Republic of Croatia\" to encourage investment in the refurbishment of the national building stock by 2050.

Croatia is a member of the High Level Group on Central East South Europe Connectivity (CESEC) together with Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Slovak Republic and Slovenia. The objective of the High Level Group is to establish a regional priority infrastructure roadmap and advance its implementation in order to develop missing infrastructure and improve security of gas supplies.

        "11 Towards an Energy Union - Croatia 8. Cohesion policy contribution The EU Cohesion policy provides for important investment possibilities to implement energy policy objectives in Croatia which will be complemented by national public and private co-financing, aiming at optimal leverage. It also ensures integrated territorial solutions to challenges by supporting capacity building and territorial cooperation, including the Danube Region and Adriatic and Ionian Region macro-regional strategies in which Croatia takes part. Internal Energy Market: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest some EUR 20 million in smart electricity distribution grids in Croatia. These investments are expected to contribute to around 5 800 additional users connected to smart grids. Energy efficiency: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest some EUR 402 million in energy efficiency improvements in public and residential buildings and in enterprises, as well as in high- efficiency cogeneration and district heating in Croatia. A further estimated EUR 810 million will be invested in supporting the move towards an energy-efficient, decarbonised transport sector. These investments are expected to contribute to around 10 000 households with improved energy consumption classification and a decrease of around 55 100 000 kWh per year of decreased primary energy consumption of public buildings, as well as to around 80 km of reconstructed or upgraded railway lines and 250 km of improved inland waterways. Decarbonisation: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest some EUR 95 million in renewable energy in Croatia. Research, Innovation and Competitiveness: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest significantly in R&I and in SME competitiveness in Croatia. This will be based on the national strategy for smart specialisation. For Croatia, the draft strategy includes a focus on energy and sustainable environment as well as transport and mobility among the selected priorities. At this stage, at least EUR 40 million is foreseen for investments in R&I and adoption of low-carbon technologies in Croatia, but this might increase further in line with the evolving content of the smart specialisation strategy.
