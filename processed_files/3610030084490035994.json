        "Live & Learn November 2011 03 What kind of vocational education and training should be provided? This question has a simple answer: it should be good quality and relevant. Performance based management of vocational education and training aims, amongst other things, at achieving that, but without going into detail, this answer is not enough. Questions such as \u2018How can it be achieved?\u2019 or \u2018Who is in charge?\u2019 are even more important. As with many public policies, the expectation of transparency and public accountability has increased, so good quality and relevant public policy is now, more than ever, the goal. And evidence- based policy making is part of the solution. In many ways, knowledge is beginning to play a new role in policy: we can now distinguish post-bureaucratic from traditional bureaucratic regimes and show that each presupposes a specific kind of knowledge and a specific way of using it. The discovery and identification of missing knowledge is a key aspect of the paradigm shift. Policy-makers have to have the ability to link scientific evidence and political planning. Appropriate knowledge about the proper tools and mechanisms for reaching policy goals should become available in the countries. Additionally, knowledgeable actors who could diffuse and mediate the new policy knowledge at different levels have to be empowered. In fewer countries than before, policy- makers are at the top-centre of government; there is a shift from a pyramid system, strongly hierarchical and centralised, to a more subtle one. A network system with vertical and horizontal interactions is what is wanted. The government and the state bodies should change the nature of their role by cooperating with non-state actors, social partners, other civil society representatives, interest groups, etc. These changes do not involve the disappearance of the nation state, only a change to its role. Thus, a new approach is needed, a more complex and less rigid one, able to reconcile general interests with multiple specific interests, and to redefine relations between the centre and component units. This is why the concepts of governance, good governance and multi-level governance have appeared. The vertical dimension of multi-level governance - the interactions among the actors on different territorial levels - does not mean decentralisation at any price ! We advocate functional reforms that analyse, for each function of vocational education and training, who is doing what, what is the quality level and the cost of results. Functional reforms have to be evaluated for effectiveness and efficiency. The horizontal dimension of multi-level governance suggests a network society in which multiple interdependent actors contribute to the delivery of public services. In this case the professionalism of each actor is key i.e. the right mix of multi-level interactions in multi-level governance whereby, levels are loyal to each other. Practice should be cleared by the political decision making process. With its new authority, the state has the role and the responsibility to ensure this environment and to secure the empowerment and the professionalism of the multiple actors involved.

        "Live & Learn November 2011 04 Profile Around the world, there is much more consensus on qualification frameworks than there was just two years ago when the ETF organised its first major conference on the topic in Brussels. By the end of 2012, all countries in the EU are expected to have a framework in operation and most of the surrounding countries will have adopted or started planning one. The ETF conference \u2018Qualifications Frameworks from Concept to Implementation\u2019, held in Brussels on 6 and 7 October, showed that developments in this field are indeed moving fast. Very fast. While in 2009 the event discussed the rationale for frameworks of qualifications, by 2011 focus had moved towards implementation arrangements and implications for institutions and systems. Ahead of us are some crucial years during which professionals in many of our partner countries will need all the support they can get from an international community of colleagues. Precisely for that reason, the ETF used the meeting to launch its Qualifications Platform, an online community of professionals engaged in the developing and implementing frameworks of qualifications. They were given some clear advice along the way: \u201cThere is no ideal model,\u201d said Gordon Clark, summarising the two days of discussions, \u201ceach [NQF] model has its own context and derived merits. There are certainly elements, such as coordination and communication, and stages that are common in most scenarios but the process is never completed and therefore international transparency on the different experiences is essential.\u201d His words precisely echo the key conclusions of an ETF study that provided the empirical basis for the conference. Published as a working document which will be finalised with input from the meeting, \u2018Implementation arrangements for national frameworks of qualifications and the role of stakeholders and institutions\u2019 is an analysis of progress and developments in ten very different countries, including EU Member States, partner countries and countries on different continents. Practical and concrete tools Back in Brussels, Clark reminded people that \u201cqualification frameworks are not just economic tools but also social tools, to address issues in society and, more importantly, to help individuals.\u201d QUALIFICATION FRAMEWORKS: FROM CONCEPT TO PRACTICE \u201cQUALIFICATION FRAMEWORKS ARE NOT JUST ECONOMIC TOOLS BUT ALSO SOCIAL TOOLS, TO ADDRESS ISSUES IN SOCIETY AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, TO HELP INDIVIDUALS\u201d Gordon Clark reported that greater international transparency over experience with qualifications frameworks is needed Photo: ETF/EUP & Images ",
        "Live & Learn November 2011 05 This sentiment was echoed by Stefan F\u00fcle, Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy. \u201cQualifications frameworks offer practical and concrete tools [...] to allow people to maximise their potential,\u201d he said in his video address to the conference. DG Education and Culture director Pierre Mairesse warned however that what we have developed in Europe over the past few years is largely institutional. \u201cAlthough we are entering a new phase, where relations between sub-systems, cooperation between countries and the transition from education to work are growing in importance, this is all still fairly institutional,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need impact on the ground now. We need to disseminate the qualifications framework principles for use by providers and users of qualifications. We need to have an impact on individuals,\u201d he added. But he showed he could be seduced by the promise that broader international cooperation holds in a globalising world. \u201cCould we move beyond even regional frameworks and move, perhaps together with UNESCO, towards a worldwide framework for referencing qualifications?\u201d he wondered. Words: Ard Jongsma, ICE Pierre Mairesse spoke of the need to move from institutional frameworks to ones that have an impact on the individual Photo: ETF/Juha Roininen - EUP & Images What do qualifications frameworks mean to you? The debate on frameworks of qualifications usually takes place at a very abstract level. Frameworks are meant to put qualifications in perspective, promote transparency and deliver relevance. But what does this all mean for young people around the world who struggle to find work or relevant education? Various experts in the field gave us their opinion. Joseph Samuels is the deputy CEO of the South African Qualifications Authority. \u201cWe had four reasons to establish a framework,\u201d he says, \u201cwe needed a truly national system of education and training, improved access and mobility, improved quality and to support those that had been discriminated against.\u201d These are all issues that on paper should help both the country and individuals. But are they succeeding? \u201cChange takes time and resources. In the last years, access has approached 100%. But only two-thirds leave education with a qualification.\u201d It is the other two-thirds that need to be addressed and the structural work to encapsulate all education and training into a comprehensive national framework has helped to map the areas that most urgently need attention. \u201cWe now concentrate our efforts on making workplaces centres of learning and making sure that people make the right choices. We broadcast radio programmes in nine indigenous languages and have established a free helpline that is open to all, but addresses young people in particular.\u201d David Kereselidze has been at the forefront of the development of a framework of qualifications in Georgia. According to him, it has above all been a tool for transparency and reform. \u201cIn all its simplicity, it describes the system,\u201d he says. This has showed many of its weaknesses and has helped to target reforms. \u201cFor young people in the country, this has had implications that cannot be underestimated. It has supported social mobility, particularly because it made possible the recognition of prior learning. But it also helped us to explain to people that VET is important, by showing what education actually leads to what professions.\u201d Has it worked? \u201cThis year was the first time that professional education enrolled the majority of Georgian students.\u201d In Iceland, the prime aim of the qualification framework has been making the system more transparent, according to \u00d3lafur Kristj\u00e1nsson, an advisor to the education ministry of Iceland. \u201cWe want to encourage more people to seek education according to their capabilities, both by making clear what pathways they can follow and by better explaining the opportunities offered by initial choices,\u201d says Kristj\u00e1nsson. \u201cObviously, we expect that simply clarifying these pathways and opportunities, or the lack of them, will also generate new pathways and opportunities.\u201d \u25a0 The Qualifications Platform is a restricted community for specialists, so users will need a login and password to join.

        "Live & Learn November 2011 06 Feature BEATING THE DRUM FOR VOCATIONAL TRAINING Parents, society, peer pressure all push young people towards higher education while vocational education options, by comparison, are often seen as life in the slow lane. This is not a fair or accurate perception and vocational education and training managers and professionals across Europe and its partner countries are showing why - through a range of ground- breaking promotional campaigns. From Russia to the Czech Republic, Denmark to Jordan, advertising campaigns are demonstrating the skills that can be acquired, the career and earnings achieved through vocational education and training, a new survey by the European Training Foundation has found. Social pressure in Russia In Russia \u2013 where vocational education and training suffers from social pressure towards higher education and elite studies such as law, economics and business \u2013 Moscow city education officials decided to do something about it. Skills shortages in key economic sectors, including catering, mechanics and other essential cogs in a major world capital, gave urgency to a public advertising and promotional campaign last year that championed vocational education and training at a time when the city was celebrating 70 years of professional education in Russia. The way the Moscow campaign was packaged and managed was heavily influenced by cultural perceptions of advertising, Irina Yakovleva, deputy head of vocational education for Moscow said. \u201cWord of mouth is much more effective than radio or television. People get the message straight away and believe each other.\u201d It sometimes seems as if the choice graduating secondary school students face - further education or higher education - is like the race between the hare and the tortoise. A promotional campaign is being planned to tackle low female participation in the labour market in Jordan Photo: ETF/Salah Malkawi ",
        "Live & Learn November 2011 07 Most of the promotion was done through events at vocational schools, newspaper, radio and television reports, a few city-wide street banners and a grand music and song finale at a concert in the Kremlin. Promotional paper bags, books, badges and awards for veterans of vocational education all contributed to a campaign that produced a viral buzz throughout the city. See the case study on p.8 for more information on the Moscow promotional campaign. Sweeping changes in the Czech Republic In the Czech Republic, sweeping changes to vocational education took 800 different specialisms and remoulded them into 260 clearly defined skills groups. Dubbed Project Curriculum S, the promotional campaign was aimed at a professional audience. The campaign slogan \u201cWe help schools with modern education\u201d was one it was felt could be understood by all target groups. Vocational schools and social partners played a key role in PR activities \u2013 by producing their own leaflets, writing copy for professional journals and local newspapers, promoting the curricular reforms to officials, employers, trade associations, parents and prospective students in their region. \u201cThis was and is a multi-level PR campaign,\u201d said Irena Palanova, head of the Department of International Cooperation at the National Institute for technical vocational education and manager of the national project on curricular reform. Better jobs and salaries in Denmark A more student-targeted campaign in Denmark put forward the advantages of taking the vocational route to good jobs and salaries. Prompted by a Danish government target to increase uptake of upper secondary education, Danish organisation Danske Erhvervsskoler\u2019s \u20ac3m campaign \u201cFlere fagfolk, tak!\u201d (More professionals please!) ran on radio, television and new media. Aimed both at boosting the popularity of vocational education and training with young people and encouraging companies to offer more internships, the campaign \u2013 designed by youth-oriented communications agency JuniorPeople \u2013 was a big hit. On this page, two examples of the literature produced for the Russian campaign. ",
        "Live & Learn November 2011 08 Feature FOR WHOM THE GONG TOLLS: MOSCOW MEDALS FOR VOCATIONAL EXCELLENCE Russians like to be given medals and orders. They love the pomp and circumstance, the attention and glamour that go with it. That is why one of the unique features of Moscow\u2019s innovative VET promotional campaign last year was the handing out of a select few professional education gongs. It was a key component of a hugely popular and successful campaign, Etapi Bol\u2019shovo Puti (Milestones on a long path). It was launched in 2009 after a city wide college amalgamation process that reduced the number of colleges to 88 and combined specialisms. The aim was to explain that colleges now offered a wide range of courses to suit all needs and skills levels, offering good prospects of getting a job. City advertising campaign The campaign kicked off with an outdoor advertising campaign \u2018Ti nuzhin gorodu!\u2019 - The city needs you! This was followed by a wide range of print articles, television programmes, leaflets, brochures and other materials. Exhibitions, shows, the award of bronze medals to 251 people, including 88 \u2018veterans\u2019 of the vocational education and training system (one for each of the city\u2019s vocational training institutes, a notably diplomatic decision) and the opening of the city\u2019s first ever Museum of the History of Vocational Education, also featured. More than 5,500 people attended the grand finale, a jubilee evening concert marking 70 years of vocational education and training in Russia held at the State Kremlin Palace of Congresses, situated within Moscow\u2019s world famous Kremlin. Vocational applications went up over the course of the campaign: 2009-10 saw a 17% increase in full time equivalent students; 2010-11, a 24% increase, and this year an estimated 30% increase. There is increased activity in existing college-workplace partnerships and a growing trend for career professionals to volunteer as visiting lecturers at vocational training colleges. Perhaps they hope they\u2019ll get a medal\u2026.

Planning a campaign in Jordan An ambitious campaign is planned in Jordan, where a coalition chaired by the Ministry of Labour that includes the Employment-Technical Vocational Education and Training Council (representing all the relevant ministries), Al-Balqa University and chambers of commerce and industry, aims to bring more women into the labour market by reforming technical vocational education and training and changing social and gender attitudes. Currently the labour market participation rate for women in Jordan is just 14% - the lowest in the Middle East - even though women tend to outnumber and outperform men in education. Still a work in progress, \u20ac113,000 has been spent on the as yet unnamed project with a further \u20ac378,000 pledged by the World Bank as seed money for implementation. Although no decision has been made on which media to use to get the message across, options include the use of social networking sites, community based initiatives and education entertainment such as dramas, sitcoms, cartoons or interactive talk shows for television or radio that incorporate desired social messages. \u201cChanging people\u2019s behaviour may take decades to do but once you start working on this, you start moving upwards,\u201d said Saad Darwazeh, managing director of Prisma Marketing and Communication, the company commissioned by the Jordanian Ministry of Labour to develop and implement the campaign. \u25a0 Words: Nick Holdswoth, ICE ",

Graduating from Turin University with a degree in Russian in 1986, Crestani then did a diploma on Russian poet and novelist Alxander Pushkin at Moscow\u2019s Pushkin Institute. She was a witness to Russia in the thick of Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s experiment with communism, perestroika (rebuilding) and glasnost (freedom). Those reforms would prove too little too late and by 1991 change would sweep through Russia, Central Asia and Eastern Europe. \u201cMy professional life spans the collapse of the empire,\u201d says Crestani. \u201cThis has given me the chance to see with my own eyes how the daily life of people can change and to understand how important freedom is.\u201d Crestani joined the ETF in 1995 after working as an editor, translator and event organiser for cultural and film organisations in Turin.

        "10 Live & Learn November 2011 TAJIKISTAN LOOKS FOR MOVES ON MIGRANTS Country Focus \uf0bd Tajikistan Spend any time in Moscow or other major Russian cities and you may notice how many Central Asian men are working on building sites, as street sweepers and \u2018dvorniki\u2019 \u2013 caretakers of the apartment block courtyards that form one of the most ubiquitous types of communal open spaces in the country. Many of them are from Tajikistan. Twenty years after the collapse of the Soviet Union and nearly 15 years after the end of the bitter ethnic and tribal civil war that tore Tajikistan apart, endemic poverty and an economy that struggles to find jobs for half its workforce means migrant labour is critical. Fifty percent of Tajikistan\u2019s annual gross domestic product, around US$1.7 billion, is sent home each year from the estimated one million, mostly male, migrant workers. The vast majority of those men work in Russia where wages are seven times higher than at home. The sheer size of this migrant workforce \u2013 representing more than one-tenth of the entire Tajikistan population of 7.6 million \u2013 makes it a key factor which shapes current employment and training policies. Migration is seen as both a positive factor, as a source of economic and political stability, as the absent migrant workers can reduce social tensions at home by creating job opportunities for those left behind. It is also negative because of its adverse impact on families left behind and because few skills picked up abroad, apart from building and construction qualifications, are relevant to the Tajikistan economy. Now the Tajikistan government, with the help of the European Training Foundation, the World Bank and other donor agencies, has begun to formulate long-term strategic policies to reform the internal labour market to ensure Tajikistan is less reliant upon exporting migrant labour. Jamshed Kuddusov, director of Dushanbe\u2019s Socservice Information and Research Centre, which works with the ETF in implementing labour market, policy and vocational education research, observes that, the \u201cproblem of outflow of labour migrants will not be solved within the next ten years.\u201d The author of a major ETF report, Labour market review - Tajikistan , published last year, he notes that only through the implementation of a new national strategy on labour market development through 2020, approved \u201cENDEMIC POVERTY AND AN ECONOMY THAT STRUGGLES TO FIND JOBS FOR HALF ITS WORKFORCE MEANS MIGRANT LABOUR IS CRITICAL\u201d Tajikistan needs to develop its industry, among other sectors Photo: ETF/F.

        "11 Live & Learn November 2011 TAJIKISTAN LOOKS FOR MOVES ON MIGRANTS by the Tajikistan government in June this year, \u201ccan we stabilise the quantity of labour migrants.\u201d With a rapidly growing population \u2013 the working age population increased by 41% between 1998 and 2007 at a time when the labour market expanded just 19% - and a VET system that until 2005 was chronically underfunded and even now struggles to offer places to just 45% of school leavers, Tajikistan is facing major structural challenges to reforming its labour market. The rapid rise in young working age people \u2013 half of them women \u2013 \u201crequires intensive growth in the number of workplaces,\u201d says Kuddusov. \u201cWe need to develop business in the country; to really improve the business environment, industry, the power sector, tourism, services and farming, particularly the processing of agricultural products,\u201d he adds. None of this can be achieved without an improvement in professional training and vocational education, although sounding a note of caution that will surprise no one familiar with the education sector in Central Asia and other parts of the former Soviet Union, Kuddusov adds: \u201cThe main deterrent [to such developments] is universal corruption.\u201d One reason for the poor level of skilled technicians in Tajikistan is the endemic culture of paying bribes to pass exams. Students also often drop out of VET after choosing inappropriate courses or applying simply to avoid serving in the army. With corruption or without it, the high level of labour force growth, widespread unemployment \u2013 officially (and understated) 7% - and an increasing tendency to people taking second jobs to supplement low wages in their main place of work, means there is a need to create 150,000 new jobs every year. Employment would need to grow at 7% annually, although current figures show it is increasing at eight times lower than that rate at just 0.9%. The need for vocational training and specific programmes to help the school- to-work transition remains a pressing one in a country with an annual per capita income of just US$ 2,000. Next year the ETF plans to launch a project that involves a survey on school- to-work transition to provide an evidence base for better policies to address this key area. Building on the most recent work in this field, a study by the Centre for Strategic Studies attached to the Executive Office of the President of Tajikistan that surveyed more than 4,000 school leavers in 28 urban areas and districts, the ETF will undertake a more detailed investigation. Kuddusov observes: \u201cIt is necessary to develop professional training and to determine who to train and in which fields,\u201d he says. Key objectives should include training for entrepreneurship and developing an efficient system for helping young people \u201cchoose a trade properly\u201d through the creation of a \u201cnational system of vocational counselling of youth and career formation, and for adults to facilitate lifelong learning and trade transition.\u201d Without efforts to change the structure of Tajikistan\u2019s labour and training market, the country is likely to remain locked into a system of a diaspora labour force for many years to come. \u25a0 Words: Nick Holdsworth, ICE \u201cIT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND TO DETERMINE WHO TO TRAIN AND IN WHICH FIELDS\u201d Jamshed Kuddusov, director of Dushanbe\u2019s Socservice Information and Research Centre Photo: ETF/A.

Winning generally involves having a particular gift \u2013 ruthless guile is useful \u2013 but it is really the legwork involved in building the proper foundations that enables winners to scale the heights. In the vocational education game of life, evidence-based policy is the recipe for winning. In Tajikistan, one of the poorest of the Central Asian states, creating an environment in which officials and politicians can gather and use reliable data on the labour market, vocational education system and students to create realistic, effective policies, is a key objective. The ETF is working with politicians and policy advisors to create such evidence based foundations to ensure that a better system of post school and adult training can be built on top. In June, the ETF brought key Tajikistan education, labour, migration, social protection, statistics and adult training specialists together for a one-day workshop in Dushanbe on evidence- based policy development in vocational education and training. The workshop demonstrated the need for better information gathering and the fact that the political will to create better evidence based policies now exists in Tajikistan. Participants identified three key priorities: improving governance and responsiveness to labour market demands; guaranteeing the quality of education; and boosting social partnership. Current data collection in Tajikistan is clearly inadequate, participants agreed, with data insufficient to allow for correct evaluation of graduates\u2019 skills, the quality of training and whether that training meets labour market demands. Drawing up the best indicators for Tajikistan is a first step: in October a second ETF workshop in Dushanbe tackled that very subject. Alisher Faromuzov, director of Dushanbe\u2019s Vocational Education and Training Support Foundation, says targeting key areas in the national strategy for progress through 2020 is the next step.

Only an evidence-based approach can achieve this. We need to consider the needs of people from several groups including illiterate youngsters, people with poor competitive skills and those from remote mountain villages,\u201d said Faromuzov. The ETF\u2019s support in helping create the tools for assessing the true training needs of Tajikistan \u2013 on which effective policies can be based \u2013 is invaluable, he added. \u201cThe ETF\u2019s experience in other countries is essential. We need to expand cooperation with politicians, managers and education institutions to involve them in the process of introducing new approaches. The accent should be on increasing knowledge, training and broadening the public policy discussion.\u201d Challenges to this include insufficient funding for statistical studies, a need to determine key indicators and encouraging more cooperation between politicians, officials and the ministries affected, he added. Tajikistan specialists have already been armed with some powerful tools from the ETF arsenal in this respect: at the June workshop in Dushanbe, the ETF\u2019s Manuela Prina briefed participants on indicators used in European Union countries.

        "14 Live & Learn November 2011 Teachers must come onboard if the entrepreneurial learning agenda is to move forward according to participants at a symposium on promoting entrepreneurship in teacher training organised by the European Training Foundation in Istanbul in July. The question of how to do this occupied the minds of policymakers and teacher training specialists alike as they worked hard to come up with a set of policy principles which could guide the process in Turkey, the Western Balkans and the Southern Mediterranean. \u201cHow can we get teachers in our busy schools ready for the entrepreneurial agenda without overstretching scarce resources?\u201d asked Anthony Gribben, project leader for enterprise and entrepreneurship at the ETF, kicking off the meeting. Agents of change What became clear as the two-day event developed is that there are several reasons why teacher training should take priority. First and foremost this is because teachers are the most important agents of change in education systems and if we want them to be active proponents of education for entrepreneurship, they will need all our encouragement and support. Lamis Al-Alami, Minister of Education and Higher Education in the occupied Palestinian territory pointed out that there is a lot of entrepreneurial learning activity taking place in the non-formal sector, but the question is - how do we get it mainstreamed? Involving the business sector is essential, through initiatives such as teacher placements in companies and businessmen and women contributing to the teaching and learning process within schools. At the heart of the matter is the need to develop new relationships between schools and companies; and it is not about funding. \u201cEducation systems should not be seen as beggars always asking for money,\u201d said R\u00f3sa Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir, an adviser at the Icelandic Ministry of Education Science and Culture, \u201cwe want to work with business on an equal footing and we are interested in their cooperation not their money.\u201d Preparing for uncertainty It also became clear that advocates of entrepreneurial learning might have to work hard to dispel myths and misunderstandings about what entrepreneurship in the education system actually means and who it can benefit. For many it is solely about business and as some delegates underlined, the notion of the dishonest entrepreneur is something that needs to be addressed if entrepreneurship is to be accepted into the school environment. Others stated that teachers, and certainly teacher trade unions, might equate the idea of entrepreneurial learning in schools as part of a wider pro-market agenda. \u201cWe are not talking about bringing the market into the classroom, we are talking about something which is much more inclusive and which can help everyone to be more enterprising and more employable. It\u2019s about preparing young people for uncertainty,\u201d said Gribben.

        "15 Live & Learn November 2011 Concentrating on the benefits for everyone for becoming more entrepreneurial could be the best way forward, delegates suggested. \u201cTeaching entrepreneurship is giving people a tool for life,\u201d said Michael Oren, Vice President of the Manufacturers\u2019 Association of Israel. \u201cEven if the teacher or the student does not become an entrepreneur in future, they get a lot of tools for life \u2013 it builds confidence and encourages problem-solving and the ability to identify opportunities.\u201d he said. Inspiring examples The symposium agenda included a range of inspiring examples of entrepreneurial learning in action. These included how Tunisia and Kosovo are mainstreaming entrepreneurial learning into national curricula and how the pre-accession countries are cooperating to address common concerns. The work of the South East European Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning involving multi-country expert teams co-working on teacher support tools in entrepreneurship as a key competence attracted significant interest, in particular the recommendations for pre and in-service teacher training. The discussions also demonstrated the diversity of issues from country to country and with this the challenges. \u201cOne question for us is the sheer size of the Egyptian education system; we currently need another 23,000 schools but can only build about 1,000 a year,\u201d said Mohsen Said, advisor within Egypt\u2019s education ministry. \u201cSo how do you prepare teachers to foster entrepreneurial attitudes when they may be dealing with classes of 60 students?\u201d \u25a0 Words: Rebecca Warden, ICE Teachers can help get entrepreneurial learning into all areas of schooling Photo: ETF/A. Jongsma \u2018Early start\u2019 The entrepreneurial learning process requires an \u2018early start,\u2019 said Simone Baldassari of the European Commission\u2019s enterprise directorate. \u2018We need to ensure that from the first day at school we work towards creating inquisitive minds, problem solving skills, opportunity identification, risk-taking and team working. Teaching and learning processes should generate these core entrepreneurial traits,\u2019 he advised. Dragica Karai \u0107 , Head of EU programmes at the Croatian economy ministry provided examples of how young children in her country were encouraged to problem solve in groups \u2013 a team work approach. In one such example, a class of six year olds was asked how they would go about measuring the height of a skyscraper. After a morning\u2019s brainstorming, they came up with the following simple but elegant solution: take a lift to the top, drop a ball of string over the side, measure the piece of string! Focus on teachers a priority across the continent The Istanbul symposium was one of a series of meetings involving EU Member States and ETF partner countries on how to drive forward the entrepreneurial learning agenda. A high-level meeting with partner countries organised by the ETF and the European Commission in Zagreb in March 2010 called for an immediate focus on teacher training, while a similar symposium meeting of EU27 experts (including Iceland and Norway) in Budapest in April this year came to the same conclusion. \u201cNo matter what we declare as priorities in our work plans at higher levels, what actually happens in the classroom is key,\u201d said ETF Director, Madlen Serban. Harald Hartung, Head of Unit at the European Commission\u2019s education directorate described teachers as \u201cimportant multipliers\u201d where existing teachers must be given the chance to upgrade; and called upon school management to \u201cgive legitimacy to new teachers to put ideas such as partnerships or new teaching methods into action. The important issue is that entrepreneurial learning is not just an addition to the curriculum but an integral part of it.\u201d A report covering the issues and recommendations from both the Budapest and Istanbul symposia will be available on both the ETF and European Commission websites in November 2011. \u201cWE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT BRINGING THE MARKET INTO THE CLASSROOM, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH IS MUCH MORE INCLUSIVE\u201d ",
        "16 Live & Learn November 2011 Know thyself - this advice from Socrates has survived the test of time and today, more than ever, how organisations manage their greatest asset \u2013 knowledge - remains paramount. This is particularly true for the ETF, an agency whose work is all about sharing knowledge and expertise. Since 2010, the ETF has been working on a new strategy for knowledge management. The aim is twofold, according to Ian Cumming, leader of the operations knowledge management team which also includes Mirella Rossi and Denise Loughran. \u201cThe team wants to ensure that the knowledge we create and generate is used to the best possible effect,\u201d he says, \u201cthis means retrieving the results of our work in a timely and comfortable manner but more importantly looking again at how we interact in order to achieve deeper insights into how we solve our common challenges by sharing knowledge.\u201d Putting knowledge into practice While 2010 was the year of consultation and consolidation of the strategy, 2011 has been the year for starting to put it into practice. The team works in the Evidence- Based Policy Making Department and is now supporting a number of knowledge pillars: re-visiting past results such as events, publications, and projects to ensure they are retrievable for our current thematic priorities; promoting the corporate services of the library both as information but also as a place or hub where people can congregate and interact; initiating a number of pilot communities in using corporate social media tools for working together and most importantly, providing expertise to projects and country work in the applied use of knowledge and sense-making tools and methods. A final important element of the work is to ensure that the ETF shares and brokers knowledge of EU evidence based policy practice in training as well as applying knowledge management strategies and techniques together with its partners in a peer learning environment. This means working together with project and country teams in an integrated fashion. Torinet project During 2012, knowledge management methods will be more deeply embedded in Torinet, an eleven-country pilot working alongside the Torino Process mapping exercise for promoting evidence-based policy making. This will include practices designed to encourage stronger cooperation and mutual reflection and learning, deeper thought and the generation of new ideas both nationally and within projects. All in all, Ian, Mirella and Denise believe that the benefits, both for the ETF and for partner countries, will be many. \u201cFirst, people will be able to locate things more easily, will be aware of who does what and will experience a richer participatory interaction. Second, these new approaches will build a stronger link between the vital ETF triangle of knowledge, evidence and decision making,\u201d says Rossi, member of the ETF knowledge management team. This will not only give the ETF and its partners better tools and approaches for solving complex problems but will also make a significant contribution to the impact of the ETF\u2019s work. \u25a0 Words: Rebecca Warden, ICE ETF GETS THE KNOWLEDGE Feature Ian Cumming (left) and Dagmar Ouzon (centre) used knowledge management techniques in Kazakhstan to help formulate vocational education and training policy reform CASE STUDY: Kazakhstan sees knowledge management in action How knowledge management can galvanise events was clearly shown at three ETF events in Kazakhstan in October 2011. Ian Cumming accompanied Kazakhstan country manager Dagmar Ouzoun to these two regional workshops in the cities of Atyrau and Ust Kaminogorsk and the national workshop in the capital Astana. The aim of the regional events was to channel input from the regions into formulating national policy for VET reform, a national priority identified by the 2010 phrase of the Torino Process. Ian used knowledge management methods to facilitate dialogue and reporting between one group of educationalists and another representing business. Not only was this process much faster than usual, but it also encouraged far more participation and interaction, according to Ouzoun. Moreover the team shared knowledge in EU evidence-based policy practices and developments. Using knowledge management techniques to share knowledge itself \u2013 a first for this project! \u201cReporting and explaining was done in a very attractive way which guaranteed an exchange of opinions from one group to another,\u201d she said, \u201cI would definitely be happy to use such methods again and will be booking Ian for next year\u2019s events!\u201d ",
        "17 Live & Learn November 2011 People\u2019s skills are a major asset - both for individuals themselves and for society at large. They help people find rewarding jobs and are a major ingredient in boosting productivity, competitiveness and innovation. But when peoples\u2019 skills do not fit demand out there in the labour market, this is when the trouble starts. This phenomenon, known in the trade as the skills mismatch, is the hidden factor behind one of the biggest paradoxes afflicting labour markets everywhere to a greater or lesser degree. It goes a long way towards explaining how it can be that while many people cannot find jobs, at the same time employers struggle to find employees with the skills they need. For young people in many partner countries, especially women, it makes finding that all important first job hard or sometimes impossible. Finding ways of solving this contradiction is at the heart of the ETF\u2019s work and is also the reasoning behind a new project launched in 2011 called \u2018anticipating and matching demand and supply of skills in ETF partner countries\u2019. Labour markets in the future Tackling the skills mismatch means not only looking at the situation today but attempting to predict what labour markets will look like in the future. And seeing as crystal balls have shown their limitations, a more methodical approach is called for. \u201cThe first step is to assess current demand for skills and to anticipate future skills needs, the second step is to turn this information into effective action; to make education and training curricula more demand orientated and to guide young people in their decisions about what to learn and where to find a good job,\u201d says Lizzi Feiler, team leader of the project and a labour market specialist at the ETF. The project, due to run until 2013, aims to help policy makers and practitioners in partner countries improve their matching systems. So far a network of experts from Croatia, Egypt, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia, Turkey and Ukraine has been set up and each participating country has taken stock of what it currently does to tackle the mismatch. The results of this exercise will be presented in a synthesis report before the end of the year. In 2012, this team together with the ETF, will work on developing more effective tools for anticipating skills needs and matching these to demand for labour. \u201cThe ETF will put a strong emphasis on how the findings can be used to achieve better labour market results,\u201d says Feiler. It will also draw upon the wealth of experience and research available in EU Member States and other OECD countries as well as initiatives in partner countries such as employer surveys, labour market transition studies or sector specific skills analysis. \u25a0 Words: Rebecca Warden, ICE TACKLING THE SKILLS MISMATCH For Lizzi Feiler, young people need guidance on learning and finding a good job Photo: ETF/A.Ramella The network of experts on skills matching met at the ETF earlier this year Photo: ETF/A.Ramella Why is matching so important for partner countries? The economies of ETF partner countries are often heavily dependent on the flow of foreign direct investment and imported technology and may be characterised by a divide between an emerging, modern sector and a less innovative, more traditional sector, often highly informal. Businesses tend to be small and micro-enterprises may find it hard to articulate their requirements for skills. In many countries, the population is predominantly young causing a strong demand for new jobs as each cohort enters the labour market. This demand that may find an escape valve through brain drain and outward migration when the local economy cannot provide enough jobs. In countries such as Egypt and Tunisia, the explosive combination of high youth unemployment and political and social discontent has made the need for better functioning labour markets only too plain.

        "24 Live & Learn November 2011 One of the first things that people will do if you ask them about education is to talk about their own experiences of schools and teachers. They will say \u201cI went to a great school\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t like it\u201d, or \u201cI had a great teacher, and that\u2019s why I am doing what I am doing now\u201d. Schools help shape young people and their influence continues throughout peoples\u2019 lives. They are one of the main formative influences for young people. However, a lot of education policy dialogue takes place over their heads \u2013 even though ultimately they are the most affected by policies. Making the Connection With The Skool I\u2019d Like we are trying to make sure there is this connection - high- level policy dialogue can be enriched by the voice of the students. That is why the ETF is starting The Skool I\u2019d Like project. Our aim is to listen to young peoples\u2019 voices, to learn from them, to hear first-hand what students think is most important for them. Ultimately, it is to enrich the policy processes that the ETF tries to help with. This concept is inspired by the project run by the UK\u2019s Guardian newspaper, which asked the same question to UK students and received some stimulating responses. The ETF however, is inviting young people to share their ideas for schools they would like through social media, on a special Facebook page and on Twitter. Why social media? Why social media? Because social media is the pre-eminent platform where young people discuss things and express their opinions. We want to hear their messages. We have successfully used social media in the past in an award- winning 2010 project for events on women and work and promoting social inclusion. This time it is different. This is more of an open-ended exercise. We are asking a broad question: \u2018what school would you like?\u2019 We don\u2019t attach it to any event. It\u2019s the beginning of an ongoing dialogue, part of the way we work. We want to involve people from all ETF partner regions. This approach has both risks and opportunities.
