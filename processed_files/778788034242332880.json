        "EN 2 EN COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS Commission Legislative and Work Programme 2008 1. I NTRODUCTION The EU is moving forward. Following the recent agreement at the informal European Council, a ratified Treaty of Lisbon will equip the EU better to tackle the challenges and deliver policies for the 21 st century. The Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs is feeding through into improved economic performance. The EU has made a historic commitment to tackle climate change and bring about secure, competitive and sustainable energy. The Commission has started to frame policies for the future through the internal market review and the ongoing stocktaking of European society. The consultation now under way on the EU budget will help preparing the review of one of the EU's key levers for the next decade and beyond. Europe is also pressing ahead with new relationships with key partners in the neighbourhood, in Africa and worldwide. With the latest enlargement now concluded, the EU has a new critical mass and a new reach. There is a real consensus \u2013 shared by the informal European Council of October 2007 and the European Parliament's resolution on the Annual Policy Strategy for 2008 \u2013 that the focus should be on the capacity of an EU of 27 to make globalisation an opportunity for its citizens. This adds up to an excellent backdrop for the EU's ambitions for 2008. A focused Work Programme In 2008, the Commission will maintain its focus on delivering results within the overall strategic objectives set out at the start of its mandate: prosperity; solidarity; security and freedom, and a stronger Europe in the world 1 . These objectives provide the core direction for the Commission's work, and the driving force to shape ambitious policies. Most of the subjects at the forefront of the political agenda cut across the strategic objectives and contribute to several or all of them. Meanwhile, challenges for the EU such as tackling climate change, developing an Energy Policy for Europe or managing migration flows call for a comprehensive, flexible and coherent approach, expanding beyond traditional boundaries; they need to be addressed both through action by the EU institutions, with other key players in the EU, and through a global approach with partners around the world. The EU budget review to be presented in 2008/9, is another key example of where EU policies must be looked at holistically. As in 2007, the Work Programme for 2008 is focused and concentrates on a limited number of new policy initiatives. It includes strategic initiatives that the Commission commits itself to deliver during the year, and priority initiatives to be delivered over a 12-18 month period. 1 COM(2005) 12. ",
        "EN 3 EN All strategic and priority initiatives announced in this Work Programme will be subject to the quality discipline of impact assessment. In addition, the requirement to assess the impact before an initiative is proposed will be further extended to include other initiatives. Impact assessments will be reviewed by the Impact Assessment Board 2 . Impact assessments are made public, including whenever they lead to a proposal being dropped 3 . When preparing this Work Programme, the Commission has taken full account of the results of the dialogue conducted with the European Parliament and the Council on the 2008 Annual Policy Strategy (APS) 4 , as well as of contributions received from national parliaments. This Programme is also the first to include inter-institutional communication priorities for 2008.To better reflect the current multi-annual nature of most of the activities of the Commission and in an effort to increase overall transparency, this Work Programme introduces a new chapter identifying issues on which the Commission will work in 2008 which could lead to new initiatives in the years ahead. 2. T HE PRIORITIES FOR 2008 Growth and Jobs The Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs remains the major vehicle for promoting a more prosperous, environmentally responsible and socially inclusive European Union, in partnership with the Member States. The 2008 Spring European Council will give the EU the opportunity to reflect on whether the Lisbon strategy needs refinement to address the challenges of globalisation most effectively. 2008 will also see the first results of a further effort to use the leverage of EU cohesion policy to implement the Lisbon strategy at regional level. Raising employment towards the target for the employment rate set under the Lisbon strategy provides a basis for growth, improved quality of life and facing the challenge of an ageing population. This requires a combination of flexibility and security for workers and for employers, with incentives and opportunities for lifelong learning. At the same time, the EU needs to find new ways to promote access and opportunity in society, to address the risks and causes of social exclusion and poverty through policies for active inclusion, and to help to anticipate change. Adequate social protection should also be promoted. Developing a knowledge society is a cornerstone of the growth and jobs strategy, and the Commission will continue to look at new ways to promote education, training, research and innovation as part of its Lisbon strategy. The Single Market Review identified new initiatives, many of which will be presented in 2008, that will foster a Single Market built on a strong, innovative and competitive industrial 2 Established in November 2006 under the authority of the Commission's President to provide independent quality support and control. 3 Examples of proposals not pursued in 2007 as a result of the impact assessment work are: the proposal aiming to modernise and reinforce the organisational framework for inland waterway transport in Europe, the proposed Recommendation on Proportionality between capital and control in companies, the proposal for a 14th Company Law Directive on the transfer of a company's registered office, or the proposal for a Decision on the protection of witnesses and individuals who cooperate with the judicial process. 4 COM(2007) 65. ",
        "EN 4 EN base and maximising the full potential of services, where consumers and business benefit fully from well-functioning open markets ensuring a level playing field and where European standards can serve as inspiration at the international level. The Commission will focus on making markets work better, in the area of retail financial services and in areas where policies can achieve a maximum impact so as to allow consumers and companies alike, and in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to benefit fully from the internal market. This needs targeted action like more coordinated market surveillance to secure compliance of products and services with rules and standards, more systematic market and sector monitoring and a methodology to measure the performance of the internal market from a consumer perspective. As small and medium size enterprises create most jobs and wealth in Europe, specific measures to improve their market performance will be prepared in a \u201cSmall Business Act\u201d. As from 1 January 2008, Cyprus and Malta will adopt the euro as their currency. The euro is a symbol of common identity, shared values and the success of European integration. Ten years from the launch of EMU, the Commission will undertake a strategic review of the European Monetary Union , with proposals for the future. Sustainable Europe Tackling climate change will be an integral part of the Commission\u2019s priorities in 2008 to secure sustainable prosperity for Europe. But with climate change already under way, the EU needs to look at how public policies need to help the process of adaptation to new realities. The Commission will propose a White Paper on the Adaptation to the impact of Climate Change . A wide range of EU policies \u2013 such as human and animal health, agriculture, fisheries, biodiversity, energy, industry, research and tourism \u2013 will need to adjust, and the White Paper will seek to identify where change is most needed. Particular attention will be given to measures to encourage the greening of the transport sector. The implementation of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) will provide a powerful tool for this tuning of EU policies. In view of the Spring Council in 2009, the Commission will present a 2 nd Strategic Energy Review , which will serve as the basis for the new Energy Action Plan from 2010 onwards, and will include a review of the Energy Taxation Directive to better combine fiscal and environmental goals. Solidarity between Member States needs to be strengthened at a moment when natural resource constraints and the increased global demand threaten the security of supply. The reformed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) will undergo a \u201c Health Check \u201d, to see whether the 2003 reform regarding the single payment scheme and certain agricultural markets and its implementation in the Member States need to be fine-tuned; this will also help to pave the way for the future design and priorities of the CAP. The EU maritime policy is another example of how an integrated EU approach can draw together the threads of different policies for the sustainable development of all sea-based activities and coastal regions. The recast and strengthening of the control framework of the Common Fisheries Policy will represent a decisive step towards ensuring sustainable fishing. ",
        "EN 5 EN An integrated approach to migration The Commission will propose further steps towards a common policy on migration . Migration and social integration represent key challenges of the 21 st century and require a multi- dimensional approach in order to realise the potential of migration for socio-economic development in both countries of origin and of destination. This means combining well- managed labour migration, supporting circular migration and promoting education and integration of migrants in the broader context of managing demographic change in our societies. It also requires effective action against illegal migration and human trafficking. The EU needs to protect its external borders with common tools, to prevent illegal migration, and maximise efforts to counter human trafficking and reduce the tragic death toll of immigrants in the sea trying to reach our borders. In 2008 the work of the External Borders Agency will be evaluated and Member States will be supported in tackling illegal migration through a European surveillance system . The Commission will be shaping the future of a coherent and efficient Common European Asylum Policy. This will notably include adapting the European legislation on reception conditions and assessment criteria, to achieve fuller harmonisation of national rules on eligibility criteria, and progress towards a single procedure for assessing applications for refugee status. This will allow for a true expression of European values of solidarity. Putting the citizens first One of the main objectives of this Commission is to put the citizen at the centre of the European project. This translates into different types of initiatives. The Social Reality Stocktaking, alongside the internal market review, has been looking at the changes under way in Europe's economies and societies, with a view to identifying how the well-being of Europe\u2019s citizens can be best advanced in a globalised world. The stocktaking will be the basis for developing a modern social agenda for Europe \u2013 an agenda that promotes among others the reconciliation of professional, private and family life, and sets out how the EU can work in partnership with the Member States to fight discrimination and deliver access to opportunities for all Europeans. The EU has to equip itself to handle effectively the security, health and safety risks inherent in an open world. The European dimension to health services will be taken forward with concrete initiatives on patient safety and quality of health services. Internet and new media are in constant evolution. Communication and information infrastructures have become more tightly and globally interconnected. New technologies bring new possibilities, new applications and new challenges. A coherent European approach is key to develop new markets in a secure environment. Finally, the 2008 year of Intercultural Dialogue will help to build new bridges and closer ties across Europe. Europe as a world partner Globalisation is creating new opportunities, and at the same time testing Europe's capacity to influence it and to manage its consequences. It has become ever clearer that internal and ",
        "EN 6 EN external policy goals are intertwined as never before, underpinning the need for a modern and integrated vision on how to project, promote and protect Europe's interests and values successfully. The Union's enlargement policy is extending peace and stability, prosperity, democracy, human rights and the rule of law across Europe. The European neighbourhood policy helps building a stable and prosperous neighbourhood, based on common principles and shared interests. The global competitiveness agenda contributes to creating lasting growth and jobs at home, promoting trade and unlocking development abroad. Europe is a world leader in the fight against poverty, in fostering sustainable development, human rights and good governance, as well as in providing humanitarian assistance. At the same time, the international dimension to addressing climate change, managing migration, combating terrorism, or boosting energy security is acknowledged as critical to success. The Commission will report on progress made in the countries involved in accession negotiations and in the stabilisation and association process, and make the appropriate recommendations to adjust the EU's enlargement strategy. Particular attention will be required to support the implementation of the future status of Kosovo. The European neighbourhood policy has become established as the central platform for deepening relationship with the countries it covers, from the Baltic to the Mediterranean. It will continue to support political, economic and social reforms in partner countries, providing a diversified response to their needs within a common policy framework. The Commission will produce a summary analysis of progress on the ground as well as annual reports on each country. It will implement its own undertakings to strengthen the incentives to partner countries, and continue to work closely with Member States to ensure that the EU plays its part effectively in implementing this policy.. Building on the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, the European neighbourhood policy also gives the Union the tools to further develop the longstanding regional dialogue and cooperation with all the countries of the Mediterranean region. The EU-Africa summit in December 2007 should pave the way for a new phase in relations with an EU-Africa strategy to bring a new maturity to relations and to ensure that political, economic and development policies are geared to best effect. All available instruments will be geared towards turning the strategy into a tangible reality: the 10 th EDF and its facilities and trust funds as well as the relevant Community budget instruments, bilateral contributions from EU and African states, interested third parties and international organisations and investments from the private sector. The Commission will also examine any new avenues to be followed in its work to implement the Millennium Development Goals. It will present an ambitious package on Financing for Development and on Aid Effectiveness in view of the top-level international meetings in Accra (September 2008) and Doha (December 2008). 3. D ELIVERY : A DAILY TASK New actions with a focus on political priorities are only one aspect of the Commission's work. Throughout the year, the Commission remains responsible for implementing and overseeing agreed policies, and for managing financial programmes and operational tasks. As guardian of the common European interest, it has direct responsibility for ensuring the acquis is properly applied. The Commission also has a responsibility to promote effective communication with European citizens and to explain the value of the European project. It will pursue its reform ",

Delivering on the European Transparency initiative, the Commission will launch the Interest Representative Register in 2008 and pursue work to ensure full transparency on end beneficiaries of EU funds. Implementing agreed policies 2008 will see detailed work to follow up on the initiatives taken by the Commission since the start of its mandate. This includes negotiations to take forward proposals already on the table with special attention given to a range of actions now coming on stream. It will be a crucial year for taking forward the Energy and Climate Change proposals presented by the Commission in 2007. Political agreement will be sought from the institutions on the legislation on the internal market and on how the EU will meet its targets on greenhouse gases and renewable energy, as well as on how to make a step change in energy technologies. The follow up to the Bali Conference on Climate Change will require intensive international negotiations to bring agreement closer on a successor regime to the Kyoto Protocol. The implementation of the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) legislation is a test case to show Europe's capacity to improve the health and environment for European citizens while enhancing the competitiveness of European industry. Research and technological development is essential to promoting sustainable development and innovation and ensuring that Europe remains a competitive and prosperous society in the future. The implementation of the Framework programmes will continue in 2008 and initiatives will be taken to deepen the European Research Area, such as promoting the mobility of researchers, developing new infrastructures and launching the joint European \u2013 national programming of research on broad societal challenges. Within the broad-based strategy for innovation, the European Institute of Technology, which should move ever closer to become operational during 2008, will help to bridge the innovation gap between the EU and its major competitors through strategic research and education. Following the turmoil in financial markets a number of issues have been identified where further analysis is required in order to assist policy makers and regulators draw appropriate conclusions which may involve suggestions for regulatory change. Among the issues the Commission will be working on in 2008, together with other actors at EU and international level, will be: transparency for investors, markets and regulators; valuation standards, including illiquid assets; prudential framework, risk management and supervision in the financial sector; as well as market functioning including the role of credit agencies. 2008 will be the year where the latest market reforms of the CAP will be implemented, continuing the trend of making European agriculture more sustainable and competitive. The implementation of all new 2007-2013 programmes in cohesion policy (452 programmes), in rural development (96 programmes) and fisheries will be vigorously pursued securing their enhanced contribution to growth and more and better jobs to the European citizens. Work will also be continued in order to allow companies to choose an EU-wide tax base as set out in the 2008 Annual Policy Strategy. An impact assessment has been launched to examine the options and their implications. The Commission will continue to press ahead with the completion of the Hague Programme for freedom, security and justice, and to encourage work on proposals still on the table to ",

The Action Plan for the new EU Integrated Maritime Policy adopted in 2007 by the Commission, will be progressively implemented through the related initiatives identified in this Work Programme and a new process of monitoring and reporting. The Commission will adopt and start implementing a 6 year Action Plan on EU Animal Health Strategy. The Commission will also clarify the legal framework for risk assessment on GMOs by the European Food Safety Authority. The international scene The EU has a series of strategically important negotiating streams which will be taken forward in 2008. Accession negotiations with Turkey and Croatia will continue on the basis of the agreed negotiating frameworks. The expected completion of the network of Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the Western Balkans will strengthen bilateral political and economic ties and accelerate reforms. A second set of progress reports will be submitted under the European neighbourhood policy . The benefits of the European Neighbourhood Policy remain open to Belarus, were it to engage in democratisation and respect for human rights and the rule of law. The Commission will move ahead with its Global Europe agenda, continuing to press for a WTO trade agreement and at the same time working on an ambitious set of bilateral negotiations . 2008 will also be the first year of the Economic Partnership Agreements and the 10 th European Development Fund : new resources and a new focus on aid effectiveness and complementarity will play a fundamental part in delivering development inside the broader relationship now in place with ACP partners. Work in the area of humanitarian assistance will build on the Declaration \u201cTowards a European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid\u201d 5 . The Commission will also continue its work with respect to the preparation, launch, negotiation or conclusion of agreements with, inter alia, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iraq, China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Laos, Cambodia, ASEAN, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Andean Community, Central America and Mercosur. The Commission will take the first steps to establish formal relations with Libya. The Commission will remain active regarding political developments across the globe and continue its engagement in the stabilisation and reconstruction efforts in the Middle East, including through its role in the Quartet and as major donor in the region, as well as in Africa and South Asia. The Commission will also seek to further strengthen the transatlantic partnership, a crucial cornerstone of Europe's external relations and which has been given a new political push through the framework for advancing transatlantic economic integration adopted at the last EU-US summit. Management of financial programmes The EU budget is one of the key instruments to realise the EU's policy objectives. It benefits from continuity, as the Union's spending priorities have been agreed on a multi-annual basis. The annual budgetary process translates and fine-tunes the orientations reflected in the 5 COM(2007) 317. ",
        "EN 9 EN financial framework, without changing the strategic direction. With the new generation of financial programmes largely in place, 2008 will be a year of consolidation and implementation. The budget authority is shortly expected to take a decision on the Commission's proposals for the 2008 budget, amounting to around \u20ac 129 billion in commitments and \u20ac 122 billion in payments. More than 44% of commitment appropriations will be reserved for activities supporting growth and jobs in Europe through investment in areas like research, competitiveness and innovation, transport and energy networks, lifelong learning and economic and social cohesion. In addition to these commitments, the Commission will continue to manage the final phase of 2000-2006 programmes and projects. In the area of cohesion policy alone, this means responsibility for close to 380 structural fund programmes and 1 200 cohesion fund projects. In implementing these funds, the Commission seeks to ensure the best use of limited resources so as to achieve better social and economic outcomes for European citizens and obtain the best value for money while ensuring a high level of budget execution. It is bound by and committed to the highest standards of sound financial management. Where the budget is implemented in shared management with the Member States, the Commission will give guidance as necessary. Where it cannot obtain the necessary assurance, the Commission will consider suspending payments to the relevant Member States. Managing the Community acquis Following on from the Communication \"A Europe of results \u2013 Applying EC law\" 6 adopted last September, better enforcement of Community law, including through improvements in the dialogue with Member States to ensure timely implementation and effective and equitable application, will remain a priority for the Commission in 2008. The Commission will continue to make great efforts to ensure compliance with EU legislation, with a special emphasis on transport, environment, food safety, animal health, animal welfare and plant health standards. The Commission attaches great importance to the cooperation with Member States to facilitate the implementation and enforcement of EU law, establishing mechanisms for prior monitoring of new national legislation, promoting active participation in the SOLVIT network and working with informal networks like the Forum of Judges. The launch of infringement cases is the ultimate expression of the Commission\u2019s fundamental task as guardian of the Treaties and directly connects with EU citizens\u2019 concerns. Many of these cases are triggered by complaints and petitions submitted by individual citizens, enterprises and NGOs. By enforcing European competition rules in individual cases, the Commission will promote markets which work better for the benefit of consumers and overall competitiveness. The Commission will launch one or more new competition sector inquiries in markets where shortcomings have been identified. Under the State Aid Action Plan, the Commission will deliver initiatives to complete the shift towards more effective and simple rules on subsidies, firmly grounded in sound economic analysis. 6 COM(2007) 502.

W ORKING TO SHAPE NEW POLICIES To better reflect the current multi-annual nature of most of the activities of the Commission, this new chapter identifies subjects linked to the priorities on which services will work in 2008, through impact assessments of envisaged new actions, studies, stakeholders' consultations, which could lead to specific initiatives in the future. The Commission is working in many different areas linked to an agenda for sustainable competitiveness as part of efforts to promote sustainable development. This includes looking at how standards can mainstream environmental goals, sustainable access to raw materials beyond the area of energy, and examining ways to address the consequences of climate change on health. As a follow up to the Green Paper on Agricultural Product Quality, the Commission will consider how optimising quality can better meet consumer demand and add value to the agricultural production. The Commission will also present a green paper on territorial cohesion, a concept acknowledged by the Treaty of Lisbon. At the request of the Agriculture Council the Commission is working on an initiative on the consumption of fruit in schools. An impact assessment is being prepared and subject to the outcome a proposal will be made. The conclusions of the social reality stocktaking will carry through into the modernisation of EU social policies, reflecting the challenges of globalisation and the need to anticipate and manage change. The Treaty of Lisbon will provide a new impetus to the area of freedom, security and justice. The priorities and objectives for the future development of the EU policy will have to be defined, and the means and initiatives to best achieve them will need to be determined. The Commission will present a Communication on the next multi-annual strategy to establish an area of freedom, security and justice . Further to the consultation on future priorities for the Action Plan on Company Law and Corporate Governance, and to respond to the high demand, the Commission will carry out a feasibility study on a European Foundation Statute. In 2008 the Commission will also focus on preparatory work relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters with third countries, including a legal mechanism to deal with bilateral agreements of Member States with third countries in specific sectors as well as cooperation with international organisations such as the Council of Europe. During 2008, work will be launched on the review of the Merger Regulation, of the Procedural Regulation 1/2003 and several anti-trust Block Exemption Regulations. In the area of state aid, consultations will be launched to review the guidelines on state aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty and the Shipbuilding Framework. The Commission is also looking at ways to maximise the potential for coordination on crisis response, including crisis prevention and preparedness. It also intends to clarify rules on the protection of personal data. The Commission is also reflecting on a substantial revision of the Overseas Association Decision, within the limits of the EC Treaty concerning the future relations between the EU and the Overseas Countries and Territories.

        "EN 11 EN The Commission will start the preparation of activities for the European Year of Creativity and Innovation in 2009. In this connection, a broad range of community programmes, notably Lifelong Learning, Culture, Youth in Action and Europe for Citizens, will contribute to raising awareness about how education and culture can support innovation and creativity. Finally the Commission will prepare the 2008-2009 Budget Review to optimise Europe\u2019s capacities to address the key challenges of the next decade. 5. B ETTER R EGULATION : S IMPLIFICATION , C ODIFICATION , W ITHDRAWALS AND MEASUREMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS Improving the regulatory environment in Europe is a core priority of the Commission. Its ambitious Better Regulation agenda, aiming at delivering quality initiatives and at modernising and simplifying the stock of existing legislation, is anchored in the Lisbon strategy for jobs and growth. Economic, social and environmental impacts are assessed in an integrated and balanced way together with a measurement of administrative costs of draft legislation whenever such costs are likely to be substantial. Impact assessments also support the Commission's simplification programme 7 by identifying the simplification potential of existing legislation. A strategic review of Better Regulation In view of the Spring European Council, in early 2008 a strategic review will present the progress made in 2007 under the different strands of the Better Regulation agenda, taking account of the views expressed by the other EU-institutions and stakeholders. The review will in particular update and strengthen the Commission's Simplification Rolling Programme and report on the implementation of the Action Programme for reducing administrative burdens 8 as well as taking stock of the new arrangements governing impact assessment since the setting up of the Impact Assessment Board. Screening of pending proposals Having carried out in this year's exercise a screening of proposals pending before the legislator which were adopted by the Commission up to end of 2005, in line with its commitment to the European Parliament, the Commission has included in the CLWP the list of 30 pending proposals it intends to withdraw together with the specific justifications. The Commission will continue to monitor proposals pending in the legislative process with a view to withdrawal or taking any other action in line with its political priorities and better regulation standards. Simplification Implementation of the Simplification Rolling Programme is progressing well. Out of 47 simplification initiatives foreseen for adoption by the Commission in 2007, 44 - of which 19 already adopted and 25 still planned - will have been adopted by the end of the year (94% success rate). Amongst the more recent achievements, the revision of EU insurance law (SOLVENCY II) and the repeal of the GSM Directive will have direct impact for companies 7 COM(2005) 535 and COM(2006) 690. 8 COM(2007) 23.

The programme aims at bringing real advantages to Europeans \u2013 for example, proposals will \u2022 simplify the current rules on waste electrical goods to make it easier for manufacturers, retailers and consumers to meet their environmental obligations; \u2022 bring about a significant simplification of the current biocides legislative framework and address concerns regarding complexity and costs, as well as availability of certain biocidal products; \u2022 repeal some 50 technical Directives in the automotive sector and replace them, where appropriate, with references to UNECE Regulations; \u2022 reduce the administrative burden for industry by simplifying the rules for pharmaceutical products; \u2022 alleviate the statistical reporting of economic operators (Intrastat), in particular SMEs; \u2022 consolidate and expand the areas in which national, regional and local authorities can grant support without needing the Commission\u2019s prior approval through the simplification of the General Block Exemption Regulation on State aid. Administrative costs reduction The Action Programme launched in 2007 aims at reducing administrative burdens on businesses in the EU by 25% in 2012. Small and medium enterprises will benefit most from this reduction. To ensure close involvement of stakeholders, the Commission developed a website available in all EU official languages, where businesses across Europe can submit suggestions to reduce administrative burdens 9 . In addition to this online consultation, the Commission set up a \u201cHigh Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens\u201d to advice on the implementation of the Action Programme, which should lead to further refinement. 6. C OMMUNICATING E UROPE Over the last two years, the Commission has strengthened its efforts to better communicate Europe and to involve the citizen in the decision-making process. These efforts will be pursued and consolidated in 2008, with an emphasis on partnership 10 with other institutions and on working locally. For the first time, interinstitutional communication priorities are proposed. As decided in the APS 2008, the main communication priorities for 2008 will reflect the Commission's political priorities as well as research findings from Eurobarometer, 9 http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/admin-burdens-reduction/ 10 As suggested by the Commission in its Communication on Communicating Europe in Partnership, 3 October 2007.

A higher turn-out in the 2009 elections than in 2004 is also an important goal to which the communication efforts of all EU institutions should contribute. Recent research shows that the main concerns for EU citizens are the social dimension of the EU in the context of globalisation, in particular jobs and the fear of unemployment, as well as migration and issues related to citizens' security. Interest in energy and climate change is increasing, with widespread support for the energy/climate change package of proposals. In accordance with the cross-cutting policy-making approach favoured by the Commission, challenges such as globalisation and achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions (economic, social and environmental) will have to be integrated in any communication priority. At the same time, communication must \"go local\" and the Commission will pursue its efforts to adapt its messages to different audiences, sectors or countries. Following the successful conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference for a new EU Treaty, communication efforts will aim at both providing full and comprehensive information and maintaining a permanent dialogue with the European citizens, and will be reinforced during the ratification process in full collaboration with national authorities.

White Paper on Adaptation to Climate Change Non-legislative action/White Paper Policy statement covering measures to ensure adaptation to climate change in a broad range of areas fundamental to the EU way of life (e.g. industry, agriculture, energy, fisheries, forestry, tourism, social policy), reduce their vulnerability, increase their resilience to the inevitable negative impacts of climate change and anticipate and accompany those changes. The objective is to avoid significant effects on human health, biodiversity and habitats, and on EU citizens' quality of life. Measures in the White Paper will also imply changes in existing Community policies. Green transport package: a) Communication on greening the transport sector b) Communication on the internalisation of external costs of transport Non-Legislative action/Communication a) This Communication will present the main findings of three initiatives in the area of transport (Internalisation of external costs, Green Propulsion and ITS Action Plan) and will draw possible recommendations for the future. b) This second Communication will provide a generally applicable, transparent and comprehensible model for the assessment of external costs of various modes of transport. It will analyse how internalisation measures can correct a specific type of market failure that is very relevant in the transport field and which consists in the presence of large negative externalities.

Proposal for a Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment outside employment Legislative Proposal/Directive Legal basis: Art. 13 EC Treaty Article 13 provides the legal base for the European Union to take appropriate actions to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation but the principle of non-discrimination only becomes operational when contained in a Directive or other instrument made under Article 13 EC. Three Directives have already been adopted under this legal base but they are not applicable against discrimination outside of the employment sphere only for racial or ethnic origin and sex. Although some Member States may go beyond the current Directives and provide for the same level of protection for all the grounds of discrimination, it is necessary to ensure certain coherence throughout Europe in this field. Only a European Directive can provide such a coherent framework. Lack of uniform protection can affect people's choices on whether to work or study in another Member State, or whether to travel there and access services. The consultation of European Business Test Panel shows that many businesses believes it matters if there are different levels of protection between the EU Member States against discrimination in access to goods, services and housing on grounds of age, disability, religion and sexual orientation (63%) and 26% believe that a difference in the level of protection would ",

The \"Health Check\" is not a fundamental reform, rather it essentially aims to ensure that the CAP functions effectively and to simplify it where possible. This initiative arises from the review clauses regarding the Single Payment Scheme and certain agricultural markets that were included 2003/04 CAP reforms. Commission Regulation on information and promotion actions for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries Revision This initiative has as objective to establish the conditions regarding co-financing of information and promotion programmes for agricultural products in the internal market and in third countries. It will take the form of a consolidation of two existing Commission Regulations ((EC) No 1071/2005 and (EC) No 1346/2005).

It does not modify policy but streamlines and harmonises legislation. Various substantive amendments were made in the meantime to the existing CMOs. This is notably the case in the milk, the sugar and the fruit and vegetables sectors, It is important to incorporate these amendments into the single CMO in order to achieve the aim of having one single simplified legal text which will facilitate the access to the existing legislation and thus create a much higher degree of transparency and legal clarity. The initiative thus concerns the subsequent Commission proposal. ",

Technical clarifications and simplification (e.g. concerning the security provisions) will improve the readability of the text. Streamline Controls: Amendment of Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 regarding the detailed rules of cross compliance and the integrated administration and control system Revision This proposal stems directly from the Commission report to the Council on the application of the system of cross-compliance (COM(2007) 147). Its amendments will lead to simpler and more effective rules concerning the controls on direct payments to farmers with regard to the selection of the control sample, the timing of these controls, and the specific rules concerning on the spot checks.

This will bring a qualitative impact in terms of clarity, predictability and transparency of EU rules for business and national and regional authorities. The new GBER will cover areas already covered by block exemptions (training, employment, SME) and new areas (innovation, environment, risk capital, regional aid). Texts on research and capital risk were adopted in 2006, but those applicable to the environment will be adopted in 2007. Finalisation of the draft new GBER is scheduled for 2007 and formal adoption by the Commission in 2008. Proposal of Directive amending Council Directive 2001/23/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses Revision Directive 2001/23/EC does not contain any provisions on conflict of laws. As a result, there is a lack of clarity as to how to apply the provisions of the Directive to cross-border transfers. The aim of the proposal - to be made by the Commission following the two phases of consultation of social partners - is therefore to clarify the application of the Directive to cross-border operations. The proposal would increase legal certainty for economic and judicial agents and result in costs savings for undertakings and better protection for workers. Community initiative on work-related musculoskeletal disorders Recast The objective of this initiative is to integrate into a single legislative instrument the provisions on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks of musculo-skeletal disorders at work. These provisions are currently fragmented over different directives, namely Council Directive 90/269/EEC on the minimum health and safety requirements for the manual handling of loads and Council Directive 90/270/EEC on the minimum health and safety requirements for work with display screen equipment. A single legislative instrument would be more comprehensive, clearer and easier to apply.

Revision of the Pharmaceutical \"Variations\" Regulations: change to the legal basis, in Directives 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use and 2001/82/EC for veterinary use Revision The objective is to simplify the rules concerning post-licensing changes to medicines (so-called \u2018Variations\u2019 Regulations). Administrative management of these rules currently mobilise more than 60% of the human resources and financial costs of companies\u2019 regulatory departments. In some cases, this burden may hinder innovation by preventing the introduction of changes that are beneficial to patients and society. The objective of this initiative is to reduce the administrative burden for industry by streamlining the circumstances obliging industry to fill applications for variations of human and veterinary medical products. The current legal basis for implementing rules on changes to the marketing authorisation doesn't allow the Commission to set rules for purely national marketing authorisation. This legal basis should be widened to close the gap for harmonisation. This initiative aims at changing the legal basis for Directives: 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use and Directive 2001/82/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for veterinary use.

Regulation on Advanced Safety Features and Tyres Revision The proposal will simplify EC legislation in the domain of vehicle safety by replacing existing legislation in the area into one main Regulation. It will include electronic stability control and low rolling resistance tyres. The proposal will repeal some 50 separate Directives and will replace them, where appropriate, with references to UNECE Regulations. The beneficiaries of the simplification aspect of this proposal will primarily be vehicle manufacturers and national approval authorities. Replacing Directives with a Regulation will also ease the administrative burden on the Member States since they would not have to transpose legal acts in the domain of vehicle safety in the future. Furthermore, references to UNECE Regulations will avoid the existing duplication between EU and UNECE law and will thus lead to \"better regulation\". Textiles: simplification and replacement by a single regulation Revision The replacement of 3 Directives by 1 Regulation will simplify procedures for Member States, companies and the Commission leading to shorter periods for adoption of new fibre names. The standard methods of quantitative analysis of binary and ternary textile fibre mixtures currently included in two of the directives are to be transferred to the standardisation process. This means that consumers and companies could benefit faster from the use of new innovative products. Innovation and technological developments will be thus encouraged. In addition, the legal nature of the legislation (Regulation) will facilitate the application of technical adaptations by the Member States. Pressure Vessels and Transportable Pressure Equipment Repeal The objective is to repeal 4 Directives on Pressure Vessels (76/767/EEC, 84/525/EEC, 84/526/EEC, 84/527/EEC) and integration of the still relevant provisions into the revision of Directive 99/36/EC (Transportable Pressure Equipment).

Eco-label award scheme: revision of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco- label award scheme Revision The revision aims at enhancing effectiveness and market impact by increasing the range of eligible product groups and the number of eco-labelled goods and services actually available to the consumer. For this purpose, the procedure of developing and adopting eco-label criteria will be thoroughly changed and simplified. Economic stakeholders will be involved to a greater extent into the process, thereby increasing ownership and self-regulatory aspects of the scheme, whereas the administrative burden put on Member States will be reduced. Once the criteria are adopted, it will be easy for economic operators to apply for the award of the eco-label to their products. Synergies with existing eco-labels at national level will be facilitated and limits will be put on the costs and fees Member States' authorities may charge on the applicant. Furthermore, the criteria should be defined in such a way that they can be easily used for the purpose of green public procurement.

The objective is to provide a revised legal framework for regulating the placing on the market of biocidal products. The revision aims to address concerns regarding complexity and the cost, as well as the availability of certain biocidal products, and bring about a significant simplification of the current legislative framework and procedures. The revision of the biocides legislative framework will bring it in line with the EU Chemicals policy (REACH Regulation). WEEE: revision of Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electric and Electronic Equipments Revision The revision of the Directive 2002/96/EC will examine possibilities to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the directive in achieving its environmental goals and eliminate any unnecessary costs to business, consumers, NGOs and public authorities arising from implementation of the directive. The revision will concern the targets, scope, treatment requirement and the operation of the producer responsibility provisions. RoHS: revision of Directive 2002/95/EC on the limitation of the use of certain hazardous substances in the electric and electronic equipments Revision The revision aims at clarifying concepts and facilitate the implementation and enforcement while increasing the environmental benefits. It will enhance legal certainty for all stakeholders and will facilitate implementation by manufacturers by streamlining the mechanism for granting exemptions and enforcement by national authorities through market surveillance and administrative cooperation clauses. It will furthermore provide a more transparent level playing field for manufacturers and simplify procedures through introduction of harmonised compliance checking. Most of these measures will also enhance the internal market effect of the Directive and reduce administrative costs for administrations and manufacturers. ",
        "EN 35 EN Ozone layer: revision of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 on substances that deplete the ozone layer Recast As the production and consumption of the substances covered have been reduced or phased out, many provisions of the Regulation, after seven years in force, need to be repealed or updated. Other provisions may benefit from simplification such as clarification of definitions and procedures and interaction with other pieces of legislation. This will reduce the cases of ambiguous interpretation and the risk of infringements and consequent administrative burdens. In particular, most of the administrative cost reduction will result from ending exemption provisions on some uses of ozone depleting substances. The beneficiaries will be the Member States and the Commission. Overall, the cost savings from ending the exemptions is expected to exceed any additional cost associated with new control measures to combat illegal trade of ozone depleting substances. SEIS: legislative proposal to follow up the Communication on a Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS) Revision Following the 2007 Communication the Commission will adopt legislative proposals underpinning the development of SEIS that could address reporting streamlining and/or coherence of approaches to monitoring and information.

Review of the provisions related to the total feed ban Revision A ban on the feeding of mammalian meat and bone meal (MBM) to cattle, sheep and goats was introduced as of July 1994. This partial ban was extended to a total EU wide suspension on the use of processed animal protein in feed for any animals farmed for the production of food on 1 January 2001 with some exceptions like the use of fish meal for non-ruminants. Any presence of prohibited constituents of animal origin in feed is considered as a breach of the feed ban i.e. the zero-tolerance.

In addition the newer directive needs to be built on to create a minimum set of centralised functions, including a database to allow appropriate entities to carry out trend analysis or other studies, and keep track of safety recommendations, while providing information to the general public. Both directives will be replaced by a single piece of legislation. The objective of the simplification is to take advantage of the necessary revision of the Directive 94/56 to adapt it to recent developments by merging it with Directive 2003/42/EC to create a single legislative act as both directives deal with the use of feedback information to improve accident prevention. Modernise the Marine Equipment Directive 96/98/EC Recast or Revision The objective is to modernise and reform the existing system established by Council Directive 96/98/EC on marine equipmentIts main objectives are : 1) to produce a consolidated version of the text following the successive amendments of the Directive 2) to improve the functioning of the Directive's system by addressing the existing shortcomings ; 3) to adapt it to the reform of the New ",
        "EN 39 EN Approach. It is intended to abrogate the existing Directive and replace it with an entirely new one, while recourse to recast is not excluded. At present, the Directive needs periodic amendments in order to keep pace with the safety requirements and technical standards produced by the International Maritime Organisation as well as the international and European standardisation bodies. This produces an inevitable mismatch between the European and international regulatory frameworks, sometimes spanning several years, whose correction will greatly facilitate the work of the sectors concerned and thus favour the competitiveness of the European marine equipment industry. Furthermore, the adaptation of the directive to the new regulatory framework for the free movement of goods (revision of the new approach) is expected to improve the readability of this instrument and reduce the administrative burden on the industry. Timing of adoption is conditional on significant progress being achieved by December 2007 in the legislative process as regards the revision of the New Approach. Transport of radioactive material Recast The objective is to update and simplify the Community regulatory framework for transporting radioactive material There are currently more than 20 Directives, Regulations and Recommendations governing the transport of radioactive material within the EU. Harmonisation will lead to simplification of rules and procedures. (45 initiatives) ",
