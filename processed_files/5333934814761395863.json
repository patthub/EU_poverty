        "D. whereas on 23 January 2017 US President Donald Trump reinstated the so-called \u2018global gag\u2019 rule, which prevents international organisations from receiving any US global health assistance if they provide, counsel for, refer to or advocate for abortion services \u2014 even if they are doing so with their own, non-US funds and even if abortion is legal in their country; whereas programmes which address HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, Zika response efforts and other health and disease areas will now be affected; whereas this rule will set back years of gains made in advancing the health and wellbeing of communities worldwide, especially in the area of women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights, and could undercut healthcare access for millions worldwide; E. whereas the fifth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG5) is to achieve gender equality and to empower all women and girls worldwide; whereas SDG5 is a stand-alone goal, meaning that it has to be mainstreamed into the whole 2030 Agenda and the realisation of all SDGs; whereas empowering women means providing them with the necessary tools to become economically independent, be represented equally across society, play an equal role in all spheres of life, and gain more power in public life and control over all decisions impacting their lives; F. whereas women are important economic agents worldwide and women\u2019s economic participation can stimulate the economy, create jobs and build inclusive prosperity; whereas countries that value and empower women to participate fully in the labour market and decision-making are more stable, prosperous and secure; whereas gender budgeting is smart economics and ensures that public spending serves the advancement of equality between women and men; G. whereas female creativity and entrepreneurial potential are under-exploited sources of economic growth and jobs that should be further developed; H. whereas 20 years after Beijing, despite solid evidence that women\u2019s empowerment is central to reducing poverty, promoting development and addressing the world\u2019s most urgent challenges, EU governments recognised that no country had fully achieved equality between women and men and empowerment for women and girls, that progress had been slow and uneven, that major gaps and forms of discrimination remained and that new challenges had emerged in the implementation of the Platform for Action\u2019s 12 critical areas of concern; I. whereas the EU plays an important role in fostering the empowerment of women and girls, within the EU as well as worldwide, by political and financial means; whereas the EU must play the key role of guardian of language on women\u2019s human rights agreed by the UN and the EU; J. whereas women continue to produce around 80 % of food in the poorest countries and are currently the main guardians of biodiversity and crop seeds; K. whereas the land is not only a means of production, but a place of culture and identity; whereas access to land is therefore a fundamental component of life and an inalienable right for peasant and indigenous women; 1. Addresses the following recommendation to the Council: General conditions for empowering women and girls (a) Confirm its commitment to the Beijing Platform for Action and to the range of actions for women\u2019s human rights and gender equality outlined therein; confirm its commitment to the twin-track approach to women\u2019s human rights, through gender mainstreaming in all policy areas and the implementation of specific actions for women\u2019s human rights and gender equality; (b) Encourage policies to invest in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 equal access to high-quality education and vocational training, including formal, informal and non-formal education, and to eliminate gender disparities in these fields and across all sectors, particularly those traditionally dominated by men; 18.7.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 252/299 Tuesday 14 February 2017 ",

        "(ab) Establish internal and international rules that guarantee limits to the extensive land grabbing that goes against the interests of small owners, especially women; (ac) Call for the engagement of rural women\u2019s organisations in local, regional, national and global policymaking and support women\u2019s networks in the exchange of experience and good practice, particularly where women\u2019s lives could be affected by the relevant decisions; (ad) Call on all countries to ratify and implement the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, including Article 6 thereof entitled \u2018Women with disabilities\u2019; (ae) Emphasise the right of migrant women workers, especially migrant and refugee domestic workers, to decent working conditions and equal social protection; call for the ratification and implementation of ILO Convention 189; (af) Urge all parties to implement policies that guarantee the rights and humane treatment of women and girl refugees; (ag) Ensure that gender-based persecution is considered as a basis for an asylum claim under the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; (ah) Emphasise the need to protect and promote the rights of LGBTI women; (ai) Call on the CSW, together with the CEDAW Committee, to institutionalise an intersectional approach to their analysis, and to promote the concept of combating multiple discrimination through intersectional analysis throughout all UN bodies; (aj) Pursue policies to address the situation of women facing poverty and social exclusion; (ak) Recognise the role of women as formal and informal carers, and implement policies to improve the conditions under which they provide care; Translating these commitments into expenditure and making them more visible (al) Mobilise the resources required to realise women\u2019s economic rights and reduce gender inequality, including through the use of the existing instruments at EU and Member State level, such as gender impact assessments; use gender budgeting for public expenditure to ensure equality between women and men and remove all gender inequalities; (am) Ensure the full involvement of Parliament and its Committee on Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality in the decision-making process regarding the EU\u2019s position at the 61st session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women; (an) Express its strong support for the work of UN Women, which is a central actor in the UN system for eliminating violence against women and girls worldwide and bringing together all relevant stakeholders in order to generate policy change and coordinate actions; call on all UN member states, as well as on the EU, to increase their funding for UN Women; 2.
