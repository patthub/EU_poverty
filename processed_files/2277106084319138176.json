        "Note to readers Written questions with answers tabled during the sixth parliamentary term are no longer available in all the official languages; the title only is translated into 19 languages (not Maltese). P and E questions are translated by Parliament into the 11 \u2018 old \u2019 languages and into the author \u2019 s language if it is one of the 2004 enlargement languages. As regards answers to questions, the situation is more complicated: \u2014 Answers prepared by the Commission are supplied only in the author \u2019 s language and in either English or French, as requested; \u2014 The Council gives answers only in the 11 old Union languages. In the light of this situation, readers seeking details of the substance of questions and answers should go to Parliament \u2019 s website (Europarl) and, more specifically, the \u2018 Parliamentary questions \u2019 heading: http://www. europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB. Should the language version the reader is seeking not be available, Europarl will propose an alternative.
