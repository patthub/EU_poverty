        "1 Summary: Performance in research and innovation The indicators in the table below present a synthesis of research and innovation (R&I) performance in Turkey. They relate knowledge investment and input to performance and economic output throughout the innovation cycle. They show thematic strengths in key technologies and also the high-tech and medium-tech contribution to the trade balance. The indicator on excellence in science and technology takes into consideration the quality of scientific production as well as technological development. The Innovation Output Indicator covers technological innovation, skills in knowledge-intensive activities, the competitiveness of knowledge-intensive goods and services, and the innovativeness of fast-growing enterprises, focusing on innovation output. The indicator on knowledge-intensity of the economy focuses on the economy\u2019s sectoral composition and specialisation and shows the evolution of the weight of knowledge-intensive sectors and products. Turkey The challenge of structural change for a more competitive economy Since the early 2000s, Turkey has devoted increasing importance to investment in science, technology and innovation, as shown by the continuing rise in government funding for R&D and innovation activities. The growing political commitment to science, technology and innovation is also reflected in the Tenth Development Plan (2014-2018) adopted by the Parliamentary General Assembly on 2 July 2013. It establishes a long-term perspective and identifies improving science, technology and innovation as one of the building blocks for innovative production and steady growth. The new science, technology and innovation strategy document, National Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy (UBTYS), covering the period 2011-2016, was approved by the Supreme Council for Science and Technology (BTYK) in December 2010. It aims to create more output from existing research capacity, to enhance needs-oriented research capacity, and defines strategic focus areas for increased science, technology and innovation performance. Target-oriented approaches are identified in the areas where Turkey has R&D and innovation capacities, demand-oriented approaches where further R&D and innovation efforts are needed, while bottom-up approaches (including basic, applied and frontier research) are also an option. Key indicators of research and innovation performance R&D intensity 2012: 0.86 % (EU: 2.07 %; US: 2.79 %) 2007-2012: +4.4 % (EU: 2.4 %; US: 1.2 %) Excellence in S&T 1 2012: 17.6 (EU: 47.8; US: 58.1) 2007-2012: +6.7 % (EU: +2.9 %; US: -0.2) Innovation Output Indicator 2012: 59.2 (EU: 101.6) Knowledge-intensity of the economy 2 2012: 19.5 (EU: 51.2; US: 59.9) 2007-2012: + 5.3 % (EU: +1.0 %; US: +0.5 %) Areas of marked S&T specialisations: Energy, construction and construction technologies, and automobiles HT + MT contribution to the trade balance 2012: -3.1 % (EU: 4.23 %; US: 1.02 %) 2007-2012: n.a.

        "2 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U Investing in knowledge R&D intensity in Turkey increased progressively from 0.48 % in 2000 to 0.86 % in 2011, experiencing an average annual growth rate of 4.4 % during this period. If this trend continues, Turkey will have an R&D intensity of 1.27 % in 2020, which would be a very good achievement although still below the projected EU average for 2020. Turkey\u2019s R&D intensity decreased slightly from 0.85 % in 2009 to 0.84 % in 2010 due to a corresponding decrease in public R&D intensity from 0.51 % to 0.48 %. Despite the decline in public R&D intensity and the economic crisis, R&D expenditure has increased across all sectors while business R&D intensity grew from 0.34 % in 2009 to 0.37 % in 2011. Although Turkey\u2019s business R&D intensity is still well below the EU average of 1.30 %, it is involved in a positive catching-up process with an average annual growth rate of 2.0 % 3 . Turkish R&I also benefit from support from the EU budget, the main funding instrument being the EU\u2019s Framework Programmes for research and development. The total number of participants in the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) in Turkey is 1201 (out of 7844 applicants), who are receiving more than EUR 200 million. Although the success rate among the participants rose to 16.56 %, it remains below the EU average success rate of 23.72 %.

        "3 An effective research and innovation system building on the European Research Area The graph below illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of Turkey\u2019s R&I system. Reading clockwise, it provides information on human resources, scientific production, technology valorisation and innovation. Average annual growth rates from 2000 to the latest available year are given in brackets. The graph above shows that the Turkish R&I system is still weaker than the EU average in all areas except innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and public expenditure on R&D financed by business enterprise as a % of GDP. On the other hand, the average annual growth rates for most of the indicators are increasing progressively. The most vulnerable areas include human resources, patents and public-private scientific co- publications. In particular, Turkey is behind countries with similar knowledge capacity and economic structure in human resources, with new graduates in science and engineering and new doctoral graduates showing especially low averages. The relative strength of Turkey\u2019s R&I system has declined in the quality of its scientific production, lowering its average annual growth to 2.8 % in the share of its scientific publications among the top 10 % most cited worldwide. A new policy tool has been designed to improve the quality and impact of scientific publications; it is based on arranging the incentives for scientific publications according to their impact factors. In view of Turkey\u2019s commitment to achieve 2023 targets, it shows great potential for catching up. The decrees adopted at the 24 th meeting of the Supreme Council for Science and Technology (BTYK), which focus on furthering the development of human resources for STI, can be considered as complementary initiatives to the National Science and Technology Human Resources Strategy and Action Plan (2011-2016). These decrees strengthen the linkage between the Action Plan and education policies, their main purpose being to improve the quality of Turkey\u2019s education system.

Both the specialisation index (SI, based on the number of publications) and the revealed technological advantage (RTA, based on the number of patents) measure the country\u2019s scientific (SI) and technological (RTA) capacity compared to that at the world level. For each specialisation field it provides information on the growth rate in the number of publications and patents. The graph above shows Turkey\u2019s strong technological specialisations (measured by the number of patents) in energy, construction and construction technologies, and automobiles, as well as scientific specialisation in food, agriculture and fisheries, construction, security, health and biotechnology. Co-specialisation in science and technology can be noted for food, agriculture and fisheries, construction and, to some extent, energy. 03 0.5 3.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 Source: DG Research and Innovation \u2013 Unit for the Analysis and Monitoring of National Research Policies Data: Science-Metrix Canada; Bocconi University, Italy Notes: ( 1 ) Values over 1 show specialisation; values under 1 show a lack of specialisation.

        "5 The relatively limited correlation between specialisation in science and specialisation in technologies suggests that the knowledge transfer towards industry through technologies is limited while, at the same time, the country has yet to benefit from sufficient inflows of foreign direct investment for technological activities, which would help shape a more coherent industrial specialisation. Like Bulgaria, Romania, Poland and Croatia, Turkey has a low knowledge-intensive economy The graph above shows the results of a positional analysis of scientific publications in Turkey. The highest numbers of scientific articles are produced in the field of health, followed by food, agriculture and fisheries, ICT, materials and socio-economic sciences. Scientific excellence and a rather modest participation in FP7. Turkish participation in FP7 is highest in food, agriculture and biotechnologies. The graph below illustrates the positional analysis of Turkish publications showing the country\u2019s situation in terms of scientific specialization and scientific impact over the period 2000-2010. The scientific production of the country is reflected by the size of bubbles, which corresponds to the share of scientific publications from a science field in the country\u2019s total publications. can be found in particular in the field of security, energy, other transport technologies, new production technologies, ICT, and construction and materials. However, those areas of greatest impact are still underdeveloped in terms of the number of publications.

        "6 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U Since 2013, Turkey has adopted an even more bottom-up strategic approach to formulating and implementing STI policy, which enables the wide and active participation of non-state actors. Through this process, both the private sector and academia have identified their R&D needs in a detailed and more efficient way, and support mechanisms have acquired a more targetted structure. In addition, in 2013 the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (T\u00dcB\u0130TAK) developed call- based measures to improve R&D performance in the priority research areas. \u2018The Support Programme for Research, Technological Development and Innovation Projects in Priority Areas (T\u00dcB\u0130TAK-1511)\u2019 targetted private-sector companies whereas \u2018The Support Programme for Research, Technological Development and Innovation Projects in Priority Areas (T\u00dcB\u0130TAK-1003)\u2019 was directed towards researchers from both academia and private/public research centres. Within the last two years, around 60 calls have been opened within the scope of T\u00dcB\u0130TAK-1511 and T\u00dcB\u0130TAK-1003 covering all the priority fields, and new calls will be opened in the near future. The most recent STI priorities include the decisions adopted in meetings of the Supreme Council for Science and Technology (BTYK) which set new targets for Turkey\u2019s national innovation and entrepreneurship system. The BTYK\u2019s 26 th meeting was held on 11 June 2013. The resulting seven new decisions, directly or indirectly related to the energy sector. The national innovation and entrepreneurship system targets have been renewed and new ones set for 2023, the aim being for Turkey to become of the top 10 economies in the world by 2023. The targets are: to increase R&D intensity to 3 %; to increase business R&D intensity to 2 %; to raise the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) researchers to 300 000; to raise the number of FTE researchers in business to 180 000. Innovation Output indicator The Innovation Output Indicator, launched by the European Commission in 2013, was developed at the request of the European Council to benchmark national innovation policies and to monitor the EU\u2019s performance against its main trading partners. It measures the extent to which ideas stemming from innovative sectors are capable of reaching the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. The indicator on innovation focuses on four policy axes: growth via technology \u2013 (patents); jobs (knowledge-intensive employment); long-term global competitiveness (trade in mid-/high-tech commodities); and future business opportunities (jobs in innovative fast-growing firms). On the other hand, The Support Programme for National New Opinions and Products (T\u00dcB\u0130TAK 1005) aims to support much-needed projects in Turkey in order to reduce foreign technology dependency and/or increase the country\u2019s competitiveness. The development of applied research or experimental research projects at the national/international level for new products, processes, methods and modelling is also supported. Another example is the decree which aims to develop policy tools to trigger innovation and entrepreneurship in the universities. In line with this decree, a university index was developed in 2012 to evaluate universities\u2019 entrepreneurship and innovativeness performance, based on such criteria as R&D projects, university- industry collaborations, international collaborations, articles, licences and spin-offs. The 50 most entrepreneurial universities in Turkey were listed for the first time, and this list will be renewed and published annually. The Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology (MoSIT) has also adopted the evaluation-based approach by conducting a performance index work and impact assessment. The first task was preparation of the index for the Technology Development Zones operating in Turkey. The results were announced at a summit held by the ministry in March 2013. The new index is under preparation and indicators are being reviewed for better results. To coordinate the R&I policies and supporting tools, a temporary interministerial coordination board has been set up, including participation of the relevant governmental bodies, to review all R&D, innovation and entrepreneurship support mechanisms in Turkey with a view to ensuring a target-oriented approach.

        "7 Turkey is a low performer in the European innovation indicator. This is the result of low performance in most components of the innovation indicator, whilst the country has no areas of strong performance. Furthermore, its performance is stagnating. The relatively low performance in patents is linked to Turkey\u2019s economic structure, with a relatively large agricultural and low-tech sector (textiles), a limited number of large Turkish multinational manufacturing companies, and the division of work within international companies, including motor vehicle producers, which have production facilities in Turkey but tend to do research and patenting in the headquarter country 4 . Turkey has a very low share in knowledge-intensive activities, partly explained by the importance of employment in the agriculture, construction and tourism sectors. As regards the exports of goods, low- and medium- low-tech sectors, such as food and textiles, are over- represented, which explains the low performance in the share of medium-high/high-tech exports. The low share of knowledge-intensive service exports is explained by the importance of tourism (personal and business travel represent nearly 60 % of service exports) and of transport services (road freight transport) which are not classified as knowledge intensive. However, Turkey is committed to improving its innovative capacity through smart policies and more investment in RDI activities. 2012 2010 EU EU EU EU EU EU EU 80.0 100.0 120.0 75.0 100.0 25.0 50.0 0.0 60.0 GOOD SERV Source: DG Research and Innovation \u2013 Unit for the Analysis and Monitoring of National Research Policies Data: Eurostat, OECD, Innovation Union Scoreboard 2014, DG JRC Notes: All data refer to 2012 except PCT data, which refer to 2010.
