        "our world our dignity our future European Year for Development 2015 Peace and security Light a symbol of peace: deradicalised youth in Pakistan vowing to work towards peace in their communities. Read their story on europa.eu/eyd2015 MAY, THE MONTH OF PEACE AND SECURITY Today, approximately 1.5 billion people live in fragile and conflict-affected countries. Over the last decade, the concept of fragility has emerged to describe the situation of countries that have gone through recurrent cycles of violence, conflict and lack of development. Conflict and violence can have different root causes including injustice, inequality, ethnic tensions or extremism. Moreover, instability can result from state institutions being weak, and failing to meet the basic needs of citizens and upholding human rights. Conflict and violence on a national scale weaken state structures and can reverse a country\u2019s development progress by more than 20 years. It is the weakest in society who suffer from instability. Currently, the number of people that have been forced from their homes is at the highest level since World War II, with over 51 million refugees and displaced people worldwide. Insecurity and violent conflict are amongst the biggest obstacles to achieving development goals. As a group, fragile states have lagged behind other developing countries in making progress towards reaching the MDGs. Only one in every three fragile states is expected to reach the goal of halving poverty by 2015, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). On current trends, the goal of eradicating poverty and other development goals will remain beyond the reach of many fragile states, well into the future. THE EU AND PEACE AND SECURITY Ensuring a safer and more equitable world is a matter of mutual interest for developed and developing countries alike. Peace and security have long been recognised by the EU as essential for development and vice versa, as encapsulated in the European Consensus on Development from 2005: \u2018Without peace and security, development and poverty eradication are not possible, and without development and poverty eradication no sustainable peace will occur.\u2019 This development\u2013security nexus is one of the challenges that the EU seeks to address in order to promote sustainable development. Development is also the most effective long-term response to forced and illegal migration and trafficking of human beings. The EU pursues a comprehensive approach to peace and security, integrating its full range of external policies and tools, to better EXAMPLES OF EU COOPERATION IN ACTION \u25a0 African Peace Facility (APF): Since 2004 the EU has provided \u20ac1.3 billion through the APF to back African efforts in the area of peace and security on the continent. This has enabled a number of African-led peace operations to take place, such as the AU Mission to Somalia (Amisom), the International Support Mission MISCA in the Central African Republic (CAR) and six accomplished missions in Sudan, Comoros, the CAR and Mali. \u25a0 Ukraine: Since the beginning of the crisis in Ukraine 1.2 million people have been forced from their homes. The EU is funding support centres for people affected by the crisis so that they can find shelter, warm clothes and medical, legal and psychological aid. \u25a0 Myanmar/Burma: The EU is working to bring an end to the long-running civil war in Myanmar/Burma. The Myanmar Peace Centre was established 2 years ago with EU support. The Myanmar Peace Centre supported the peace process which helped bring about bilateral agreements between the government and 16 ethnic armed groups. On 31 March 2015 the government and the groups agreed on a text for a nationwide ceasefire agreement for Myanmar/Burma. \u25a0 The EU is engaged in situations of conflict and fragility through electoral observation missions and common security and defence policy (CSDP) missions. There were 16 civilian and military CSDP missions in July 2014, representing over 7 000 personnel. The year 2015 is a landmark for international aid and development cooperation as the millennium development goals (MDGs) come to their conclusion. Based on these, the world will come together to agree on a new course of action and a post-2015 development agenda. Each month, the EYD2015 is focusing on a different development theme to raise awareness of the benefits of the EU\u2019s development cooperation in that field and to encourage direct involvement, critical thinking and active interest of EU citizens.

EYD2015 \u2014 PEACE AND SECURITY THEMATIC MONTHS Each month during the campaign will focus on a different theme involved in development around the world. January EUROPE IN THE WORLD February EDUCATION March WOMEN AND GIRLS April HEALTH May PEACE AND SECURITY June SUSTAINABLE GREEN GROWTH, DECENT JOBS, BUSINESSES July CHILDREN AND YOUTH August HUMANITARIAN AID September DEMOGRAPHY AND MIGRATION October FOOD SECURITY November SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE ACTION December HUMAN RIGHTS AND GOVERNANCE respond to external conflicts and crises, from early warning and prevention to early recovery, stabilisation and peace-building. The EU works to promote peaceful and inclusive societies and the building of viable state institutions. To ensure this process is inclusive, the EU engages all groups in partner countries, including women and at-risk groups. Security is a vital element of the EU\u2019s comprehensive approach towards reestablishing peace and development in a country. One way in which the EU addresses security is through security sector reform, which includes all relevant actors of the security system (i.e. army, police, justice, oversight bodies and civil society). The EU also tackles threats of a global or transregional nature, such as organised crime, terrorism, cybercrime and many more, which undermine the development and human security of millions worldwide. During humanitarian emergencies, the EU provides emergency assistance and relief to the victims, with particular attention to the most vulnerable. Aid is channelled impartially to the affected populations, regardless of their race, ethnic group, religion, gender, age, nationality or political affiliation. DID YOU KNOW? The importance of addressing conflict and instability in the post-2015 development agenda has been recognised with the proposal of a specific sustainable development goal (SDG) goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. This is an important step which will help unite the international community in working towards sustainable development and peace and security. FACTS AND FIGURES The EU works with over 50 countries affected by conflict and fragility. The EU each year helps over 120 million victims of conflict and disasters worldwide.
