These Reports are published, pursuant to the Rules of the Court of Justice and in accordance with the rules on the languages to be used in the Communities, in the official languages, 1 namely, Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish, the language of each case being specified. From 1 May 2004, unless the Judges hearing the case decide otherwise, the following will no longer be published in the Reports: \u2014 judgments in cases other than references for a preliminary ruling delivered by Chambers of three Judges, \u2014 judgments in cases other than references for a preliminary ruling delivered by Chambers of five Judges where the Advocate General does not give an Opinion, \u2014 orders. Those decisions can, however, be found on the Court\u2019s Internet site (http://curia. europa.eu) in the languages available, namely the language of the case and the language of the deliberations. From volume 2006-1, the Reports will include a section containing details of unpublished decisions (pages numbered I-1*, I-2*, etc.). * The summaries of judgments and orders do not bind the Court and are in no way to be regarded as an official interpretation of the decisions summarised. * In order to facilitate use of the Reports, pagination is the same in all the language versions. It is therefore inevitable that some pages will not be fully utilised. These Reports may be reproduced, provided the source is acknowledged. The recommended mode of citation is as follows: the case number, the names of the parties in the form used in the heading of the pages of the Reports, the year (in square brackets) and abbreviated title (ECR) of the Reports, the page number, preceeded by the numeral \u2018I\u2019 for cases before the Court of Justice and by the numeral \u2018II\u2019 for cases before the Court of First Instance. 1 For Irish, temporary derogation measures have been laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 920/2005 (OJ 2005 L 156, p. 3).

        "I NOTE ON THE CITATION OF ARTICLES OF THE TREATIES IN THE PUBLICATIONS OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE AND THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE Pursuant to the renumbering of the articles of the Treaty on European Union (EU) and of the Treaty establishing the European Community (EC), brought about by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance have introduced, with effect from 1 May 1999, a new method of citation of the articles of the EU, EC, ECSC and Euratom Treaties. That new method is primarily designed to avoid all risk of confusion between the version of an article as it stood prior to 1 May 1999 and the version applying after that date. The principles on which that method operates are as follows: \u2014 Where reference is made to an article of a Treaty as it stands after 1 May 1999, the number of the article is immediately followed by two letters indicating the Treaty concerned: EU for the Treaty on European Union EC for the EC Treaty CS for the ECSC Treaty EA for the Euratom Treaty. Thus, \u2018Article 234 EC \u2019 denotes the article of that Treaty as it stands after 1 May 1999. \u2014 Where, on the other hand, reference is made to an article of a Treaty as it stood before 1 May 1999, the number of the article is followed by the words \u2018of the Treaty on European Union\u2019, \u2018of the EC (or EEC) Treaty\u2019, \u2018of the ECSC Treaty\u2019 or \u2018of the EAEC Treaty\u2019, as the case may be. Thus, \u2018Article 85 of the EC Treaty \u2019 refers to Article 85 of that Treaty before 1 May 1999. \u2014 In addition, as regards the EC Treaty and the Treaty on European Union, again where reference is made to an article of a Treaty as it stood before 1 May 1999, the initial citation of the article in a text is followed by a reference in brackets to the corresponding provision of the same Treaty as it stands after 1 May 1999, as follows: \u2014 \u2018Article 85 of the EC Treaty (now Article 81 EC)\u2019, where the article has not been amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam; ",
        "II \u2014 \u2018Article 51 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 42 EC)\u2019, where the article has been amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam; \u2014 \u2018Article 53 of the EC Treaty (repealed by the Treaty of Amsterdam)\u2019, where the article has been repealed by the Treaty of Amsterdam. \u2014 By way of exception to the latter rule, the initial citation of (the former) Articles 117 to 120 of the EC Treaty, which have been replaced en bloc by the Treaty of Amsterdam, is followed by the following wording in brackets: \u2018 (Articles 117 to 120 of the EC Treaty have been replaced by Articles 136 EC to 143 EC) \u2019. For example: \u2014 \u2018Article 119 of the EC Treaty (Articles 117 to 120 of the EC Treaty have been replaced by Articles 136 EC to 143 EC)\u2019. The same applies to Articles J to J.11 and K to K.9 of the Treaty on European Union. For example: \u2014 \u2018Article J.2 of the Treaty on European Union (Articles J to J.11 of the Treaty on European Union have been replaced by Articles 11 EU to 28 EU)\u2019; \u2014 \u2018Article K.2 of the Treaty on European Union (Articles K to K.9 of the Treaty on European Union have been replaced by Articles 29 EU to 42 EU)\u2019. \u2014 Comprehensive lists setting out the new method of citation of the art - icles of the EC Treaty and of the articles of the Treaty on European Union as they stood before 1 May 1999 are published in Sections I and II of the European Court Reports for May 1999.

Acts of the institutions \u2014 Choice of legal basis \u2014 Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans and loan guarantees for projects outside the Community \u2014 Decision 2006/1016 (Arts 177 EC, 179 EC and 181a EC; Council Decision 2006/1016) 3. Actions for annulment \u2014 Judgment annulling a measure \u2014 Effects \u2014 Limitation by the Court (Art. 231, second para., EC; Council Decision 2006/1016) 1. It is true that in its literal sense the term \u2018third countries\u2019 used in Article 181a EC in connection with economic, financial and technical cooperation with third countries is sufficiently wide to encom- pass both developing countries and other third countries. It cannot, however, be implied from this, without restricting the scope of Article 179 EC in Title XX of the EC Treaty on development cooperation, that all economic, financial and tech- nical cooperation measures with devel- oping countries within the meaning of Article 177 EC may be undertaken on the sole basis of Article 181a EC. Although Article 181a EC alone expressly envis- ages \u2018economic, financial and technical cooperation\u2019, while Article 179 EC refers, in a general way, only to \u2018measures\u2019, the fact remains that such cooperation may, depending on its specific details, constitute a typical form of development cooperation. In addition, Article 181a EC is intro- duced by the words \u2018[w]ithout prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty, and in particular to those of Title XX\u2019. Those words indicate that Title XX applies specifically to development cooperation. Although Article 179 EC also starts with the words \u2018[w]ithout prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty\u2019, it must, however, be noted, first, that Article 179 EC was drafted at a time before Article 181a EC existed. Second, the proviso contained in Article 179 EC is less specific than that contained in Article 181a EC, which refers expressly to Title XX of the Treaty. In those circumstances, the proviso contained in Article 181a EC applies with priority over the proviso in Article 179 EC. It follows that, since Article 181a EC is to apply without prejudice to Title XX of the EC Treaty, that article is not intended to constitute the legal basis for measures pursuing the objectives of development cooperation within the meaning of Title XX which are set out in Article 177 EC. (see paras 39-45, 47) ",
        "I - 8105 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL 2. Decision 2006/1016 grants a Commu- nity guarantee to the European Invest- ment Bank (EIB) against losses under loans and loan guarantees for projects outside the Community. In so far as the contested decision concerns devel- oping countries within the meaning of Title XX of the Treaty, it falls under that title, and thus under Article 179 EC, inasmuch as the financial cooperation which the decision implements through the Community guarantee granted to the EIB also pursues, in so far as devel- oping countries are concerned, the socio-economic objectives referred to in Article 177 EC, particularly the sustain- able economic and social development of such countries. Accordingly, Decision 2006/1016 has two components, one of which concerns development cooperation falling under Article 179 EC, while the other concerns economic, financial and technical co- operation with third countries other than developing countries, falling under Article 181a EC. Those two components are inseparably linked, without it being possible to identify a main or predomin- ant aim or component. Recourse to a dual legal basis is, however, not possible where the procedures laid down for each legal basis are incompat- ible with one another. In that regard, the Council acts by a qualified majority both under the procedure referred to in Article 179 EC and under that laid down in Article 181a EC. Moreover, the use of a dual legal basis consisting of Articles 179 EC and 181a EC would not encroach on the rights of the European Parliament. The use of Article 179 EC involves greater participation by the Parliament since it provides for the adop- tion of the measure by the \u2018co-decision\u2019 procedure, while Article 181a EC \u2014 the sole legal basis used for the adoption of the contested decision \u2014 provides only for consultation of the Parliament by the Council. In view, furthermore of the complementary relationship which exists between Titles XX and XXI of the Treaty and the quasi-interdependence of Art - icles 179 EC and 181a EC, the procedures respectively laid down in those two art - icles cannot be classed as incompatible. It follows that Decision 2006/1016 should have been founded, exceptionally, on the dual legal basis of Articles 179 EC and 181a EC. It must thus be annulled, since it is based on Article 181a EC alone. (see paras 37, 66, 67, 72, 75-77, 79, 83-85, operative part 1) ",
        "I - 8106 SUMMARY \u2014 CASE C-155/07 3. The second paragraph of Article 231 EC, under the terms of which the Court may, if it considers this necessary, state which of the effects of a regulation which it has declared void are to be considered defini- tive, is also capable of being applied, by analogy, to a decision where there are important grounds of legal certainty, comparable to those which arise in the case of annulment of certain regulations, justifying exercise by the Court of the power conferred on it, in this context, by that article. In that regard, Decision 2006/1016 granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank (EIB) against losses under loans and loan guarantees for projects outside the Community, without maintaining its effects would be liable to have adverse consequences for the credit rating of the European Investment Bank and would lead to damaging uncertainties for current and future financing operations of that organisation.

By the present action for annulment, the Parliament is objecting to the legal basis chosen for the adoption of Council Decision 2006/1016/EC of 19 December 2006 granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans and loan guarantees for projects outside the Community. 2 2. The Council adopted that decision on the legal basis for economic, financial and technical cooperation with third coun- tries (Article 181a EC). In the view of the Parliament, the decision should have been based additionally on Article 179 EC \u2014 the legal basis for development cooperation. In support of its view, the Parliament points out that the majority of the third countries covered by the decision are developing countries. 1 \u2014 Original language: German. 2 \u2014 OJ 2006 L 414, p. 95, \u2018Decision 2006/1016\u2019, \u2018the contested decision\u2019 or \u2018the decision\u2019.

On 22 June 2006 the Commission submitted its proposal for a Council Deci- sion granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank (\u2018the EIB\u2019) against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the Community, basing that proposal on Article 181a EC. 3 14. In its resolution of 30 November 2006 the Parliament presented its view on the proposal and called on the Commission to add Article 179 EC to Article 181a EC as the legal basis. 4 3 \u2014 Proposal for a Council Decision granting a Community guar- antee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the Community, COM(2006) 324 final. 4 \u2014 European Parliament legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council decision granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the Community, 30 November 2006, P6_TA(2006)0507 (OJ 2006 C 316E, p. 109). 15. However, the Commission did not amend its proposal in this regard 5 and on 19 December 2006 the Council adopted the contested decision with Article 181a EC as the sole legal basis. B \u2014 Forms of order sought and procedure before the Court of Justice 16. On 19 March 2007 the Parliament brought an action before the Court of Justice.

",
        "I - 8113 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL 17. The Council claims that the Court should: \u2014 dismiss the action; \u2014 order the Parliament to pay the costs. 18. By order of the President of the Court of Justice of 10 October 2007, the Commission of the European Communities was granted leave to intervene in support of the form of order sought by the Council. 19. All the parties presented submissions in the written procedure and at the hearing on 14 May 2008. IV \u2014 Legal assessment 20. The Parliament relies on a single plea in law in support of its action for annulment, alleging an incorrect choice of legal basis for the adoption of the decision. The Parliament thus alleges an infringement of the EC Treaty for the purposes of the second paragraph of Article 230 EC. 21. The Parliament considers that Deci- sion 2006/1016 should not have been based solely on Article 181a EC, but additionally on Article 179 EC. In support of its view, the Parliament makes the submission \u2014 which the Council does not dispute \u2014 that the majority of the third countries covered by the decision are to be regarded as developing countries. 22. Both parties agree that the decision is a financial cooperation measure. In the view of the Parliament, however, Article 179 EC is the more specific legal basis for financial cooperation with developing countries and precludes the application of Article 181a EC in this regard. 23. The Council and the Commission take the view that a measure cannot be based additionally on Article 179 EC solely because it concerns developing countries. That legal basis is applicable only where the measure in question also pursues the objectives of devel- opment assistance policy, as laid down in Article 177 EC. Whilst the contested decision does also concern developing countries in - directly, it does not pursue development as- sistance objectives. ",
        "I - 8114 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-155/07 A \u2014 Determination of the correct legal basis 24. It is settled case-law that the choice of the legal basis for a Community measure must rest on objective factors amenable to judicial review, which include in particular the aim and the content of the measure. 6 25. If examination of the aim and the content of a Community measure reveals that it pursues a twofold purpose or that it has a twofold component, falling within the scope of different legal bases, and if one is identifi- able as the main or predominant purpose or component, whereas the other is merely inci- dental, the measure must be based on a single legal basis, namely that required by the main or predominant purpose or component. 7 26. Before I consider the content and the objectives of the contested decision, however, it is first necessary to determine the scopes of Articles 179 EC and 181a EC in abstract terms. Only once the respective 6 \u2014 See, inter alia, Case C-440/05 Commission v Council [2007] ECR I-9097, paragraph 61; Case C-178/03 Commission v Parliament and Council [2006] ECR I-107, paragraph 41; Case C-94/03 Commission v Council [2006] ECR I-1, paragraph 34; and Case C-300/89 Commission v Council , \u2018 Titanium dioxide\u2019 , [1991] ECR I-2867, paragraph 10. 7 \u2014 See, inter alia, Case C-91/05 Commission v Council [2008] ECR I-3651, paragraph 73; Case C-178/03 Commission v Parliament and Council (cited in footnote 6, paragraph 42); Case C-94/03 Commission v Council (cited in footnote 6, paragraph 35); and Case C-211/01 Commission v Council [2003] ECR I-8913, paragraph 39. scopes of those legal bases have been defined is it possible to examine in a second stage whether the objective and the content of the decision actually fall within the scope of both legal bases and, if so, what consequences are to be inferred. B \u2014 Does the decision fall within the scope of more than one legal basis? 1. The scope of Article 179 EC and Article 181a EC 27. Article 179 EC constitutes the legal basis for development cooperation measures, whilst Article 181a EC is a legal basis for \u2018economic, financial and technical cooper- ation with third countries \u2019. The present case essentially hinges on how these two legal bases are to be distinguished and whether Article 181a EC can also encompass meas- ures of the kind mentioned therein which relate to developing countries . 28. It should first be made clear that the nature of the measure cannot be used as a distinguishing criterion. It is true that only Article 181a EC expressly mentions ",
        "I - 8115 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL \u2018 economic, financial and technical co- operation\u2019 and Article 179 EC refers solely in general terms to \u2018measure\u2019. Economic, finan- cial and technical assistance or cooperation is, however, among the conventional forms of development cooperation. 8 29. The Parliament takes the view that only a geographical criterion distinguishes the respective scopes of the two provi- sions. Accordingly, Article 179 EC concerns cooperation with developing countries and Article 181a EC concerns only cooperation with other countries. 30. In support of its view, the Parliament mentions in particular the historical devel- opment of Titles XX and XXI. Title XX on development cooperation was inserted into the Treaty by the Maastricht Treaty. Meas- ures concerning developing countries had previously been based on Article 308 EC. Following the introduction of Title XX meas- ures concerning third countries which were not developing countries continued to be based on Article 308 EC, until Article 181a EC was created by the Treaty of Nice. The Parliament adds that it can be seen that Article 181a EC was intended to fill the gap which existed in the Treaty as regards co- operation with third countries which were not developing countries. 8 \u2014 See the joint statement by the Council and the representa- tives of the governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on European Union Development Policy: \u2018The European Consensus\u2019, 20 December 2005 (OJ 2006 C 46, p. 1), point 119. 31. The Council and the Commission, on the other hand, take the view that a geographical criterion alone may not be used in drawing a distinction between the provisions. A ma- terial criterion must also be added. A measure falls outside the scope of Article 181a EC only if it concerns a developing country and also pursues the objectives referred to in Article 177 EC, since only then is Article 179 EC relevant as a legal basis. A measure con- cerning developing countries which does not pursue the objectives referred to in Article 177 EC may therefore be based on Article 181a EC. 32. If consideration is given only to the wording, the term \u2018third countries\u2019 is suffi- ciently broad to include developing countries. 33. However, an examination of the scheme of the Treaty raises doubts over this understanding. 34. Article 181a EC is introduced with the words \u2018without prejudice to the other provi- sions of this Treaty, and in particular those of Title XX\u2019. It is thus made clear that Title XX on development cooperation is more specific and takes precedence over Article 181a EC. ",
        "I - 8116 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-155/07 35. The Council points out that Article 179 EC also begins with the words \u2018without preju- dice to the other provisions of this Treaty\u2019. However, it must be stated, first of all, that Article 179 EC was drafted at a time when Article 181a EC did not yet exist, as the latter article was introduced into the EC Treaty only with a subsequent amendment of the Treaty. Secondly, the proviso contained in Article 179 EC is much less specific than the proviso in Article 181a EC, which expressly mentions Title XX. The proviso in Article 179 EC therefore prevails over the proviso in Article 181a EC. 36. Title XX and the legal basis formed by Article 179 EC are therefore the more specific provisions for cooperation with developing countries. 37. However, it is unclear how far the effects of the specific nature of Title XX extend. Can measures which concern developing countries never be based on Article 181a EC? Or do the effects extend no further than the scope of Article 179 EC, with the result that measures which do not fall within the scope of Article 179 EC may be based on Article 181a EC? 38. In my view, a teleological interpretation suggests that measures concerning devel- oping countries are not in principle covered by Article 181a EC. 9 39. Any other interpretation conceals the danger that Article 181a EC will be used to circumvent the wording and assessments in Title XX. 10 The measures governed in Article 181a EC, namely economic, finan- cial and technical cooperation, are among the conventional forms of development assistance. 11 Under Article 179 EC, meas- ures concerning developing countries are dependent on the precondition that they serve the objectives referred to in Article 177 EC by fostering the sustainable economic and social development of developing coun- tries, their smooth and gradual integration into the world economy and the campaign against poverty. In contrast, Article 181a EC does not link cooperation to the pursuit of development-policy and social objectives. 40. If the legislature could base cooper- ation measures with developing countries on Article 181a EC where they do not pursue the objectives referred to in Article 177 EC, that would ultimately circumvent the binding objectives laid down in Article 177 EC. The legislature could then organise economic cooperation with developing countries 9 \u2014 See to this effect also the Opinion of Advocate General Mengozzi of 19 September 2007 in Case C-91/05 Commis\u00ad sion v Council (cited in footnote 7, point 148). 10 \u2014 Article 181a EC does not only refer to Article 179 EC but expressly mentions Title XX as a whole. 11 \u2014 See footnote 8. ",
        "I - 8117 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL without taking account of the objectives imposed on it by Article 177 EC. 12 However, this is contrary to the scheme of the Treaty described above. With a view to avoiding the circumvention of Article 177 EC, there is therefore much to suggest that measures concerning developing countries should not be based on Article 181a EC. 13 2. Interim conclusion 41. There is, however, no need to give a final ruling in the present case on whether a distinction is to be drawn between Article 179 EC and Article 181a EC solely on the basis of the geographical criterion or whether account must also be taken of a material criterion . That question would be relevant only if the contested decision did not pursue the objectives referred to in Article 177 EC. As the following analysis of the content and the objectives of the contested decision will show, however, the decision does pursue the 12 \u2014 In so far as Article 178 EC requires that the Community takes account of the objectives referred to in Article 177 EC in all policy areas, this is no compensation for the risk of circumvention, as merely taking the objectives into account is of secondary importance compared with the obligation under Article 177 EC to further the objectives. 13 \u2014 On the basis of this understanding, the amendment to Article 181a EC to be made by the Treaty of Lisbon would constitute a clarification. Article 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) will in future explicitly exclude developing countries from its scope: \u2018\u2026 the Union shall carry out economic, financial and technical cooperation measures\u2026 with third countries other than developing countries \u2026\u2019 objectives of development assistance policy for the purposes of Article 177 EC in so far as it concerns developing countries. C \u2014 Content and objective of Decision 2006/1016 42. I will examine below in a first step whether the contested decision falls within the scope of Article 179 EC on the basis of its content. In a second step I will show that the decision pursues the objectives referred to in Article 177 EC, in so far as it concerns devel- oping countries. 1. Content of the decision 43. According to Article 1(1), the content of the decision is constituted by the grant of a guarantee from the Community budget for certain EIB operations. Article 1(1) also lays down the conditions relating to the scope of the guarantee. Under that provision, the guarantee applies to payments not received by the EIB, but due to it, in respect of loans and loan guarantees for EIB eligible invest- ment projects (\u2018EIB financing operations\u2019) ",
        "I - 8118 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-155/07 carried out in countries covered by the deci- sion. A further condition is that the EIB financing operations in question have been granted in accordance with the EIB\u2019s own rules and procedures and in support of the relevant external policy objectives of the European Union. 44. Annex I to the decision specifies which countries fall within the scope of the decision and are eligible. The annex lists countries in four groups: \u2018Pre-accession countries\u2019, \u2018Neighbourhood and partnership countries\u2019, \u2018Asia and Latin America\u2019 and \u2018South Africa\u2019. Individual countries are listed for each group. 45. The Parliament has argued that the majority of the countries listed are devel- oping countries. In the absence of a defin- ition of \u2018developing country\u2019 in Community law, the Parliament has relied on the clas- sification of countries by the OECD and the World Bank. This has not been contested by the Council. In that regard it should be stated that in principle classifications by the OECD and the World Bank have only indicative effect for the purposes of Community law. The concept of \u2018developing country\u2019 is to be determined autonomously in Community law, with the result that classification may differ in individual cases. However, any such possible differences are not of consequence for the assessment of the list of countries in the contested decision. 46. Is the guarantee introduced by the contested decision a measure which falls within the scope of Article 179 EC on the basis of its subject-matter? 47. As has already been explained above, 14 a financial cooperation measure may also fall within the scope of Article 179 EC. 48. Classification as a development assist- ance measure also cannot be precluded by the fact that the EIB\u2019s payments to the project partners in developing countries are not non-refundable subsidies but loans. 49. First of all, as the Parliament and the Commission have argued, the EIB\u2019s project partners are granted loans at more favour- able interest rates on the basis of the guar- antee, and this must be regarded as consti- tuting assistance. Secondly, Article 179(2) EC expressly provides that the EIB must support the Community\u2019s development assistance policy. Since the EIB\u2019s activity essentially consists in lending, the fact that it grants loans and not subsidies cannot preclude clas- sification as development assistance. 14 \u2014 See point 28 of this Opinion. ",
        "I - 8119 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL 2. Objectives of the decision 50. The Parliament takes the view that the contested decision pursues the objectives referred to in Article 177 EC in so far as it concerns developing countries, in particular the fostering of sustainable economic and social development. 51. The Council has disputed this claim, but has not stated what other objective the decision pursues in relation to developing countries. The Council has merely repeat- edly stated that it is the objective of Decision 2006/1016 to establish a \u2018financial cooper- ation measure with third countries by means of a Community financing instrument\u2019. Contrary to the view taken by the Council, however, this does not indicate the objective of the measure so much as its content. As is apparent from the decision, the grant of the guarantee is not an end in itself, but furthers more extensive objectives. 52. The objectives pursued by the deci- sion can be seen in particular from recitals 1 and 3 in its preamble. According to those recitals, the guarantee is granted with a view to supporting EU external action without affecting the EIB\u2019s credit standing. 53. The guarantee is therefore intended to enable the EIB to conduct financing oper- ations in countries outside the Community, which will often entail higher risks, without jeopardising its favourable credit rating. 54. At first sight the impression might there- fore be created that the contested decision is not an external policy measure, but a purely internal measure. This also appears to be intimated by the Commission when it states that the provisions of the contested decision define a financing instrument which applies primarily to the Community\u2019s internal dimension. The Commission also points out that, unlike other financing instruments in the field of external relations, the contested decision is not itself the legal basis for the EIB\u2019s financing operations in third countries; the relevant legal basis is, first and foremost, the second subparagraph of Article 18(1) of the Protocol on the Statute of the EIB. 15 The Commission states that the third countries benefit only indirectly from the contested decision in that they obtain more favour- able loans on the basis of the guarantee. The third countries benefit directly from 15 \u2014 EIB Statute, Protocol No 10 annexed to the Treaty estab- lishing the European Community, in the version of 1 May 2004, Article 18(1): \u2018Within the framework of the task set out in Article 267 of this Treaty, the Bank shall grant loans to its members or to private or public undertakings for invest- ment projects to be carried out in the European territories of Member States, to the extent that funds are not available from other sources on reasonable terms.However, by way of derogation authorised by the Board of Governors, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Board of Directors, the Bank may grant loans for investment projects to be carried out, in whole or in part, outside the European territories of Member States.\u2019 ",
        "I - 8120 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-155/07 the EIB financing operations. At the hearing the Council clarified that this indirect link between the guarantee and the developing countries is the decisive reason why in its view the contested decision should not be based additionally on Article 179 EC. 55. However, that view is not convincing. If the Commission\u2019s argument were taken to its logical conclusion, the result reached would have to be that neither Article 179 EC nor Article 181a EC is a possible legal basis for the contested decision, regardless of whether or not developing countries are concerned. Article 181a EC provides a legal basis for financial cooperation with third countries and not for purely internal measures. 56. The Commission is admittedly correct in its view that the guarantee has direct effects initially only within the Community, that is to say between the EIB and the Community budget. The guarantee in itself therefore also cannot be classified as financial cooperation with third countries. However, the funda\u00ad mental objective of the decision is to support the Community\u2019s external policy. The guar- antee is not an end in itself, but merely the means to achieve the Community\u2019s actual objective, which is to support its external policy by making financial cooperation with third countries through the EIB possible. This is made particularly clear by the fact that under Article 1(1) of the decision the guarantee applies only to EIB financing oper- ations which have been granted in support of the relevant external policy objectives of the European Union. 57. Classification as a development assist- ance measure is not therefore precluded by the fact that the guarantee has effects in developing countries only indirectly through the EIB. The guarantee is the essential condition for implementation by the EIB of financing measures in third countries which, having regard to its own credit rating, it might otherwise not implement at all, or only on much less favourable terms for the EIB\u2019s borrowers in the third countries. Essentially, the guarantee thus makes possible and fosters the EIB\u2019s operations in developing countries. 58. Since the Community establishes through the decision the specific basic condi- tion for the EIB\u2019s assistance activities, the preservation of the EIB\u2019s credit rating there- fore appears, when the necessary assessment is made, to be simply the necessary inter- mediate link for achieving the main objective, which is to support developing countries. ",
        "I - 8121 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL 59. However, does the contested decision, in so far as it concerns developing coun- tries, also pursue the objectives referred to in Article 177 EC, that is to say sustainable economic and social development, integra- tion of developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty? 60. The decision mentions in fairly general terms that its objective is to support the Community\u2019s external policy. However, the Community\u2019s external action also includes the Community\u2019s development assistance policy. Recital 8 in the preamble to the contested decision stresses that EIB financing operations should be consistent with and support EU external policies including specific regional objectives. With regard to developing countries, the specific regional objective is to foster sustainable economic and social development. 16 Article 3(2) of the decision also expressly specifies that the cooperation must be carried out on a region- ally differentiated basis, taking into consid- eration the EIB\u2019s role as well as the policies of the European Union in each region. 61. The contested decision moreover expressly lists the instruments of cooperation which are intended to serve the EIB\u2019s activ- ities to which the guarantee applies. With one exception, those financing instruments 16 \u2014 With regard to the partnership countries listed in Annex 1 it is to support the partnership and neighbourhood policy, and with regard to the pre-accession countries it is to support the pre-accession policy. are based solely or inter alia on Article 179 EC and are therefore development cooper- ation instruments: the European Neighbour- hood and Partnership Instrument 17 (based on Article 179 EC and Article 181a EC), the Development Cooperation Instrument 18 (based on Article 179 EC) and the Instru- ment for Stability 19 (based on Articles 179 EC and 181a EC). 62. In addition, in its preamble the deci- sion sets out specifically the objectives which should be pursued by the EIB financing operations in the individual regions. For the regions which include the developing coun- tries the objectives mentioned are typical objectives of development cooperation. 63. EIB financing in Asia and Latin America should focus on environmental sustain- ability and energy security projects, as well as the continued support of the EU\u2019s pres- ence in Asia and Latin America through foreign direct investment and the transfer of technology and know-how (recital 12). In Central Asia the EIB should focus on major 17 \u2014 Regulation (EC) No 1638/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 2006 laying down general provisions establishing a European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (OJ 2006 L 310, p. 1). 18 \u2014 Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (OJ 2006 L 378, p. 41). 19 \u2014 Regulation (EC) No 1717/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 November 2006 establishing an Instrument for Stability (OJ 2006 L 327, p. 1).

In South Africa the EIB should focus on infrastructure projects of public interest (including municipal infrastructure and power and water supply) and private sector support, including SMEs (recital 14). 64. The financial cooperation with third countries which the contested decision implements through the guarantee to the EIB therefore also pursues, in so far as developing countries are concerned, the socio-economic objectives referred to in Article 177 EC, in particular the sustainable economic and social development of developing countries. 3. Interim conclusion 65. In so far as the contested decision concerns developing countries, it falls within the scope of Article 179 EC. In so far as other countries are concerned, it falls within the scope of Article 181a EC. It must therefore be examined below whether the measure should therefore have been founded on both legal bases. D \u2014 Is it possible to identify a centre of gravity? 66. In principle, a measure is to be founded on only one legal basis. If examination of a Community measure reveals that it pursues a twofold purpose, or that it has a twofold component, according to the Court\u2019s \u2018centre of gravity\u2019 case-law the measure must be founded on the legal basis required by the main or predominant purpose or component. 20 67. Only if, exceptionally, it is established that the measure simultaneously pursues a number of objectives or has several compo- nents that are indissociably linked, without one being secondary and indirect in rela- tion to the other, will such a measure have to be founded on the various corresponding legal bases, in so far as their procedures are compatible. 21 68. As has been explained, the contested decision has a twofold component: on the one hand, it concerns financial cooperation with developing countries and falls within the scope of Article 179 EC, whilst, on the other, it concerns financial cooperation with other third countries and falls within the scope of Article 181a EC. 20 \u2014 Commission v Parliament and Council (cited in footnote 6, paragraph 42) and Case C-338/01 Commission v Council [2004] ECR I-4829, paragraph 55. 21 \u2014 See, inter alia, Case C-91/05 Commission v Council (cited in footnote 9, paragraph 75); Commission v Parliament and Council (cited in footnote 6, paragraph 43); and Case C-338/01 Commission v Council (cited in footnote 20, paragraph 56). ",
        "I - 8123 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL 69. The Parliament takes the view that the Court\u2019s case-law on centre of gravity is not applicable in the present case. In the alterna- tive, the Parliament argues that, even if the criterion of centre of gravity is applied, both components are indissociably linked and neither is secondary and indirect in relation to the other. 70. The present situation differs from previ- ously decided cases in two respects. 71. First of all, the two legal bases concern the same subject, namely cooperation with third countries. However, as has been explained above, they are mutually exclusive with regard to the beneficiaries of the co- operation: Article 179 EC is a more specific provision than Article 181a EC and takes precedence over it. Where developing coun- tries are concerned, Article 179 EC is the correct legal basis and, where other countries are concerned, Article 181a is the appro- priate legal basis. 72. Secondly, the centre of gravity here cannot be determined on the basis of a content-related criterion, as the contested decision concerns financial cooperation with developing countries and with other coun- tries. A centre of gravity can be determined at most in purely quantitative terms. 73. This is also the difference compared with the fisheries and trade agreements cited by the Council. 22 Even though they concern developing countries, they were founded only on the substantively relevant legal basis and not additionally on Article 179 EC. A content\u00adrelated centre of gravity can be identified there, from between development assistance policy and fisheries policy or trade policy. Where the centre of gravity in terms of content is fisheries or trade policy, a measure must be founded solely on the relevant legal bases and not additionally on Article 179 EC, even if the measure concerns developing countries. However, the contested decision concerns, in terms of content, the same kind of actions, which differ only with respect to the beneficiaries. 74. Examination of the quantitative centre of gravity in the present case would give rise to the conclusion that neither the component which concerns countries other than devel- oping countries nor the component which concerns developing countries forms the centre of gravity. 75. There is a greater number of devel- oping countries than other countries among the countries eligible or potentially eligible for financing under the decision. If only the number of countries were taken as the basis, 22 \u2014 Council Regulation (EC) No 1801/2006 of 30 November 2006 on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agree- ment between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania (OJ 2006 L 343, p. 1). ",
        "I - 8124 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-155/07 the decision should possibly even have been based solely on Article 179 EC. In deter- mining the quantitative centre of gravity, however, the guarantee ceilings which the decision lays down for the individual regions should also be taken into account. It is uncer- tain whether it can be stated precisely how the guarantee ceiling is apportioned between developing countries and non-developing countries. An overall amount is merely given for each individual region and not for indi- vidual countries. However, in a region there may be countries from both categories. At the hearing the Parliament submitted that around one half of the total amount which the decision indicates as the guarantee ceiling is apportionable to developing countries. 23 76. In any case it cannot be inferred from these findings that in quantitative terms the decision concerns countries other than developing countries mainly and predom- inantly and developing countries only in a secondary and incidental way. Even applying the centre of gravity theory, the conclusion is therefore reached in the present case that the contested decision could not be based solely on Article 181a EC. 77. In my view, however, a purely quan\u00ad titative criterion is not suitable in prin- ciple for determining, for the purposes of 23 \u2014 At the hearing Parliament made the submission, which was not disputed by the Council and the Commission, that roughly EUR 13 400 million of the EUR 27 800 million guar- antee ceiling is apportionable to developing countries. the Court\u2019s case-law on centre of gravity, whether the centre of gravity of a measure relates to Article 179 EC or Article 181a EC. It is unclear from the outset on what basis the quantitative centre of gravity is to be determined. Is the number of the coun- tries concerned to be taken as the basis? Does the size in terms of area or popula- tion of the countries also have to be taken into consideration in order to determine whether the centre of gravity of a measure is developing countries or other countries? The correct approach would however prob- ably involve taking account not only of the number of countries but also of the size of the amounts that a measure makes available for cooperation. 78. These factors may possibly, depending on the way they are treated and weighted, produce arbitrary results. In the light of the principle of legal certainty, it is therefore doubtful whether the choice of legal basis should be determined on such a basis. Conse- quently, I believe that in situations such as that in the present case no centre of gravity can be determined for reasons of principle. 79. Ultimately, however, both views lead to the same conclusion: the contested decision could not be based solely on Article 181a EC. ",
        "I - 8125 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL 80. It follows that if both components are indissociably linked the measure is to be founded, exceptionally, on both relevant legal bases, in so far as their procedures are compatible. 24 It must therefore be examined, lastly, whether the procedures under Ar- ticles 179 EC and 181a EC are compatible. E \u2014 Compatibility of the procedures 81. Recourse to a dual legal basis is not possible where the procedures laid down for each legal basis are incompatible with each other or where the use of two legal bases is liable to undermine the rights of the Parlia- ment. 25 This must be examined below. 82. With regard to the voting rules within the Council, the two legal bases are readily compatible since the Council acts by a quali- fied majority in the case of both Article 179 EC and Article 181a EC. 24 \u2014 Commission v Parliament and Council (cited in footnote 6, paragraphs 43 and 57) and Case C-94/03 Commission v Council (cited in footnote 6, paragraphs 36 and 52). 25 \u2014 See Commission v Parliament and Council (cited in foot- note 6, paragraph 57), which refers to Case C-300/89 Commission v Council , \u2018 Titanium dioxide\u2019 (cited in foot- note 6, paragraphs 17 to 21). 83. However, there are differences between the two procedures in relation to participa- tion by the Parliament. 26 Whilst Article 181a EC merely provides for the Parliament to be consulted, under Article 179 EC the Parliament exercises the legislative function together with the Council in the co-decision procedure. 84. The Court has already been called on to decide whether Article 133(4) EC, which does not provide for any formal right of participa- tion by the Parliament, and Article 175(1) EC, which provides for co-decision with the Parliament, are compatible having regard to the different rights of participation enjoyed by the Parliament. 27 The Court proceeded on the basis that the co-decision procedure, involving that is to say greater participation by the Parliament, is to be applied to the combined procedure. The Court accepted that the two procedures are compatible on the basis of the argument that recourse to both these legal bases is not liable to under- mine the Parliament\u2019s rights since recourse to Article 175 EC enables that institution to participate in the adoption of the measure under the co-decision procedure. Conse- quently, the Court considered the two pro - cedures to be compatible. 85. In determining the compatibility of the procedures with regard to the respective 26 \u2014 Under the Treaty of Lisbon this problem will no longer arise because the same procedure will be applicable to both articles and the question as to compatibility can then be answered in the affirmative without any difficulty. 27 \u2014 See Commission v Parliament and Council (cited in foot- note 6, paragraph 59) and Case C-94/03 Commission v Council (cited in footnote 6, paragraph 54). ",
        "I - 8126 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-155/07 forms of participation by the Parliament, the Court therefore has in view in these cases only the rights of participation enjoyed by the Parliament. 86. On the basis of these arguments, the two procedures must also be regarded as compat- ible in the present case. If, as the Court has already ruled, a procedure which does not provide for any participation by the Parlia- ment and the co-decision procedure are compatible with each other, this must apply a fortiori to the compatibility of \u2018consult- ation\u2019 and \u2018co-decision\u2019, the procedures at issue in the present case. Article 179 EC and Article 181a EC may therefore be used as a dual legal basis for a measure. 87. However, the Court has found that a dual legal basis forms the exception, which is possible only where two equivalent objectives or components are indissociably linked. 28 88. As a result, this means that, where a measure is divisible, two separate measures, 28 \u2014 See Commission v Parliament and Council (cited in foot- note 6, paragraph 43) and Case C-94/03 Commission v Council (cited in footnote 6, paragraph 36). that is to say \u2018twin measures\u2019, have to be adopted. A measure which concerns devel- oping countries is to be adopted on the basis of Article 179 EC and a second measure which concerns other third countries on the basis of Article 181a EC. If a measure is not divisible, it is to be based both on Article 179 EC and on Article 181a EC. The legislature is given discretion in assessing whether a measure is divisible. In the present case there is much to suggest that the measure is not divisible, in its present form at least, since it provides for global sums, as guarantee ceilings, for the individual regions which may encompass both developing countries and other countries. This method of indi- cating global sums for individual regions and not ceilings for each country gives the EIB optimal flexibility in the pursuit of its activities. 89. If, on the other hand, the rights of partici- pation of the Council were also considered to be relevant in assessing compatibility, as I suggested in my Opinion in Commission v Parliament and Council , 29 the procedures would have to be found incompatible in the present case. The Council would, as a result of the extension of the co-decision procedure to cooperation with third countries for which 29 \u2014 Commission v Parliament and Council (cited in footnote 6, point 61). ",
        "I - 8127 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL the Treaty has not provided for any right of co-decision for the Parliament, be deprived of its exclusive legislative competence in this field and would have to share legisla- tive competence with the Parliament. Such a result would be contrary to the deliberate decision of the Member States regarding the legislative procedure. According to this view, the contested decision could not therefore be based simultaneously on development cooperation and on cooperation with third countries. 90. Where the procedures are incompatible, the measure must, according to this view, ultimately be founded on one legal basis, and the legal basis which provides for the co-decision procedure must prevail, since, with respect to legislative procedure, the Parliament\u2019s right of co-decision is the norm. Moreover, it is consistent with the principle of transparency (Article 1(2) EU) and the principle of democracy (Article 6(1) EU) if, where two legal bases are equally possible and equally concerned but not compatible with each other, in case of doubt the basis is chosen under which the Parliament\u2019s rights of participation are greater. 91. In my Opinions in Commission v Parliament and Council and Case C-94/03 Commission v Parliament I therefore took the view that a measure which pursues both objectives referred to in Article 133 EC and objectives referred to in Article 175 EC is to be based solely on Article 175 EC. 30 Accord- ingly, in the present case the contested decision would have had to be based solely on Article 179 EC, which provides for the co-decision procedure. F \u2014 Interim conclusion 92. As an interim conclusion, it is clear that, irrespective of whether the procedures under Article 179 EC and under Article 181a EC are considered to be compatible, the contested decision could not in any event be founded on Article 181a EC as the sole legal basis. It must therefore be annulled on account of the incorrect choice of legal basis. V \u2014 Maintenance of effects 93. The Parliament has requested the Court to order that, if the contested decision is annulled, its effects be maintained until the adoption of a new decision. The Council and the Commission support this request by the Parliament. 30 \u2014 Commission v Parliament and Council (cited in footnote 6, point 64). ",
        "I - 8128 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-155/07 94. Under the second paragraph of Article 231 EC the Court, if it considers it necessary, is to state which of the effects of a regulation which it has declared void are to be considered definitive. Whilst, on the basis of its wording, that provision applies only to regulations, the Court has also applied it mutatis mutandis to other measures. 31 95. In accordance with Article 10 thereof, the contested decision came into force on the third day following its publication in the Offi\u00ad cial Journal of the European Union , which took place on 30 December 2006. Since it came into force, the EIB has entered into commitments on the strength of the guar- antee. If the guarantee for the financing oper- ations already commenced by the EIB ceased to apply, this would constitute a considerable risk to the EIB\u2019s credit standing. In respect of commitments already entered into, the effects of the contested decision must there- fore be maintained. 96. It is open to question whether the effects of the decision are also to continue to apply to projects on which a decision has not yet been taken. It could be argued that the EIB could preserve its credit standing by refusing to finance high-risk projects. However, this would result in undue paralysis of the EIB\u2019s operations and thus also of the pursuit of the external objectives of the Community. 31 \u2014 With regard to the mutatis mutandis application to deci- sions, see Case C-22/96 Parliament v Council [1998] ECR I-3231, paragraph 42, and Case C-106/96 United Kingdom v Commission [1998] ECR I-2729, paragraph 41. 97. The validity of the guarantee is thus also to be maintained for EIB financing oper- ations which have not yet been agreed, that is to say for EIB financing operations which are agreed before the adoption of a new decision, but at the latest before the end of a reason- able period within which a new decision is to be adopted. 32 The legislature required less than six months for the adoption of the contested decision. A period of 12 months from the delivery of the judgment should therefore be reasonable for the adoption of a new decision. VI \u2014 Costs 98. Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Pro - cedure, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party\u2019s pleadings. Since the Parliament has applied for the Council to be ordered to pay the costs and the Council is unsuccessful, the Council must be ordered to pay the costs. Under Article 69(4) of the Rules of Procedure, the Commission is to bear its own costs. 32 \u2014 See, in this regard, Joined Cases C-14/06 and C-295/06 Parliament v Commission [2008] ECR I-1649, paragraphs 82 to 86, and Commission v Parliament and Council (cited in footnote 6, paragraphs 61 to 65); see, in this regard, also my Opinion in Case C-217/04 United Kingdom v Parliament and Council [2006] ECR I-3771, points 47 to 50.

        "I - 8129 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL VII \u2014 Conclusion 99. I therefore propose that the Court should: (1) Annul Council Decision 2006/1016/EC of 19 December 2006 granting a Commu- nity guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans and loan guarantees for projects outside the Community. (2) Order that the effects of the annulled decision be maintained for EIB financing operations agreed before a decision adopted on the correct legal basis has entered into force, but at the latest before the end of the 12th month after delivery of the judgment.

Background to the dispute and procedure before the Court On 22 June 2006, the Commission of the European Communities adopted the proposal which led to the contested decision. That proposal cited Article 181a EC as a legal basis. On 30 November 2006, the Parliament adopted a resolution setting out its opinion in respect of that proposal, Amendment 1 of which sought to add Article 179 EC as a legal basis. It called on the Commission to amend the proposal accordingly, in accordance with Article 250(2) EC. 1 2 3 ",
        "I - 8133 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL The Commission did not amend its proposal in that respect and, on 19 December 2006, the Council of the European Union adopted the contested deci- sion on the sole legal basis of Article 181a EC.

By order of the President of the Court of Justice of 10 October 2007, the Commission was granted leave to intervene in support of the form of order sought by the Council. By order of the President of the Court of 25 October 2007, the request of the Euro- pean Investment Bank (EIB) for leave to intervene was refused on the ground that the EIB is not one of the institutions of the European Community exhaustively listed in Article 7(1) EC.

SOUTH AFRICA South Africa.\u2019 The action Arguments of the parties Arguments of the Parliament According to the Parliament, it is clear from the terms of the contested decision that it is an external policy instrument which covers cooperation with both developing and other countries. Since cooperation with developing countries falls exclusively 18 ",
        "I - 8139 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL under Title XX of the Treaty, headed \u2018Development cooperation\u2019, it is necessary to add Article 179 EC as a legal basis for that decision. The Parliament notes, in particular, that the majority of the regions covered by the contested decision are comprised of countries which are \u2018developing countries\u2019 according to the classifications of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and of the World Bank and that the majority of the countries concerned \u2014 in particular, the Mediterranean neighbourhood and partnership coun- tries, the Asian and Latin American countries and South Africa \u2014 are developing countries. The contested decision thus falls within the objectives of Article 177 EC, which include the \u2018sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries\u2019. The fact that the contested decision also concerns third countries which are not developing countries does not mean that that decision had to be adopted on the sole legal basis of Article 181a EC. The purpose of that article, introduced by the Treaty of Nice, is to establish a specific legal basis for autonomous programmes in the finan- cial and technical fields and for horizontal agreements with third countries which are not developing countries. The Parliament also claims that the absence of Article 179 EC as a legal basis for the contested decision allows the Council, pursuant to Article 2(2) and (4) of the deci- sion, to adopt individual decisions concerning one or more developing countries on the basis of Article 181a EC, which would constitute a breach of the Treaty. According to the Parliament, to exclude economic, financial and technical co- operation measures from the scope of development cooperation would amount to excluding the majority of the instruments based on Article 179 EC, with the result that that provision would be rendered largely redundant. 19 20 21 22 ",
        "I - 8140 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-155/07 Furthermore, the Parliament is of the view that the choice of legal basis must be made in the light of a geographical criterion, having regard to the countries with which the Community cooperates pursuant to the Community measure concerned. Thus, Articles 179 EC and 181a EC are applicable according to the countries benefiting from that measure, irrespective of whether there is a main objective and a secondary objective. Inasmuch as the pursuit of the objectives set out in Article 177 EC in prac- tice takes the form of economic and financial cooperation with developing countries, it is possible for Articles 179 EC and 181a EC to seek similar objectives while relating to different target countries. In the alternative, the Parliament maintains that the contested decision simultan- eously pursues the objectives referred to in Articles 181a EC and 179 EC, since it constitutes an economic cooperation measure both with developing countries and with other third countries. The use of a dual legal basis is, thus, justified inasmuch as cooperation with developing countries is an inseparable part of the objective of that decision. Arguments of the Council According to the Council, Article 181a EC constitutes the appropriate and sufficient legal basis for the contested decision. Moreover, one institution\u2019s wish to participate more fully in the adoption of a particular measure has no impact on the choice of its legal basis. The Council considers that it is clear, from an examination of its aim and content, that the sole purpose of the contested decision is to establish a financial cooperation measure with third countries, by means of a Community instrument. 23 24 25 26 ",
        "I - 8141 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL The contested decision falls within the scope of Article 181a EC since, in that regard, it does not distinguish between the third countries covered according to whether or not they are developing countries. The fact that EIB financing operations have to be consistent with the external policies of the European Union and to comple- ment aid policies means, according to the Council, that they are consistent with the development policy of the Community, as required by the first subparagraph of Article 181a(1) EC. In contrast, the fact that the contested decision envisages that it is to be applied in a way which is consistent with development policy or the fact that it produces effects which encourage development is insufficient to justify its adoption on the basis of Article 179 EC too. The same is also true in respect of the fact that the list of eligible or potentially eligible countries which appears in Annex I to the decision includes developing countries, since Article 179(1) and (2) EC provides that the EIB\u2019s contri- butions pursuant to that article are to be implemented without prejudice to the other provisions of the Treaty. The Council stated at the hearing that, in its opinion, the indirect nature of the rela- tionship between the Community guarantee and the developing country constitutes the decisive reason why the contested decision should not additionally be based on Article 179 EC. Arguments of the Commission The Commission contends that the respective scopes of Articles 179 EC and 181a EC are based both on a geographical criterion (developing countries for Title XX of the Treaty and third countries for Title XXI) and on a material criterion (the three object- ives laid down in Article 177(1) EC for Title XX of the Treaty and economic, finan- cial and technical cooperation measures for Title XXI). 27 28 29 30 ",
        "I - 8142 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-155/07 It challenges what it considers to be the strictly geographical interpretation of the scope of Article 181a EC put forward by the Parliament. That interpretation is not justified in the light of the wording of Titles XX and XXI of the Treaty. So far as concerns Title XXI, the geographical criterion refers to all third countries, including, potentially, developing countries. Article 181a EC may thus apply to developing countries in the absence of a more restrictive wording of the title under which it appears and of Article 181a(1) EC. According to the Commission, the Parliament\u2019s argument fails to take account of the phrase \u2018[w]ithout prejudice to the other provi- sions of this Treaty\u2019 included in Article 179(1) EC. The Commission also contends that the contested decision is a financial instru- ment which applies primarily at an internal Community level. It is not that decision but primarily Article 18(1) of the Protocol on the Statute of the EIB, annexed to the Treaty, which is the legal basis for EIB financing operations for the benefit of third countries. The Commission, like the Council, notes that Article 181a EC lays down that economic, financial and technical cooperation measures outside the Community undertaken on the basis of that article \u2018shall be\u2026 consistent with the development policy of the Community\u2019. According to the Commission, therefore, the authors of the Treaty were of the view that measures based on Article 181a EC may have a positive effect on development, including that of developing countries. In reply to a question asked by the Court at the hearing, the Commission stated that, even for the grant of a guarantee to the EIB that relates to operations concerning countries which are all developing countries within the meaning of the Treaty, the correct legal basis is Article 181a EC, since that guarantee benefits those countries only indirectly, through loans which are granted by the EIB under its own internal procedures and on the basis of the Protocol on the Statute of the EIB. 31 32 33 ",
        "I - 8143 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL Findings of the Court Preliminary observations According to settled case-law, the choice of the legal basis for a Community measure must rest on objective factors amenable to judicial review, which include the aim and content of that measure (see, to that effect, inter alia, Case C-300/89 Commission v Council (\u2018Titanium dioxide\u2019) [1991] ECR I-2867, paragraph 10, and Case C-338/01 Commission v Council [2004] ECR I-4829, paragraph 54), and not on the legal basis used for the adoption of other Community measures which might, in certain cases, display similar characteristics (see, to that effect, Case 131/86 United Kingdom v Council [1988] ECR 905, paragraph 29, and Case C-91/05 Commission v Council [2008] ECR I-3651, paragraph 106). In addition, where the Treaty contains a more specific provision that is capable of constituting the legal basis for the measure in question, the measure must be founded on that provision (see, to that effect, Case C-338/01 Commission v Council , paragraph 60, and Case C-533/03 Commis\u00ad sion v Council [2006] ECR I-1025, paragraph 45). If examination of a measure reveals that it pursues two aims or that it has two components and if one of those aims or components is identifiable as the main one, whereas the other is merely incidental, the measure must be founded on a single legal basis, namely that required by the main or predominant aim or component (see, to that effect, inter alia, Case C-155/91 Commission v Council [1993] ECR I-939, para- graphs 19 and 21; Case C-36/98 Spain v Council [2001] ECR I-779, paragraph 59; Case C-338/01 Commission v Council , paragraph 55; and Case C-91/05 Commission v Council , paragraph 73). With regard to a measure that simultaneously pursues a number of objectives, or that has several components, which are inseparably linked without one being inci- dental to the other, the Court has held that, where various provisions of the Treaty 34 35 36 ",
        "I - 8144 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-155/07 are therefore applicable, such a measure will have to be founded, exceptionally, on the various corresponding legal bases (see, to that effect, Case C-211/01 Commis\u00ad sion v Council [2003] ECR I-8913, paragraph 40, and Case C-91/05 Commission v Council , paragraph 75). None the less, the Court has previously held, in particular in paragraphs 17 to 21 of the judgment in Titanium dioxide , that recourse to a dual legal basis is not possible where the procedures laid down for each legal basis are incompatible with each other (see also, to that effect, Joined Cases C-164/97 and C-165/97 Parliament v Council [1999] ECR I-1139, paragraph 14; Case C-338/01 Commission v Council , paragraph 57; Case C-94/03 Commission v Council [2006] ECR I-1, paragraph 52; and Case C-178/03 Commission v Parliament and Council [2006] ECR I-107, paragraph 57). It is in the light of the foregoing that it is necessary to establish whether it was possible to adopt the contested decision validly on the sole legal basis of Article 181a EC. To that end, it is necessary to analyse, initially, the relationship between Article 179 EC, which appears in Title XX of the Treaty, and Article 181a EC, which falls under Title XXI, before examining whether the content and the aim of that decision fall, as the Parliament contends, within the scope of those two articles. If that proves to be the case, it will be necessary to examine what was the appropriate legal basis for the adoption of the decision. Definition of the respective scopes of Titles XX and XXI of the Treaty It is true that, as the Commission states, in its literal sense the term \u2018third countries\u2019 used in Article 181a EC is sufficiently wide to encompass both developing coun- tries and other third countries. It cannot, however, be implied from this, without restricting the scope of Article 179 EC, that all economic, financial and technical cooperation measures with developing countries within the meaning of Article 177 EC may be undertaken on the sole basis of Article 181a EC. 37 38 39 ",
        "I - 8145 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL Although Article 181a EC alone expressly envisages \u2018economic, financial and tech- nical cooperation\u2019, while Article 179 EC refers, in a general way, only to \u2018measures\u2019, the fact remains that such cooperation may, depending on its specific details, consti- tute a typical form of development cooperation. It is common ground that the EIB acts essentially within the framework of economic, financial and technical cooper- ation. Article 179 EC, read in conjunction with Article 177 EC, lays down that the EIB is to contribute, under the terms laid down in its Statute, to the implementa- tion of the measures necessary to further the objectives of the Community\u2019s devel- opment cooperation policy. Thus, point 119 of the joint statement by the Council and the representatives of the governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on European Union Devel- opment Policy: \u2018The European Consensus [on Development]\u2019 (OJ 2006 C 46, p. 1) states that the EIB \u2018is playing an increasingly important role in the implementation of Community aid, through investments in private and public enterprises in developing countries\u2019. In addition, Article 181a EC is introduced by the words \u2018[w]ithout prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty, and in particular to those of Title XX\u2019. Those words indicate that Title XX applies specifically to development cooperation. It is true that, as the Council and the Commission point out, Article 179 EC also starts with the words \u2018[w]ithout prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty\u2019. It must, however, be noted, first, as the Parliament states in its pleadings, that Article 179 EC was drafted at a time before Article 181a EC existed, since Title XXI, of which the latter article forms part, was not inserted into the Treaty until it was revised by the Treaty of Nice. Before Article 181a EC entered into force, provided that Community instruments falling under other policy areas were not involved, the Community, for want of a specific legal basis, adopted measures and concluded cooperation agreements with third countries which were not developing countries on the basis of Article 235 of the EC Treaty (now Article 308 EC). The insertion into the Treaty of Title XXI thus created a specific legal basis for that cooperation and 40 41 42 43 ",
        "I - 8146 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-155/07 eased the procedure for adopting Community initiatives in that field by substituting a qualified majority in the Council for the unanimity required by Article 308 EC. Second, the proviso contained in Article 179 EC is less specific than that contained in Article 181a EC, which refers expressly to Title XX of the Treaty. In those circumstances, the proviso contained in Article 181a EC concerning Title XX of the Treaty applies with priority over the proviso in Article 179 EC. That interpretation cannot be undermined by the Commission\u2019s argument, set out in paragraph 33 above, to the effect that measures concerning policy in the develop- ment cooperation field may be based on Article 181a EC alone, provided that they are consistent with that policy as resulting from Title XX of the Treaty. In stating that economic, financial and technical cooperation measures \u2018shall be\u2026 consistent with the development policy of the Community\u2019, Article 181a(1) EC means simply that, when adopting measures on the basis of Article 181a(1) EC, the Community must ensure that consistency is maintained with what has been or may be decided on the basis of Article 179 EC. Such an analysis is supported by Article 178 EC, under which the Community is to take account of the objectives referred to in Article 177 EC in the policies that it implements which are liable to affect developing countries. It follows that, since Article 181a EC is to apply without prejudice to Title XX of the EC Treaty on development cooperation, that article is not intended to constitute the legal basis for measures pursuing the objectives of development cooperation within the meaning of Title XX which are set out in Article 177 EC. 44 45 46 47 ",
        "I - 8147 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL Without it being necessary, in the present case, to rule on the question whether an economic, financial and technical cooperation measure with developing countries may, to the extent that it does not pursue such objectives, have Article 181a EC as its sole legal basis, it is appropriate to proceed to an examination of the content and aim of the contested decision. The content of the contested decision In accordance with Article 1(1), the contested decision grants the EIB a budgetary guarantee relating to defaults on payments in connection with the financing oper- ations which it carries out in countries covered by that decision, where, inter alia, the financing concerned has been granted to support the external policy objectives of the European Union. As provided in Article 2(1) of the contested decision, the list of countries eligible or potentially eligible for EIB financing under Community guarantee is laid down in Annex I. That list is subdivided into four groups relating, respectively, to pre- accession countries, to neighbourhood and partnership countries, to Asia and Latin America and, lastly, to South Africa. The Parliament contends that the majority of the countries mentioned in that annex are \u2018developing countries\u2019, according to the classifications made in that regard by the OECD and the World Bank. The Council and the Commission have not objected to those categorisations. In that connection, it should be pointed out at the outset that the concept of \u2018devel- oping country\u2019 which appears in Title XX of the Treaty is left undefined. It is true that, as is apparent both from the parties\u2019 oral replies to a question asked by the 48 49 50 51 52 ",
        "I - 8148 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-155/07 Court at the hearing and from footnote 2 of the joint declaration referred to in para- graph 40 above, particular importance is accorded in Community practice to the list of Official Development Assistance recipients adopted by the Development Assist- ance Committee of the OECD. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the concept of \u2018developing country\u2019 must be given an autonomous Community interpretation. That is equally true in view also of the dynamic nature of the developing country cat - egory, in the sense that it is liable to evolve in response to events which are difficult to predict. This notwithstanding, in the present case it is sufficient to point out that it is common ground that a significant number, even the majority, of countries appearing in the list of eligible countries annexed to the contested decision are capable of falling within that concept, whatever its precise definition. In those circumstances, contrary to the contentions of the Council and the Commis- sion, it cannot be ruled out that the establishment of a financial cooperation measure with third countries by means of the contested decision is capable of falling under development cooperation within the meaning of Title XX of the Treaty. As the Parliament and the Commission state, the EIB\u2019s project partners receive, by virtue of the Community guarantee, loans at more favourable rates, which may constitute aid measures. Article 179(2) EC lays down that the EIB is to support the Community\u2019s development cooperation policy. Accordingly, the fact that the EIB\u2019s activity consists essentially in advancing repayable loans, rather than making grants, cannot preclude the classification of certain of its financing operations as develop- ment aid. In this context, it should also be noted that, under Article 2(2) of the contested deci- sion, the Council may decide, on a case by case basis, to grant the Community guar- antee for EIB financing in respect of certain countries, including countries which do not appear in Annex I to that decision. Also, in accordance with Article 2(4) of 53 54 55 56 ",
        "I - 8149 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL the contested decision, the Council may decide to suspend new EIB financing under that guarantee when certain conditions are present. It is by no means inconceivable that developing countries may be concerned by Council decisions taken pursuant to Article 2(2) or (4) of the contested decision. None the less, according to those provi- sions, such decisions are adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 181a EC, regardless of whether they relate to developing countries within the meaning of Title XX of the Treaty. The aim of the contested decision Although it is common ground that the contested decision falls within the context of financial cooperation with third countries by means of a Community financial instrument, the Parliament does not agree with the Council and the Commission as to the consequences of that finding. The Parliament contends that the contested decision, in so far as it concerns devel- oping countries, pursues the objectives of Article 177 EC, in particular the fostering of sustainable economic and social development. The Council disputes that conten- tion, without, however, indicating what aim is otherwise pursued by the decision in relation to developing countries within the meaning of Title XX of the Treaty. Contrary to the view held by the Council and the Commission, it is the content of the contested decision rather than its aim which emerges from the description in paragraph 57 above. It follows from that decision that the grant of the Community guarantee pursues objectives going beyond a measure which is directed merely inci- dentally at development cooperation. Thus, it is apparent in particular from recital 3 that the contested decision seeks to support EU external action without affecting the 57 58 59 ",
        "I - 8150 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-155/07 EIB\u2019s credit rating. Moreover, under Article 1 of that decision, the Community guar- antee is granted only where, inter alia, the financing operations in question have been decided upon \u2018in support of the relevant external policy objectives of the European Union\u2019. As the Parliament stated at the hearing, it is possible that, in the absence of such a guarantee, the EIB may be unable to undertake financing operations in the countries concerned. In view of the heightened risks connected with the grant of financing in certain third countries, the EIB\u2019s credit rating might be affected by carrying out such operations in those countries, with the result that, in order to prevent damage to its credit rating, the EIB would be deterred from going ahead with those operations or at least be obliged to impose in their respect appreciably less favourable terms for borrowers. Thus, EIB investment in third countries is fostered or made possible as a result of the Community guarantee, through its favourable effect on the EIB\u2019s credit rating. Accordingly, maintaining that credit rating is necessary in order to fulfil the fundamental objective of the contested decision, which is to contribute to the external policy of the Community. Moreover, assuming, as the Council and the Parliament have maintained, that, in respect of third countries concerned by the contested decision, the Community guar- antee produces only indirect effects, by enabling the EIB to grant finance for those countries subject to more favourable terms, this circumstance does not preclude that measure from forming part of Community policy in the development cooperation field. Furthermore, contrary to the view put forward by the Commission, the contested decision cannot be considered essentially to be an internal Community measure. Admittedly, at first, the Community guarantee produces its effects primarily within the Community, namely in the relationship between the EIB and the Community budget. None the less, as is clear from paragraph 59 above, the guarantee does not 60 61 62 ",
        "I - 8151 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL constitute the objective of the contested decision, but the means chosen in order to attain that objective, which consists of supporting the external policy of the Commu- nity by facilitating and strengthening financial cooperation with third countries, through the EIB. Community policy in the field of development cooperation forms an integral part of Community external action. Furthermore, recital 8 of the contested decision states that EIB financing operations should be consistent with and support EU external policies including specific regional objectives. Also, Article 3(2) of that decision expressly provides that cooperation is to be carried out on a regionally differentiated basis, taking into consideration the EIB\u2019s role as well as the policies of the European Union in each region. It is clear from recital 4 of the contested decision that the Community guarantee is intended to cover EIB financing operations carried out, in particular, in countries covered by the Development Cooperation Instrument and the European Neighbour- hood and Partnership Instrument. Recital 7 of the decision also mentions the Instru- ment for Stability introduced by Regulation No 1717/2006. The decision thus seeks to strengthen action undertaken, in particular, by means of those three instruments which concern, at least in part, development cooperation within the meaning of Title XX of the Treaty. That analysis finds support in recital 15 of the decision, which relates, inter alia, to possible opportunities to \u2018combine EIB financing with EU budget- ary resources as appropriate, in the form of grant support, risk capital and interest rate subsidies, alongside technical assistance for project preparation, implementa- tion or enhancement of the legal and regulatory framework\u2019. Moreover, the specific objectives cited in the preamble to the contested decision regarding the different regions concerned by the decision correspond, at least in part, to typical objectives of development cooperation. Thus, it is apparent from recital 12 of the decision, cited by the Parliament at the hearing, that in Asia and Latin America \u2014 regions in which the \u2018EIB should endeavour to progressively expand its activities across a larger number of countries \u2026 including in the less pros- perous countries\u2019 \u2014 EIB financing should focus on environmental sustainability and 63 64 65 ",
        "I - 8152 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-155/07 energy security projects, as well as the continued support of the EU\u2019s presence in those regions through foreign direct investment and the transfer of technology and know-how. Furthermore, it is apparent from recitals 13 and 14 respectively of the contested decision that the EIB should focus in Central Asia on major energy supply and energy transport projects with cross-border implications and in South Africa on infrastructure projects of public interest and private sector support, including small and medium-sized enterprises. It follows that the financial cooperation which the contested decision implements through the Community guarantee granted to the EIB also pursues, in so far as developing countries are concerned, the socio-economic objectives referred to in Article 177 EC, particularly the sustainable economic and social development of such countries. It is apparent from the foregoing that, in so far as the contested decision concerns developing countries within the meaning of Title XX of the Treaty, it falls under that title, and thus under Article 179 EC. Accordingly, that decision has two components, one of which concerns development cooperation falling under Article 179 EC, while the other concerns economic, financial and technical cooperation with third coun- tries other than developing countries, falling under Article 181a EC. The relationship between the components of the contested decision Contrary to the Parliament\u2019s contention, the finding that the contested decision has the two components set out in the paragraph above is not sufficient to conclude that it should have been adopted on a dual legal basis consisting of Articles 179 EC and 181a EC. In the light of the case-law cited in paragraphs 35 and 36 above, it 66 67 68 ",
        "I - 8153 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL is necessary to determine whether one of the components of the decision is identi- fiable as the main or predominant one, whereas the other is merely incidental, or, conversely, whether the two components are inseparably linked, without one being incidental to the other. It should, at the outset, be noted that the legal bases at issue in this case, namely Articles 179 EC and 181a EC, both concern cooperation with third countries, at the financial level among others, and that, as is apparent particularly from paragraph 55 above, the EIB\u2019s involvement in the context of financial cooperation with third countries forms an integral part of development cooperation within the meaning of Title XX of the Treaty. It should, in this case, also be noted that, although the Council and the Commis- sion contend that the contested decision has, first, a main aim and component linked almost exclusively to Article 181a EC and, second, an incidental aim and compo- nent linked to Article 179 EC, they have, however, not been able to establish how the economic, financial and technical cooperation between the Community and third countries which are developing countries is so alien to development cooper- ation within the meaning of Title XX of the Treaty that that decision, even where the cooperation which it envisages concerns developing countries, has a main or predominant aim and component unrelated to development cooperation within the meaning of Title XX. The contested decision seeks to strengthen financial cooperation both with devel- oping countries and with other third countries by means of the Community guar- antee granted to the EIB. That decision thus concerns actions of a similar nature, distinguished only in relation to the regions and countries concerned. As is clear from points 77 and 78 of the Advocate General\u2019s Opinion, it would be hazardous, 69 70 71 ",

That is particularly true in view of the evolving nature of the category of devel- oping countries within the meaning of Title XX of the Treaty and of the possibility, provided for in Article 2(2) of that decision, for the Council to decide, on a case by case basis, on the eligibility of countries which are not even mentioned in Annex I to the decision to receive EIB financing coupled with a Community guarantee. It follows from the foregoing that, from the point of view of its content and aim, the contested decision has components which are inseparably linked, falling, first, under Article 179 EC and, second, under Article 181a EC, without it being possible to identify a main or predominant aim or component. Consequently, pursuant to the case-law cited in paragraph 36 above, it is clear that the decision, in principle, had to be adopted on the basis of those two articles, unless such a combination of legal bases is not possible in accordance with the case-law cited in paragraph 37 above, which is the question which now falls to be examined. Compatibility of the procedures Invited by the Court to comment, at the hearing, on whether the procedures laid down in Articles 179 EC and 181a EC respectively are compatible, all the parties replied in the affirmative, stating that certain measures have already been adopted by the Community legislature on the dual basis of those articles. In that regard, it is necessary, however, to point out that, as is clear from the case- law cited in paragraph 34 above, it is not possible to determine the legal basis for a measure in the light of the legal basis used for the adoption of other Community measures which might, in certain cases, display similar characteristics. 72 73 74 ",
        "I - 8155 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL As stated in paragraph 37 above, recourse to a dual legal basis is not possible where the procedures laid down for each legal basis are incompatible with one another. In the present case, it should be noted that, unlike the situation that gave rise to the judgment in Titanium dioxide , the Council acts by a qualified majority both under the procedure referred to in Article 179 EC and under that laid down in Article 181a EC. Admittedly, in the context of Article 179 EC, the Parliament exercises the legisla- tive function through co-decision with the Council, while Article 181a EC \u2014 the sole legal basis used for the adoption of the contested decision \u2014 provides only for consultation of the Parliament by the Council. However, the importance of the Parliament\u2019s role in the Community legislative process should be noted. As the Court has already stated, participation by the Parlia- ment in that process is a reflection, at the Community level, of the fundamental democratic principle that the people should participate in the exercise of power through the intermediary of a representative assembly (see, to that effect, Titanium dioxide , paragraph 20 and the case-law cited, and Case C-65/93 Parliament v Council [1995] ECR I-643, paragraph 21). In that regard, in contrast to the situation in Titanium dioxide , in the circum- stances of the present case the use of a dual legal basis consisting of Articles 179 EC and 181a EC would not encroach upon the Parliament\u2019s rights (see, to that effect, Case C-94/03 Commission v Council , paragraph 54, and Commission v Parliament and Council , paragraph 59). The use of Article 179 EC involves greater participation by the Parliament since it provides for the adoption of the measure by the \u2018co-deci- 75 76 77 78 79 ",
        "I - 8156 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-155/07 sion\u2019 procedure. Moreover, it was not stated before the Court that such a dual legal basis would not be possible, from the point of view of legislative technique. Furthermore, a number of factors support the conclusion that the concurrent use of Articles 179 EC and 181a EC would have been both possible and appropriate in rela- tion to the contested decision. Firstly, as is clear from paragraphs 69 to 72 above, the components of the contested decision concerning, first, developing countries and, second, other third countries are inseparably linked. In the light of the evolving nature of the category of devel- oping countries within the meaning of Title XX of the Treaty and the requirements of legal certainty, it would hardly be possible, in practice, to favour the parallel adop- tion of two measures, one concerning developing countries and based exclusively on Article 179 EC, and the other concerning third countries which are not developing countries and based exclusively on Article 181a EC. Secondly, as is also clear from those paragraphs of this judgment, it is not possible to contend that one of those components is incidental to the other. In those circumstances, a solution which, in the light of the differences between the \u2018co-decision\u2019 and \u2018consultation\u2019 procedures laid down in Articles 179 EC and 181a EC respectively, favoured Article 179 EC as the sole legal basis, since it involves greater participation by the Parliament, would result in economic, financial and technical cooperation with third countries which are not developing countries not being expressly covered by the chosen legal basis. In such a situation, the legisla- tive role of the Council would, in any event, be affected in the same way as by the use of a dual legal basis consisting of Articles 179 EC and 181a EC. In addition, in the same way that, as is apparent from paragraph 47 above, Article 181a EC is not intended to constitute the legal basis of measures pursuing the objectives, referred to in Article 177 EC, concerning development cooperation within the meaning of Title XX of the Treaty, Article 179 EC equally cannot, in principle, be the basis for cooperation measures which do not pursue such objectives. 80 81 82 ",
        "I - 8157 PARLIAMENT v COUNCIL It follows that, in the specific circumstances of this case, characterised, inter alia, by the complementary relationship which exists between Titles XX and XXI of the Treaty and by the quasi-interdependence of Articles 179 EC and 181a EC, the pro - cedures respectively laid down in those two articles cannot be classed as incompatible. Consequently, it must be held that the contested decision should have been founded, exceptionally, on the dual legal basis of Articles 179 EC and 181a EC. Having regard to all the foregoing, it is thus necessary to annul the contested deci- sion since it is based on Article 181a EC alone. Request for the effects of the contested decision to be maintained The Parliament, supported in this respect by the Council and the Commission, requests the Court, in the event that it annuls the contested decision, to order that the effects of the decision be maintained until a new decision is adopted. Under the second paragraph of Article 231 EC, the Court may, if it considers this necessary, state which of the effects of a regulation which it has declared void are to be considered definitive. That provision is also capable of being applied, by analogy, to a decision where there are important grounds of legal certainty, comparable to those which arise in the case of annulment of certain regulations, justifying exercise by the Court of the power conferred on it, in this context, by the second paragraph 83 84 85 86 87 ",
        "I - 8158 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-155/07 of Article 231 EC (see to that effect, inter alia, Case C-271/94 Parliament v Council [1996] ECR I-1689, paragraph 40; Case C-106/96 United Kingdom v Commission [1998] ECR I-2729, paragraph 41; and Case C-22/96 Parliament v Council [1998] ECR I-3231, paragraphs 41 and 42). In accordance with Article 10 thereof, the contested decision entered into force on the third day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union , which occurred on 30 December 2006. It is common ground that annulling that deci- sion without maintaining its effects would be liable to have adverse consequences for the EIB\u2019s credit rating and would lead to damaging uncertainties for current and future EIB financing operations. Accordingly, there are important grounds of legal certainty justifying the grant by the Court of the parties\u2019 request for the effects of the contested decision to be main- tained. It is thus appropriate to suspend the effects of the annulment of that decision pending the entry into force, within a reasonable period, of a new decision. In that regard, a period of 12 months from the date of delivery of this judgment may be considered to be reasonable. Costs Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party\u2019s pleadings. Since the Parliament has applied for costs and the Council has been unsuccessful, the Council must be ordered to pay the costs. The Commission, which intervened in support of the form of order sought by the Council, must be ordered, in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 69(4) of the Rules of Procedure, to bear its own costs. 88 89 90 ",

In the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance summarised the facts of the action before it as follows: \u20187 Following the transfer of the capital of Nigeria from Lagos to Abuja, the Commission has, since 1993, rented a building in Abuja to house its delega- tion as well as, temporarily, the repre- sentations of a number of Member States, including the Hellenic Republic. Under an arrangement with those Member States (hereinafter the \u201cAbuja I project\u201d), the Commission was sub- letting a number of offices and provided a number of services to the representa- tions in question. The Member States reached an agreement on the sharing of the costs relating to their representa- tions. The contribution of the Hellenic Republic amounted to 5.5% of the total costs. Having decided that the Hellenic Republic had not paid its debts in that regard, the Commission, in 2004, proceeded to recovery by offsetting of the corresponding sums (see para- graph 44 below). 8 On 18 April 1994, the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, Ireland, the Italian Republic, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Portuguese Republic and the Commission (hereinafter \u201cthe partners\u201d), on the basis of Article J.6 of the Treaty on European Union (now, after amendment, Article 20 EU), concluded a Memorandum of Under- standing (hereinafter \u201cthe initial memo- randum\u201d) concerning the construction, for their diplomatic missions in Abuja, of a joint complex of embassies using joint support services (hereinafter \u201cthe Abuja II project\u201d). The initial memorandum was supplemented, following the acces- sion of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden, by an accession protocol. 9 Article 1 of the initial memorandum stipulates that the embassies of the participating Member States and the delegation of the Commission are to be distinct diplomatic missions which are subject to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961, and, with regard to the Member States, also subject to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 24 April 1963. 10 Article 10 of the initial memorandum stated that the Commission would act, as coordinator of the Abuja II project, \u201con behalf of\u201d the other partners. 11 Under Article 11 of the initial memo- randum, the Commission is authorised to undertake architectural feasibility studies for the Abuja II project, as well as initial costings and design developments. That article also provides for the conclu- sion of an additional Memorandum ",

Finally, Article 11 provides for the setting-up of a permanent Steering Committee, comprising representatives of all the partners and chaired by the Commis- sion, to coordinate and control the Abuja II project. The permanent Steering Committee is to give regular reports to the Working Party on Administrative Affairs, established in the Council in the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) (hereinafter the \u201cCFSP Working Party on Administrative Affairs\u201d). 12 Article 12 of the initial memorandum reads as follows: \u201cThe [Abuja II] project will be directly financed, upon approval of the [add - itional memorandum] referred to in Article 11, by contributions from partici- pating partners, reflecting the share of the project allocated to each partner. The contribution by the Commission will be paid from the appropriate budget line. The costs of preparation of the project (phase 1) will be paid by the Commis- sion from its administrative appro- priations. These costs are estimated at ECU 140 000. If the [Abuja II] project is carried out, these costs will be reimbursed by contributions from all participating partners reflecting their individual share of the project.\u201d 13 Article 13 of the initial memorandum states: \u201cAll participating partners guarantee, upon approval of the [additional memo- randum], the payment of their total costs. The total costs for each partner will consist of: (a) the full costs for each partner\u2019s indi- vidual part of the project, (b) each partner\u2019s share of the costs for the common and public areas, calcu- lated in the same proportion as its share of the sum of individual areas.\u201d 14 Article 14 of the initial memorandum provides that the Commission, with the agreement and participation of the partner Member States, will make all payments to third parties (contractors).

Under Article 1 of that contract, the Commis- sion confirms the intention of the partici- pating partners to conclude a \u201ccontract\u201d with the consultants. Under Article 2, the consultants undertake to begin design work for the project in question. The cost of that design work amounted to EUR 212 547.59. 17 At meetings between representa- tives of the responsible services of the foreign ministries of the Member States concerned and the architects, Dissing & Weitling arkitektfirma, the real needs of the representation of each Member State and their respective share of the expend- iture were determined. 18 On 26 October 1995, the \u201cBuildings\u201d sub- working party, established in the frame- work of the CFSP, met. According to the minute of the meeting, the sub-working party requested that the Commission: \u201c\u2026 \u2014 finish work on the [outline design] phase; \u2014 make the necessary arrangements with the firm of architects for elaboration of the [scheme design phase] within the time-limits laid down by the [permanent Steering Committee]; \u2014 conclude the contracts [relating to the soil survey and investiga- tion of the construction site], that latter [contract] being essential to the drafting of the additional memorandum; \u2014 and advance the funding linked to these steps.\u201d ",
        "I - 8171 GREECE v COMMISSION 19 The sub-working party confirmed that \u201cthe sums paid by the Commission [would be] considered to be an advance on its share of the ad hoc autonomous fund, which has been agreed beforehand as the appropriate method of financing the [Abuja II] project\u201d and that \u201c[i]n the case of a failure to execute the project, the other partners shall reimburse the Commission under the procedures agreed for previous phases\u201d. 20 On 24 November 1995, the permanent Steering Committee (see paragraph 11 above) met. The minute of that meeting states that a \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d contract with the consultants, for a value of EUR 2 676 369 (hereinafter the \u201cprin- cipal contract\u201d) had been submitted for approval to the Commission\u2019s Advis- ory Committee on Procurements and Contracts (ACPC). It also stated that \u201cin the case of a failure to execute the project, the other partners shall reim- burse the Commission\u201d. 21 On 27 December 1995, the Commis- sion concluded the principal contract. That contract concerned the outline and scheme design phases of the Abuja II project (Articles 4.4 and 4.5), as well as possible detailed design (Article 4.6). 22 On 19 September 1996, the CFSP Working Party on Administrative Affairs approved the scheme design. 23 On 21 November 1996, the CFSP Working Party on Administrative Affairs asked the Commission to make ad hoc arrangements in order to allow the architects to start work on the detailed design. The Working Party indicated that the formal contract for that phase would be concluded after the additional memorandum had been finalised. At that meeting, the Commission informed the Working Party of the amount that it had advanced until 15 November 1996 for the preparation of the Abuja II project, namely approximately EUR 2.8 million. 24 On 24 February 1997, the CFSP Working Party on Administrative Affairs met again and decided not to wait for the additional memorandum to be finalised before proceeding to the drawing-up of the detailed design and contractual documents. The minute of that meeting contains the following resolutions: \u201cThe Commission [is invited] to make the necessary arrangements with the architects for the elaboration of these documents and to advance the funds needed for these tasks according [to] modalities agreed for the project. Like on previous occasions, such advance payments by the Commission will later be reimbursed by other participants according to the procedures foreseen to this end in [the initial memorandum].\u201d ",
        "I - 8172 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-203/07 P 25 In the months that followed, several Member States withdrew from the Abuja II project. On 28 April 1997, the CFSP Working Party on Administrative Affairs asked the Commission to \u201carrange bilat- erally for the reimbursement of the Danish share of project-related costs incurred by the Commission on behalf of participating partners\u201d. A similar deci- sion was taken following the withdrawal of Ireland in September 1997, and the withdrawals of the Portuguese Republic, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden. 26 On 12 November 1997, the Commis- sion concluded with the architects an addendum to the principal contract, the object of which was the drawing-up of detailed plans and the reimburse- ment of travel expenses, for a value of EUR 1 895 696. 27 On 18 June 1998, the CFSP Working Party on Administrative Affairs mentioned the possibility of a with- drawal of the Kingdom of Belgium from the Abuja II project. It is clear from the minute of that meeting that the per - manent Steering Committee pointed out that the Kingdom of Belgium would pay its share of the costs as agreed after the approval of the scheme design. 28 On 10 June 1998, a payment order for EUR 153 367.70, corresponding to the share of the Hellenic Republic in the initial phase of the project, namely 5.06% of the total costs, was sent by the Commission to the Hellenic Republic. The deadline for payment was 31 December 1998. 29 On 9 December 1998, the additional memorandum was signed by the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria and the Commission. Article 11 of the add - itional memorandum provides for the creation of a special fund to finance the project. 30 Under Article 14 thereof, the additional memorandum was to be provisionally applied from the first day of the second month after its signature and enter into force on the first day of the second month following the date on which the Member States and the Commission declared that it had been ratified. 31 On 28 April 1999, the Commission issued a call for tender for the construc- tion of the embassies of the Member States concerned and of the Commission ",
        "I - 8173 GREECE v COMMISSION delegation (OJ, S 82/1999). It was stated therein that the embassy of the Hellenic Republic was to have an area of 677 m 2 . 32 On 3 September 1999, the Commission \u201creiterated\u201d its request of 1998 in the CFSP Working Party on Administrative Affairs that the Member States reim- burse it for the sums paid to consult- ants for the scheme design phase. The Commission stated that some Member States had already paid the amounts due, but that others, including the Hellenic Republic, had not reimbursed it before the due date of 31 December 1998. The Commission added that a further invoice would be sent to all partners concerning, first, the costs of the detailed design (phase) and, second, the costs caused by the redesign of the complex after the withdrawal of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Spain and the Portu- guese Republic. 33 On 20 September 1999, the permanent Steering Committee met to finalise the pre-qualification of construction com - panies. The representative of the Hellenic Republic signed the minute of the meeting. A call for tender was published in the Official Journal S 54/2000 of 17 March 2000. 34 By payment order of 17 February 2000, the Commission requested payment from the Hellenic Republic of EUR 168 716.94 for the drawing-up of the call for tender for the detailed design. 35 On 22 June 2000, the permanent Steering Committee decided to adopt a new project approach (hereinafter \u201cAbuja Light\u201d), which was made neces- sary by the withdrawal of the French Republic. The Abuja Light project provided in particular for the omission of common buildings and common tech- nical installations, and a reduction of the construction area. The representative of the Hellenic Republic at that meeting indicated his agreement with the project, subject nonetheless to the approval of his superiors. On 29 June 2000, the Commission sent the minute of the meeting of 22 June 2000 to the Hellenic Republic and asked it for an official reply regarding the Abuja Light project. 36 On 5 September 2000, the Commission reiterated its request to the representa- tives of the Hellenic Republic. After another reminder dated 14 September 2000, the Commission sent a letter on 25 September 2000 to the Hellenic Republic by fax, giving a deadline for response of 30 September 2000 and stating that a failure to respond would be understood as a withdrawal from the project. On 2 October 2000, the Greek authorities informed the Commission that they were unable to give a formal answer regarding the Abuja Light ",

Consequently the Commission responded, on the same day, that it had asked the architects to proceed with the redesign of the Abuja II project without including the Hellenic Republic. 37 By letter of 28 January 2002, the Commission sent a debit note for EUR 1 276 484.50 to the Hellenic Republic for the construction costs of the Abuja II project. The Commission subsequently cancelled this debit note. 38 After setting up its own embassy in Abuja, the Hellenic Republic vacated the temporary buildings it was occupying as a partner of the Abuja I project on 13 July 2002. 39 By letter of 11 October 2002, the Commission formally notified the Hellenic Republic of the outstanding debit notes regarding the Abuja I and Abuja II projects and requested that it pay a total amount of EUR 861 813.87 and USD 11 000. 40 Following negotiations between the parties, the Commission reminded the Hellenic Republic, by letter of 31 January 2003, that the latter had not paid its debts relating to the Abuja I and Abuja II projects and requested that it pay a total amount of EUR 516 374.96 and USD 12 684.89 by the end of February 2003. The Commission added that, in the case of failure to pay by that deadline, it would enforce recovery of the amounts in question by all means available under the law. 41 During the months that followed, the Hellenic Republic and the Commission discussed the amounts of the sums due. 42 On 29 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic sent its Permanent Repre- sentative to the European Union a letter worded as follows: \u201cGiven that the European Commission maintains its position regarding our country\u2019s debt for the Abuja II project by applying the offsetting procedure, we ask you to monitor that procedure and to inform us whether, and to what extent, it has been used, so that the Hellenic Republic can examine the possibility of taking action against the European Commission. As regards the Abuja I project, we would note that we have admitted our debt up ",
        "I - 8175 GREECE v COMMISSION to May 2002, while the amount claimed by the Commission covers the period up to July 2002 and after. Given that we have the intention to pay the aforemen- tioned debt, we ask you to make contact with the competent financial services of the Commission in order to verify the elements of the exact total amount of our debt in euro up to May 2002.\u201d 43 On 16 February 2004, the Commission sent a letter to the Hellenic Republic identifying the latter\u2019s outstanding debts for the Abuja I and Abuja II projects. It is apparent from the table attached to that letter, which mentions in par - ticular 11 unpaid debit notes for the Abuja I and Abuja II projects, that the Commission was requesting payment of EUR 565 656.80 from the Hellenic Republic. In that letter, the Commission stated: \u201cThe Hellenic Republic forwarded the following claim for payment to the Commission: 2000GR161PO005OBJ 1 MAINLAND GREECE \u2014 Interim payment \u2014 EUR 4 774 562.67. Under the payment conditions laid down in [the second subparagraph of Article 73(1) of the Financial Regula- tion], the Commission shall proceed to the offsetting of the debts and amounts receivable, taking interest for late payment into account, where necessary. Where the claims that you have commu- nicated are greater than the amounts offset, the net amount to which you are entitled will be transferred to you as soon as possible\u2026\u201d 44 On 10 March 2004, the Commis- sion transferred funds to the Hellenic Republic under the Regional Oper- ational Programme for mainland Greece. However, instead of paying an amount of EUR 4 774 562.67 (see paragraph 43 above), the Commission only transferred EUR 3 121 243.03. It thus proceeded to recovery by offsetting the amount not yet paid by the Hellenic Republic, of which EUR 565 656.80 concerned the Abuja I and Abuja II projects (hereinafter \u201cthe contested act\u201d).\u2019 III \u2014 Proceedings before the Court of First Instance and the judgment under appeal 12. The Hellenic Republic brought an action against the act of offsetting before the Court ",
        "I - 8176 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-203/07 P of Justice, which was later referred to the Court of First Instance and registered as Case T-231/04. In the proceedings before the Court of First Instance, the Hellenic Republic relied on a single plea in law, alleging infringement of the initial and additional memoranda of understanding and of the provisions of the Financial Regulation and Regulation No 2342/2002. 13. By the first part of the plea, the Hellenic Republic alleged infringement of the initial and the additional memoranda. 14. At the outset the Court of First Instance dealt with the question whether it had juris- diction to hear the application given that one of the sums which was set off came within the scope of Title V of the EU Treaty, in respect of which the Court has no jurisdic- tion because such competence is not spe - cified in Article 46 EU. However, since the Commission had proceeded to recover the disputed amounts by means of an act pursuant to the Financial Regulation and Regulation No 2342/2002, the Court of First Instance concluded that the act of offset- ting was covered by Community law and in consequence was open to challenge under Article 230 EC. The Court of First Instance therefore considered that it had jurisdiction to hear the application. 15. The Court of First Instance then went on to examine the financial liability of the Hellenic Republic for the Abuja I and Abuja II projects. 16. With regard to the Abuja I project, the Hellenic Republic had acknowledged that it was liable for rent and operating costs, but disputed its liability for the total amount of EUR 72 714.47, for which the Commis- sion was holding it liable. The Court of First Instance held that the Hellenic Republic had failed to show that the Commission had made an error regarding the amount payable. Moreover, the Hellenic Republic had not contested the numerous debit notes it had received and had not explained why it was not liable for the difference between the debt it acknowledged and the amount requested by the Commission. Thus the argument by which the Hellenic Republic denied its liability for the debts relating to the Abuja I project could not be accepted. 17. As to the Abuja II project, the Court of First Instance pointed out that for more than six years \u2014 from 18 April 1994 until 30 September 2000 \u2014 the Hellenic Republic, by its conduct, consistently gave the other partners to understand that it was continuing to participate in the Abuja II project. After the signature of the additional memorandum in December 1998, it took part in that project for almost another two years. 18. The Court of First Instance inferred from those facts that an assessment of the Hellenic Republic\u2019s obligations could not be based solely on the initial and the additional memo- randa, but had also to take into account the expectations which that Member State\u2019s conduct had led its partners to entertain. ",
        "I - 8177 GREECE v COMMISSION 19. In that connection the Court of First Instance stated that the principle of good faith is a rule of customary international law, which is binding on the Community and on the other participating partners and that it is the \u2018corollary in public international law of the principle of protection of legitimate expectations\u2019. 20. The Court of First Instance then noted that, since the Hellenic Republic had signed the initial memorandum, which it also rati- fied, it was one of the partners participating in the Abuja II project and as such owed certain enhanced obligations of cooperation and solidarity towards the other participants. 21. The Court of First Instance observed that the initial memorandum concerned the preliminary phases of the Abuja II project and that, once that phase had been completed, the partners had decided, before signing the additional memorandum, to carry on with the project and to bear the costs concerning the detailed design of the building. Indeed, at a meeting on 24 February 1997, which was attended by two representa- tives of the Hellenic Republic, the partners authorised the Commission to make the necessary arrangements with the architects to draw up detailed plans without awaiting the additional memorandum. The Court of First Instance found that, in so doing, the partners went further than the preliminary phases, thereby necessarily concluding an implied agreement to carry out the project. Since the partners decided at the meeting of 24 February 1997 to carry out the project, they were no longer free \u2014 in the view of the Court of First Instance \u2014 to withdraw from it without reimbursing their share of the preliminary and subsequent expenditure. 22. The Court of First Instance went on to observe that although certain Member States subsequently withdrew from the project the Hellenic Republic did not conduct itself in such a way as to give rise to doubts as to its participation and on 9 December 1998 the Hellenic Republic signed the additional memorandum, together with the other part- ners which had not withdrawn from the project. The Court of First Instance took note of the fact that it was not until the summer of 2000 that the Hellenic Republic, for the first time, showed reticence with regard to its continued participation. 23. According to the Court of First Instance, it is common ground that the Hellenic Republic was entitled to withdraw from the project but, in view of the evolution of the undertakings given after the initial phase, and notwithstanding the non-ratification of the additional memorandum, the Hellenic Republic could not withdraw without being held liable for the expenditure linked to its participation in the Abuja II project. 24. Moreover, the Court of First Instance held that the Hellenic Republic\u2019s financial obligations also arose from the terms of the initial memorandum, specifically from Article 15(1) thereof. Under that provision, a State can escape the financial obligations relating to the project by not signing the add - itional memorandum. However, the Court of First Instance suggested that, where a State has signed the additional memorandum (as in the case of the Hellenic Republic), the reverse is equally true. ",
        "I - 8178 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-203/07 P 25. As to the argument that the ratification of the additional memorandum is a necessary condition for its entry into force, the Court of First Instance held that, in accordance with Article 14 of the additional memorandum, the latter applied provisionally to the Hellenic Republic from 1 February 1999 until October 2000. For the Court of First Instance this implied that the Hellenic Republic could not disregard that provisional application by pleading that it had not ratified the add - itional memorandum. 26. Lastly, in relation to the Hellenic Repub- lic\u2019s argument that the increase in the cost of the project could be regarded as a \u2018fundamental change of circumstances\u2019 that would relieve it of its financial obligations, the Court of First Instance held that in the case of a building construction project the increase in the cost of the project cannot be considered a \u2018fundamental change of circum- stances\u2019. Furthermore the Hellenic Republic had accepted the increase in the cost of the project, which was known since the begin- ning of the Abuja II project, and had not raised any objections when its share of the project had grown following the withdrawal of several Member States between 1997 and 1999. 27. For all those reasons the Court of First Instance held that the Hellenic Republic had to be held liable for all the costs relating to its participation in the Abuja II project. 28. The Court of First Instance there- fore rejected the first part of the plea as unfounded. 29. By the second part of the single plea, the Hellenic Republic alleged infringement of the Financial Regulation and Regulation No 2342/2002. 30. As to the submission by the Hellenic Republic that manifest uncertainty surrounded the amount of, and justification for, the sums claimed in respect of both the Abuja I and the Abuja II projects, the Court of First Instance emphasised that offsetting under Article 73(1) of the Financial Regula- tion is not precluded where one of the debts is disputed or where there are negotiations between the Commission and the debtor regarding those debts, since otherwise the debtor could indefinitely delay the recovery of a debt. 31. The Court of First Instance considered that, even if there may have been uncer- tainty regarding the amounts receivable in 2002, the Commission came to a definite conclusion, following exchanges between the parties and a fresh examination of the case- file, as regards the amounts due in 2004 when it proceeded to recovery. ",
        "I - 8179 GREECE v COMMISSION 32. Furthermore, the Court of First Instance stated that the Hellenic Republic had not produced any evidence to show that the Commission had failed to follow the pro - cedure laid down in the regulations in ques- tion or that the Commission was not justified in concluding that the amount receivable was \u2018certain, of a fixed amount and due\u2019. There- fore the conditions laid down for recovery by offsetting were fulfilled at the time of the contested act. 33. Lastly, the Court of First Instance rejected the submission by the Hellenic Republic that the Commission was not authorised to proceed to recovery by offset- ting because the amounts in issue were receivable by the partners, not by the Community, and the offsetting did not there- fore pursue the protection of the Commu- nities\u2019 financial interests, which is the ob- jective of the abovementioned regulations. The Court of First Instance considered, on the contrary, that the amounts in issue were receivable by the Community because the Commission was acting as the agent of the partners participating in the Abuja I and II projects. 34. The Court of First Instance therefore rejected the second part of the single plea as unfounded. IV \u2014 Forms of order sought before the Court of Justice 35. The Hellenic Republic claims that the Court should: \u2014 allow the present appeal; \u2014 set aside the judgment of the Court of First Instance in so far as it is contested; \u2014 grant the application in accordance with the form of order sought; \u2014 order the Commission to pay the costs. 36. The Commission contends that the Court should: \u2014 declare the appeal inadmissible; \u2014 in the alternative, declare the appeal manifestly unfounded and dismiss the appeal in its entirety; \u2014 in any event, order the appellant to pay the costs.

        "I - 8180 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-203/07 P V \u2014 The appeal A \u2014 Grounds of appeal 1. First ground of appeal 37. The Hellenic Republic submits that the Court of First Instance misinterpreted Art - icles 12, 13 and 15 of the initial memorandum of understanding, Article 14 of the add - itional memorandum and the principles of good faith and of the protection of legitimate expectations. 38. The Hellenic Republic submits that the Court of First Instance erred in holding that the obligations of the Member States in connection with the Abuja II project were determined by the conduct of each Member State, rather than being of a purely contractual nature determined by the provi- sions of those two memoranda. On a proper construction of Articles 12, 13 and 15 of the initial memorandum of understanding and Article 14 of the additional memorandum, however, it has to be accepted that financial obligations had not arisen for the Hellenic Republic since it had merely signed the add - itional memorandum and had not ratified it. Accordingly, the Hellenic Republic had not approved that memorandum and, in conse- quence, the conditions for incurring financial obligations had not been met in the case of that Member State. 39. The Hellenic Republic submits that the principle of good faith is relevant only for the purposes of determining whether a Member State was taking part in the Abuja II project, not for determining the obligations resulting from such participation. Those obligations must be determined exclusively on the basis of the contractual provisions, the conduct of the Member State being of no relevance in that regard. 40. In that connection, the Hellenic Republic maintains that the Court of First Instance misconstrued Article 13 of the initial memo- randum which, \u2018upon approval of the [add - itional memorandum]\u2019, requires \u2018the payment of their total costs\u2019 by the Member States concerned. The mere provisional application of the additional memorandum is not suffi- cient to give rise to the financial obligations laid down in Articles 12 and 13 of the initial memorandum, which require the approval of the additional memorandum. 41. The Court of First Instance also misin- terpreted Article 14 of the additional memo- randum which made it clear that it was necessary for the additional memorandum to be approved by ratification in order for it to enter into force and thus for financial obligations to arise for participating Member States. ",
        "I - 8181 GREECE v COMMISSION 2. Second ground of appeal 42. The Hellenic Republic submits that the Court of First Instance misinterpreted Article 15 of the initial memorandum of understanding in holding that, prior to signature of the additional memorandum, an agreement to implement the project was implicitly concluded by the part- ners on 24 February 1997 and that in this way Article 15(1) was set aside or at least amended. B \u2014 Admissibility 1. First plea of inadmissibility 43. The Commission contends that the appeal is inadmissible on the ground that it is founded on the interpretation of memoranda of understanding which do not form part of Community law. Thus the appeal is not based on any of the grounds listed in Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice as consti- tuting a possible basis for an appeal. 44. Article 58 of that Statute provides that an appeal to the Court of Justice is to be limited to points of law. That provision is understood as confining the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Justice to a review of the legality of the decision of the Court of First Instance. 45. In the present case, a difficulty arises from the fact that, as the Court of First Instance expressed it, \u2018the relations between the Commission and the Member States resulting from their cooperation in the design, planning and execution of the Abuja I and Abuja II projects come within the scope of Title V of the EU Treaty\u2019. 6 However, as the Court of First Instance rightly noted \u2018under the EU Treaty, in the version arising from the Treaty of Amsterdam, the powers of the Court of Justice are exhaustively listed in Article 46 EU. That article makes no provi- sion for any jurisdiction of the Court in respect of the provisions of Title V of the EU Treaty.\u2019 7 Thus, the memoranda of under- standing do not as such fall within the juris- diction of the Court. 46. Nevertheless, with regard to the dispute before it, the Court of First Instance held that \u2018it is not disputed that the Commission proceeded to recover the disputed amounts by means of an act adopted pursuant to the Financial Regulation and Regulation No 2342/2002, so that the act of offsetting is covered by Community law\u2019. 8 6 \u2014 Paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal. 7 \u2014 Paragraph 73 of the judgment under appeal. 8 \u2014 Paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal. ",
        "I - 8182 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-203/07 P 47. The Court of First Instance further held that \u2018it is apparent from the scope of the Financial Regulation, and in particu- lar Article 1 thereof, that the procedure of recovery by offsetting laid down in Article 73(1) thereof applies only to sums falling under the Community budget. It is not disputed that the Commission was author- ised, under Article 268 EC, which provides for both Community expenditure and certain expenditure occasioned for the institutions by the provisions of the Treaty on European Union relating to the common foreign and security policy, to assign to the Community budget the costs incurred in respect of the Abuja I and Abuja II projects.\u2019 9 48. In my view, the Court of First Instance has drawn the correct logical inferences from Article 268 EC, which provides that not only Community expenditure, but also certain expenditure occasioned for the insti- tutions by the provisions of the Treaty on European Union relating to the common foreign and security policy, is to be assigned to the Community budget. That provision is mirrored by Article 28(2) EU. Those provi- sions have had the effect of assimilating to a large extent the budgetary treatment of such expenditure with that of the expenditure incurred under the EC Treaty. 10 It follows that Article 73(1) of the Financial Regulation, 9 \u2014 Paragraph 111 of the judgment under appeal. As far as it is relevant for the present case, Article 268 EC states: \u2018Admin- istrative expenditure occasioned for the institutions by the provisions of the Treaty on European Union relating to common foreign and security policy and to cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs shall be charged to the budget. The operational expenditure occasioned by the implementation of the said provisions may, under the condi- tions referred to therein, be charged to the budget.\u2019 10 \u2014 See Philippe L\u00e9ger, Commentaire article par article des trait\u00e9s UE et CE, 2000, p. 1806. which provides for the offsetting of debts to the Community against any debtor who in turn has a claim on the Community, is equally applicable to expenditure which has been occasioned for the institutions by the provisions of the Treaty on European Union relating to the common foreign and security policy and which has been assigned to the Community budget as it is to Community expenditure. 49. As an act of Community law, the act of offsetting is subject to review by the Commu- nity judicature under Article 230 EC. Such review, if it is to be effective and comprehen- sive, will often 11 require verification of the existence of the debts being set off. In the present case, the Court of First Instance had to construe both the initial and the additional memoranda, in so far as their interpretation was necessary in order to ensure comprehen- sive judicial review of the legality of the act of offsetting. 50. In my view, as a logical consequence of the fact that the Court of First Instance was entitled to make legal findings as regards the two memoranda of understanding and proceeded to do so, it is quite legitimate that, at the level of an appeal before the Court of Justice, a ground of appeal can concern the interpretation given to those 11 \u2014 This would for example not be the case where the act of offsetting was challenged merely on procedural grounds. ",
        "I - 8183 GREECE v COMMISSION two memoranda. However, while such a ground of appeal concerns a question of law which must be addressed in the present case in order to verify the legality of an act of Community law (the act of offsetting), that ground of appeal is not, in fact, based on an alleged misinterpretation of Community law. Since the grounds of appeal relied on by the appellant are not among those speci- fied in Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, it must be determined whether the Court of Justice may nevertheless decide on grounds of appeal based on such questions of law. 51. In that connection, it should first be pointed out that, in the context of proceed- ings other than appeals, the Court of Justice has frequently been called upon to construe provisions of public international law. 12 52. Secondly, it must be recalled that the purpose of the appeals procedure is to provide a system of two-tier legal protection which enhances the legitimacy of judicial decisions. 13 12 \u2014 See, for a recent example, in an infringement proceeding, C-459/03 Commission v Ireland [2006] ECR I-4635, and, in a preliminary reference, C-431/05 Merck Gen\u00e9ricos [2007] ECR I-7001. 13 \u2014 See D. Waelbroeck, \u2018Le transfert des recours directs au Tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance des Communaut\u00e9s europ\u00e9ennes \u2014 vers une meilleure protection des justicia- bles?\u2019, La r\u00e9forme du syst\u00e8me juridictionnel communautaire , \u00c9ditions de l\u2019universit\u00e9 de Bruxelles, 1994, at pp. 87 to 97. 53. Lastly, it cannot be ruled out that a restrictive reading of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice would have effects for other types of appeal, where questions of law are involved which do not, strictly speaking, concern the interpretation of Community law. This is the case of appeals against judg- ments made by the Court of First Instance pursuant to Article 238 EC. In such proceed- ings, the Court of First Instance is likely to make findings based mainly, if not exclu- sively, on the national law applicable to the contract containing the arbitration clause. If the Commission\u2019s plea based on Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice were to be upheld in the present case in relation to find- ings concerning Title V of the EU Treaty, this might in my view also preclude an appellant of a judgment of the Court of First Instance pursuant to Article 238 EC from successfully invoking errors of law concerning findings made by the Court of First Instance under a given national law. To my mind, that is diffi- cult to reconcile with the desire to provide a system of two-tier legal protection. 54. I am therefore of the view that the grounds of law relating to the interpretation of the memoranda of understanding must be regarded as falling within the ambit of the questions of law that are amenable to review by the Court in the context of this appeal. 55. The first plea of inadmissibility should therefore be rejected. ",
        "I - 8184 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-203/07 P 2. Second plea of inadmissibility 56. The Commission contends that the appeal is inadmissible because the grounds of appeal are ineffective. In the Commission\u2019s view, the judgment under appeal would remain valid even in the unlikely event that the two grounds of appeal were regarded as admissible and well founded. More precisely, the Commission maintains that the appel- lant does not question the finding in para- graph 100 of the judgment under appeal to the effect that only the parties which withdrew from the project without signing the additional memorandum are liberated from their financial obligations, by contrast with those parties which signed the add - itional memorandum without ratifying it. Nor, according to the Commission, does the appellant dispute the finding at para- graph 101 of the judgment under appeal that the Hellenic Republic also incurs financial liability as a result of the provisional applica- tion of the additional memorandum. 57. Although the Hellenic Republic may not have specifically attacked the findings in paragraphs 100 and 101, it follows clearly from its argument concerning the first ground of appeal and the parts of the judg- ment under appeal to which it refers that the Hellenic Republic disagrees fundamentally with the Court of First Instance\u2019s findings in those paragraphs. First, it disputes the legal finding that, according to Article 15(1) of the initial memorandum, the signature of the additional memorandum of understanding entails financial obligations for the Hellenic Republic that differ from those of parties which have not signed the additional memo- randum. Second, in so far as the Hellenic Republic rejects the possibility that financial obligations arose before the ratification of the additional memorandum, and expli - citly argues that the Court of First Instance misconstrued Article 14 of the additional memorandum which provides for the provi- sional application of that memorandum, it is necessarily disputing that the provisional application of the additional memorandum to its signatories could have the effect of imposing financial obligations on the signa- tories of the additional memorandum who failed to ratify the latter. Clearly, therefore, the first ground of appeal also covers the findings of the Court of First Instance set out in paragraphs 100 and 101 of the judgment under appeal. In consequence, if the Court were to declare the first ground of appeal well founded, it would by implication be declaring that the findings made by the Court of First Instance in paragraphs 100 and 101 of the judgment under appeal are invalid. 58. This plea of inadmissibility must there- fore be rejected. C \u2014 Substance 1. First ground of appeal 59. The key issue in the present case is whether the Court of First Instance has ",
        "I - 8185 GREECE v COMMISSION erred in finding that the Hellenic Republic had a financial debt towards the Community budget deriving from financial obligations incurred by virtue of its planned participa- tion in the Abuja II project. 60. In the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance assessed the exist- ence of financial obligations in the light of the wording of the initial and the additional memoranda, as well as in the light of the principle of good faith and protection of legitimate expectations. In addition, in para- graphs 100 and 101 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance found that a financial obligation had arisen on the basis of Article 15(1) of the initial memorandum (given that the Hellenic Republic had signed the additional memorandum), and from the fact that, under Article 14 of the additional memorandum, the latter was to apply provi- sionally with effect from the first day of the second month after its signature. 61. The Hellenic Republic submits that the determination of a financial obligation should be based exclusively on the terms of the contractual provisions and that the conduct of the Hellenic Republic may not be taken into account for the purposes of deter- mining the existence of any financial obliga- tions. In substance, the Hellenic Republic takes the view that the contractual clauses alone are relevant and that no financial obli- gation could arise before it had expressed its consent to be bound by the additional memorandum, that is to say, before it had ratified that memorandum. 62. At the outset it may be recalled, as I mentioned earlier with regard to the admissibility of the present application, that the two memoranda at issue were adopted under Title V of the Treaty on the European Union concerning the common foreign and security policy, commonly referred to as \u2018the second pillar\u2019 of the European Union. The provisions of that Title give rise to rights and obligations governed by international law. 14 This implies that, legally speaking, the memoranda are international agreements, 15 which, as is stated in their preamble, appear to have been concluded between the Euro- pean Commission, on the one hand, and a number of States, including the Hellenic Republic, on the other. 16 It follows from the nature of those legal instruments that they must be construed in accordance with the rules of public international law. 17 63. In this regard, it follows from customary international law, as codified 18 in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Laws of 14 \u2014 See, to this effect, Maria-Gisella Garbagnati Ketvel, \u2018The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in respect of Common Foreign and Security Policy\u2019, International and Comparative Law Quarterly , vol. 55, January 2006, pp. 77 to 120, at p. 82; I. Macleod, I.D. Hendry and S. Hyett, The External Relations of the European Communities , Clarendon Oxford Press, 1996, at p. 424. 15 \u2014 To support this finding, it may be pointed to the fact that it appears that the memoranda require ratification by the parties before they can enter into force. Such formality is in principle reserved to conventional acts of public inter- national law. 16 \u2014 While this kind of agreements certainly raise a number of interesting legal issues, such as the power of the Commis- sion to conclude such agreements under Title V of the EU Treaty, it certainly goes beyond the scope of the present case to analyse them in further depth. 17 \u2014 As far as the additional memorandum is concerned, this finding does not, in my view, preclude the application, whenever they can be identified, of \u2018general principles common to the legal systems of the Member States of the European Community\u2019, as is stated in Article 13(2) of the additional memorandum, in conjunction with the rules of international law. 18 \u2014 It has indeed been recognised by the International Court of Justice that the principles embodied in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention reflect customary international law ( Libya v Chad , ICJ Reports 1994, p. 4, paragraph 41).

In the case of the memoranda at issue, the provision which is most relevant for the purposes of determining the financial obli- gations of a withdrawing party is certainly Article 15(1) of the initial memorandum. It governs the effects of the withdrawal of a partner from the Abuja II project. It provides, in essence, that if a partner decides to with- draw from the Abuja II project by not signing the additional memorandum, the terms of the initial memorandum \u2014 including the financial obligations referred to in Articles 12 and 13 thereof \u2014 will cease to apply to the withdrawing partner. 65. It is clear that the Hellenic Republic questions the finding of the Court of First Instance in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal 19 in that it states in its applica- tion in the present case that the legal situ- ation of a State which has signed but not rati- fied the additional memorandum, and which is therefore not a party to the additional memorandum, is no different \u2014 especially as regards the financial obligations \u2014 from the legal situation of a State which has never signed the additional memorandum. 19 \u2014 \u2018As the Hellenic Republic acknowledged (see paragraph 56 above), it is quite clear from Article 15(1) of the initial memorandum that a participating partner which does not sign the additional memorandum can escape the financial obligations relating to the project (see paragraph 15 above). However, is not disputed that the Hellenic Republic did sign the additional memorandum. In the circumstances of the case, Article 15(1) of the initial memorandum must be read exactly contrary to the interpretation given to it by the Hellenic Republic.\u2019 66. In my view, that argument cannot be upheld. 67. First, Article 15(1) of the initial memo- randum expressly refers to the signature of the additional memorandum, not to its ratifi- cation. That indicates that the parties agreed to attach special importance, in the context of the withdrawal of parties from the Abuja II project, to the signature of the additional memorandum rather than to its ratification. This choice of a future event as a starting point for the unfolding of certain legal effects is independent of the fact that only the ratifi- cation of the additional memorandum allows the additional memorandum to enter into force. 68. There is thus nothing to suggest that the additional memorandum of understanding had to be ratified and had to enter into force in order for the provisions on withdrawal laid down in Article 15(1) of the initial memo- randum to unfold their legal effects. 69. In my view, the Court of First Instance was therefore entitled to make the finding, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, that the Hellenic Republic\u2019s financial obligations arise from the terms of the initial memorandum. To my mind, that is sufficient to mean that the judgment of the Court of First Instance should be upheld. ",
        "I - 8187 GREECE v COMMISSION 70. Second, and in support of that last conclusion, it is important to point out that, by its signature, the Hellenic Republic had agreed, in accordance with Article 14 of the additional memorandum, that the latter memorandum should apply provisionally with effect from the first day of the second month following the signature until its entry into force following ratification by the signatories or the notification to the other signatories of the intention not to ratify the agreement. 71. While, as I showed above, the signature of the additional memorandum is sufficient for Article 15(1) of the initial memorandum to unfold its legal effects, the fact that the additional memorandum was provision- ally applied has additional significance for the purposes of determining whether the Hellenic Republic was already bound by financial obligations when it withdrew from the Abuja II project. 72. Although an international agreement does not in principle have binding effect on a signatory State until after ratification, 20 contracting parties can provide that an agree- ment will apply provisionally before its entry into force. 21 The purpose of such provisional 20 \u2014 Normally a signatory will only be bound under international law after it has ratified the agreement according to the rules of its domestic law. 21 \u2014 Article 25 of the Vienna Convention on the Laws of Treaties. application is to remove any incentive for signatories to defect from a treaty regime through delay or failure to ratify the treaty by forcing them to bear the costs of treaty obligations immediately at the time of the signing. 22 73. Therefore the fact that the signatories of the additional memorandum agreed that it should have provisional application clearly shows their intention to accept the effects, whether financial or other, flowing from the provisional application of the memorandum until such time as a signatory notified the other partners of its intention not to ratify the additional memorandum. 74. I consequently consider that the Court of First Instance did not err in finding, in para- graph 101 of the judgment under appeal, that the Hellenic Republic could not disregard that provisional application by pleading that it had not ratified the memorandum. 22 \u2014 Alex.

",
        "I - 8188 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-203/07 P 75. It follows that the Court of First Instance could rightly establish in paragraphs 100 and 101 of the judgment under appeal that the existence of a financial obligation follows from Article 15(1) of the initial memo- randum and the provisional application of the additional memorandum. 76. It is therefore doubtful whether, for the outcome of the present appeal, it is at all relevant whether the Court of First Instance erred in its application of the principles of good faith and of the protection of legitimate expectations in connection with Articles 12, 13 and 15 of the initial memorandum of understanding and Article 14 of the add - itional memorandum of understanding. 77. In any event and for the sake of complete- ness, it may be briefly stated that to my mind the Court of First Instance could also rely on the principle of good faith in support of the conclusion that a financial obligation existed for the Hellenic Republic as a result of its ratification of the initial memorandum and signature of the additional memorandum. 78. As the Court of First Instance correctly pointed out, the principle of good faith is a rule of customary international law which has been recognised by the Permanent Court of International Justice established by the League of Nations. 23 It is, to some 23 \u2014 Judgment under appeal, paragraph 85. extent, 24 the counterpart in public inter- national law, of the principle of protection of legitimate expectations, existing in the Community legal order. 25 79. It can be added that, more recently, the International Court of Justice stated that \u2018[o]ne of the basic principles governing the cre ation and performance of legal obliga- tions, whatever their source, is the principle of good faith\u2019. 26 80. However, the precise definition 27 and role of the principle of good faith in inter - national law are not easy to grasp. 28 Never- theless, it appears to be common ground that the principle of good faith, when applied to conventional relations under international 24 \u2014 The equivalence between the two principles is in my view not total, since the principle of good faith in public inter- national law appears to have a wider scope than the principle of legitimate expectations under Community law. 25 \u2014 I believe the use of the word \u2018counterpart\u2019 is more appro- priate in this connection because it is more neutral than the word \u2018corollary\u2019, which the Court of First Instance used in paragraph 87 of the judgment under appeal in reliance on that Court\u2019s case-law in Case T-115/94 Opel Austria v Council [1997] ECR II-39, paragraph 93. Indeed, to my mind, the term \u2018corollary\u2019 necessarily implies that the Community law principle of protection of legitimate expectations precedes, in time and importance, the inter- national law principle of good faith. In this connection refer- ence may also be made to the Opinion of Advocate General Jacobs in Case C-162/96 Racke [1998] ECR I-3655, who, in point 76 thereof, did not use the term \u2018corollary\u2019 but put it as follows: \u2018[i]n Opel Austria the international law principle of good faith was married to the Community law principle of protection of legitimate expectations\u2019. 26 \u2014 Australia v France (Nuclear Tests Case), ICJ Reports 1974, p. 253, at p. 268. 27 \u2014 For a definition, see J.F.

        "I - 8189 GREECE v COMMISSION law, implies a reasonable and equitable appli- cation of conventional provisions to the circumstances of the individual case. The principle of good faith is especially a guiding principle for the interpretation of factual circumstances. 29 81. What seems to be most relevant to the case before the Court is that good faith requires that the intention expressed be consistent with the real intention, and, more generally, that the legal reality be consistent with the legal appearance (that is to say, consistent with the appearances created by statements or conduct on the part of the legal actors). 30 This effect of the principle of good faith seems to coincide with the prin- ciple \u2018 allegans contraria non est audiendus \u2019, commonly known as the principle of estoppel under international law. 31 82.

As explained by Lord McNair, this principle prevents a party who makes or concurs in a statement, on which another person relies to the extent of influencing its position, from later asserting a different state of affairs. until September 2000 that it would continue to participate in the Abuja II project, the Court of First Instance rightly referred to the principle of good faith in support of its conclusion that the Hellenic Republic could not withdraw without being held liable for the expenditure related to its participation in the Abuja II project. 83. That finding is supported \u2014 beyond that general understanding of the principle of good faith \u2014 by the existence of an enhanced obligation of good faith 32 which is incumbent upon Member States of the European Union as regards their relations with one another and with the institutions of the European Union as a result of their membership of the EU. 33 In the present case, such an obligation applied to the Hellenic Republic in its rela- tions with the Commission and the partner States in the Abuja II project. 84. For all those reasons, I am of the view that the first ground of appeal is unfounded. 32 \u2014 See Elisabeth Zoller, cited in footnote 29, p. 157. The author considers that strengthened good faith (the author uses the expression \u2018bonne foi renforc\u00e9e\u2019) exists in international organisations, applying both to Member States and the organs of the organisation. 33 \u2014 The existence of such a strengthened obligation to act in good faith is in my view reflected in Article 11(2) EU which provides that \u2018[t]he Member States shall support the Union\u2019s external and security policy actively and unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity\u2019. This is supported by the fact that, as far as the EC Treaty is concerned, it is recognised that a strengthened good faith seems to be at least implicitly reflected in the obligation of loyal cooper- ation contained in Article 10 EC (see, Vlad Constantinesco, \u2018L\u2019article 5 CEE, de la bonne foi \u00e0 la loyaut\u00e9 communau- taire\u2019, Du droit international au droit de l\u2019int\u00e9gration (Liber amicorum Pierre Pescatore), Nomos, 1989, pp. 97\u2013114, at p. 101).

Since I consider that financial obligations had already arisen for Greece from the provi- sions of the initial and the additional memo- randa, it appears irrelevant for the outcome of the present appeal whether the Court of First Instance was right in determining that such financial obligations also arose from an implied agreement concluded at the meeting of 24 February 2007. 86. The second ground of appeal is therefore ineffective and should be rejected. 87. It follows from all the foregoing consid- erations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.

As the Commis- sion has applied for costs against the Hellenic Republic, and the Hellenic Republic has been unsuccessful, the Hellenic Republic must be ordered to pay the costs.

Following the transfer of the capital of Nigeria from Lagos to Abuja, the Commis- sion has, since 1993, rented a building in Abuja to house its delegation as well as, temporarily, the representations of a number of Member States, including the Hellenic Republic. Under an arrangement with those Member States (\u201cthe Abuja I project\u201d), the Commission was sub-letting a number of offices and provided a number of services to the representations in question. The Member States reached an agreement on the sharing of the costs relating to their representa- tions. The contribution of the Hellenic Republic amounted to 5.5% of the total costs. Having decided that the Hellenic Republic had not paid its debts in that regard, the Commission, in 2004, proceeded to recovery by offsetting of the corresponding sums (see paragraph 44 below). 8. On 18 April 1994, the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, Ireland, the Italian Republic, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Portuguese Republic and the Commission (\u201cthe partners\u201d), on the basis of 9 10 ",

The initial memorandum was supplemented, following the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden, by an accession protocol. 9. Article 1 of the initial memorandum stipulates that the embassies of the partici- pating Member States and the delegation of the Commission are to be distinct diplomatic missions which are subject to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961, and, with regard to the Member States, also subject to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 24 April 1963. 10. Article 10 of the initial memorandum stated that the Commission would act, as coordinator of the Abuja II project, \u201con behalf of\u201d the other partners. 11. Under Article 11 of the initial memorandum, the Commission is authorised to undertake architectural feasibility studies for the Abuja II project, as well as initial costings and design developments. That article also provides for the conclusion of an additional Memorandum of Understanding covering \u201cdetailed building design, sharing of costs and individual participating partners\u2019 legal interests in the premises on completion of the [Abuja II] project\u201d (\u201cthe additional memo- randum\u201d).

On 19 September 1996, the CFSP Working Party on Administrative Affairs approved the scheme design. 23. On 21 November 1996, the CFSP Working Party on Administrative Affairs asked the Commission to make ad hoc arrangements in order to allow the architects to start work on the detailed design.

On 24 February 1997, the CFSP Working Party on Administrative Affairs met again and decided not to wait for the additional memorandum to be finalised before proceeding to the drawing-up of the detailed design and contractual documents. The minute of that meeting contains the following resolutions: \u201cThe Commission [is invited] to make the necessary arrangements with the archi- tects for the elaboration of these documents and to advance the funds needed for these tasks according [to] modalities agreed for the project.

A similar decision was taken following the withdrawal of Ireland in September 1997, and the withdrawals of the Portuguese Republic, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden. \u2026 27. On 18 June 1998, the CFSP Working Party on Administrative Affairs mentioned the possibility of a withdrawal of the Kingdom of Belgium from the Abuja II project.

The Commission stated that some Member States had already paid the amounts due, but that others, including the Hellenic Republic, had not reimbursed it before the due date of 31 December 1998. The Commission added that a further invoice would be sent to all partners concerning, first, the costs of the detailed design (phase) and, second, the costs caused by the redesign of the complex after the withdrawal of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Spain and the Portu- guese Republic.

        "I - 8205 GREECE v COMMISSION 33. On 20 September 1999, the permanent Steering Committee met to finalise the pre-qualification of construction companies. The representative of the Hellenic Republic signed the minute of the meeting. A call for tender was published in the Official Journal S 54 of 17 March 2000. 34. By payment order of 17 February 2000, the Commission requested payment from the Hellenic Republic of EUR 168 716.94 for the drawing-up of the call for tender for the detailed design. 35. On 22 June 2000, the permanent Steering Committee decided to adopt a new project approach (\u201cAbuja Light\u201d), which was made necessary by the withdrawal of the French Republic. The Abuja Light project provided in particular for the omission of common buildings and common technical installations, and a reduc- tion of the construction area. The representative of the Hellenic Republic at that meeting indicated his agreement with the project, subject none the less to the approval of his superiors. On 29 June 2000, the Commission sent the minute of the meeting of 22 June 2000 to the Hellenic Republic and asked it for an official reply regarding the Abuja Light project. 36. On 5 September 2000, the Commission reiterated its request to the representa- tives of the Hellenic Republic. After another reminder dated 14 September 2000, the Commission sent a letter on 25 September 2000 to the Hellenic Republic by fax, giving a deadline for response of 30 September 2000 and stating that a failure to respond would be understood as a withdrawal from the project. On 2 October 2000, the Greek authorities informed the Commission that they were unable to give a formal answer regarding the Abuja Light project. Consequently the Commission responded, on the same day, that it had asked the architects to proceed with the redesign of the Abuja II project without including the Hellenic Republic. 37. By letter of 28 January 2002, the Commission sent a debit note for \u2026 to the Hellenic Republic for the construction costs of the Abuja II project. The Commis- sion subsequently cancelled this debit note. ",

After setting up its own embassy in Abuja, the Hellenic Republic vacated the temporary buildings it was occupying as a partner of the Abuja I project on 13 July 2002. 39. By letter of 11 October 2002, the Commission formally notified the Hellenic Republic of the outstanding debit notes regarding the Abuja I and Abuja II projects \u2026. 40. Following negotiations between the parties, the Commission reminded the Hellenic Republic, by letter of 31 January 2003, that the latter had not paid its debts relating to the Abuja I and Abuja II projects and requested that it pay a total amount of EUR 516 374.96 and USD 12 684.89 by the end of February 2003. The Commission added that, in the case of failure to pay by that deadline, it would enforce recovery of the amounts in question by all means available under the law. 41. During the months that followed, the Hellenic Republic and the Commission discussed the amounts of the sums due. \u2026 43. On 16 February 2004, the Commission sent a letter to the Hellenic Republic identifying the latter\u2019s outstanding debts for the Abuja I and Abuja II projects. \u2026 44. On 10 March 2004, the Commission transferred funds to the Hellenic Republic under the Regional Operational Programme for mainland Greece. However, instead of paying an amount of EUR 4 774 562.67 \u2026, the Commission only trans- ferred EUR 3 121 243.03. It thus proceeded to recovery by offsetting the amount not yet paid by the Hellenic Republic, of which EUR 565 656.80 concerned the Abuja I and Abuja II projects \u2026\u2019 ",
        "I - 8207 GREECE v COMMISSION The action before the Court of First Instance and the judgment under appeal By application lodged at the Registry of the Court of Justice on 22 April 2004, the Hellenic Republic brought an action for the annulment of the contested act. By order of 8 June 2004, pursuant to Article 2 of Council Decision 2004/407/EC, Euratom of 26 April 2004 amending Articles 51 and 54 of the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice (OJ 2004 L 132, p. 5), the Court of Justice referred the case to the Court of First Instance. By the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action brought by the Hellenic Republic. It ruled that the Hellenic Republic was liable for the debts relating to the Abuja I and the Abuja II projects and that the conditions for recovery by offsetting were fulfilled on the date of the contested act. After holding in paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal that it had jurisdiction to hear the application for annulment of the act of offsetting, the Court of First Instance found in paragraph 84 of the judgment under appeal, as regards the Abuja II project, that the Hellenic Republic did not deny that it had acted as a full participant in that project for more than six years. In particular, the Court of First Instance found that the Hellenic Republic had taken part in the project for almost two years after the signature of the additional memorandum on 9 December 1998. Thus, according to the Court of First Instance, the Hellenic Republic had, by its conduct, given the other partners to understand that it would continue to participate in the Abuja II project. The Court of First Instance proceeded in paragraph 84 to infer from this that the obligations of the Hellenic Republic could not be assessed solely on the basis of the initial and additional memoranda; account had also to be taken of the expectations which the conduct of that Member State had led its partners to entertain. 11 12 13 14 15 ",
        "I - 8208 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-203/07 P In that regard, the Court of First Instance stated in paragraphs 85 to 87 of the judg- ment under appeal that the principle of good faith is a rule of customary inter - national law which is binding on the European Community and on the other partici- pating partners, that it has been codified by Article 18 of the Vienna Convention and that it is the corollary, in public international law, of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations. Further, the Court of First Instance found, in paragraph 88 of the judgment under appeal, that, since the Hellenic Republic had signed and ratified the initial memo- randum, it was one of the partners participating in the Abuja II project, a status which entailed certain enhanced obligations of cooperation and solidarity between participants. In paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance went on to point out that after the initial phase of the project, the partners had decided to go ahead with the project and to bear the costs relating to the detailed design of the building, before the additional memorandum was finalised. In particular, at a meeting on 24 February 1997 which was attended by two representatives of the Hellenic Republic, the Commission was authorised to make the necessary arrange- ments with the architects to draw up detailed plans without awaiting the additional memorandum. In that connection, the Court of First Instance found in paragraph 93 of the judg- ment under appeal that, in thus going further than the preliminary phases, the partners had necessarily concluded an implied agreement to carry out the project. In the same paragraph, the Court of First Instance stated that, by referring to the subsequent reimbursement of the advances provided for in the initial memorandum, the partners were in fact referring to Article 12 of that memorandum, according to which, if the project was carried out, the partners were to reimburse the costs of preparation of the project advanced by the Commission. The Court of First Instance added that since the partners decided at the meeting of 24 February 1997 to carry out the project, they were no longer free to withdraw from it without reimbursing their share of the preliminary and subsequent expenditure. 16 17 18 19 ",
        "I - 8209 GREECE v COMMISSION In paragraph 95 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance stated that the Hellenic Republic, together with the other partners which had not withdrawn from the project, had signed the additional memorandum on 9 December 1998 and that, in the subsequent months, the Hellenic Republic had acted as a full partner in the project, not showing any reticence with regard to its participation until the summer of 2000. In paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance inferred from this that, even though the Hellenic Republic was entitled to withdraw from the project, it could not \u2014 particularly in the light of the evolution of the under- takings given after the initial phase, and notwithstanding the non-ratification of the additional memorandum \u2014 withdraw without being held liable for the expenditure linked to its participation in the Abuja II project. In paragraph 97 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance stated that the obligation incumbent upon the Hellenic Republic to act in good faith was reinforced by the fact that it had signed and ratified the initial memorandum and that, from 18 April 1994 to 30 September 2000, it was a \u2018participating partner\u2019 in the project. The Court of First Instance went on to state in paragraph 98 of the judgment under appeal that, if the Hellenic Republic had considered that it had no financial responsi- bility prior to ratification of the additional memorandum, it should have objected to the payment orders of 10 June 1998 and 17 February 2000 sent to it by the Commis- sion in relation to the Abuja II project. The Court of First Instance added in the same paragraph that the Hellenic Republic had never showed any intention of with- drawing from the project or of not ratifying the additional memorandum, despite the withdrawal of several Member States and the consequent change in its share of the project. 20 21 22 23 ",
        "I - 8210 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-203/07 P In paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance inferred from this that the conduct of the Hellenic Republic had been that of a full participant in the project, and that it had thus given its partners to understand that it would fulfil its financial obligations in relation to the project. In paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance added that the financial obligations of the Hellenic Republic also arose under the terms of the initial memorandum and, in particular, from Article 15(1) thereof. The Court of First Instance pointed out in paragraph 101 of the judgment under appeal that, under Article 14 thereof, the additional memorandum was to apply provisionally to the Hellenic Republic from the first day of the second month after its signature \u2014 that is to say, from 1 February 1999 \u2014 and that that provisional appli- cation could not be affected by the fact that the Hellenic Republic did not ratify the memorandum. For all those reasons, the Court of First Instance held, in paragraph 103 of the judg- ment under appeal, that the Hellenic Republic had to be held liable for all the costs relating to its participation in the Abuja II project. Moreover, the Court of First Instance rejected as unfounded the plea that the amounts receivable were not certain and of fixed amount for the purposes of the applicable regulations and held that the conditions laid down for recovery by offset- ting were fulfilled at the time of the contested act. In the light of all those considerations, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action brought by the Hellenic Republic. 24 25 26 27 28 29 ",

The appeal In support of its appeal, the Hellenic Republic relies on two pleas in law (\u2018the grounds of appeal\u2019 or \u2018the pleas on appeal\u2019). 30 31 32 ",
        "I - 8212 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-203/07 P According to the first plea on appeal, the Court of First Instance erred in law in its interpretation and application of Articles 12, 13 and 15 of the initial memorandum and of the principles of good faith and legitimate expectations. By the second plea on appeal, the Hellenic Republic submits that the Court of First Instance was wrong to find that the partners had concluded an implied agreement on 24 February 1997 \u2014 that is, before the signature of the additional memorandum \u2014 by reason of which they were no longer free to withdraw from the project without reimbursing their share of the expenditure. Admissibility of the appeal According to the Commission, the appeal brought by the Hellenic Republic is inad- missible in so far as it is not based on any of the grounds listed in Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice: the grounds on which it is based relate exclusively to the interpretation of the memoranda, which form no part of Community law. In this respect, it should be borne in mind that the Court of First Instance has juris- diction to hear and determine actions or proceedings referred to in Article 230 EC, with the exception of those reserved in the Statute for the Court of Justice. Decisions given by the Court of First Instance under that provision may be the subject of an appeal to the Court of Justice on points of law only, under the conditions and within the limits laid down by the Statute. In the present case, an action was brought before the Court of First Instance pursuant to Article 230 EC for the annulment of the contested act \u2014 adopted on the basis of Article 73(1) of the Financial Regulation, and the Implementing Regulation \u2014 by which the Commission had proceeded to recovery by offsetting of sums, owed by the 33 34 35 36 37 ",

The Hellenic Republic criticises the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed its application for annulment of that act, the legal basis for which lies in Community regulations. As regards the scope of the pleas themselves, it should be noted that the Hellenic Republic challenges the Court of First Instance\u2019s legal interpretation of the sole plea raised before it, which alleged in particular that the analysis of the Hellenic Repub- lic\u2019s financial obligations in relation to the Abuja II project was unsound. It is not contrary to Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice \u2014 under which an appeal to the Court of Justice is to lie on the grounds of lack of competence of the Court of First Instance, or a breach of procedure before it which adversely affects the interests of the appellant, or the infringement of Community law by the Court of First Instance \u2014 for the pleas put forward in support of the application to have the judg- ment of the Court of First Instance set aside, which challenge the classification of the Hellenic Republic as a debtor within the meaning of Article 78 of the Implementing Regulation, to entail an analysis of the scope of legal acts which cannot themselves be contested before the Court of First Instance, such as the two memoranda referred to in paragraphs 33 and 34 of this judgment. Further, it should be noted that, for the purposes of determining whether the contested act is well founded \u2014 in particular, as regards verification that the debt itself exists and that the conditions for offsetting are satisfied \u2014 it is necessary to interpret those legal acts, but such an analysis does not necessarily give rise to an action in respect of those legal acts. 38 39 40 41 ",
        "I - 8214 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-203/07 P Moreover, the Commission contends that the appeal is inadmissible because the pleas on appeal are ineffective. Therefore, the Commission submits that, even if those pleas had to be upheld, the fact that they were well founded could not, in any event, lead to the judgment under appeal being set aside, in so far as other grounds forming a sound basis for the operative part of that judgment are not challenged in the appeal. Given that that argument does not relate to the admissibility of the appeal but to its merits, it could not \u2014 even if it were well founded \u2014 entail the inadmissibility of the appeal. Accordingly, the appeal must be declared admissible. Substance Arguments of the parties According to the Hellenic Republic, first, the Court of First Instance should have held that the obligations of the Member States participating in the Abuja II project were determined by the provisions of the initial and additional memoranda, not by the conduct of each Member State. 42 43 44 45 ",
        "I - 8215 GREECE v COMMISSION An obligation incumbent upon a Member State can be defined only on the basis of the relevant terms of the memoranda. The conduct of the Hellenic Republic, analysed in the light of the principle of good faith, cannot therefore be taken into consider- ation in order to determine, from the outset, its obligations in relation to the Abuja II project, since that principle cannot have the effect of imposing obligations to which that Member State did not contractually subscribe. In this respect, the Hellenic Republic submits that the Court of First Instance should have looked only at the text of the initial memorandum and should have noted that it did not impose any financial obligations on the Hellenic Republic, so long as the additional memorandum had not been ratified. According to the Hellenic Republic, pursuant to Articles 12 and 13 of the initial memorandum, the obligation on the participating Member States to contribute financially to the Abuja II project only arises after approval of the additional memo- randum; such approval \u2014 which is one of the methods by which a State consents to be bound by an international treaty \u2014 is thus equivalent, pursuant to the Vienna Convention, in particular, to instruments of ratification, acceptance or accession. For that reason, the financial obligations referred to in the initial memorandum are conditional upon that approval. Moreover, as is clear from Article 16 of the Vienna Convention, such legal instru- ments establish the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty upon, inter alia, the notification of those instruments to the other contracting States or to the depositary. Accordingly, the Hellenic Republic submits that Article 14 of the additional memo- randum, which concerns the application of that act, clearly distinguishes signature of the memorandum, the sole effect of which is the act\u2019s provisional application, from its entry into force, which cannot take place until the parties declare that they have ratified it. As it is, even though the Hellenic Republic signed the additional memo- randum and initially participated in the work for the implementation of the Abuja II project, it never ratified that memorandum. 46 47 48 49 ",
        "I - 8216 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-203/07 P According to the Hellenic Republic, it follows from the foregoing that the specific conditions defined in Articles 12 and 13 of the initial memorandum, read in conjunc- tion with Article 15 of that memorandum, were not fulfilled in its case, since applica- tion of the principle of good faith cannot run counter to those contractual provisions. Secondly, the Hellenic Republic submits that the Court of First Instance was wrong to find that the partners concluded an implied agreement on 24 February 1997, in so far as that agreement was not confirmed by a corresponding provision in the add - itional memorandum. For its part, the Commission contends, first, that according to a well-established rule, a contracting State incurs financial liability if its conduct infringes the principle of good faith and causes its partners damage. The Commission adds that a Member State cannot, in its relations with its inter- national partners, ignore general principles of law which it recognises in its national legal system and stresses that the Greek legal system recognises the principle of good faith both in private and in public law. It follows that the Court of First Instance was right, in order to assess the financial obligations of the Hellenic Republic, to take into account its relations with its part- ners and to find that, given the Hellenic Republic\u2019s consistent pattern of behaviour from 1994 to 2000, the application of the principle of good faith made it incumbent upon that Member State to reimburse the costs at issue. 50 51 52 53 54 ",
        "I - 8217 GREECE v COMMISSION Secondly, the Commission contends that an agreement exists from the moment the parties have expressed their formal consent. The Court of First Instance was there- fore right to infer from the minutes of the meeting of 24 February 1997, in which the Hellenic Republic participated, that an agreement existed that gave rise to rights and obligations for the Member States that took part in the meeting. Findings of the Court The financial obligations of Member States in the context of the implementation of the Abuja II project must be determined, first, in the light of the content and the scope of the initial and additional memoranda. It should be noted that, far from dismissing such an approach to the financial obli- gations, the Court of First Instance directly followed that approach in the judgment under appeal, in particular in the analysis it undertook in paragraphs 100 et seq. of that judgment, following its interpretation of the initial and additional memoranda. In this respect, it is common ground \u2014 as the Court of First Instance stated in para- graph 88 of the judgment under appeal \u2014 that the Hellenic Republic signed the initial memorandum on 18 April 1994 and that it also ratified that memorandum, thus becoming, along with several other Member States, a partner in the Abuja II project for the construction in a \u2018spirit of mutual benefit\u2019 of a common complex accommodating embassies and the Commission delegation. Moreover, it is also common ground \u2014 as the Court of First Instance stated in para- graph 95 of the judgment under appeal \u2014 that the Hellenic Republic signed the add - itional memorandum on 9 December 1998 even though, by that date, some Member 55 56 57 58 59 ",
        "I - 8218 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-203/07 P States had already withdrawn from the Abuja II project, after reimbursing their share of the costs incurred by that stage in the project, and that the conclusion of that additional memorandum of understanding had been envisaged by the initial memo- randum, as Article 11 of the latter shows. In addition, it was through the interpretation that it had to carry out of Article 15(1) of the initial memorandum that the Court of First Instance rightly found \u2014 as is clear from paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal \u2014 that, where one of the participants decided to withdraw from the Abuja II project after signing the add - itional memorandum, the terms of the initial memorandum continued to apply to it, including the financial obligations envisaged in Articles 12 and 13. Moreover, pursuant to Article 14 of the additional memorandum, even though that memorandum was to enter into force on the first day of the second month following the date on which the Member States and the Commission declared that it had been ratified, it was to be provisionally applied from the first day of the second month after its signature. As the Court of First Instance found, the Hellenic Republic, by signing the additional memorandum, necessarily consented to its provisional appli- cation, hence to the consequences attaching to withdrawal from the Abuja II project prior to expressing any approval. As the Advocate General stated in paragraphs 67 and 73 of his Opinion, it is clear from Article 15(1) of the initial memorandum and Article 14 of the additional memorandum that the participating Member States and the Commission intended to attach special importance to the signature of the additional memorandum and to its provisional application, rather than to its ratification, particularly in the context of the withdrawal of participants from the Abuja II project. 60 61 62 ",
        "I - 8219 GREECE v COMMISSION Even though the Hellenic Republic thus remained free to withdraw from the project so long as it had not ratified the additional memorandum, it could not refuse to fulfil the financial obligations arising from its participation in the Abuja II project up until the date on which it withdrew, those obligations falling to be determined in the light of the evolution of the undertakings given by that Member State after the initial phase. Moreover, the Court of First Instance was entitled to invoke, as an additional basis for the obligation thus incumbent on the Hellenic Republic under the memoranda, the customary principle of good faith, which forms part of general international law (C-308/06 Intertanko and Others [2008] ECR I-4057, paragraph 52). In that respect, the Court of First Instance found \u2014 by way of an assessment of the facts that is not open to appeal \u2014 that, between 18 April 1994 and 30 September 2000, the Hellenic Republic had expressed no reservations with regard to its partici- pation in the Abuja II project, even though its commitments had evolved substan- tially owing to the withdrawal from the project of a number of Member States, and that, in particular, it had not objected to the payment orders sent by the Commis- sion, thus leading its partners confidently to expect that it would fulfil its financial obligations under the Abuja II project. It follows from all the foregoing that the Court of First Instance was right to infer from the interpretation of the scope of the initial and additional memoranda that, even though it had not ratified the additional memorandum, the Hellenic Republic was under an obligation to reimburse the costs relating to its participation in the Abuja II project, having moreover led its partners confidently to expect that it would fulfil its financial obligations. Finally, the submissions concerning the existence of an implied agreement concluded at the meeting of 24 February 1997 cannot call into question the operative part of the judgment under appeal in so far as they are directed at superfluous grounds, 63 64 65 66 67 ",

In the context of the cooperation between the Court of Justice and the national courts laid down by Article 234 EC, it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judi- cial decision, to determine in the light of the particular circumstances of the case both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judg- ment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court. It follows that questions on the interpretation of Community law referred by a national court, in the factual and legislative context which that court is responsible for defining and the accuracy of which is not a matter for the Court to deter- mine, enjoy a presumption of relevance. The presumption that questions referred by national courts for a preliminary ruling are relevant may be rebutted only in exceptional cases, where it is quite obvious that the interpretation which is sought of Community law bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or to its purpose or where the problem is hypothetical or the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it. (see paras 32, 33) 2. Article 291(1) of Regulation No 2454/93 laying down provisions for the imple- mentation of Regulation No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code, as amended by Regulation No 89/97, must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of \u2018person importing the goods or having them imported for free circulation\u2019 contained ",
        "I - 8223 TRESPA INTERNATIONAL therein refers to the person for whom the goods are destined and who intends to assign them to the prescribed end-use, irrespective of whether he makes the customs declaration himself or has that done by a representative within the meaning of Article 5 of Regulation No 2913/92. That concept does not refer to the representative of that person before the customs authorities, disre- garding those cases in which that person is deemed to act in his own name and on his own behalf pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 5(4) of Regula- tion No 2913/92 and who must therefore be considered an importer. In that regard, although it is true that Part II, Title I, Chapter 2, of the imple- menting regulation, which governs the admission of goods with favour- able tariff treatment by reason of their end-use, does not define the concept of \u2018person importing the goods or having them imported for free circulation\u2019, the fact remains that that legislation places certain obligations on the holder of that authorisation which allow iden- tification of the person referred to in Article 291(1) of that regulation. Thus, both the obligation laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 291(3) of that regulation, which states that the person concerned is to enable the customs authorities to trace the goods to their satisfaction in the establishment or establishments of the undertaking throughout their processing, and the obligations provided for in Article 293 of that regulation, such as the require- ment that the goods be assigned to the prescribed end-use, the keeping of records enabling the customs author- ities to carry out any checks which they consider necessary to ensure that the goods are actually put to the prescribed end-use, and the retention of such records, show that the person importing the goods or having them imported, that is to say, the person who is required to hold the authorisation referred to in Article 291 of the implementing regula- tion, is the person for whom the goods are destined and who intends to assign them to the prescribed end-use. Only that person is in a position to fulfil the obligations laid down in Articles 291 and 293 of that regulation. The fact that Article 291(1) of the imple- menting regulation uses as alternatives the expressions \u2018the person importing \u2026 goods\u2019 and \u2018[the person] having them imported\u2019 shows that it is possible to import goods which have a particular end-use through a representative before the customs authorities in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation No 2913/92. It follows that the representative who makes customs declarations on behalf of someone else is not the person referred to in Article 291(1) of the implementing regulation and therefore does not have to hold an authorisation within the meaning of that article. It is solely where a customs agent fails to state that he is acting in the name of or on behalf of another person or states that he is acting in the name of or on behalf of another person without being empowered to do so, that that agent is himself considered the importer and must, consequently, hold written authorisation in order to benefit from favourable tariff treatment for the goods imported.

        "I - 8224 SUMMARY \u2014 CASE C-248/07 3. Article 297(1) of Regulation No 2454/93 laying down provisions for the imple- mentation of Regulation No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code, as amended by Regulation No 89/97, must be interpreted as meaning that there has been no transfer of goods within the Community in a situation where goods are imported into a Member State and then transported to another Member State, if the person authorised acts on behalf of the ultimate importer, which is for the national court to ascertain. The mere fact that the goods were imported into and cleared through customs in one Member State and then transported to another Member State is irrelevant to the establishment of the existence of a transfer within the meaning of that provision. Where goods are transferred, the transferee must hold an authorisation issued in accordance with Article 291 of that regulation. In that regard, in order to determine whether there is a transfer within the Community within the meaning of Article 297(1) of the implementing regu- lation, it is apparent from the purpose of that regulation that what is important is the transfer to the transferee of obliga- tions relating to the goods transferred. In that regard, the transferee must hold an authorisation issued in accordance with Article 291 of that regulation. Thus, Article 298(4) and (5) and the second paragraph of Article 300 of the implementing regulation provide that, from the date of transfer of the goods, the obligations which follow from Art - icles 291 to 304 of the implementing regulation pass from the consignor to the consignee and the latter is required to enter the goods transferred in his records. It follows therefrom that a transfer of goods, within the meaning of Article 297(1) of the implementing regulation, can take place only between persons holding an end-use authorisa- tion, that is to say, persons who intend or intended to assign the goods to the end-use prescribed. (see paras 65-69, operative part 2) 4. Article 297(1) of Regulation No 2454/93 laying down provisions for the imple- mentation of Regulation No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code, as amended by Regulation No 89/97, must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of \u2018transferee\u2019 contained therein does not refer to a customs agent who carries out customs formalities on behalf of the importer. The transferee is the person who acquires from the consignor the right or goods transferred. Thus, the term \u2018transferee\u2019 within the meaning of Article 297(1) of the implementing regulation refers to the person who acquires from the consignor the goods which benefited from favourable tariff ",

        "I - 8237 TRESPA INTERNATIONAL The dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a prelim- inary ruling Since 1 January 1995, Trespa has been importing kraft paper from the United States into the Netherlands for use in the manufacture of building materials. Trespa buys those goods from the American company Westvaco in accordance with sales condi- tions termed \u2018delivered duty unpaid\u2019. Under those conditions, the vendor bears the storage costs and Trespa can take goods from the stock as and when it needs them. Until May 1997, the kraft paper was delivered to Moerdijk Marine Services in Moer- dijk (Netherlands), where the paper was then warehoused. In May 1997, the Euro- pean branch of Westvaco, Westvaco Europe NV, informed Trespa that it intended to transfer its stock from Moerdijk to Antwerp (Belgium) and to use Nova\u2019s services for customs clearance, storage and release. At the same time as the transfer of the warehouse of Westvaco Europe NV to Antwerp, Trespa applied to the Commission of the European Communities to place the kraft paper under the duty suspension system in order not to have to pay import duties. That application was based on the fact that the European Union did not produce enough kraft paper to meet Trespa\u2019s needs. On 27 June 1997, the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1291/97 amending Regu- lation (EC) No 2505/96 opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products and amending Regula- tion (EC) No 3059/95 opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products (first series 1996) (OJ 1997 L 176, p. 17), pursuant to which the applicable customs duty on 8 000 tonnes of 16 17 18 19 ",
        "I - 8238 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-248/07 kraft paper with CN code 4804 41 91 10 and on 7 000 tonnes of kraft paper with CN code 4804 51 90 10 was to be 0%. Under Regulation No 1291/97, only imports of kraft paper assigned to an end-use, in particular the manufacture of certain products, could benefit from those two tariff quotas. Between the months of July 1997 and January 1998, Nova cleared Trespa\u2019s goods through customs free of import duties without there being any objection from the Antwerp customs authorities. In January 1998, those authorities carried out an external audit of the customs clearance documents and informed Nova that those tariff quotas were not unconditional, but subject to the condition that the goods imported be assigned to the end-use for which authorisation was necessary. Having received that information from Nova, on 26 January 1998 Trespa applied to the Netherlands customs authorities for authorisation within the framework of a continuous end-use authorisation in order to enable it to import kraft paper from the United States free of import duties for the production of its Trespa panels. The requested authorisation was granted by the Netherlands customs authorities on 17 June 1998, with 1 January 1998 indicated as the effective date. Nova made a similar application for authorisation to the Belgian customs authorities and the end-use authorisation was granted to it on 17 February 1998 for goods under CN code 4804 41 99 10. Nova then made an additional application and that author- isation was subsequently extended to CN codes 4804 41 91 10 and 4804 51 90 10 with effect from 11 June 1998. 20 21 22 23 ",
        "I - 8239 TRESPA INTERNATIONAL On 2 December 1999 the Belgian customs authorities sent Nova a claim for post- clearance recovery of import duties and value added tax (\u2018VAT\u2019) relating to the goods imported on behalf of Trespa. Having notified Trespa of the existence of that docu- ment and asked it to reimburse the amounts which Nova had to pay, Nova itself paid approximately EUR 508 400 in customs duties and VAT. Trespa also requested the Netherlands customs authorities to carry out an admin- istrative check in order to show that, since 1 January 1998, the goods imported had been put to the end-use prescribed in the description of the respective CN codes. Apart from a small quantity of the goods imported, Trespa was able to show that the goods had indeed been put to the end-use prescribed, so that the Belgian customs authorities reimbursed Nova, between 30 November 2000 and 15 December 2003, almost all of the duties paid by it, that is to say, approximately EUR 507 200. Nevertheless, on 18 January 2000, Nova invoiced Trespa for an amount corres- ponding to the customs duties and VAT which it had paid. On 7 November 2001, Nova brought an action before the Rechtbank van koophandel te Antwerpen (Antwerp Commercial Court) seeking an order that Trespa pay it approximately EUR 203 100 plus interest and a lump sum of 10% of the amount of that invoice for administration costs. Following the subsequent reimbursement which it received from the Belgian customs authorities, Nova amended that application, but did not fully withdraw it. In turn, Trespa brought counterclaims seeking indemnities and reimbursement of the administrative costs which it had incurred. 24 25 26 27 ",
        "I - 8240 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-248/07 The Rechtbank van koophandel te Antwerpen gave its decision on 26 November 2004. That court held that it had not been shown that Nova had committed an error justifying the claim for post-clearance recovery from the Belgian customs author- ities and that it had not been shown either that Nova itself was required to hold an end-use authorisation. Finally, Trespa and Nova were each ordered to pay certain sums to the other. Trespa appealed against that judgment on 1 February 2005. According to Trespa, the claim for post-clearance recovery of import duties is exclu- sively the result of errors made by Nova which, when declaring the goods to the Belgian customs and excise authorities, should have held an end-use authorisation which it did not have. According to Nova, however, such authorisation ought only to have been held by its principal, Trespa. In those circumstances, the Hof van beroep te Antwerpen decided to stay proceed- ings and refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \u2018(1) Under Article 291 of [the implementing regulation], who is \u201cthe person importing the goods or having them imported for free circulation\u201d?: does this term include the customs agent which makes the customs declaration in its own name and for its own account or does it cover only the importer for which the goods are intended? (2) Is there a transfer of goods within the Community for the purposes of Art - icles 297 and 1a of [the implementing regulation] in the case where goods are imported into the \u2026 Union at Antwerp and then transported to the Nether- 28 29 30 ",
        "I - 8241 TRESPA INTERNATIONAL lands and/or should the person referred to in Article 291 of [the implementing regulation], in such a case hold the authorisation referred to in that article? (3) Does the term \u201ctransferee\u201d in Article 297 of [the implementing regulation], refer to the customs agent which clears the goods inwards from outside the Community to a Member State of the European Union on behalf of the ultimate importer?\u2019 The questions referred for a preliminary ruling Admissibility The Commission is doubtful as to the admissibility of the reference for a preliminary ruling. It submits that the dispute in the main proceedings concerns the private law relationship between the parties to the main proceedings, which is governed by the Belgian Civil Code, and that the relevance of the questions to the resolution of that dispute is not obvious. Although it accepts that those questions may have a certain importance in the context of the main proceedings, the Commission is not convinced that the answer to be given to those questions is sufficient to resolve that dispute. In that regard, it is necessary to recall that, in the context of the cooperation between the Court of Justice and the national courts provided for by Article 234 EC, it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine in the light of the particular circumstances of the case both the need for a preliminary ruling 31 32 ",
        "I - 8242 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-248/07 in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court (see, inter alia, Case C-144/04 Mangold [2005] ECR I-9981, paragraph 34; Case C-217/05 Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Empresarios de Estaciones de Servicio [2006] ECR I-11987, paragraph 16; and Case C-119/05 Lucchini [2007] ECR I-6199, paragraph 43). It follows that questions on the interpretation of Community law referred by a national court, in the factual and legislative context which that court is responsible for defining and the accuracy of which is not a matter for the Court to determine, enjoy a presumption of relevance (see Case C-300/01 Salzmann [2003] ECR I-4899, paragraph 31, and Joined Cases C-94/04 and C-202/04 Cipolla and Others [2006] ECR I-11421, paragraph 25). The presumption that questions referred by national courts for a preliminary ruling are relevant may be rebutted only in exceptional cases, where it is quite obvious that the interpretation which is sought of Commu- nity law bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or to its purpose or where the problem is hypothetical or the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (see, to that effect, Case C-105/03 Pupino [2005] ECR I-5285, paragraph 30, and Case C-467/05 Dell\u2019Orto [2007] ECR I-5557, paragraph 40). In the present case, interpretation of the Community customs legislation will enable it to be known whether a customs agent must, in the circumstances of the main proceedings, hold an end-use authorisation. It is apparent from the documents that that information is necessary in order to decide whether Nova committed an error in its relationship with Trespa and in order to know who is to bear the costs incurred because of the post-clearance recovery of the customs duties at issue. The question is therefore neither hypothetical nor one which bears no relation to the actual facts or purpose of the dispute in the main proceedings. It is true that the decision for reference does not indicate with any certainty whether the customs agent, that is to say Nova, made the customs declarations on its own behalf or on behalf of Trespa. The first and third questions referred give rise to uncertainty in that regard, and the opposing arguments put forward by the parties to the main proceedings in their written and oral observations add to that uncertainty. 33 34 35 ",
        "I - 8243 TRESPA INTERNATIONAL It must also be recalled that, in the context of proceedings under Article 234 EC, the Court cannot resolve a dispute concerning the facts. Such a dispute, like any other assessment of the facts involved, is within the province of the national court (see Case C-279/06 CEPSA [2008] ECR I-6681, paragraph 30, and the case-law cited). In the present case, however, the Court has sufficient information to interpret the Community rules concerned and to give useful answers distinguishing, as necessary, the different hypothetical situations. The reference for a preliminary ruling is therefore admissible. Substance The first question By its first question, the national court essentially asks whether Article 291(1) of the implementing regulation is to be interpreted as meaning that the concept of \u2018person importing the goods or having them imported for free circulation\u2019 contained therein refers not only to the importer for whom the goods are destined but also to the customs agent who makes the customs declaration. 36 37 38 39 ",
        "I - 8244 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-248/07 As a preliminary point, it is clear that neither the Customs Code nor the imple- menting regulation defines the concept of \u2018customs agent\u2019. Article 5 of the Customs Code refers to a \u2018customs agent\u2019 as a representative before the customs authorities. In addition, Article 5 of the Customs Code provides that any person may appoint a representative in his dealings with the customs authorities to perform the acts and formalities laid down by customs rules. That representation may be direct or indirect according to whether the representative acts in the name of and on behalf of another person or whether he acts in his own name but on behalf of another person. As has been pointed out in paragraph 35 of this judgment, the Court is not in a pos - ition to determine in what capacity Nova, acting as customs agent, made the customs declarations at issue in the main proceedings. It is for the national court to clarify that fact. Assuming that Nova acted as a representative within the meaning of Article 5 of the Customs Code, it is probable that it made those declarations on behalf of Trespa under the indirect form of representation given that, according to the explanations provided to the Court by Nova and the Belgian Government, Belgian customs legisla- tion does not provide for direct representation. Nevertheless, the possibility cannot be excluded that Nova did not state that it acted on behalf of Trespa or that it was not empowered to represent Trespa. It follows from the second subparagraph of Article 5(4) of the Customs Code that, in such a case, the person who made the customs declarations is deemed to act in his own name and on his own behalf. It is then appropriate to regard that person as an importer and not as a representative. 40 41 42 43 44 ",
        "I - 8245 TRESPA INTERNATIONAL In addition, it must be determined whether, in those two hypothetical situations, a customs agent such as Nova must hold written authorisation within the meaning of Article 291 of the implementing regulation. Although it is true that Part II, Title I, Chapter 2 of the implementing regulation, which governs the admission of goods with favourable tariff treatment by reason of their end-use, does not define the concept of \u2018person importing the goods or having them imported for free circulation\u2019, the fact remains that that legislation places certain obligations on the holder of that authorisation which allow identification of the person referred to in Article 291(1) of that regulation. Thus, the second subparagraph of Article 291(3) of the implementing regulation states that the person concerned is to enable the customs authorities to trace the goods to their satisfaction in the establishment or establishments of the undertaking throughout their processing. It also follows from Article 293 of that regulation that the holder of the authorisation is to be obliged to assign the goods to the prescribed end-use, to keep records enabling the customs authorities to carry out any checks which they consider necessary to ensure that the goods are actually put to the prescribed end-use, and to retain such records. Those obligations show, as the Commission rightly submits, that the person importing the goods or having them imported, that is to say, the person who is required to hold the authorisation referred to in Article 291 of the implementing regulation, is the person for whom the goods are destined and who intends to assign them to the prescribed end-use. Only that person is in a position to fulfil the obliga- tions laid down in Articles 291 and 293 of that regulation. 45 46 47 48 ",
        "I - 8246 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-248/07 The fact that Article 291(1) of the implementing regulation uses as alternatives the expressions \u2018the person importing \u2026 goods\u2019 and \u2018[the person] having them imported\u2019 shows that it is possible to import goods which have a particular end-use through a representative before the customs authorities in accordance with Article 5 of the Customs Code. It follows that the representative who makes customs declarations on behalf of someone else is not the person referred to in Article 291(1) of the implementing regulation and therefore does not have to hold an authorisation within the meaning of that article. It is solely in the hypothetical situation referred to in paragraph 44 of the present judgment, that is to say where a customs agent fails to state that he is acting in the name of or on behalf of another person or states that he is acting in the name of or on behalf of another person without being empowered to do so, that that agent is himself considered the importer and must, consequently, hold written authorisation in order to benefit from favourable tariff treatment for the goods imported. In that regard, it follows from Articles 21 and 86 of the Customs Code that author- isation is to be granted only to persons who offer every guarantee necessary for the proper conduct of the operations. If authorisation is nevertheless granted, but if its holder cannot later prove that the entirety of the goods were put to the prescribed end-use, that holder is obliged, in accordance with Article 302 of the implementing regulation, to pay the amount of import duties established in accordance with the Customs Code. The Court must reject the argument of the Belgian Government that the customs agent must also hold an end-use authorisation when he stores the goods in his own warehouses on behalf of his principal in order to ensure customs supervision. It does not follow from Articles 291 to 304 of the implementing regulation that goods with a 49 50 51 52 53 ",
        "I - 8247 TRESPA INTERNATIONAL specific end-use must remain constantly under customs supervision. However, those goods are entered for free circulation and the customs authorities must be able to carry out checks, either in the importing company\u2019s premises during the processing of those goods or on the basis of the importer\u2019s records, in order to ascertain, a posteriori, that the goods in question have been put to the end-use prescribed. Accordingly, the answer to the first question must be that Article 291(1) of the implementing regulation is to be interpreted as meaning that the concept of \u2018person importing the goods or having them imported for free circulation\u2019 contained therein refers to the person for whom the goods are destined and who intends to assign them to the prescribed end-use, irrespective of whether he makes the customs declar- ation himself or has that done by a representative within the meaning of Article 5 of the Customs Code. That concept does not refer to the representative of that person before the customs authorities, disregarding those cases in which that person is deemed to act in his own name and on his own behalf pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 5(4) of that code and who must therefore be considered an importer. The second question By its second question, the national court essentially asks whether Article 297(1) of the implementing regulation, read in conjunction with Article 1a of that regula- tion, is to be interpreted as meaning that in the case where goods are imported into Belgium and then transported to the Netherlands, there is a transfer of goods within the Community. In addition, it wishes to know whether, in such a case, the person referred to in Article 291 of the implementing regulation must hold the authorisa- tion referred to in that article. 54 55 ",
        "I - 8248 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-248/07 It must be stated at the outset that Articles 291 and 297 of the implementing regula- tion govern different transactions. The first deals with the import of goods benefiting from favourable tariff treatment by reason of their end-use, while the second governs transfer of those goods within the Community which takes place after their import and before they are put to the end-use prescribed. It follows that there is no need for the Court to give consideration to an answer to the second part of the second question since, if there is an import, the answer is already apparent from paragraph 54 of the present judgment. However, if there is a transfer, the person who must hold an authorisation, that is to say, the transferee, is stated in Article 297(1) of the implementing regulation. Article 297 of the implementing regulation provides that where goods are transferred within the Community the transferee must hold an authorisation issued in accord- ance with Article 291 of that regulation. Article 1a of the Regulation provides that, for the purposes of application, inter alia, of Articles 291 to 308 of that regulation, the countries of the Benelux Economic Union are to be regarded as a single Member State. Trespa submits, in its observations to the Court, that there is a transfer within the meaning of Article 297 of the implementing regulation each time there is a transfer of control of the goods imported. However, the Commission takes the view that such a transfer can take place only where there is transfer of ownership of the goods concerned. 56 57 58 59 60 ",
        "I - 8249 TRESPA INTERNATIONAL Nova suggests that there is no transfer within the Community since the Kingdom of Belgium and the Kingdom of the Netherlands must be regarded as a single Member State within the meaning of Article 1a of the implementing regulation. The latter suggestion cannot be accepted. It is clear from the case-law of the Court relating to the interpretation of the provision which preceded Article 297 of the implementing regulation but which used identical terms that transfer of goods within the Community refers to a transfer both between one Member State and another and within the same Member State (see, to that effect, Joined Cases 248/88, 254/88 to 258/88, 309/88 and 316/88 Chimica del Friuli and Others [1989] ECR 2837, opera- tive part). Accordingly, Article 1a of the implementing regulation is irrelevant to the definition of the concept of \u2018transfer\u2019. With regard to the question whether the concept of \u2018transfer\u2019 referred to in Article 297(1) of the implementing regulation concerns transfer of ownership of goods or transfer of control thereof, the answer is not clear from the text of that regulation or from that of the Customs Code. Thus, that concept is listed together with \u2018resale\u2019 and \u2018use\u2019 in Article 29(1)(c) of the Customs Code and mentioned as an alternative to their being \u2018again made available to [their] owner\u2019 in Article 295(1)(2)(c) and (d) of the implementing regulation. Moreover, nor does a comparison of the different language versions of the imple- menting regulation show that the legislature wished to state precisely whether the transfer is of ownership or of control of goods. Thus, that concept is expressed in that regulation, for example, by the word \u2018cesi\u00f3n\u2019 in Spanish, \u2018\u00dcbertragung\u2019 in German, \u2018transfer\u2019 in English, \u2018cessione\u2019 in Italian and \u2018overdracht\u2019 in Dutch. 61 62 63 64 ",
        "I - 8250 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-248/07 In any event, the question whether the transfer is one of ownership or of control is not decisive for the determination of whether there is a transfer within the Commu- nity within the meaning of Article 297(1) of the implementing regulation. However, it is apparent from the purpose of that regulation that what is important is the transfer to the transferee of obligations relating to the goods transferred. In that regard, the transferee must hold an authorisation issued in accordance with Article 291 of that regulation. Thus, Article 298(4) and (5) and the second paragraph of Article 300 of the imple- menting regulation provide that, from the date of transfer of the goods, the obliga- tions which follow from Articles 291 to 304 of the implementing regulation pass from the consignor to the consignee and the latter is required to enter the goods transferred in his records. It follows therefrom that a transfer of goods, within the meaning of Article 297(1) of the implementing regulation, can take place only between persons holding an end-use authorisation, that is to say, persons who intend or intended to assign the goods to the end-use prescribed. In a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, that is to say, where the customs formalities are carried out in Belgium and the goods are subsequently trans- ported to the Netherlands, the view cannot be taken that there has been a transfer of goods within the Community within the meaning of Article 297(1) of the imple- menting regulation in a case where the authorised person acts on behalf of the ul- timate importer, which is for the national court to ascertain. The mere fact that the goods were imported into and cleared through customs in Belgium then transported to the Netherlands is irrelevant to the establishment of the existence of a transfer within the meaning of that provision. 65 66 67 68 ",
        "I - 8251 TRESPA INTERNATIONAL Having regard to the foregoing, the answer to the second question must be that Article 297(1) of the implementing regulation must be interpreted as meaning that there has been no transfer of goods within the Community in a situation where goods are imported into Belgium then transported to the Netherlands, if the person authorised acts on behalf of the ultimate importer, which is for the national court to ascertain. The mere fact that the goods were imported into and cleared through customs in Belgium then transported to the Netherlands is irrelevant to the estab- lishment of the existence of a transfer within the meaning of that provision. Where goods are transferred, the transferee must hold an authorisation issued in accord- ance with Article 291 of that regulation. The third question By its third question, the national court asks whether the term \u2018transferee\u2019 in Article 297(1) of the implementing regulation refers to a customs agent who carries out customs formalities on behalf of the ultimate importer. As the parties to the main proceedings, the Belgian Government and the Commis- sion rightly submit, the answer to this question must be negative. The transferee is the person who acquires from the consignor the right or goods transferred. Thus, the term \u2018transferee\u2019 within the meaning of Article 297(1) of the implementing regulation refers to the person who acquires from the consignor the goods which benefited from favourable tariff treatment, when entered for free circu- lation, by reason of their end-use but have not yet been assigned to that use at the date of transfer. 69 70 71 72 ",

Having regard to the foregoing, the answer to the third question must be that Article 297(1) of the implementing regulation must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of \u2018transferee\u2019 contained therein does not refer to a customs agent who carries out customs formalities on behalf of the importer. Costs Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.

That concept does not refer to the representative of that person before the customs authorities, disregarding those cases in which that person is deemed to act in his own name and on his own behalf pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 5(4) of Regula- tion No 2913/92 and who must therefore be considered an importer. 2.

That article does not specify whether it applies only if the taxable person receiving the supply of services uses those services for the purposes of his economic activity. Thus, unlike other provisions of the Sixth Directive, such as Articles 2(1) and 17(2), Article 9(2)(e) does not indicate that such a condition must be satisfied in order for it to apply. In the absence of any express provision in Article 9(2)(e) of the Sixth Directive that the services supplied must be used for the purposes of the customer\u2019s economic activity, it must be concluded that the fact that the customer uses those services for activities which fall outside the scope of the Sixth Directive does not preclude the appli- cation of that provision.

Pursuant to Paragraph 7 of Chapter 5 of the ML, certain specified services, including consultancy services, supplied from another Member State are regarded as supplied within the country if the purchaser is a trader who has his place of business in Sweden or a fixed establishment for which the service is supplied, or, if the trader does not have such a place of business or fixed establish- ment in Sweden, the place where he has his permanent address or usually resides.

There is no definition in the ML of the term \u2018trader\u2019. Under Paragraph 1 of Chapter 4 of the ML, \u2018professional activity\u2019 is defined as an activity which constitutes economic activity pertaining to business and remuner- ation for transactions undertaken as part of that activity which, in one tax year, exceed SEK 30 000. It is clear from Paragraph 1 of Chapter 13 of the inkomstskattelagen (Law on income tax) that economic activity refers to gainful activity carried out independently in the course of a profession. 5 \u2014 The corresponding parts of Articles 9(2)(e) and 21(1)(b) of the Sixth Directive have been implemented by those provisions. II \u2014 Facts and procedure and the question referred for a preliminary ruling 14. The case in the main proceedings concerns a foundation formed on the basis of collective agreements, the Kollektivavtal- sstiftelsen TRR Trygghetsr\u00e5det (Restart \u2014 the Council for Redundancy Support and Advice) (\u2018TRR\u2019), which was formed in 1994 from the Svenska Arbetsgivaref\u00f6reningen (Confederation of Swedish Enterprise; now Svenskt N\u00e4ringsliv) and the Privattj\u00e4nste- mannakartellen (Federation of Salaried Employees in Industry and Services). 15. According to its statutes, TRR\u2019s aims are, on the one hand, to pay compensation for unemployment and to promote measures to facilitate the transfer to new employment of employees who, for specific reasons, have been made unemployed or who run that risk and, on the other hand, to give advice and assistance to companies in or likely to be in a situation of over-manning and to promote company development in the field of human resources. The conditions for TRR\u2019s activity are regulated in more detail by an existing contract between Svenskt N\u00e4ringsliv and Privattj\u00e4nstemannakartellen, the Omst\u00e4ll- ningsavtal (agreement on transition of employment). 16. The activities are financed through the payment, by employers who are bound by the contract, of a fee corresponding to a propor- tion of the pay of the employees covered by the contract. Employers who are bound by the contract under a \u2018side contract\u2019 pay a fixed yearly fee. In addition to the activity ",
        "I - 8261 KOLLEKTIVAVTALSSTIFTELSEN TRR TRYGGHETSR\u00c5DET carried out under the Omst\u00e4llningsavtal, TRR is registered for VAT in respect of the supply of services in connection with company outsourcing. The activities which are subject to tax are stated to amount to 5% of TRR\u2019s total activity. 17. TRR intends to purchase consultancy services from, inter alia, Denmark, which will be used exclusively in the context of the activity carried out by the foundation on the basis of the Omst\u00e4llningsavtal. In order to clarify the tax consequences of that purchase, TRR sought a preliminary decision from the Skatter\u00e4ttsn\u00e4mnden on whether its activity on the basis of the Omst\u00e4llning- savtal is professional in nature and whether it is a trader for the purposes of Paragraph 7 of Chapter 5 of the ML. 18. The Skatter\u00e4ttsn\u00e4mnden answered the questions by preliminary decision of 3 March 2006, stating: (i) TRR is not to be regarded as providing services as part of a professional activity in respect of the activities under the Omst\u00e4llningsavtal and TRR is to be regarded as a trader for the purposes of Paragraph 7 of Chapter 5 of the ML. 19. The TRR has appealed against the preliminary decision, claiming that the Regeringsr\u00e4tten should amend the prelim- inary decision and declare that TRR is not a trader for the purposes of Paragraph 7 of Chapter 5 of the ML. The Skatteverket (Local Tax Board) contends that the Regering- sr\u00e4tten should confirm the preliminary decision. 20. In support of its action, TRR has submitted, inter alia, that registration for VAT does not of itself mean that the regis- tered party is always to be regarded as a trader for the purposes of Paragraph 7 of Chapter 5 of the ML. When making purchases for activ- ities which fall outside the scope of the Sixth Directive, TRR is not a trader as referred to in that provision. The corresponding provi- sion in the Sixth Directive, Article 9(2)(e), does not refer to a trader but to a taxable person. 21. The Regeringsr\u00e4tten considers that the case before it requires an interpretation of the Community law terms \u2018taxable person\u2019 and \u2018person liable for tax\u2019 where certain provisions of the Sixth Directive and of Directive 2006/112 are to be applied. The referring court notes that the meaning of the term \u2018taxable person\u2019 in the Sixth Directive has been interpreted by the Court in many judgments. However, there is no case-law on how the term is to be understood for the purposes of applying Article 9(2)(e) of that directive in a situation such as that under consideration in the present case. 22.

        "I - 8262 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-291/07 Directive 2006/112 are unclear and since it appears that the issue has not yet been addressed by the Court, the Regeringsr\u00e4tten has decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \u2018Are Articles 9(2)(e) and 21(1)(b) of the Sixth Directive and Articles 56(1)(c) and 196 of [Directive 2006/112] to be interpreted as meaning that a person who purchases consultancy services from a person liable to tax in another [Member State], [where the former] carries out both an economic activity and also an activity which falls outside the scope of the Directives, is to be regarded as a taxable person \u2026 where those articles are applied, even though the purchase was made solely in respect of the latter activity?\u2019 23. Written observations have been submitted by the Skatteverket, by the German, Greek, Italian and Polish Govern- ments and by the Commission. No hearing has been requested by the parties, and none has been held. III \u2014 Assessment A \u2014 Main arguments of the parties 24. TRR has not submitted written observa- tions to the Court. 25. In the Skatteverket\u2019s view, Article 9(2)(e) of the Sixth Directive and Article 56(1) of Directive 2006/112 do not require the customer to be acting as a taxable person when he makes a purchase or to be making the purchase as part of economic activities. Furthermore, it is in keeping with the ob- jective of both directives that, for the purposes of the relevant provisions, it is immaterial whether or not the customer is acting as a taxable person. 26. The Skatteverket contends that, for the application of the relevant provisions, a taxable person must be treated as such, independently of the aim of the purchase of services. Thus, in the case of the services purchased by TRR in circumstances such as those of the main proceedings, the supply must be considered to be carried out in Sweden. TRR is therefore required to declare and pay the VAT to the Swedish exchequer. However, the supply of services unrelated to TRR\u2019s economic activity does not give rise to a right of deduction in respect of the VAT. ",
        "I - 8263 KOLLEKTIVAVTALSSTIFTELSEN TRR TRYGGHETSR\u00c5DET 27. The German, Polish and Greek Govern- ments as well as the Commission, have put forward arguments to the same effect as those of the Skatteverket. In principle, they contend that the relevant provisions are to be interpreted as meaning that a customer making a purchase of consultancy ser - vices from a person liable to tax in another Member State where the former carries out both an economic activity and an activity which falls outside the scope of the Dir - ectives must be regarded as a taxable person, even where that purchase is made solely in respect of the latter activity. 28. However, the Italian Government submits in essence that the relevant provi- sions must be interpreted as meaning that a customer making a purchase of consultancy services from a taxable person established in another Member State where the former carries out both an economic activity and an activity which falls outside the scope of the Directives must be considered as a final consumer of that supply of services where that purchase is made solely in respect of activities falling outside the scope of the Directives. B \u2014 Appraisal 29. By its question, the referring court asks whether the relevant provisions are to be interpreted as meaning that a person who purchases consultancy services from a person liable to tax in another Member State where the former carries out both an economic activity and also an activity which falls outside the scope of the Directives is to be regarded as a taxable person, even where the purchase is made solely in respect of the latter activity. 30. Given the almost identical wording of the relevant provisions of the two Directives and in the interests of clarity, reference will be made here to the Sixth Directive alone. 6 31. Under Article 4(1) of the Sixth Directive, \u2018taxable person\u2019 means any person who inde- pendently carries out one of the economic activities referred to in Article 4(2). \u2018Economic activity\u2019 is defined in Article 4(2) as comprising all activities of producers, traders and persons supplying services. 32. It is settled case-law that Article 4 of the Sixth Directive gives VAT a very wide scope, covering all stages of production, distribution 6 \u2014 In essence, Articles 2(1), 4, 9(2)(e) and 21(1)(b) of the Sixth Directive correspond to Articles 2(1), 9, 56(1)(c) and 196 of Directive 2006/112 respectively. ",
        "I - 8264 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-291/07 and the provision of services. 7 In addition, it is also well established that, in view of the purpose of the Sixth Directive \u2014 which seeks in particular to found a common system of VAT upon a uniform definition of \u2018taxable persons\u2019 \u2014 that status must be assessed solely on the basis of the criteria set forth in Article 4 of that Directive. 8 33. Thus the Court has held that a person who carries out an economic activity for the purposes of Article 4 of the Sixth Directive is a taxable person, even if that economic activity is an ancillary one. 9 A person may be considered a taxable person under Article 4 of the Sixth Directive even where, as in the case of TRR, a predominant part of his activity does not fall within the scope of that directive. 34. The Court noted in Gillan Beach that \u2018Article 9 of the Sixth Directive contains rules for determining the place where ser - vices are deemed to be supplied for tax purposes. Whereas Article 9(1) lays down a general rule on the matter, Article 9(2) sets out a number of specific instances of places where certain services are deemed to be 7 \u2014 See, inter alia, Case C-186/89 Van Tiem [1990] ECR I-4363, paragraph 17; Case C-305/01 MKG\u00adKraftfahrzeuge\u00adFactoring [2003] ECR I-6729, paragraph 42; and Case C-25/03 HE [2005] ECR I-3123, paragraph 40. 8 \u2014 See HE , cited in footnote 7, paragraph 41 and the case-law cited. 9 \u2014 Ibid., paragraph 42. supplied. The object of those provisions is to avoid, first, conflicts of jurisdiction which may result in double taxation, and, secondly, non-taxation.\u2019 10 35. The Court went on to state, in the same judgment, that \u2018[i]t is appropriate also to note that, in respect of the relationship between Article 9(1) and (2) of the Sixth Directive, the Court has held that Article 9(1) in no way takes precedence over Article 9(2). In every situation, the question which arises is whether that situation is covered by one of the instances mentioned in Article 9(2) of that directive. If not, it falls within the scope of Article 9(1).\u2019 11 36. It follows that Article 9(2) of the Sixth Directive, not being an exception to the rule in Article 9(1), is not to be interpreted narrowly. 37. Additionally in Gillan Beach , the Court held that \u2018[i]n interpreting a provision of Community law, it is necessary to consider not only the wording of that provision but also the context in which it occurs and the 10 \u2014 See Case C-114/05 [2006] ECR I-2427, paragraph 14, citing Case 168/84 Berkholz [1985] ECR 2251, paragraph 14; Case C-327/94 Dudda [1996] ECR I-4595, paragraph 20; Case C-167/95 Linthorst, Pouwels en Scheren [1997] ECR I-1195, paragraph 10; and Case C-452/03 RAL (Channel Islands) and Others [2005] ECR I-3947, paragraph 23. 11 \u2014 See Gillan Beach , cited in footnote 10, paragraph 15 and the case-law cited. ",
        "I - 8265 KOLLEKTIVAVTALSSTIFTELSEN TRR TRYGGHETSR\u00c5DET objects of the rules of which it is part\u2019. 12 Thus, according to the Court, it must be borne in mind that Article 9(2) of the Sixth Directive is a rule of conflict which deter- mines the place of taxation of services and, consequently, delimits the powers of the Member States. I note here that it follows that \u2018services of consultants\u2019 is a Community concept which must be interpreted uniformly in order to avoid instances of double taxation or non-taxation. 13 38. It should be noted that Article 9(2)(e) of the Sixth Directive does not specify whether or not a taxable person purchasing services must make that purchase in respect of his economic activity: 14 for that matter, there is nothing in that provision to suggest that such a fact should assume any importance for the purposes of its application. 39. However, as the referring court rightly points out, Article 2(1) of the Sixth Dir - ective explicitly states that VAT is payable on the supply of goods or services effected for consideration within the territory of the country by a taxable person \u2018acting as such\u2019. Furthermore, Article 17(2) of the Sixth Dir - ective clearly provides that the taxable 12 \u2014 Ibid., paragraph 21, citing Case C-17/03 VEMW and Others [2005] ECR I-4983, paragraph 41. 13 \u2014 With reference to \u2018similar activities\u2019, see Gillan Beach , cited in footnote 10, paragraph 20 and the case-law cited. As regards \u2018advertising services\u2019, see Case C-68/92 Commission v France [1993] ECR I-5881, paragraph 14; Case C-73/92 Commission v Spain [1993] ECR I-5997, paragraph 12; and the Opinion of Advocate General Jacobs in Case C-108/00 SPI [2001] ECR I-2361, point 14. 14 \u2014 That is to say, activity subject to tax. person\u2019s right of deduction of input tax is recognised in so far as the goods and ser - vices are used for the purposes of his taxable transactions. 15 40. Nevertheless, while Articles 2(1) and 17(2) of the Sixth Directive specifically refer to the taxable person \u2018acting as such\u2019 or to services being used for the purposes of taxable transactions, Article 9(2)(e) of that directive makes no such specific reference. In my view this is by no means a (legisla- tive) oversight on the part of the Community legislature. Rather, the absence in Article 9(2) of any reference to economic activity, to a taxable person acting as such or to taxable transactions means that, for the purposes of determining the place of supply of ser - vices, the fact that the customer additionally undertakes activities which fall outside the scope of the Sixth Directive is not a bar to the application of that provision. 16 41. Furthermore, the above interpretation of the relevant provisions is in line with the interests of simplicity of administration (of the rules on the place of supply of ser - vices) and ease of collection, as well as the prevention of tax avoidance. 17 Indeed, as 15 \u2014 See Case C-378/02 WZV [2005] ECR I-4685, paragraph 32 and the case-law cited. 16 \u2014 I would add that, as is clear from the above, the purpose of Article 9(2) of the Sixth Directive is different from the aims of Articles 2(1) and 17(2). 17 \u2014 In view of my interpretation of the relevant provisions, in case of doubt with regard to the risk of tax avoidance, I would note that Articles 21 and 22(7) of the Sixth Directive permit the tax authorities of the Member States to take the necessary measures to counter that risk. See, to that effect, Dudda , cited in footnote 10, paragraph 32. ",
        "I - 8266 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-291/07 the Skatteverket correctly points out, if the customer of services supplied were required to be a taxable person acting as such or if the services had to be used for the purposes of his taxable transactions, the determin - ation of the place of supply of services would in many cases be much more difficult, both for companies and for the fiscal authorities of the Member States. 18 42. Moreover, with regard to the practi- cality 19 of such a construction of the relevant provisions, in the case of a person purchasing consultancy services the tax is charged at the stage of that person\u2019s VAT return which he submits to the tax administration in the Member State where he is established. Being a taxable person, he is bound to be regis- tered in that Member State already for the purposes of VAT returns. Moreover, if those services are used in respect of his economic activity, the purchaser may avail himself of his right of deduction of input tax. The supplier of the services, on the other hand, need only demonstrate that the person purchasing them is a taxable person. 20 18 \u2014 I also agree that if, contrary to my interpretation above, the relevant provisions were to be considered as requiring such obligations the interests of simplicity of administration of the rules and ease of collection would be undermined in situations where the purchase of services is made for both categories of activities carried out by TRR. The relevant provisions do not give any guidance in respect of how one would have to proceed with the requisite apportionment. 19 \u2014 This issue is closely linked with the one in the previous paragraph. If the allocation of tax jurisdiction is too imprac- tical, transactions which are otherwise taxable may escape taxation. 20 \u2014 As the Skatteverket rightly points out, such a regime allows a provider of services, such as consultancy services, to avoid having to register for the purposes of VAT in every Member State where his clients are established. 43. Finally, in my view such a reading of the relevant provisions is dictated also by the principle of legal certainty, as the rules on the place of supply of services must be predict- able to traders. This principle applies with particular rigour to rules which have fiscal consequences, so that individuals can iden- tify their obligations under such rules. 21 44. Moreover, that interpretation should be conducive to reducing the burden on traders operating across the internal market. And that, in turn, will help to facilitate the free movement of goods and services, which, as I recall, is one of the general aims of the common system of VAT. 22 45. Before concluding, I would briefly mention that in the light of the above consid- erations it would appear that, in its construc- tion of the relevant provisions, 23 the Italian Government has not taken due account of the purpose of those provisions. 21 \u2014 See, in this respect, the Opinion of Advocate General Fennelly in Dudda , cited in footnote 10, point 32; refer- ring to Case C-30/89 Commission v France [1990] ECR I-691, paragraph 23; and the Opinion of Advocate General Cosmas in Case C-231/94 Faaborg\u00adGelting Linien [1996] ECR I-2395, point 12. 22 \u2014 In the case before the referring court, the relevant facts predate the entry into force of Council Directive 2008/8/EC of 12 February 2008 amending Direct- ive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of services (OJ 2008 L 44, p. 11). Article 2 of Directive 2008/8 provides that, as of 1 January 2010, Article 43 of Directive 2006/112 is to read as follows: \u2018For the purpose of applying the rules concerning the place of supply of services: 1. a taxable person who also carries out activities or transactions that are not considered to be taxable supplies of goods or services in accordance with Article 2(1) shall be regarded as a taxable person in respect of all services rendered to him \u2019 (emphasis added). 23 \u2014 See point 28 of the present Opinion.

Last but not least, turning to Article 21(1)(b) of the Sixth Directive, which also figures in the question referred, suffice it to note that that provision merely states that persons to whom services covered by Article 9(2)(e) of the Sixth Directive are supplied and carried out by a taxable person resident abroad are liable to VAT. Therefore where the conditions laid down in Article 4 of the Sixth Directive as well as other condi- tions under Article 21(1)(b) are met, such a person is accountable for VAT as regards the services which he has purchased, whether or not these are effected solely in respect of the activity which falls outside the scope of the Directives. IV \u2014 Conclusion 47. I am therefore of the opinion that the Court should give the following answer to the question referred by the Regeringsr\u00e4tten: With a view to determining the place of supply of services, Articles 9(2)(e) and 21(1)(b) of the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes \u2014 Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment and Articles 56(1)(c) and 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax are to be interpreted as meaning that a person who purchases consultancy services from a person liable to tax in another Member State, where the former carries out both an economic activity and an activity which falls outside the scope of those two directives, is to be regarded as a taxable person for the purposes of applying those provisions, even where the purchase is made solely in respect of the latter activity.

The rules governing the conduct of TRR\u2019s activities are set out in more detail in an agreement between Svenskt N\u00e4ringsliv and Privattj\u00e4nstemannakartellen, called \u2018the omst\u00e4llningsavtalet\u2019 (\u2018the redeployment agreement\u2019). TRR\u2019s activities are financed through contributions paid by the employers who are party to the omst\u00e4llningsavtalet, which correspond to a percentage of the remuner- ation paid to the employees covered by the omst\u00e4llningsavtalet. Employers who are bound by the omst\u00e4llningsavtalet under a \u2018side agreement\u2019 pay a fixed yearly contri- bution.

The Skatteverket contends that the Regeringsr\u00e4tten should confirm the contested decision. In support of its action, TRR submits, inter alia, that registration as a taxable person for VAT purposes does not of itself mean that the registered party is always to be regarded as a trader for the purposes of Chapter 5, Paragraph 7, of the ML. When making purchases for activities which fall outside the scope of the Sixth Directive, it is not a trader for the purposes of that provision.

The Regeringsr\u00e4tten considers it necessary, for the purposes of applying certain provisions of the Sixth Directive and of Directive 2006/112 in the dispute before it, for the terms \u2018taxable person\u2019 and \u2018person liable for payment of the tax\u2019 to be inter- preted in the light of Community law. The Regeringsr\u00e4tten notes that the Court has interpreted the term \u2018taxable person\u2019, as used in the Sixth Directive, in many judg- ments, but that it has not yet given a ruling as to how that term is to be understood for the purposes of applying Article 9(2)(e) of the Sixth Directive in a specific situ- ation, such as the circumstances of the case before the referring court. 18 19 20 ",
        "I - 8276 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-291/07 On the view that the relevant provisions of the Sixth Directive and of Direct- ive 2006/112 are unclear and that the issue does not yet appear to have been referred to the Court, the Regeringsr\u00e4tten has decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \u2018Are Article 9(2)(e) and [point (1)(b) of Article 21] of the Sixth \u2026 Directive and Articles 56(1)(c) and 196 of [Directive 2006/112] to be interpreted as meaning that a person who acquires consultancy services from a person liable to tax in another [Member State], [in cases where the former] carries out both an economic activity and also an activity which falls outside the scope of the directives, is to be regarded as a taxable person \u2026 where those articles are applied, even though the acquisition was made solely in respect of the latter activity?\u2019 The question referred By its question, the referring court is essentially asking whether Article 9(2)(e) of the Sixth Directive and Article 56(1)(c) of Directive 2006/112 are to be interpreted as meaning that where the customer for consultancy services supplied by a taxable person established in another Member State carries out both an economic activity and an activity which falls outside the scope of those directives, that customer is to be regarded as a taxable person even where the supply is used solely for the purposes of the latter activity. It should be borne in mind that the wording of Article 9(2)(e) of the Sixth Directive is, essentially, identical to that of Article 56(1)(c) of Directive 2006/112. It follows that those two provisions must be interpreted in the same way. 21 22 23 ",
        "I - 8277 KOLLEKTIVAVTALSSTIFTELSEN TRR TRYGGHETSR\u00c5DET It should also be borne in mind that Article 9 of the Sixth Directive contains rules for determining the place where services are deemed to be supplied for VAT purposes. Whereas Article 9(1) lays down a general rule in that regard, Article 9(2) sets out a number of specific instances of places where certain services are deemed to be supplied. The object of those provisions is to avoid, first, conflicts of jurisdiction which may result in double taxation, and, secondly, non-taxation (see Case 168/84 Berkholz [1985] ECR 2251, paragraph 14; Case C-327/94 Dudda [1996] ECR I-4595, paragraph 20; Case C-167/95 Linthorst, Pouwels en Scheres [1997] ECR I-1195, paragraph 10; Case C-452/03 RAL (Channel Islands) and Others [2005] ECR I-3947, paragraph 23; and Case C-114/05 Gillan Beach [2006] ECR I-2427, paragraph 14). It is appropriate also to note that, as regards the relationship between paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 9 of the Sixth Directive, the Court has held that Article 9(1) in no way takes precedence over Article 9(2). In every situation, the question which arises is whether that situation is covered by one of the instances mentioned in Article 9(2) of that directive. If not, it falls within the scope of Article 9(1) ( Dudda , paragraph 21; Linthorst, Pouwels en Scheres , paragraph 11; RAL (Channel Islands) and Others , paragraph 24; and Gillan Beach , paragraph 15). Article 9(2)(e) of the Sixth Directive provides that the place where services of consult- ants and other similar services are supplied for taxable persons who are established in the Community, but not in the same country as the supplier, is the place where the customer has established his business. 24 25 26 ",
        "I - 8278 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-291/07 Although it is true that in the case before the referring court, the customer for the consultancy services is established within the Community but outside the country of the service supplier, the referring court asks nevertheless whether that customer must also be regarded as a taxable person for the purposes of Article 9 of the Sixth Directive where the services concerned are used only for activities which fall outside the scope of the Sixth Directive and that of Directive 2006/112. It should be noted at the outset that Article 9(2)(e) of the Sixth Directive does not specify whether it applies only if the taxable person receiving the supply of services uses those services for the purposes of his economic activity. Thus, unlike other provisions of the Sixth Directive, such as Articles 2(1) and 17(2), Article 9(2)(e) does not indicate that such a condition must be satisfied in order for it to apply. In other words, in the absence of any express provision in Article 9(2)(e) of the Sixth Directive that the services supplied must be used for the purposes of the customer\u2019s economic activity, it must be concluded that the fact that the customer uses those services for activities which fall outside the scope of the Sixth Directive does not preclude the application of that provision. Such an interpretation is consistent with the objective pursued by Article 9 of the Sixth Directive, which \u2014 as was pointed out in paragraph 24 of the present judg- ment \u2014 is to lay down a conflict of laws rule to avoid the risk of double taxation or non-taxation. 27 28 29 30 ",
        "I - 8279 KOLLEKTIVAVTALSSTIFTELSEN TRR TRYGGHETSR\u00c5DET In the same way, as the Advocate General observed in point 41 of his Opinion, that interpretation facilitates the implementation of that conflict of laws rule, in that it serves the interests of simplicity of administration \u2014 of the rules on the place of supply of services \u2014 as regards the rules governing the collection of taxes and the prevention of tax avoidance. The supplier of services need merely establish that the customer is a taxable person in order to ascertain whether the place of supply of ser - vices is in the Member State in which he, the supplier, is established or in the Member State in which the customer\u2019s activities are based. Furthermore, that interpretation is in line with the objectives and operating rules of the Community VAT system since it ensures, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, that the ultimate consumer of the supply of services bears the final cost of the VAT payable. As the Advocate General observed in points 43 and 44 of his Opinion, such an interpretation is also consistent with the principle of legal certainty; furthermore, it enables the burden on traders operating across the internal market to be reduced and facilitates the free movement of services. Finally, it should be noted that point (1)(b) of Article 21 of the Sixth Directive (essen- tially reproduced in Article 196 of Directive 2006/112) provides that VAT is payable by persons to whom services covered by Article 9(2)(e) of the Sixth Directive (essen- tially reproduced in Article 56(1)(c) of Directive 2006/112) are supplied. Accordingly, if the conditions for the application of Article 9(2)(e) of the Sixth Directive are met, the purchaser is liable for VAT on the supply of services which he receives, whether or not they have been supplied for the purposes of activities which fall outside the scope of those directives. 31 32 33 34 ",
        "I - 8280 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-291/07 In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred by the Regeringsr\u00e4tten must be that Article 9(2)(e) of the Sixth Directive and Article 56(1)(c) of Directive 2006/112 must be interpreted as meaning that where the customer for consultancy services supplied by a taxable person established in another Member State carries out both an economic activity and an activity which falls outside the scope of those directives, that customer is to be regarded as a taxable person even where the supply is used solely for the purposes of the latter activity. Costs Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.

First, prior specific examination of each planned discharge liable to contain List II substances is necessary to implement programmes to reduce water pollution estab- lished by the Member States in accordance with Article 6(1) of that directive, under which subjecting all discharges of that nature to prior authorisation constitutes one of the means of implementing those programmes. Such an examination is also necessary to fix in each case of authorised discharge the emission standards determined on the basis of the environmental quality stand- ards included in those programmes and intended to reduce discharges containing one or more List II substances. That exam- ination requires, moreover, an assessment of the actual state of the waters affected which must be taken into account in determining the emission standards. Secondly, tacit authorisation cannot be compatible with the requirement to specify, in the prior author- isation, the emission standards. (see paras 27, 35, operative part) ",

However, the court making the reference states that that scheme, in view of what is regarded as the low-polluting nature of such fish-farm facilities, is based on the objective of simplification of administrative procedures and better allocation of monitoring resources. It states that, under that scheme, the Prefect has the right to object to works, which cannot begin until a period of two months has passed, and where he does not object he may impose technical requirements in order to protect the interests referred to in Article L. 211-1 of the Environmental Code, in particular setting limits on the emissions of pollutants. It takes the view that, in those circum- stances, serious difficulty is raised by the question as to whether Article 6 of Dir - ective 2006/11 may be interpreted as allowing the Member States to introduce such a scheme. Accordingly, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat decided to stay the proceedings in respect of the claims made in the application for annulment directed against Decree No 2006-881 in so far as it makes fish farms subject to a declaratory scheme in connection with water policy, and in respect of the application for annulment of Decree No 2006/942 and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \u2018May Article 6 of Directive 2006/11/EC \u2026 be interpreted as allowing the Member States, once programmes to reduce water pollution including environmental quality standards have been adopted under that article, to introduce a declaratory scheme, in respect of facilities regarded as being low-polluting in nature, subject to a refer- ence to those standards and a right for the administrative authority to object to the commencement of the operations or to impose limits on discharges specific to the facility concerned [?]\u2019 20 21 ",
        "I - 8295 ASSOCIATION NATIONALE POUR LA PROTECTION DES EAUX ET RIVI\u00c8RES The question In order to answer the question referred, it must be pointed out, first, that Direct- ive 2006/11 is not intended to make the commencement of operations liable to discharge dangerous substances into the aquatic environment subject to a particular regime of authorisation or declaration on the basis of the characteristics of those operations. On the other hand, as is apparent in particular from recitals 6 to 8 of that directive, it is intended to eliminate pollution by List I substances of the waters falling within its scope and to reduce pollution of those waters by List II substances, such as ammonia and nitrites. Directive 2006/11 is not therefore designed to oblige Member States to adopt applicable measures specific to certain operations or facil- ities as such, but it requires them to take appropriate measures to eliminate or reduce pollution of waters caused by discharges liable to contain dangerous substances, in accordance with the nature of the latter. Accordingly, in order to reduce pollution of waters by List II substances, Article 6 of Directive 2006/11 provides, inter alia, that the Member States are to establish programmes including environmental quality standards for water, drawn up in compliance with Council directives where they exist. For the implementation of those programmes, Article 6(2) provides that all discharges into the waters referred to in Article 1 of the directive which are liable to contain any such substances require prior authorisation by the competent authority in the Member State concerned, in which emission standards are to be laid down, based on the environmental quality standards. It must be stated, secondly, that Directive 2006/11 does not lay down any exception to the rule in Article 6(2) thereof. Accordingly, for the reasons set out in paragraph 22 of this judgment, that provision does not make a distinction according to the charac- teristics of the facilities from which the discharges come and, in particular, according to whether those facilities are regarded as being high-polluting or low-polluting. 22 23 24 ",
        "I - 8296 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-381/07 Nor does it make a distinction according to the extent of the discharges. A declara- tory scheme such as the one described in the question referred by the national court could therefore be regarded as permitted under Article 6 of Directive 2006/11 only if it required the competent administrative authority to adopt in all cases of discharges a decision capable of being regarded as constituting prior authorisation within the meaning of that article. Not only must the authorisation laid down in Article 6(2) of Directive 2006/11 be prior to any discharge liable to contain any of the List II substances, it must also specify the emission standards, which are based on the environmental quality stand- ards set out in a programme established by the Member State in accordance with Article 6(1) and (3). The Court has, however, held on numerous occasions that it follows from Article 7(2) of Directive 76/464, of which the wording is identical to that of Article 6(2) of Directive 2006/11, that authorisations must contain emission standards which are applicable to authorised individual discharges and which have been calculated in accordance with the quality objectives previously laid down in a programme established pursuant to Article 7(1) to protect the expanses of water and watercourses in question (see, inter alia, Case C-282/02 Commission v Ireland [2005] ECR I-4653, paragraph 68 and the case-law cited). The Court also stated, in connec- tion with Article 7(2), that the quality objectives fixed by those programmes on the basis of analyses of the waters affected serve as the point of reference for calculating the emission standards set in the prior authorisations (see Case C-384/97 Commis\u00ad sion v Greece [2000] ECR I-3823, paragraph 41). It follows that prior authorisation within the meaning of Article 6(2) of Direct- ive 2006/11 means that every request for authorisation for that purpose must be examined individually and cannot be tacit (see, with particular regard to Article 7 of Directive 76/464, Case C-230/00 Commission v Belgium [2001] ECR I-4591, paragraph 16). 25 26 ",
        "I - 8297 ASSOCIATION NATIONALE POUR LA PROTECTION DES EAUX ET RIVI\u00c8RES On the one hand, prior specific examination of each planned discharge liable to contain List II substances is necessary to implement programmes to reduce water pollution established by the Member States in accordance with Article 6(1) of Dir - ective 2006/11, under which subjecting all discharges of that nature to prior author- isation constitutes one of the means of implementing those programmes. Such an examination is also necessary to fix in each case of authorised discharge the emission standards determined on the basis of the environmental quality standards included in those programmes and intended to reduce discharges containing one or more List II substances. That examination requires, moreover, an assessment of the actual state of the waters affected which must be taken into account in determining the emis- sion standards. On the other hand, tacit authorisation cannot be compatible with the requirement to specify, in the prior authorisation, the emission standards calculated on the basis of the procedure described above. In the light of those considerations, a declaratory scheme such as that at issue in the main proceedings, subject to a reference to the environmental quality standards included in the programmes to reduce water pollution and a right for the administra- tive authority to object to the commencement of the operations or to impose limits on discharges specific to the facility concerned, cannot satisfy the requirements referred to above of Article 6 of Directive 2006/11, since it does not guarantee that any discharges liable to contain a List II substance give rise to a specific examination leading to the fixing of emission standards specific to them, calculated on the basis of the applicable environmental quality standards and the actual state of the waters affected. Such a scheme does not therefore require the competent administrative authority to adopt a decision capable of being regarded as constituting prior author- isation within the meaning of Article 6(2) of Directive 2006/11. Furthermore, neither the existence of general rules on the preservation of the quality of surface water and national requirements or requirements specific to certain parts of the territory, such as those laid down in Articles L. 211-2 and L. 211-3 of 27 28 29 ",

Therefore, contrary to the French Government\u2019s assertion, a declaratory scheme such as that at issue in the main proceedings is not governed by provisions which might place it on the same footing in practice as a simplified authorisation scheme satisfying the requirements laid down in Article 6 of Directive 2006/11. It follows from all of the foregoing considerations that, contrary to what the French, Italian and Netherlands Governments maintain in their written or oral observations, a declaratory scheme subject to a right to object, even if it is based on the object- ive of simplification of administrative procedures and better allocation of moni- toring resources, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, cannot be regarded as equivalent to the scheme of prior authorisation provided for in Article 6 of Directive 2006/11. That conclusion cannot be called into question by the argument put forward by the Netherlands Government at the hearing, and supported also by the French Govern- ment, regarding the Framework Directive on water policy. 30 31 32 ",
        "I - 8299 ASSOCIATION NATIONALE POUR LA PROTECTION DES EAUX ET RIVI\u00c8RES It is true that the Member States may already apply, under the transitory provision in Article 22(3)(b) of the Framework Directive on water policy, for the purposes of Article 6 of Directive 2006/11, \u2018the principles for the identification of pollution prob- lems and the substances causing them, the establishment of quality standards, and the adoption of measures, laid down in [the Framework Directive on water policy]\u2019. In particular, as the Commission of the European Communities noted at the hearing, Article 11(3)(g) of the Framework Directive on water policy allows, for point source discharges liable to cause pollution, the adoption, inter alia, of a registration scheme and does not therefore necessarily lay down a prior authorisation scheme. However, that registration scheme is to be understood, even on a transitional basis, only in connection with the implementation of the Framework Directive on water policy. That registration scheme cannot be applied independently of other meas- ures laid down by that directive \u2014 the existence of which in the context of the main proceedings is not apparent from either the decision making the reference or the observations submitted by the French Government \u2014 and presupposes, in particular, as is apparent from Article 11 of that directive, the prior identification of river basin districts, the carrying out of analyses in respect of each of them and the establish- ment of a programme of measures taking into account the results of those analyses as well as the definition of the emission controls for the pollutants concerned. As a result of all of the foregoing, the answer to the question referred must be that Article 6 of Directive 2006/11 cannot be interpreted as allowing the Member States, once programmes to reduce water pollution including environmental quality standards have been adopted under that article, to introduce a declaratory scheme, in respect of facilities regarded as being low-polluting in nature, subject to a refer- ence to those standards and a right for the administrative authority to object to the commencement of the operations or to impose limits on discharges specific to the facility concerned. 33 34 35 ",

Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: Article 6 of Directive 2006/11/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 February 2006 on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community cannot be inter- preted as allowing the Member States, once programmes to reduce water pollu- tion including environmental quality standards have been adopted under that article, to introduce a declaratory scheme, in respect of facilities regarded as being low-polluting in nature, subject to a reference to those standards and a right for the administrative authority to object to the commencement of the operations or to impose limits on discharges specific to the facility concerned.

Community law lays down the limit values for the emissions of particulate matter by diesel vehicles. However, the Nether- lands is planning to authorise only vehicles complying with stricter limits. The measure is intended to help reduce the proportion of particulate matter in the ambient air. In many parts of the country the limit values under Community law for particulate matter in the ambient air are being exceeded. 2. The Netherlands therefore made a request to the Commission pursuant to Article 95(5) of the EC Treaty for an exemption from the rules governing limit values for emissions of particulate matter. However, the Commis- sion declined that request by the contested decision. 2 The Court of First Instance 1 \u2014 Original language: German. 2 \u2014 Decision 2006/372/EC of 3 May 2006 concerning draft national provisions notified by the Kingdom of the Nether- lands under Article 95(5) of the EC Treaty laying down limits on the emissions of particulate matter by diesel-powered vehicles, OJ 2006 L 142, p. 16. dismissed the action brought by the Nether- lands against the Commission decision. 3 3. By the present appeal the Netherlands alleges that the Commission failed to take account of a report submitted in due time containing recent data on air pollution in the Netherlands. In rejecting that submis- sion, the Court of First Instance failed to appreciate the duty of care and the duty to state reasons incumbent on the Commission. Furthermore, the Court of First Instance\u2019s examination of the question whether there is a problem specific to the Netherlands within the meaning of Article 95(5) EC was vitiated by an error in law. II \u2014 Relevant provisions 4. The Court of First Instance gave the following description of the relevant provi- sions in paragraphs 1 to 9: 3 \u2014 Case T-182/06 Netherlands v Commission [2007] ECR II-1983. ",

If, after the adoption by the Council or by the Commission of a harmonisa- tion measure, a Member State deems it necessary to maintain national provi- sions on grounds of major needs referred to in Article 30, or relating to the protec- tion of the environment or the working environment, it shall notify the Commis- sion of these provisions as well as the grounds for maintaining them. 5. Moreover, without prejudice to paragraph 4, if, after the adoption by the Council or by the Commission of a harmonisation measure, a Member State deems it necessary to introduce national provisions based on new scien- tific evidence relating to the protec- tion of the environment or the working environment on grounds of a problem specific to that Member State arising after the adoption of the harmonisation measure, it shall notify the Commission of the envisaged provisions as well as the grounds for introducing them. 6. The Commission shall, within six months of the notifications as referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, approve or reject the national provisions involved after having verified whether or not they are a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States and whether or not they shall constitute an obstacle to the func- tioning of the internal market. In the absence of a decision by the Commission within this period the national provisions referred to in para- graphs 4 and 5 shall be deemed to have been approved. When justified by the complexity of the matter and in the absence of danger for human health, the Commission may notify the Member State concerned that the period referred to in this paragraph may be extended for a further period of up to six months.\u201d 2. Article 7(3) of Council Directive 96/62/EC of 27 September 1996 on ambient air quality assessment and management (OJ 1996 L 296, p. 55) provides that Member States are to draw up action plans indicating the measures to be taken in the short term where there is a risk of the limits and/ or alert thresholds for the levels of ambient air pollutants being exceeded, in order to reduce that risk and to limit the duration of such an occurrence. Such plans may, depending on the individual ",

Under Article 11(1)(a) of Direct- ive 96/62, Member States are, within the nine-month period after the end of each annual reporting period, to inform the Commission of the occurrence of levels of pollution exceeding the limits plus the margin of tolerance. 4. Directive 98/69/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the meas- ures to be taken against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 70/220/EEC (OJ 1998 L 350, p. 1) entered into force on 28 December 1998, the date of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities . 5. That [directive] subjects to a limit on concentrations of particulate mass (\u2018PM\u2019) of 25 mg/km diesel-powered vehicles, first, in Category M (passenger cars), as defined in Annex II, Section A, to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (OJ, English Special Edition, 1970 (I), p. 96) \u2014 except vehicles the maximum mass of which exceeds 2 500 kg \u2014 and, second, in Category N1, Class I (commercial vehicles with a maximum permissible weight of 1 305 kg). 6.

Council Directive 1999/30/EC of 22 April 1999 relating to limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead in ambient air (OJ 1999 L 163, p. 41), lays down, in conjunction with Directive 96/62, limits applicable to, among others, concentrations of PM10 particulate matter in ambient air, which have been mandatory since 1 January 2005. 8 For the purposes of applying Directive 1999/30: \u201c\u2018PM10\u2019 shall mean particulate matter which passes through a size-selective inlet with a 50% efficiency cut-off at 10 \u03bcm aerodynamic diameter\u201d. 9. Article 5 of Directive 1999/30 provides that the Member States are to take the measures necessary to ensure that concentrations of PM 10 in ambient air do not exceed the limits laid down in Section I of Annex III to that directive.\u2019 5. Since then, Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2007 on type approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial ve- hicles (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance informa- tion 4 has been adopted. The Euro 5 emis- sion standard provides for a reduction of the limit value for the particulate mass (PM) concentration to 5 mg/km.

On 2 November 2005 the Netherlands made a request to the Commission for the approval of stricter requirements for emis- sions of particulate matter by certain diesel vehicles than provided for under Community law. The Commission gives the following description of the measures submitted for approval in paragraph 6 of Decision 2006/372/EC: \u2018The Kingdom of the Netherlands has noti- fied the Commission of a draft decree intended to impose a mandatory limit value for the emissions of particulate matter of 5 mg per kilometre on commercial vehicles with a maximum permissible weight of 1 305 kg (N1 vehicles, class I) and passenger cars (M1 vehicles) as defined in Article 1.1(h) and 1.1(at) of the Voertuigreglement . The decree would apply to all such vehicles first used after 31 December 2006, which have a diesel engine. This would imply that these vehicles are fitted with particulate filters.\u2019 8. The subsequent procedure is described in paragraphs 21 to 26 of the judgment under appeal: \u201821. By letter of 23 November 2005, the Commission acknowledged receipt of the Netherlands Government\u2019s notifica- tion and informed it that the period of six months imposed upon it by Article 95(6) EC to make a decision on requests for derogation commenced on 5 November 2005, the day after the notification was received. 22. The report on the air quality assess- ment in the Netherlands for the year 2004, established pursuant to Direct- ive 96/62, was sent to the Commission on 8 February 2006 and registered by it on 10 February 2006. ",
        "I - 8309 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION 23. By letter of 10 March 2006, the Nether- lands authorities informed the Commis- sion of the existence of a report estab- lished in March 2006 by the Milieu- en Natuurplanbureau (Netherlands Envir- onmental Assessment Agency\u2026), en- titled \u201cNieuwe inzichten in de omvang van de fijnstofproblematiek\u201d (New infor- mation on the extent of the problem of particulate matter). 24. In order to evaluate the soundness of the arguments advanced by the Netherlands authorities, the Commission asked for the scientific and technical opinion of a team of consultants coordinated by the Nederlandse Organisatie voor toegepast- natuur-wetenschappelijk onderzoek (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research\u2026). 25. That organisation submitted its report to the Commission on 27 March 2006. 26. By Decision 2006/372/EC\u2026, the Commission rejected the draft decree notified, on the ground that \u201cthe Kingdom of the Netherlands [had] failed to prove the existence of a specific problem with regard to Directive 98/69\u201d and that \u201cthe notified measure [was] not proportionate to the objectives pursued\u201d.\u2019 IV \u2014 Proceedings at first instance and forms of order sought 9. On 12 July 2006 the Netherlands brought an action for the annulment of Decision 2006/372 before the Court of First Instance. 10. According to paragraph 33 of the judg- ment under appeal, the Netherlands Govern- ment pleaded that the decision contravened the basic rules of Article 95 EC and the duty to state reasons under Article 253 EC, first , because it dismissed the existence of a problem specific to the Netherlands which arose after the adoption of Directive 98/69, in particular without having examined the rele- vant information submitted by the Member State concerned and, secondly , because it found that the draft decree notified was not proportionate to the objectives pursued by the Kingdom of the Netherlands. 11. The Court of First Instance ruled on the action, following an expedited procedure, by judgment of 27 June 2007. It examined only the first plea in law, namely whether account was taken of the information submitted by ",
        "I - 8310 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-405/07 P the Netherlands and whether a problem specific to the Netherlands was proven. On both points it rejected the submissions made by the Netherlands Government. 12. The Netherlands brought the present appeal against that judgment. The Nether- lands Government objects to both parts of the examination at first instance and claims that the Court should: \u2014 set aside the judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for judgment on the other pleas in law, and \u2014 order the other party to pay the costs. 13. The Commission contends that the Court should: \u2014 declare the appeal inadmissible or, in the alternative, dismiss the appeal, and \u2014 order the appellant to pay the costs. 14. Each party submitted a written pleading. No hearing took place. V \u2014 Legal assessment 15. The Netherlands and the Commission are in dispute as to whether it is compatible with Community law to lay down stricter limit values for emissions of particulate matter by motor vehicles in the Netherlands than are provided for in Directive 98/69. 16. The Netherlands may introduce national provisions which derogate from Directive 98/69 only after the Commis- sion has approved them. This follows from Article 95(5) and (6) EC, as the Netherlands provisions would derogate subsequently from a measure based on Article 100a of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 95 EC). 17. Under Article 95(5) EC, the Member State in question must notify the Commis- sion of the grounds for introducing the ",
        "I - 8311 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION contested domestic provisions. 6 It is there- fore for the Member State to prove the exist- ence of those grounds. 7 18. First of all, the Member State must show that the introduction of national provisions derogating from a harmonisation measure is based on new scientific evidence relating to the protection of the environment or the working environment. It must also prove that it is based on a specific problem arising after the adoption of the harmonisation measure. 8 19. Once that proof has been provided, the Commission must verify, pursuant to Article 95(6) EC, whether the proposed national provisions are a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States and whether they constitute an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market. 20. The present appeal concerns exclu- sively the application of Article 95(5) EC. In this respect the Commission found that the 6 \u2014 Case C-512/99 Germany v Commission [2003] ECR I-845, paragraph 80 et seq. 7 \u2014 With regard to Article 95(4) EC, see Case C-3/00 Denmark v Commission [2003] ECR I-2643, paragraph 84. 8 \u2014 Case C-512/99 Germany v Commission (cited in footnote 6, paragraph 80) and Joined Cases C-439/05 P and C-454/05 P Land Ober\u00f6sterreich v Commission [2007] ECR I-7141, paragraph 57. Netherlands had submitted new scientific evidence, 9 but that there was no problem specific to the Netherlands. The Court of First Instance rejected the objections raised by the Netherlands in this regard and confirmed that finding. 21. With its ground of appeal the Nether- lands Government alleges, first of all, that the Court of First Instance wrongly considered that the Commission had taken account of a report submitted by it (see under A) and, secondly, objects that the Court of First Instance held that the Commission\u2019s verifica- tion whether there was a problem specific to the Netherlands was sufficient (see under B). 22. Since both grounds of appeal highlight errors in law in the grounds of the judgment under appeal, I will then examine whether the operative part appears well founded on other legal grounds (see under C). In that case the appeal would also have to be dismissed. 10 9 \u2014 See paragraphs 25 to 32 of the contested decision. 10 \u2014 Case C-30/91 P Lestelle v Commission [1992] ECR I-3755, paragraph 28; Case C-210/98 P Salzgitter v Commission [2000] ECR I-5843, paragraph 58; and Case C-167/04 P JCB Service v Commission [2006] ECR I-8935, paragraph 186.

This ground of appeal claims that in the contested decision the Commission falsely stated that the report on ambient air quality in the Netherlands in 2004 had not yet been submitted. 1. The different reports 24. Under Article 11(1)(a)(i) of Direct- ive 96/62, the Member States must submit to the Commission each year a report on ambient air quality which describes the zones and agglomerations where the levels of one or more pollutants exceed the limit value plus the margin of tolerance. 25. In paragraph 41 of the contested deci- sion, the Commission found that the Neth- erlands had not submitted official data yet for 2004. However, it is common ground that that finding is incorrect. In paragraph 22 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance states that that report was sent to the Commission on 8 February 2006 and registered by it on 10 February 2006. The contested decision was not adopted until three months later. 26. A distinction must be drawn in particular between that report on ambient air quality for 2004 and two other reports. 27. First, in March 2006 the Netherlands submitted a report produced by the Neth- erlands environment agency, 11 the \u2018MNP report\u2019. In paragraph 41 of the contested decision, the Commission found that this report indicated that the levels of particles were 10-15% lower than previously assumed. In addition, according to the report, the number of areas where the limit values are exceeded would be halved in 2010 in compari- son with 2005 and in 2015 in comparison with 2010. 28. Second, the Commission commissioned a team of consultants coordinated by the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scien- tific Research 12 to study the request made 11 \u2014 Milieu- en Natuurplanbureau (MNP). 12 \u2014 Nederlandse Organisatie voor toegepast-natuurweten- schappelijk onderzoek (TNO). ",
        "I - 8313 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION by the Netherlands. The results of that study were set out in the \u2018TNO report\u2019 of 27 March 2006. The Commission essentially relied on that report when it adopted the contested decision. 29. The TNO report shows that the Commis- sion experts at least were aware of the most recent data regarding ambient air quality in the Netherlands in 2004. The Court of First Instance thus cites the following extract from that report in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal: \u2018[a] preliminary submission by [the Kingdom of] the Netherlands on [excesses] in 2004 gives a picture that is different from 2003: in all zones, at least one of the [limits plus the margin of tolerance] for PM10 is exceeded.\u2019 2. Legal assessment of the ground of appeal 30. With this ground of appeal, the Neth- erlands Government alleges that the Court of First Instance committed an error in law in applying the duty of care and the duty to state reasons incumbent on the Commission. Admissibility 31. The Commission considers that argu- ment to be inadmissible. First of all, the Netherlands had forfeited its right to lodge complaints in relation to the report for 2004 because it had made them only after a considerable delay. Furthermore, with this ground of appeal the Netherlands only calls into question factual findings made by the Court of First Instance. 32. The first plea raised by the Commission against the admissibility of this ground of appeal must be rejected because it is wholly unfounded, at least in the present case. The question whether the Commission must take into consideration a submission made out of time by a Member State in an administrative procedure is in principle a question of the merits of an action. 33. Only under extraordinary circum- stances may the prohibition of the abuse of rights be an obstacle to the admissibility of ",
        "I - 8314 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-405/07 P an action or certain pleas. For that to occur the Member State would, for example, have to have created the legitimate expect- ation in the Commission that it would not submit any further information or at least would not under any circumstances bring an action with regard to the consideration of specific documents. The Commission does not submit any evidence to suggest such an extraordinary case exists, in particular any legitimate expectation, nor are such circum- stances apparent. 34. Moreover, this plea could possibly be raised against the admissibility of the action at first instance, but not against the admis- sibility of the appeal. However, the Commis- sion does not argue that the Court of First Instance was wrong to admit the action brought by the Netherlands in this regard. 35. On the other hand, the second plea raised by the Commission against the admis- sibility of this ground of appeal is based on a recognised principle of the law governing appeals. It is clear from Article 225 EC and Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice that an appeal lies on points of law only. The Court of First Instance thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of those facts and the assessment of that evidence thus does not, save where they distort the evidence, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal. 13 36. Nevertheless, contrary to the view taken by the Commission, the complaint made by the Netherlands Government does not relate to the factual findings made by the Court of First Instance. Those findings are undis- puted. The question is whether the Court of First Instance correctly inferred from those facts that the Commission infringed neither its duty of care nor its duty to state reasons. That is a point of law. This plea raised by the Commission must therefore also be rejected. 13 \u2014 Case C-390/95 P Antillean Rice Mills and Others v Commis\u00ad sion [1999] ECR I-769, paragraph 29; Case C-237/98 P Dorsch Consult [2000] ECR I-4549, paragraph 35 et seq.; Joined Cases C-204/00 P, C-205/00 P, C-211/00 P, C-213/00 P, C-217/00 P and C-219/00 P Aalborg Portland and Others v Commission [2004] ECR I-123, paragraph 49; and Joined Cases C-442/03 P and C-471/03 P P&O Euro\u00ad pean Ferries (Vizcaya) v Commission and Diputaci\u00f3n Foral de Vizcaya v Commission [2006] ECR I-4845, paragraph 60.

The duty of care and the duty to state reasons incumbent on the Commission must be seen against the background of the powers which it has exercised in the present case. Because under Article 95(5) and (6) EC the Commission must undertake complex tech- nical assessments, it must be recognised as enjoying a broad discretion. 14 39. However, where review by the Court is restricted as a result of the Commission\u2019s wide power of appraisal, respect for the rights guaranteed by the Community legal order in administrative procedures is of particularly fundamental importance. Those guarantees include in particular the duty of the competent institution to examine care- fully and impartially all the relevant aspects of the individual case and to give adequate 14 \u2014 See Case C-326/05 P Industrias Qu\u00edmicas del Vall\u00e9s v Commission [2007] ECR I-6557, paragraph 75, and Case C-127/95 Norbrook Laboratories [1998] ECR I-1531, paragraph 90. reasons for its decisions. 15 The review by the Community judicature must therefore also extend to whether the evidence on which the decision is based contains all the information which must be taken into account in order to assess a complex situation and whether it is capable of substantiating the conclusions drawn from it. 16 40. It must therefore be examined, first of all, whether the report for 2004 contained relevant data. In this respect, the TNO report states that the recent data would give a picture that is different from the earlier data. A different situation as regards data is inev- itably of importance in assessing the situation in the Netherlands. Those more recent data were therefore relevant. 41. However, the date when those data were transmitted raises the question whether the Commission was permitted not to take them into account when it took the decision on the request by the Netherlands. 15 \u2014 Case C-269/90 Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen [1991] ECR I-5469, paragraph 14; Joined Cases C-258/90 and C-259/90 Pesquerias De Bermeo and Naviera Laida v Commis\u00ad sion [1992] ECR I-2901, paragraph 26; and Case T-374/04 Germany v Commission [2007] ECR II-4431, paragraph 81. 16 \u2014 Case C-12/03 P Commission v Tetra Laval [2005] ECR I-987, paragraph 39; Case C-326/05 P Industrias Qu\u00edmicas del Vall\u00e9s v Commission (cited in footnote 14, para- graph 77); and Case C-525/04 P Spain v Lenzing [2007] ECR I-9947, paragraph 57.

Under Article 11(1)(b) of Directive 96/62, the Netherlands should have forwarded that report on 1 October 2005, one month prior to its request under Article 95(5) EC. Yet it submitted it five months late. Nevertheless, the time-limits under Directive 96/62 are not related to the procedure under Article 95(6) EC. Failure to observe those time-limits therefore has no importance in terms of the derogation procedure. 43. Article 95 EC does not contain any express provision on the date on which docu- ments in support of a request for deroga- tion must be submitted. The Court of Justice takes the view that the Member State must in principle put forward its arguments with its request, 17 but it also permits the documents submitted to be supplemented. 18 44. Furthermore, taking account of infor- mation submitted subsequently is consistent with fundamental principles of Commu- nity environmental and administrative law. Under the first indent of Article 174(3) EC, in preparing its policy on the environment, 17 \u2014 Case C-3/00 Denmark v Commission (cited in footnote 7, paragraph 48) and Joined Cases C-439/05 P and C-454/05 P Land Ober\u00f6sterreich v Commission (cited in footnote 8, paragraph 38). 18 \u2014 Case C-512/99 Germany v Commission (cited in footnote 6, paragraph 62). the Community must take account, in particular, of available scientific and tech- nical data. 19 Taking account of more recent data is also the basis for the procedure under Article 95(5) and (6) EC. 20 Under the rules on administrative procedure, the validity of a measure must be assessed on the basis of the information which is available when the deci- sion is taken. 21 45. On the basis of these requirements, the Commission expressly took account of the \u2018MNP report\u2019. It received it even later than the report on ambient air quality in the Neth- erlands in 2004. At the same time, the fact that the MNP report supports the Commis- sion\u2019s position shows the handling of the report for 2004 in a particularly unfavourable light. 19 \u2014 Case C-341/95 Bettati [1998] ECR I-4355, paragraph 49 et seq.

Nevertheless, failure to take account of data submitted belatedly might be justified exceptionally in an individual case on the basis of the strict time-limits provided for in the procedure under Article 95(6) EC, 22 for example where it would no longer be possible to conduct a verification within the time-limits. If the Commission were to refuse to take account of information submitted be- latedly, however, that decision would have to be subject to judicial review. As a result, the Commission should have justified its reasons for not taking account of the report for 2004. However, that did not happen in this case. 47. The report on ambient air quality in the Netherlands in 2004 should therefore have been taken into account in taking the deci- sion on the request for derogation. 48. However, it is not clear from the contested decision that those data were taken into account. Rather, the Commission stated in paragraph 41 that the report had not been submitted. 49. In contrast, in paragraphs 43 and 44 of the judgment under appeal the Court of First Instance found that the Commission\u2019s experts took account of those figures in the 22 \u2014 See Case C-3/00 Denmark v Commission (cited in foot- note 7, paragraph 48) and Joined Cases C-439/05 P and C-454/05 P Land Ober\u00f6sterreich v Commission (cited in footnote 8, paragraph 39). TNO report and the Commission based its findings on that report. The Court of First Instance also refers to the assessment of the subsequently submitted MNP report. In paragraph 47 the Court of First Instance concludes that the Commission cannot be accused of having failed to verify recent information sent to it by the Netherlands Government prior to the adoption of the decision. 50. The TNO report does indeed show that the Commission must have been aware of the figures for 2004 and that account was taken of those figures in the procedure, indirectly through the TNO report. 51. It is not sufficient, however, for the Commission to take account of relevant information in some form or another. Rather it must duly take such information into account. 23 52. It is nevertheless not evident from the Commission\u2019s decision what importance it attaches to the limit values being exceeded throughout the Netherlands. Whilst the TNO report to which reference is made does contain some explanations of this situation, it is not clear from them whether or not there is a problem specific to the Netherlands in this regard. 23 \u2014 Case C-3/00 Denmark v Commission (cited in footnote 7, paragraph 114). ",
        "I - 8318 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-405/07 P 53. Only the Court of First Instance addresses this point in paragraphs 109 and 110 of the judgment under appeal. It points out that in 2004 four other Member States exceeded the limit values in all their areas and that ambient air quality in the Netherlands had even seen an amelioration in absolute terms as against the previous year. 54. However, those findings made by the Court of First Instance cannot rectify the deficiencies in the contested decision. Rather, the obligation to state reasons for a measure must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the insti- tution which adopted the measure in ques- tion in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for the measure and to enable the competent court to exercise its power of review. 24 Failure to state adequate reasons cannot therefore be rectified subsequently in judicial proceed- ings, not even by the Community judicature. 55. In so far as the Court of First Instance itself compares the Netherlands with other Member States, it exceeds its powers and takes the place of the Commission. 25 The Commission should have made the 24 \u2014 Case 1/69 Italy v Commission [1969] ECR 277, paragraph 9; Case C-310/99 Italy v Commission [2002] ECR I-2289, para- graph 48; Case C-66/02 Italy v Commission [2005] ECR I-10901, paragraph 26; and Joined Cases C-182/03 and C-217/03 Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission [2006] ECR I-5479, paragraph 137. 25 \u2014 See Case T-374/04 Germany v Commission (cited in foot- note 15, paragraph 81). comparison itself in the contested deci- sion or at least referred to a relevant report. The comments made by the Court of First Instance regarding the comparison with other Member States are therefore irrelevant. 56. The Court of First Instance\u2019s finding that the Commission did take account of the Netherlands report for 2004 therefore constitutes an error in law, as the Commis- sion did not duly take account of that report. However, it is possible to assess definitively whether an error in law results in, or is a factor in, the setting aside of the judgment under appeal only after considering the second ground of appeal. B \u2014 The second ground of appeal \u2014 non\u00adexistence of a problem specific to the Netherlands 57. The second ground of appeal concerns the question whether there is a problem specific to the Netherlands. The Netherlands contests two lines of argument pursued in the judgment at first instance. ",
        "I - 8319 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION 58. First of all, the Court of First Instance declined to take into account the special causes of the limit values being exceeded in the Netherlands, because Directive 1999/30 makes no mention of them. Those causes are the influence of cross-frontier emissions of particulate matter, demographic density, road traffic, and the level of residential devel- opment along roads. 59. Secondly, whilst the Court of First Instance recognised that the problem does not have to be unique, in practice it never- theless required a difference from all other Member States, that is to say a unique problem. 60. The judgment of the Court of First Instance is formulated in such a way that both lines of argument run in parallel and form the basis for the decision irrespective of one another. The Netherlands must there- fore prevail with both limbs of that ground of appeal in order for the judgment to be set aside. 1. The criteria under Directive 1999/30 61. In paragraphs 92 and 115, the Court of First Instance declined to take account of cross-frontier emissions of particulate matter, demographic density, the intensity of the road traffic in many areas of the Neth- erlands and the location of the population along the road traffic routes. These were not criteria referred to in Directive 1999/30. 62. Since Directive 1999/30 only lays down limit values, this view could therefore mean that only the extent to which the limit values are exceeded can be a suitable criterion for the existence of a specific problem. However, the Court of First Instance does not explain why it takes the view that the causes of the limit values being exceeded should be mentioned in Directive 1999/30. 63. The Netherlands rejects this view taken by the Court of First Instance. The Commis- sion does not contest the appeal in this regard, but stresses the alternative reasoning in the judgment under appeal, based on insufficient differences from other Member States. Furthermore, the Commission refers to Article 8(6) of Directive 96/62, under ",
        "I - 8320 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-405/07 P which Member States must consult with one another when limit values are exceeded in one Member State as a result of emissions in another Member State. However, the Nether- lands did not initiate any such consultations. 64. Directive 96/62 is crucial for assessing the arguments put forward by the Court of First Instance concerning the criteria not mentioned in Directive 1999/30. Direct- ive 1999/30 cannot be applied in isolation, but only together with Directive 96/62. Thus, provision is made for the adoption of Directive 1999/30 in Article 4 and Annex I of Directive 96/62. Moreover, the meas- ures which the Member States are required to take in particular, but not only where the limit values in relation to ambient air quality are exceeded, are laid down not in Dir - ective 1999/30, but in Directive 96/62. 65. There is nothing in either of the direct- ives to suggest that they aim to lay down rules to determine which causes of air pollu- tion could establish a specific problem. They are formulated in relatively general terms in order to be able to accommodate the differ- ences between the various Member States. They therefore stipulate only monitoring of ambient air quality, the aim to be achieved, namely the limit values, and the development of programmes to achieve that aim, without requiring specific measures to reduce emis- sions. Moreover, according to the fourth recital in the preamble to Directive 1999/30, the limit values for pollution of ambient air are minimum requirements which apply generally in all the Member States. Stricter rules are possible. 26 66. Furthermore, a joint analysis of Direct- ive 1999/30 and Directive 96/62 shows that the criteria rejected by the Court of First Instance are entirely relevant in assessing ambient air quality. 67. Article 8 and Annex IV of Direct- ive 96/62 lay down in particular which infor- mation the Member States must collect and communicate to the Commission where levels are higher than the limit values. Under point 5 of Annex IV, the origin of the pollu- tion is to be identified, in particular the main emission sources and pollution imported from other regions. The analysis of the situ- ation provided for in point 6 is to include details of those factors responsible for the excess, in particular transport, including cross-border transport, and formation. 26 \u2014 See also Case C-320/03 Commission v Austria [2005] ECR I-9871, paragraph 80. ",
        "I - 8321 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION 68. Article 8(6) of Directive 96/62 stresses in this connection, contrary to paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that cross- frontier emissions of particulate matter are indeed an important criterion under Community law for assessing ambient air quality, as was argued by the Netherlands. 69. Contrary to the findings of the Court of First Instance in paragraph 115 of the judg- ment under appeal, the intensity of road traffic cannot be ignored either. Although it is not emphasised in the same way as cross- frontier pollution, it is nevertheless also a cause which must be taken into account under Article 8 of Directive 96/62. 70. Lastly, under the first indent of Annex II to Directive 96/62, the degree of exposure of sectors of the population is a factor which may be taken into account when setting the Community limit values. That factor is there- fore also a suitable criterion for assessing the severity of the exceeding of limit values in certain Member States. Because demo- graphic density, the intensity of the road traffic in many areas of the Netherlands and the location of the population along the road traffic routes are relevant to the exposure of sectors of the population, paragraph 115 of the judgment under appeal is also viti- ated by an error in law in so far as the Court of First Instance rejected these factors on the ground that they are not mentioned in Directive 1999/30. 71. Accordingly, in paragraphs 92 and 115, the Court of First Instance wrongly declined, with reference to Directive 1999/30, to take account of cross-frontier pollution, demo- graphic density, the intensity of the road traffic in many areas of the Netherlands and the location of the population along the road traffic routes. 2. Non-existence of a specific problem 72. It is thus necessary to consider the second line of argument developed by the Court of First Instance, which concerns the non-existence of a problem specific to the Netherlands. 73. On the one hand, the Court of First Instance states in paragraph 63 of the judg- ment under appeal that \u2018any problem which arises in terms which are on the whole comparable throughout the Member States and which lends itself, therefore, to har - monised solutions at Community level\u2026 is, consequently, not specific within the meaning of Article 95(5) EC.\u2019 74. The Court of First Instance also concurs with the Netherlands Government in para- graph 65 of the judgment under appeal that ",
        "I - 8322 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-405/07 P \u2018for a problem to be specific to a Member State within the meaning of the relevant provision, it is not necessary that it is the result of an environmental danger within that State alone.\u2019 75. With this ground of appeal, however, the Netherlands objects that, in contradic- tion with the abovementioned arguments, in paragraphs 53 and 106 the Court of First Instance required differences from the other Member States in order for a specific problem to exist. The individual arguments in favour of a specific problem were therefore rejected by the Court on the ground that the situation is similar in other Member States. 76. Paragraph 53 of the judgment under appeal states that approval of the Nether- lands measures requires that the excesses observed in the Netherlands \u2018were so acute as to distinguish them significantly from those observed in other Member States\u2019. According to paragraph 106 the Member State in ques- tion must establish that it faces particular problems \u2018which differentiate it from the other Member States\u2019. In those paragraphs the Court of First Instance therefore requires a difference from all the other Member States. 77. Paragraphs 63 and 65 of the judgment under appeal, on the one hand, and para- graphs 53 and 106, on the other, are therefore contradictory. Despite that contradiction, however, it is clear that the Court of First Instance based the judgment under appeal only on the argument made in paragraphs 53 and 106, that the Netherlands had not estab- lished any difference from all the other Member States. The Court of First Instance does not examine whether the number of Member States faced with similar problems is too large to recognise a problem specific to the Netherlands. It merely mentions ex- amples of similarly affected Member States. 78. However, this view taken by the Court of First Instance contains an error in law. According to the judgment in Land Ober\u00f6s\u00ad terreich v Commission , a specific problem within the meaning of Article 95(5) EC is not limited to \u2018unique problems\u2019. 27 Rather, the Court of First Instance and the Commis- sion correctly interpreted \u2018specific\u2019 in Land Ober\u00f6sterreich as meaning \u2018unusual\u2019. 28 79. The findings made by the Court of First Instance regarding a comparison of the Member States do not therefore form an appropriate basis for the judgment under appeal. 27 \u2014 Cited in footnote 8, paragraph 65. 28 \u2014 Cited in footnote 8, paragraph 66 et seq. ",
        "I - 8323 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION C \u2014 The possibility of other grounds for the judgment under appeal 80. Whilst the judgment under appeal does contain errors in law, the ground of appeal would also have to be dismissed if the op- erative part is well founded on other legal grounds. 29 It must therefore be examined whether the Commission rightly found that there was no problem specific to the Nether- lands within the meaning of the judgment in Land Ober\u00f6sterreich , i.e. a problem which is not unusual, but is general in nature. 81. The problem in the Netherlands is that the proportion of PM10 in the ambient air exceeds the limit values laid down in Directive 96/62 in conjunction with Directive 1999/30. 82. The Court of First Instance and the Commission apply the existing case-law in examining whether that problem is specific, comparing the situation in different Member States. In the present case, however, a conflict of objectives between provisions of Community law in itself substantiates the existence of a specific problem (see below under 1). The substantiation of the existence of a specific problem through a comparison with other Member States will therefore be 29 \u2014 See the reference in footnote 10. examined only in the alternative (see below under 2). 1. Existence of a specific problem substanti- ated by the conflict of objectives of rules of Community law 83. In the present case, the problem which the Netherlands seeks to counter by securing a derogation from Directive 98/69 lies in the requirements of other provisions of Community law: the ambient air in the Neth- erlands does not achieve the state stipu- lated in Directive 96/62 in conjunction with Directive 1999/30. 84. This may not actually be unusual and may also apply to other Member States. Nevertheless, the stipulations of Commu- nity law regarding ambient air quality describe the desired state of ambient air throughout the Community. The infringe- ment of that quality standard cannot there- fore be regarded as \u2018usual\u2019 in a legal sense. Compliance with Community law, and not its infringement, is the basic normative rule. The infringement of the standard is therefore to be regarded as specific within the meaning of Article 95(5) EC. ",
        "I - 8324 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-405/07 P 2. The comparison with other Member States 85. In the event that the Court of Justice does not concur with or follow my view because the parties have not yet commented on it, I will examine below whether there is a problem specific to the Netherlands on the basis of a comparison with other Member States. 86. As regards the judicial review criterion, as has been stated, the Commission must be recognised as enjoying a broad discretion in so far as a comparison of the situation in different Member States requires complex technical assessments. In return, it must examine carefully and impartially all the relevant aspects of the individual case and give adequate reasons for its decisions. The review by the Community judicature must therefore also extend to whether the evidence on which the decision is based contains all the information which must be taken into account in order to assess a complex situ- ation and whether it is capable of substanti- ating the conclusions drawn from it. 30 30 \u2014 See above, point 38 et seq. 87. It should also be borne in mind that the burden of proof of the existence of a specific problem lies with the Member State making the request, in this case the Netherlands. 31 The Commission does not therefore have to prove that there is no specific problem. However, if it does not recognise any specific problem, it must explain in detail why it rejects the relevant submissions made by the Member State. 88. As has already been stated, contrary to the judgment under appeal, in the present case account must be taken in particular of cross-frontier pollution, demographic density, the intensity of the road traffic in many areas of the Netherlands and the loca- tion of the population along the road traffic routes, as well as the report on ambient air quality in 2004. 89. In paragraphs 41 to 43 of the contested decision, the Commission essentially relies on two arguments. First of all, particulate matter emissions in the Netherlands are in general no higher than in seven other Member States. Secondly, the existence of a problem with regard to Directive 98/69 is doubtful because the particular particulate 31 \u2014 See above, point 17 et seq. ",
        "I - 8325 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION matter emissions in the Netherlands are not based on emissions from the vehicles regis- tered there. 90. The first argument is convincing in prin- ciple if it is assumed \u2014 contrary to the view taken here \u2014 that exceeding the Commu- nity limit values under these circumstances does not substantiate the existence of any specific problem. However, the argument does not hold in the present case because the Commission did not consider the particulate matter emissions, as referred to in the report on the Netherlands for 2004. 91. The second argument put forward by the Commission, the absence of a specific problem with regard to diesel vehicles, is capable of refuting some of the Netherlands\u2019 arguments in the request for derogation. As is now no longer disputed by the Nether- lands, fewer diesel vehicles are authorised there than in most other Member States. 92. However, this does not mean that there are no problems specific to the Netherlands in respect of the other abovementioned points. It is irrelevant, in terms of the verifi- cation of the specific problem, whether these potential problems justify measures in rela- tion to diesel vehicles. This should instead be examined in the subsequent verification under Article 95(6) EC. 93. As regards the other relevant submis- sions made by the Netherlands, the Commis- sion acknowledges in paragraph 40 of the contested decision that the percentage contribution of transboundary transport of particulate matter in the Netherlands is high. It states, however, that that percentage is no higher than in other Benelux countries. 94. I do not find that argument convincing, however, since a specific problem does not need to be exclusive in nature. The fact that the Benelux countries suffer particularly from cross-frontier particulate matter emis- sions on account of their central location and their small size is a problem peculiar to them, which certainly may be regarded as specific. ",
        "I - 8326 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-405/07 P 95. In paragraph 40 of the contested deci- sion the Commission also confirms the considerable indirect influence of the port of Rotterdam on particulate matter emissions, although it does not explain why this does not constitute a specific problem. 96. In paragraphs 34 to 36 of the contested decision, the Commission also mentions demographic density, the intensity of the road traffic in many areas of the Nether- lands and the location of the population along the road traffic routes. Whilst it does not comment whether this may substantiate the existence of a specific problem, there are at least statements to that effect in the Commission experts\u2019 report to which refer- ence is made. According to that report, the situation in the Netherlands is comparable in this respect with other Benelux countries, the middle of the United Kingdom and western Germany. 97. However, these findings are not suffi- cient as there is no view expressed as to whether or not this geographically relatively limited part of the Community may never- theless be sufficiently unusual to be affected by a specific problem. 98. The Commission did not therefore assess relevant characteristics of the Netherlands, or did so only insufficiently, when it declined to recognise a problem specific to the Neth- erlands. Its findings on the non-existence of a problem specific to the Netherlands cannot therefore substantiate the contested decision. 3. Interim conclusion 99. The judgment under appeal cannot therefore be upheld on other grounds. In the present case, the infringement of Directive 96/62 in conjunction with Dir - ective 1999/30 in itself establishes the existence of a problem specific to the Nether- lands. However, the review of the comparison of the Member States conducted in the alter- native also leads to this conclusion, as the Commission did not sufficiently assess rele- vant submissions made by the Netherlands.

        "I - 8327 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION D \u2014 The decision on the appeal 100. Under the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of its Statute, in the event that a judgment under appeal is quashed, the Court of Justice may itself give judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits. Otherwise it refers the case back to the Court of First Instance for judgment. 101. The examination thus far does not allow a ruling to be given on the action brought by the Netherlands for the annul- ment of the contested Commission decision. The decision is based not only on the rejec- tion of the existence of a problem specific to the Netherlands. The Commission also relied on a second ground, likewise contested by the Netherlands. It claimed that the Neth- erlands measure was not compatible with Article 95(6) EC. 102. The Court of First Instance did not make any finding on this point, nor is it the subject-matter of the proceedings before the Court of Justice. There must therefore be significant doubts whether the matter is ready to proceed to judgment. 103. It could merely be asked whether the contested decision must be annulled simply because in conducting the verification under Article 95(6) EC the Commission also failed to take account of the Netherlands report on ambient air quality in 2004. However, a decision on this question would require the parties to be heard. Since this has not happened so far in the proceedings before the Court of Justice, it is not able to give a ruling on the case as a whole. 104. The case must therefore be referred back to the Court of First Instance for judgment. VI \u2014 Costs 105. Where the Court refers the case back to the Court of First Instance for judgment, no decision as to costs is to be made under Article 122 of the Rules of Procedure and that decision is reserved for the final judgment.

Directive 96/62 does not itself set the limit values, but states, in its Article 4, read in conjunction respectively with its Annexes I and II, the atmospheric pollutants for which such values must be set and the factors of which account is to be taken when setting them. Among those factors is the degree of exposure of sections of the popu- lation to those pollutants. The limit values for fine particulate matter, and particularly PM10, are laid down by Council Directive 1999/30/EC of 22 April 1999 relating to limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead in ambient air (OJ 1999 L 163, p. 41).

Thus, the limits and tolerances laid down for the first stage have been mandatory since 1 January 2005. Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe (OJ 2008 L 152, p. 1) will, by virtue of its Article 31, replace, in particular, Directives 96/62 and 1999/30 from 11 June 2010.

Facts By letter of 2 November 2005, the Kingdom of the Netherlands notified the Commis- sion, pursuant to Article 95(5) EC, of its intention to adopt a decree subjecting, from 1 January 2007 and by derogation from the provisions of Directive 98/69, new diesel- powered vehicles in Categories M1 and N1, Class I, to a limit on emissions of par - ticulate matter of 5 mg/km. 13 14 15 ",
        "I - 8337 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION In support of its request for derogation, the Kingdom of the Netherlands stated that the limits on concentrations of particulate matter laid down by Directive 1999/30 were exceeded in several areas of its territory and that, therefore, it did not consider itself in a position to comply with its obligations under that directive. It emphasised, in that context, its high demographic density and greater concentration of infra- structure than in other Member States, which gives rise to a higher rate of emis- sions of particulate matter per square kilometre. Residents are thus very exposed to air pollution because, particularly, of the immediate proximity of automobile traffic zones and residential zones. In addition, a large proportion of the pollution comes from the neighbouring Member States, so that only 15% of the national average of concentrations of particulate matter can be affected by national standards of en - vironmental protection. The Kingdom of the Netherlands stated that, in order to reduce concentrations of particulate matter, it gives priority to the reduction of emissions of particulate matter generated by passenger cars and commercial vehicles, which are responsible for 70% of those emissions from road traffic. The derogating measure notified would form an integral part of a regulatory framework based on, among other factors, the promotion of vehicles and fuels which are less pollutant. Practically, it would involve the instal- lation, in diesel-powered vehicles registered in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, of a filter reducing the quantity of particulate matter in diesel exhaust. It explained that the decree notified would apply only to vehicles registered in the Netherlands and in no way change either the EC type-approval procedure or the conditions for registration of vehicles having obtained such approval in other Member States. On the other hand, the Netherlands police and authorities respon- sible for the periodical testing of vehicles could verify, after the decree\u2019s entry into force, whether the passenger car or light commercial vehicle could comply with the new limit of 5 mg/km on emissions of particulate matter. 16 17 18 ",
        "I - 8338 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-405/07 P By letter of 23 November 2005, the Commission acknowledged receipt of the Kingdom of the Netherlands\u2019 notification and informed it that the period of six months imposed upon it by Article 95(6) EC to make a decision on requests for dero- gation had commenced on 5 November 2005. On 8 February 2006, the report on the air quality assessment in the Netherlands relating to the year 2004 (\u2018the assessment report for 2004\u2019), established pursuant to Directive 96/62, was sent to the Commission. It was registered by the Commission on 10 February 2006. By letter of 10 March 2006, the Netherlands authorities informed the Commission of the existence of a report established during March 2006 by the Milieu- en Natuur- planbureau (Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency; \u2018the MNP\u2019), entitled \u2018Nieuwe inzichten in de omvang van de fijnstofproblematiek\u2019 (\u2018New information on the extent of the problem of particulate matter\u2019) (\u2018the MNP\u2019s report\u2019). In order to evaluate the soundness of the arguments advanced by the Netherlands authorities, the Commission asked for the scientific and technical opinion of a team of consultants coordinated by the Nederlandse Organisatie voor toegepast-natuur- wandenschappelijk onderzoek (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research; \u2018the TNO\u2019). That organisation submitted its report (\u2018the TNO\u2019s report\u2019) on 27 March 2006. By the contested decision, the Commission, on 3 May 2006, rejected the draft decree notified, on the ground that \u2018the Kingdom of the Netherlands [had] failed to prove 19 20 21 22 23 ",
        "I - 8339 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION the existence of a specific problem with regard to Directive 98/69\u2019 and that, in any event, \u2018the notified measure [was] not proportionate to the objectives pursued\u2019. The action before the Court of First Instance and the judgment under appeal By application lodged on 12 July 2006 at the Registry of the Court of First Instance, the Kingdom of the Netherlands brought an action for annulment of the contested decision together with an application for its action to be decided under the expedited procedure. By the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance, under the accelerated procedure, dismissed the action. To do so it rejected the first two pleas in law advanced by the Kingdom of the Netherlands based on the Commission\u2019s determin- ation as to whether there was a problem specific to the Netherlands. In paragraphs 43 to 49 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance, first, rejected the plea in law by which the Kingdom of the Netherlands claimed that the Commission breached its duties of care and to state the reasons for its decisions, by failing, without explanation, to take account, in its determination as to the specificity of the problem of ambient air quality in the Netherlands, of the data concerning that problem relating to the year 2004. The Commission had, in that context, admitted that, contrary to its statement in recital 41 in the contested decision, the Kingdom of the Netherlands had, in fact, officially lodged its quality assessment report for 2004 before that decision was adopted. 24 25 26 ",

In particular, the TNO states on page 29 \u2026 in that document: \u201c[a] preliminary submission by [the Kingdom of] the Netherlands on [excesses] in 2004 gives a picture that is different from 2003: in all zones, at least one of the [limits plus the margin of tolerance] for PM10 is exceeded.\u201d 45 In addition, the TNO, on page 29 of its report, and the Commission, in recital 41 in the [contested decision], reproduce certain conclusions from the MNP\u2019s report \u2026 46 Finally, as is clear from recital 42 in the [contested decision], it was also in view of the new information transmitted by the Netherlands Government and contained in the MNP\u2019s report that the Commission refused to take as estab- lished the existence of a specific problem of compliance by the Kingdom of the Netherlands with the limits on concentrations of particulate matter laid down by Directive 1999/30.\u2019 27 ",
        "I - 8341 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION The Court of First Instance found, in paragraphs 47 and 48 of the judgment under appeal, that in those circumstances the Commission could not be accused either of having failed to examine the recent information which the Netherlands Government had sent it or of having failed to state the reasons for that alleged failure. The Court of First Instance, next, rejected the plea in law that the Commission denied, wrongly, that there was a specific problem of ambient air quality in the Netherlands. As regards the first argument, that the Commission wrongly applied the criterion, established by Article 95(5) EC, of the problem\u2019s national specificity by requiring that the problem relied upon affected the Kingdom of the Netherlands exclusively, the Court of First Instance found, in paragraphs 66 to 72 of the judgment under appeal, that the complaint lacked any factual basis. In that regard, it pointed out, in particular, that the contested decision, like the TNO\u2019s report, refers to the situation of other Member States and that it follows from that comparison that the Kingdom of the Netherlands is not faced with a specific problem of environmental protection which would justify the adoption of a derogating measure. The second argument, which alleged that the Commission did not take account of the Kingdom of the Netherlands\u2019 impotence to deal with the problem of emissions of particulate matter generated by inland navigation and marine transport, was rejected in paragraphs 78 to 84 of the judgment under appeal. The Court of First Instance held, in that regard, that, in any event, that argument lacked any factual basis, because, contrary to the Kingdom of the Netherlands\u2019 submission, the Commission 28 29 30 31 ",
        "I - 8342 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-405/07 P did not make the possibility of approving the notified measure subject to the condi- tion that the excesses over the limits arise, for the most part, from the emissions generated by diesel-powered road vehicles. As regards the third argument, that the problem of ambient air quality is specific because it is impossible, for the Kingdom of the Netherlands, to combat cross-fron- tier pollution, the Court of First Instance decided, in paragraphs 87 to 94 of the judg- ment under appeal, that such impossibility could not be taken as establishing that that Member State was faced with a specific problem of air quality. The Court of First Instance held, in paragraphs 88 and 91 of the judgment under appeal, that in geographically small countries, like the Netherlands, a greater propor- tion of particulate matter is, almost by definition, from an exogenous source. It found that it had, none the less, not been established that the emissions of cross-frontier particulate matter affected the air quality in the Netherlands to such an extent that the problem of limiting emissions of particulate matter arises there in a different way to that in which it arises in the rest of the European Community. It, furthermore, observed, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it is in the light of the standards established by Directive 1999/30 that the specificity of the problem is to be determined. Annex III to Directive 1999/30 establishes only limits on concentrations of particulate matter, without taking into consideration the origin of the particulate matter present. Finally, the Court of First Instance, in paragraphs 105 to 116 of the judgment under appeal, rejected the fourth argument, that the Commission denied, wrongly, the particularly serious nature of the excesses over the limits on concentrations of par - ticulate matter observed in the ambient air in the Netherlands. 32 33 34 35 ",
        "I - 8343 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION In paragraph 107 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance held, in that regard, that it was not apparent from the documents in the Court file that the excesses recorded in the Netherlands were so acute, as against those observed in other Member States, as to constitute a specific problem. Thus, the Court of First Instance particularly pointed out, in paragraph 109 of the judgment under appeal, that it follows from the list established on the basis of the national air quality assess- ment reports relating to the year 2004 that the Kingdom of the Netherlands forms part of a group of five Member States for which were recorded, for that year and for all their zones, rates of concentration of particulate matter exceeding the daily limits. The Court of First Instance also decided, in paragraph 115 of the judgment under appeal that, apart from the fact that they are not criteria under Directive 1999/30, it was not established that the demographic density, the intensity of the road traffic in many zones of the Netherlands and the location of the population along the road traffic routes combined to constitute, for that Member State, a problem distin- guishing it significantly from other regions, particularly those of the Benelux, the central part of the United Kingdom and western Germany. The Court of First Instance having, accordingly, found, in paragraphs 117 to 120 of the judgment under appeal, that the Kingdom of the Netherlands had not succeeded in establishing that there was a problem specific to its territory, which is one of the cumulative conditions required by Article 95(5) and (6) EC, it decided that the Commission was obliged to reject the draft decree notified. Therefore, it proceeded by keeping the pleas considered to a minimum and not adjudicating on that Member State\u2019s other pleas in law, which put in issue both the Commission\u2019s determination and its statement of reasons relating, first, to the proportionality of the draft notified and, second, to the international legal context. 36 37 38 ",

First, it submits that the Court of First Instance misconstrued the duty of care and the duty, referred to in Article 253 EC, to state reasons, in ruling that the Commission had not 39 40 41 ",
        "I - 8345 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION breached those duties when the relevant information contained in the assessment report for 2004 was, without specific reasons, left out of account in the contested decision. Secondly, the Kingdom of the Netherlands submits that the Court of First Instance applied incorrect legal criteria to determine whether there was a specific problem of ambient air quality in that country. Admissibility The Commission raises an objection that the appeal is inadmissible. As regards the first ground of appeal, it contends that the Kingdom of the Netherlands has no right to invoke the alleged failure to take account of the assessment report for 2004 since it submitted that report after the expiry of the time-limit imposed by Directive 96/62 and three months after the request for derogation was made. The Commission submits, moreover, that the Court of First Instance held that, in fact, the Commis- sion did take account of that report and that that finding of fact is not subject to appeal. As regards the second ground of appeal, the Commission submits that the Court of First Instance\u2019s conclusions are based on numerous factors, most of which are not challenged, and that those conclusions would still be justified even were the Court of Justice to accept the Kingdom of the Netherlands\u2019 arguments. In that regard, first, the question whether, in this case, the Commission was obliged to take account of the assessment report for 2004 despite the alleged lateness with which it was submitted, is, as the Advocate General considered in points 32 to 34 of her Opinion, not one of admissibility but of substance. 42 43 ",
        "I - 8346 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-405/07 P As regards, next, the argument that the Kingdom of the Netherlands is, by its first ground of appeal, seeking to put findings of fact in issue, it is sufficient to observe that such is not the case. In fact, the Kingdom of the Netherlands is in no way chal- lenging the Court of First Instance\u2019s findings in that context, from which it is clear, in particular, that the data for the year 2004 was incorporated in the TNO\u2019s report and that the Commission, apart from that report, also took account of the MNP\u2019s report. On the other hand, that Member State does challenge the conclusions which the Court of First Instance drew from those findings of fact. The question whether the Court of First Instance could, properly in law, conclude from those facts that the Commission failed neither in its duty of care nor in its duty to state reasons for its decisions, is a question of law subject to the review of the Court of Justice on appeal (see Case C-188/96 P Commission v V [1997] ECR I-6561, paragraph 24, and Joined Cases C-189/02 P, C-202/02 P, C-205/02 P to C-208/02 P and C-213/02 P Dansk R\u00f8rindustri and Others v Commission [2005] ECR I-5425, paragraph 453). Finally, as regards the Commission\u2019s objection to the second ground of appeal, the fact that an appeal, or a plea in support of an appeal, does not refer to all the reasons which led the Court of First Instance to adopt a position on a question does not result in the plea being inadmissible (see Case C-458/98 P Industrie des poudres sph\u00e9riques v Council [2000] ECR I-8147, paragraph 67, and the order of 23 September 2005 in Case C-357/04 P Andolfi v Commission , paragraph 24). It follows that the appeal must be declared admissible. 44 45 46 ",
        "I - 8347 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION Substance The first ground of appeal, alleging misconstruction of the duty of care and of the duty referred to in Article 253 EC to state reasons \u2014 Arguments of the parties The Kingdom of the Netherlands, in its first ground of appeal, emphasises that the assessment report for 2004 is extremely important because it shows that, for that year, the daily limits, even plus the tolerance, were exceeded in all zones and agglom- erations of the Netherlands. Also, the data for that year gives a different picture to that of the year 2003, which the Court of First Instance itself recognised in para- graph 44 of the judgment under appeal, referring to the TNO\u2019s report. The Kingdom of the Netherlands deduces from the judgment under appeal that the Court of First Instance considers it sufficient if the Commission confines itself to forwarding the relevant data submitted by the Member State to a research organ- isation, even though, first, it does not examine that data in the contested decision, disputing there even the fact that the data was sent to the Commission, and, second, it does not refer, in the contested decision, to the research organisation\u2019s finding that such data discloses a fundamentally different more problematic picture of the situation of the Member State in question. By that interpretation, the Court of First Instance thus incorrectly applied the safeguards in respect of care and giving reasons, 47 48 ",
        "I - 8348 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-405/07 P which include, particularly, the obligation for the Commission to examine care- fully and impartially all the relevant elements of the individual case and to give an adequate statement of the reasons for its decision. In that Member State\u2019s submission, the Court of First Instance in the end gives, wrongly, great importance to the fact that the Commission took account of the MNP\u2019s report. It notes, in that regard that while the Commission supported its pos - ition with the aid of that report, which was, moreover, sent to it a month and a half before the contested decision was adopted, it did not, on the other hand, without giving reasons why, take any account of the assessment report for 2004 which was, in fact, sent to the Commission three months before such adoption, but the data in which was less favourable to its position. Furthermore, the TNO\u2019s report clearly demonstrates that the findings in the MNP\u2019s report make no difference to the find- ings as to the limits based on the data in the assessment report for 2004. The Commission \u2014 apart from the argument, rehearsed in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, that the assessment report for 2004 was submitted late \u2014 contends that it is not obliged to incorporate in its decisions all the elements of the expert studies to which it resorts. It follows, moreover, from certain paragraphs of the judg- ment under appeal, that the Court of First Instance considered that it was clear from the assessment report for 2004 and from the MNP\u2019s report that the air quality in the Netherlands improved compared to the year 2003 and earlier estimates. \u2014 Findings of the Court Under Article 95(5) EC, after the adoption of harmonisation measures, Member States are obliged to submit to the Commission for approval all national derogating provisions which they deem necessary. 49 50 51 ",
        "I - 8349 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION That provision requires that the introduction of such provisions be based on new scientific evidence relating to the protection of the environment or the working environment made necessary by reason of a problem specific to the Member State concerned arising after the adoption of the harmonisation measure, and that the proposed provisions as well as the grounds for introducing them be notified to the Commission (Case C-512/99 Germany v Commission [2003] ECR I-845, para- graph 80, and Joined Cases C-439/05 P and C-454/05 P Land Ober\u00f6sterreich and Austria v Commission [2007] ECR I-7141, paragraph 57). Those conditions are cumulative in nature and must therefore all be satisfied if the derogating national provisions are not to be rejected by the Commission (see Germany v Commission , paragraph 81, and Land Ober\u00f6sterreich and Austria v Commission , paragraph 58). To determine whether those conditions are, in fact, satisfied, which can, depending on the circumstances, necessitate complex technical evaluations, the Commission has a wide discretion. The exercise of that discretion is not, however, excluded from review by the Court. According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, not only must the Community judicature establish whether the evidence relied on is factually accurate, reliable and consistent but also whether that evidence contains all the information which must be taken into account in order to assess a complex situation and whether it is capable of substantiating the conclusions drawn from it (see Case C-525/04 P Spain v Lenzing [2007] ECR I-9947, paragraph 57 and the case-law cited). 52 53 54 55 ",
        "I - 8350 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-405/07 P Moreover, it must be recalled that, where a Community institution has a wide discre- tion, the review of observance of guarantees conferred by the Community legal order in administrative procedures is of fundamental importance. The Court of Justice has had occasion to specify that those guarantees include, in particular for the compe- tent institution, the obligations to examine carefully and impartially all the relevant elements of the individual case and to give an adequate statement of the reasons for its decision (see Case C-269/90 Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen [1991] ECR I-5469, paragraph 14; Joined Cases C-258/90 and C-259/90 Pesquerias De Bermeo and Naviera Laida v Commission [1992] ECR I-2901, paragraph 26; and Spain v Lenzing , paragraph 58). The review of observance of those procedural guarantees is even more important in the procedure under Article 95(5) EC since the right to be heard does not apply to it (see Land Ober\u00f6sterreich and Austria v Commission , paragraph 44). In this case, the Kingdom of the Netherlands accuses the Commission of having breached its duty of care and its duty to give reasons by failing to examine, in the contested decision, without specific reasons, the data contained in the assessment report for 2004. The contested decision finds, in that regard, in its recital 41, that \u2018[t]he annual reports under Council Directive 96/62/EC indicate that the Netherlands had no espe- cially high exceedance problems in 2003 compared to other Member States (such as Belgium, Austria, Greece, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Slovenia and Slovakia). Since the Netherlands has not submitted official data yet for 2004, it is not possible to compare the air quality situation in the Netherlands with that in other Member States in 2004\u2019. 56 57 58 59 ",
        "I - 8351 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION It is established that the official data for that year contained in the assessment report for 2004 was submitted to the Commission on 8 February 2006 and registered by it on 10 February 2006, that is several months before the contested decision was adopted. Under the first indent of Article 174(3) EC, the Commission is, as a rule, obliged to take account, in its decisions in the field of the environment, of all available new scientific and technical data. That obligation applies, particularly, to the procedure under Article 95(5) and (6) EC, for which taking account of new data forms the very foundation. The Commission was therefore, in this case, obliged to take account of the data contained in the assessment report for 2004. That obligation was not particularly weakened by the fact that the Kingdom of the Netherlands had submitted that report to it outside the time-limit laid down by Directive 96/62, since that time-limit is unconnected with the procedure under Article 95(5) and (6) EC. It is also established that it was still actually possible for the Commission to take account of that report in the preparation of the contested decision, since the TNO\u2019s and MNP\u2019s reports, on which the Commission based the contested decision, were submitted to it even later. The Commission\u2019s findings contained in recitals 41 and 42 in the contested decision, from which it is clear that it made its determination as to the existence of a problem specific to the Kingdom of the Netherlands on the basis of the annual reports relating to the year 2003 and not to the year 2004, raise serious doubts as regards the taking into account, in the contested decision, of the data relating to the latter year. 60 61 62 63 ",
        "I - 8352 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-405/07 P Whilst it is true, as the Court of First Instance observes in paragraph 44 of the judg- ment under appeal, that the TNO\u2019s report also incorporates some preliminary data submitted by the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the year 2004, the fact remains that the contested decision makes no reference to that fact or to the TNO\u2019s findings relating to that data. Unlike the judgment under appeal, the contested decision makes no reference to the TNO\u2019s assessment that the preliminary data for the year 2004 gives a different picture to that of the preceding year: in all zones of the Netherlands, at least one of the limits plus tolerance for PM10 was exceeded. Therefore, in particular in the light of that finding by the TNO, the Commission, in order to fulfil adequately its obligation both to examine all the relevant elements of the individual case and to give an adequate statement of the reasons for its decision, was obliged to explain, in the contested decision, the reasons for which it decided, also on the basis of the data relating to the year 2004 and in spite of the differences pointed out by the TNO between that data and the data for the preceding year, that it had not been demonstrated that there was a specific problem. In fact, while the Court of Justice has recognised that the Commission, as part of its assessment of the merits of a request for derogation under Article 95(5) EC, may have to have recourse to outside experts in order to obtain their advice on new scientific evidence adduced in support of such request (see Land Ober\u00f6sterreich and Austria v Commission , paragraph 32), the primary responsibility for making that assessment rests on the Commission, which must itself, if appropriate on the basis of the experts\u2019 advice, properly take account of all the relevant evidence and explain, in its final deci- sion, the essential considerations which led it to adopt that decision. 64 65 66 67 ",
        "I - 8353 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION It follows that the mere fact that the TNO\u2019s report incorporated the preliminary data relating to the year 2004 cannot justify the Commission\u2019s failure, in the contested decision, either to examine the data relating to that year or to state the reasons for that omission. The same applies to the fact that the Commission set out, in the contested deci- sion, certain findings in the MNP\u2019s report and, in the light of the new information contained in it, determined whether there was a problem specific to the Netherlands. Thus, the MNP\u2019s findings, set out by the Commission in recital 41 in the contested decision, contain no statement relating to the question whether there was, when the contested decision was adopted and particularly having regard to the data relating to the year 2004, a specific problem of ambient air quality in the Netherlands. Indeed, those findings \u2014 from which it is clear that, according to a re-evaluation, the levels of PM10 are 10 to 15% lower than previously assumed and the number of zones where the limits are exceeded will be halved in 2010 compared to 2005 and in 2015 compared to 2010 \u2014 do not put in question the veracity of the data relating to the year 2004, which demonstrates that the limits were exceeded throughout the Netherlands, and do not exclude the possibility that there was, at the date of the contested decision\u2019s adoption, a specific problem in that Member State. 68 69 70 71 ",
        "I - 8354 JUDGMENT OF 6. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-405/07 P It follows from the foregoing that the Court of First Instance made an error of law in holding that the Commission\u2019s adoption of the contested decision had breached neither its duty of care nor its duty to state the reasons for the decision. Since the Commission, in order to determine whether there was a specific problem of ambient air quality in the Netherlands, did not properly take account of all the relevant data, and particularly that relating to the year 2004, that determination is necessarily vitiated by an error, and that regardless of whether the Commission, in that determination, also applied incorrect legal criteria, as the Kingdom of the Neth- erlands had submitted. In those circumstances, the Court of First Instance could not, without falling into error of law, dismiss the Kingdom of the Netherlands\u2019 action as unfounded, by concluding that the Commission had correctly decided that the problem of compli- ance with the Community limits on concentrations of particulate matter in ambient air was not a specific problem. It follows that the judgment under appeal must be set aside. Since dealing with the second ground of appeal, by which the Kingdom of the Netherlands complains that the Court of First Instance applied incorrect legal criteria in its determination of whether there was a specific problem of ambient air quality, cannot, therefore, what- ever the result of deciding it, affect the outcome of the appeal, it is appropriate to forego its examination. 72 73 74 75 ",
        "I - 8355 NETHERLANDS v COMMISSION Under the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, the Court, when quashing the decision of the Court of First Instance, may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits. That is the case here. In that regard, the Commission\u2019s incomplete analysis of the relevant scientific evidence is apt to vitiate not only its determination as to whether there was a specific problem but the entirety of its determination of the conditions for applying Article 95(5) and (6) EC, and, particularly, that of the proportionality of the measure notified, since a fuller evaluation of the available scientific evidence may, by its very nature, affect the determination as to such a measure\u2019s proportionality. In those circumstances, the contested decision must be annulled in order that the Commission may again evaluate, on the basis of all the relevant scientific evidence, the measure notified to determine whether it satisfies the requirements of Article 95(5) and (6) EC.

The only defence available to a Member State in opposing an application by the Commission under Article 88(2) EC for a declaration that it has failed to fulfil its obligations is to plead that it was abso- lutely impossible for it properly to imple- ment the decision ordering the recovery. In the event of difficulties, the Commis- sion and the Member State must, pursuant to the duty of genuine cooper- ation under Article 10 EC, work together in good faith with a view to overcoming those difficulties whilst fully observing the Treaty provisions. The condition that it be absolutely impossible to implement a decision is not fulfilled where the Member State merely informs the Commission of the legal, political or practical difficul- ties which could be involved in imple- menting the decision, without taking any real steps to recover the aid from the undertakings concerned, and without proposing to the Commission any alter- native arrangements for implementing the decision which enable those diffi- culties to be overcome. The difficul- ties, concerning the identification of the recipients, the calculation of the amount of the aid to be recovered and the choice and implementation of recovery procedures, are internal difficulties caused by the national authorities\u2019 own acts or omissions. (see paras 44-46, 50) 2. The re-establishment of the previous situation and the elimination of the distortion of competition resulting from unlawfully paid aid may, in prin- ciple, with respect to recipient under- takings which have ceased their activity and are subject to collective proceed- ings, be achieved by registration of the liability relating to the repayment of the aid in question in the schedule of liabilities. If the period for the presenta- tion of claims has expired, the national authorities must, where such a proced- ure exists and is still available, apply any procedure to lift a time-bar so as to allow the presentation of claims out of time. Where the recipients have ceased their activity and transferred their assets the national authorities must check whether the financial conditions of the transfer complied with market condi- tions. If such is the case, the aid element was assessed at the market price and included in the purchase price, so that the buyer cannot be regarded as having ",
        "I - 8359 COMMISSION v FRANCE benefited from an advantage in relation to other market operators. Otherwise, it cannot be ruled out that the trans- feree may be required to repay the aid in question where it is established that it continues to benefit from the competi- tive advantage linked with the receipt of the aid. For the purposes of checking the financial conditions of the transfer, the national authorities may take into consideration, in particular, the form of the transfer, for example, public tendering, deemed to ensure that a sale takes place under market conditions or any expert\u2019s report prepared at the time of the transfer. Where the assets have been acquired by a number of different buyers, there is nothing to prevent the financial conditions of each of the trans- actions from being checked for their compliance with market conditions. In the case of a privately negotiated transfer of assets, the recovery of the aid from the transferee cannot be dependent on an express reference in the legal instrument of a transfer of that aid. Recovery can take place where the transferee should have been aware of the existence of the aid and of a review procedure instituted by the Commission. In the light of those facts, a defendant Member State may not, in proceedings for a declaration that it has failed to fulfil its obligations, simply make general and abstract statements without referring to specific individual cases, analysed in the light of all the steps actually taken to implement the decision. (see paras 56-63) 3. In an action for failure to fulfil obli- gations brought by the Commission under Article 88(2) EC, the Court does not need to examine the head of claim seeking a declaration that a Member State has failed to inform the Commis- sion of the measures to implement a decision declaring an aid scheme incom- patible with the common market and requiring recovery of aid granted, where that Member State did not in fact imple- ment the decision within the prescribed period.

        "I - 8360 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-214/07 OPINION OF ADVOCATE GENERAL SHARPSTON delivered on 12 June 2008 1 1. In these proceedings under Article 88(2) EC, the Commission contends that France, in failing to recover sums accorded to com - panies taking over the activities of firms in difficulty, has failed to implement Commis- sion Decision 2004/343/EC 2 (\u2018the deci- sion\u2019) within the prescribed time period. The Commission therefore seeks a declar- ation that France is in breach of its obliga- tions under Articles 5 and 6 of that decision, the fourth paragraph of Article 249 EC and Article 10 EC. 2. France contests neither the decision which declared the State aids in question illegal, nor that it is in principle obliged to recover them. It nevertheless maintains that it is not in breach of its obligations under Community law. 3. France\u2019s defence is that its authorities have done all that they can to recover the aid 1 \u2014 Original language: English. 2 \u2014 Decision of 16 December 2003 on the aid scheme imple- mented by France for the takeover of firms in difficulty (OJ 2004 L 108, p. 38). concerned, and that to ask them to recover the aid any faster would be to demand the impossible. That is particularly the case where the companies which received the aid have subsequently ceased to trade, or have sold their assets. Legal framework Treaty provisions 4.

Article 87(1) EC sets out the condi- tions under which a State aid is in principle incompatible with the common market. Article 87(3) EC indicates a number of circumstances where such aid may neverthe- less be considered to be compatible. 6. Article 88(2) EC provides: \u2018If, after giving notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments, the Commission finds that aid granted by a State or through State resources is not compatible with the common market \u2026 it shall decide that the State concerned shall abolish or alter such aid within a period of time to be deter- mined by the Commission.

Article 44 septies of the French General Tax Code 5 provided for a two-year exemp- tion from corporation tax for companies created to take over the activities of industrial firms in difficulty. Articles 1383 A and 1464 B and C further extended to such companies the benefit of a two-year exemption from business tax and property tax, subject to the agreement of the competent local authorities. 10. By letter of 12 September 2001, the Commission requested information from France concerning the tax exemption provided for in Article 44 septies of the General Tax Code. The Commission subse- quently initiated a formal investigation procedure, by letter dated 19 August 2002, on the grounds that the exemption might amount to aid falling under Article 87(1) EC. 5 \u2014 Introduced by Article 14A, Law 88-1149 of 23 December 1988 (loi de finances pour 1989), Journal Officiel de la R\u00e9pu- blique Fran\u00e7aise, 28 December 1988. Article 44 septies was amended five times before being suspended and replaced by a provision which the Commission accepted as being in conformity with the common market (see point 14 below). 11. The French authorities responded by letter of 13 December 2002. They argued that the arrangement did not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87 EC or that, if it did, it was justified under the Commu- nity guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty. 6 12. However, the Commission concluded that the fiscal exemptions in question were unlawful State aids within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC. Accordingly, on 16 December 2003 it adopted the decision. 13. The operative part of that decision provides: \u2018 Article 1 The State aid scheme provided for in Article 44 septies of the General Tax Code in the form of a scheme of tax exemptions for companies taking over the assets of firms in difficulty that France has implemented in breach of Article 88(3) of the Treaty is 6 \u2014 OJ 2004 C 244, p. 2.

        "I - 8365 COMMISSION v FRANCE series of letters and memoranda concerning the decision. Three meetings between offi- cials to discuss the recovery process also took place. However, the correspondence and the meetings did not lead to the recovery of any of the unlawful aid. 16. The exchanges between the Commission and the French authorities are set out chrono- logically in the annexes to the Commis- sion\u2019s application. I find it more helpful to summarise them by reference to the argu- ments raised by each of the parties. The number of companies affected 17. The first issue to be determined was how many companies were affected by the decision. Initially the French author- ities estimated that about 2000 companies might be concerned. A month or so later, France sent the Commission preliminary data, indicating that around 4000 companies might have benefited from aid under those fiscal provisions. By the time the Commis- sion commenced proceedings, France had submitted three lists of beneficiaries. 12 Aids granted before the 1994 fiscal year 18. At the initial meeting, the French authorities indicated that the obligation under national law to keep financial records was limited to 10 years. There were therefore no records for the period up to the end of fiscal year 1993. The Commission accepted that aids granted before 1994 were impos- sible to recover. Those aids form no part of the present proceedings. 12 \u2014 France submitted a further list of beneficiaries as an annex to its rejoinder. In those four lists, the French authorities identified 721 companies in total. Of these, 143 were liable to repay over EUR 200 000 of unlawful aid. The discrep- ancy in numbers between the first estimates and the lists provided is (perhaps) explained if the French authorities confined their investigations to the companies whose tax returns were subject to the \u2018r\u00e9gime r\u00e9el normal\u2019 (involving sums above the de minimis threshold for that regime), and correspondingly disregarded companies whose returns were subject to the \u2018r\u00e9gime simplifi\u00e9\u2019, and those which were granted exemptions which fell below the de minimis threshold. ",
        "I - 8366 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-214/07 Beneficiaries which have ceased to trade 19. At the initial meeting, France indicated that some beneficiaries might have ceased to trade. Ten months later France stated that these beneficiaries were around 140 in number. At the third meeting between the parties, the Commission agreed that the decision could be considered as implemented where a company had ceased to be econom- ically active. Prioritisation 20. In respect of beneficiaries who had transferred assets to other companies, the Commission proposed that France should confine its investigations to the largest companies, by reference to whether the assets had been sold under market conditions. 21. More generally, the Commission proposed that the French authorities should address the largest distortions of competi- tion first when recovering the unlawful aids. France accepted this proposal but indicated that it would separate the beneficiaries into two groups \u2014 one to be exempted from repayment completely, the other to be exam- ined thoroughly in order to determine the exact amount to repay. 22. On 16 March 2005 France supplied the Commission with a list of the 55 beneficiaries it had identified as each owing more than EUR 1 million. The grant of new aids to certain beneficiaries 23. France proposed granting new aids to certain beneficiaries. The Commission replied that there should be no link between new grants of aid and the obligation to repay monies granted under the takeover aid scheme. On 7 July 2006 France sent the Commission a list showing the benefi- ciaries which were due to repay sums under EUR 200 000, and proposed to make new grants of aid to them in order to cover their liabilities to repay the unlawful aid. 13 13 \u2014 There is an apparent disparity between the maximum for de minimis aid in Regulation No 69/2001 and that cited by France. The former sets an upper limit of EUR 100 000. Regulation No 1998/2006 (OJ 2006 L 379 p. 5) \u2014 which has applied since 1 January 2007 \u2014 increased the maximum to EUR 200 000. While that change cannot affect the classifi- cation of the original grants of aid paid, the new maximum will apply to new grants of State aid. ",
        "I - 8367 COMMISSION v FRANCE The definition of SMEs 24. France asked to be allowed to apply a simplified definition of SMEs. The Commis- sion pointed out that focusing on SMEs ran counter to its order of priority for recovering the aid. It eventually agreed, exceptionally, to simplify the normal conditions defining a SME for the purposes of exemption from the recovery obligation. Legal basis for recovery 25. At the second meeting, France explained that it was encountering difficulties in finding an appropriate legal basis in national law for the recovery procedure and that a regula- tory act or a legislative modification would be needed in order to require the benefi- ciaries to repay the aid. It does not appear that any modification of national law was in fact enacted. Instead, the French authorities undertook to recover the unlawful aid on an ad hoc basis. 26. This ad hoc procedure required the cooperation of the beneficiaries. Moreover, certain procedural steps had to be taken before the unlawful aid could be recovered. France stressed the importance of deter- mining the precise amount of aid to be recovered before sending out orders for the recovery of that aid, and referred to the scale of the administrative work this required. France also stressed the need to avoid post- recovery actions against the State from beneficiaries. Timetable for recovery 27. The Commission asked the French authorities to provide a timetable for recovery from the larger enterprises located outside regional aid zones. This was not forthcoming. Explanations for the delays in recovery 28. France gave a number of political explan- ations for the delays in recovering the ",
        "I - 8368 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-214/07 unlawful aid: the reactions of the companies involved; the potential damage to businesses from recovery of the aid; the risk that jobs might be affected and the possible adverse impact that large-scale recovery of the unlawful aids might have during the run-up to the French referendum on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. The amount of aid to be recovered 29. The Commission asked France to explain how it intended to calculate the amount of aid to be recovered from each of the benefi- ciaries. France explained that its calculation would be based on the benefit each company actually derived from the aid. The Commis- sion had already indicated that such a basis was conceptually incorrect and therefore rejected France\u2019s proposed method of calcu- lating the sums to be recovered. Recovery of the aid 30. The Commission asked France to set out its proposed procedure for recovering the unlawful aid. It does not appear that this was done. 31. In January 2006, the Commission asked France to send out recovery orders to the companies which it had already identified and the extent of whose unlawful aid it had already calculated. Two months later the Commission asked for confirmation that the orders had been sent. When the present proceedings were initiated in April 2007, France had not yet sent out the orders for recovery. 32. The Commission began to indicate its concern in August 2004 at the continuing lack of any effective recovery of the sums due. In January 2005, the Commission indi- cated that the recovery process should start by April, and threatened action under Article 88(2) EC. France responded to that letter in the middle of March. A year later (in March 2006) the Commission again threat- ened action under Article 88(2) EC. France replied in July 2006 emphasising the difficul- ",
        "I - 8369 COMMISSION v FRANCE ties it was facing and attaching two lists of companies that had nothing to repay. 33. Following receipt of that letter, the Commission instigated proceedings before the Court of Justice under Article 88(2) EC. The procedure before the Court 34. The Commission seeks a declaration that France is in breach of its obligations under Articles 5 and 6 of the decision, the fourth paragraph of Article 249 EC and Article 10 EC. 35. The Commission considers that France is in breach of its obligation immediately and effectively to recover the unlawful aid. France has not recovered any of the sums due. Nor has it taken any steps towards actu- ally recovering those sums. France has not demonstrated that it is absolutely impossible for it to recover the unlawful aid. Rather, its conduct has been such as to breach its duty of loyal cooperation under Article 10 EC. 36. France contends that it has had to take a number of steps in order to recover sums under the decision. Throughout the process, it has highlighted and explained the diffi- culties which its authorities have encoun- tered. Those difficulties amount to a situ - ation in which it has, thus far, been absolutely impossible to recover the unlawful aid. France maintains that it has been active in the recovery process; that the Commission has seriously underestimated the difficulties France faces; and that it is not in breach of its obligations under Article 10 EC. 37. The Commission and France have both submitted full written pleadings. No hearing was held. ",
        "I - 8370 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-214/07 The obligations of Member States The nature of the obligation 38. Member States are in principle obliged to recover unlawful State aid. This general obligation stems from Article 88(2) EC and from Regulation No 659/1999. The indi- vidual decision which declares a particular form of State aid to be unlawful imposes a more specific obligation on the Member State to which it is addressed. The decision is binding on its addressee. 39. Those obligations serve to restore the status quo insofar as possible and to elim- inate anti-competitive advantages created by unlawful State aids. 14 40. France is the addressee of the decision. Although the decision did not prescribe a specific time period for recovery of the unlawful aid, it required France to effect recovery \u2018without delay\u2019 (Article 5). It is common ground that no recovery took 14 \u2014 Case C-419/06 Commission v Greece , paragraphs 53 and 54 and the case-law cited therein. place before the Commission initiated these proceedings. France has therefore not complied with the obligation as to result set out in the decision. 41. Article 5 of the decision also imposes an obligation regarding the manner in which that result is to be achieved. It requires France to take \u2018all necessary measures\u2019 and states that recovery must be \u2018effected without delay and in accordance with the procedures of national law provided that they allow the immediate and effective execution of [the decision]\u2019 15 42. In my view, a detailed analysis of the manner in which a Member State has attempted to effect recovery is irrelevant when the Member State in question has wholly failed to meet its obligation as to result. 15 \u2014 In imposing those obligations, Article 5 of the decision echoes Article 14 of Regulation No 659/1999, which obliges Member States to execute the decision immediately and effectively, recovering without delay sums unlawfully paid as State aids. The Court has consistently emphasised the need for the immediate and effective execution of the deci- sion in question. See Case C-209/00 Commission v Germany [2002] ECR I-11695, paragraphs 33 and 34; Case C-232/05 Commission v France [2006] ECR I-10071 paragraphs 49 and 50 and Commission v Greece , cited above in footnote 14, paragraphs 57 to 61. ",
        "I - 8371 COMMISSION v FRANCE The defence of absolute impossibility 43. The Court has consistently stated that only absolute impossibility excuses a failure to recover unlawful State aid. 16 The Court construes that defence strictly, refusing to accept that \u2018mere apprehension of internal difficulties\u2019 amounts to absolute impossibility. 17 44. It is important to stress that the defence of absolute impossibility attaches to the result to be achieved: the recovery of the unlawful aid. If it could be invoked in respect of the manner in which recovery were effected, it would be all too easy for a Member State to choose a process for recovering the unlawful aid that proved impossible and then claim that it was absolved from its obligation to recover the aid. 45. Certain complementary duties arise if a Member State encounters difficulties in recovering the aid. Thus, the Court has 16 \u2014 Commission v Greece , cited above in footnote 14, para- graph 39 and the case-law cited therein. 17 \u2014 Case C-404/00 Commission v Spain [2003] ECR I-6695, paragraph 55. consistently stated that if the Member State merely informs the Commission of the legal, political or practical difficulties involved in implementing the decision, without taking any real steps to recover the aid from the undertakings concerned, and without proposing to the Commission any alternative arrangements for implementing the decision which could have enabled the difficulties to be overcome, the conditions of absolute impossibility will not be satisfied. A Member State may rely on the defence of absolute impossibility only if it has brought these problems to the attention of the Commission and has tried to resolve the difficulties it is facing. 18 46. Thus, a Member State may not argue that it has \u2018done all it can\u2019 to recover the sums in question unless the circumstances amount to a situation of objective absolute impossibility . 19 It cannot base the defence upon its own, subjective perception of what is impossible. 18 \u2014 See most recently Commission v Greece , cited in foot- note 14, paragraph 40 and the case-law cited therein. 19 \u2014 It is settled case-law that Member States cannot invoke the particularities of their own legal systems in order to found an argument of absolute impossibility. See Case 225/86 Commission v Italy [1988] ECR 2271, paragraph 10 and Case C-183/91 Commission v Greece [1993] ECR I-3131, paragraph 17. At point 72 of his Opinion in Commission v France , cited above in footnote 15, Advocate General Ruiz- Jarabo Colomer rejected (in my view, entirely correctly) an argument which was probably implicitly based upon limita- tions arising from within the legal system of the Member State in question ",
        "I - 8372 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-214/07 The obligation under Article 10 EC 47. Article 10 EC imposes a general duty of sincere cooperation upon Member States. 48. Naturally that duty continues to apply where a Member State encounters difficulties in the recovery of unlawful aid. The specific obligation to execute a decision regarding the recovery of State aids and the more general obligation under Article 10 EC are closely entwined; and Article 10 EC shapes the way in which a Member State must act during the recovery process. 20 49. The Court has, indeed, been quite explicit as to the requirements that flow from Article 10 EC if or when a Member State encounters difficulties in recovering unlawful State aid. In Commission v Spain the Court stated that \u2018\u2026 when, during the implementa- tion of a Commission decision on State aid, 20 \u2014 This has been settled case-law since Case 52/84 Commission v Belgium [1986] ECR 89, paragraph 16. It was most recently reiterated in Case C-415/03 Commission v Greece [2005] ECR I-3875, paragraph 42. a Member State encounters unforeseen and unforeseeable difficulties or becomes aware of consequences unforeseen by the Commis- sion, it must submit those problems to the Commission for its assessment, proposing appropriate amendments to the decision in question. In such a case, under the rule imposing on Member States and Commu- nity institutions reciprocal duties of genuine cooperation which underlies in particular Article 10 EC, the Commission and the Member State must work together in good faith with a view to overcoming the difficul- ties whilst fully observing the provisions of the Treaty and in particular those on aid.\u2019 21 50. I shall therefore examine the conduct of the French authorities in two stages. First, has France shown that it was absolutely impossible for it to recover the unlawful aid? Second, has France met its obligations under Article 10 EC in the way in which it has sought to deal with the difficulties that it has encountered? 21 \u2014 Case C-499/99 Commission v Spain [2002] ECR I-6031 paragraph 24. ",
        "I - 8373 COMMISSION v FRANCE The alleged absolute impossibility of recovering the unlawful aid 51. France has made reference to a number of specific circumstances which, it argues, produced a situation of absolute impossibility. 52. First, France argues that it was absolutely impossible to identify the beneficiaries of aid granted before the end of the 1993 fiscal year, because financial records are only kept for a period of 10 years. The Commission accepted that argument and recovery of that aid forms no part of the Commission\u2019s application. 22 53. Second, the French authorities identified 204 companies which have ceased to trade since receiving aid under the takeover aid scheme. France argues that it is absolutely 22 \u2014 France may only rely upon the defence of absolute impos- sibility in respect of financial records which, at the time the decision took effect , had already been deleted following the expiry of the 10 year retention obligation. Financial records for the 1994 fiscal year and afterwards must, as a corollary, be deemed to have been available to the French authorities at the start of the recovery process. impossible to execute the recovery decision in respect of these companies. 54. Where a company simply vanishes, leaving behind only an empty shell on the register of companies, it becomes in practical terms impossible to recover the unlawful aid. Where a company is wound up, however, the liability relating to the repayment of the unlawful aid can be registered in that company\u2019s schedule of liabilities. The Court has stated that in principle that suffices to re-establish the status quo and to eliminate the distortion of competition which arose from the aid. 23 55. When a company is liquidated by judi- cial process and the unlawful aid is taken into account by the court whilst so doing, the obligation to recover the unlawful aid will either be fulfilled (if the company has suffi- cient assets to repay the aid at that point) or will cease when the company is wound up and the distortion to competition is conse- quently eliminated. 56. Where an original beneficiary continues to trade, and its assets are sold to another 23 \u2014 Case C-277/00 Germany v Commission [2004] ECR I-3925, paragraph 85 and the case-law cited therein. ",
        "I - 8374 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-214/07 company, 24 the Court has stated that the Member State is required to ascertain that the buyer has bought those assets under market conditions 25 and with no intention to evade the obligation to repay the unlawful aid. 57. The Commission has referred in its pleadings to the test set out in Banks , 26 which does not include assessing whether the sale was made in order to evade the obliga- tion to repay the unlawful aid. However, that particular case concerned the sale of shares. The present case is concerned with assets, and the proper test is that set out in Germany v Commission . In its judgment, the Court adopted the approach set out in Banks , 27 modified that approach to the peculiarities of a purchase of assets rather than shares 28 and applied the modified approach to a sale of assets. 29 I see no reason to depart from the approach set out in Germany v Commission . 58. France states that it may sometimes be impossible to determine whether the liability 24 \u2014 Or companies \u2014 if more than one company has bought assets then the analysis is unaffected, although the level of practical difficulty encountered in tracing the liability may increase. 25 \u2014 Germany v Commission , cited in footnote 23, paragraph 86. 26 \u2014 Case C-390/98 [2001] ECR I-6117. 27 \u2014 Paragraph 80 of the judgment. 28 \u2014 Paragraph 86 of the judgment. 29 \u2014 Paragraphs 92 and 93 of the judgment. to repay the unlawful aid lies with the original beneficiary or with the company that bought its assets. In certain circumstances the assets being sold may be so unusual that a com - parator cannot be found, so that the hypo- thetical market price for the asset cannot be established. 59. I cannot accept that argument. 60. The Court has been unreceptive to the suggestion that a unique situation may pose insurmountable problems. 30 Moreover, it would (presumably) be fairly unusual for the assets disposed of truly to be unique. If this is a merely hypothetical objection, France may not rely on it. France has not shown that such circumstances exist in respect of any, let alone a majority or all, of the companies in question. 30 \u2014 In Case C-328/99 Italy and SIM 2 Multimedia v Commis\u00ad sion [2003] ECR I-4035, the Court evaluated the review of market conditions conducted by the Commission. It referred to a hypothetical \u2018private investor\u2019 to evaluate the actions of the actual investor concerned (paragraphs 37 to 40 of the judgment) and accepted the use of an inde- pendent expert to evaluate the price paid (paragraph 72 of the judgment). ",
        "I - 8375 COMMISSION v FRANCE 61. Nor has France shown that its author- ities lack the means to investigate such sales, or that such an investigation has been attempted. I add that, if the competent authorities were to place on the companies making the asset acquisition the evidential burden of showing that the sale took place under normal market conditions, the neces- sary material to evaluate individual transac- tions might be forthcoming. 62. France also argues that, where a buyer of assets was unaware of the state aid liability at the time of purchase, it cannot be held liable to repay the unlawful aid even if the sale was below market price. France asserts that an action for recovery of such aid from the buyer would lack a legal foundation in national law. 63. As the Commission has rightly pointed out, this would encourage buyers to avoid becoming aware of such liabilities. Further- more, the absence of an existing legal foun- dation for recovery in national law cannot amount to absolute impossibility. 64. I regard the specific situations described above as falling within the category of internal difficulties. France has not therefore made out the defence of absolute impossi- bility in those respects. 65. France\u2019s more general pleas of impos- sibility are predicated upon the assumption that it is entitled to rely upon the difficulties it encountered, at each stage, in recovering the aid, which have slowed down the process. As I have indicated above, 31 the manner in which a Member State may have set about the recovery process cannot be taken into account when considering absolute impos- sibility, if it has in fact failed to recover the unlawful aid at all. 66. In taking steps to implement the deci- sion, France has in fact identified the major beneficiaries due to repay the unlawful aid. It has determined the amount of money each beneficiary owes. And I can see no tangible reason \u2014 still less an insurmount- able obstacle \u2014 that prevents the French authorities from sending out recovery orders to those beneficiaries. 31 \u2014 At point 42. ",
        "I - 8376 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-214/07 67. I therefore conclude that France has not rebutted the case made out by the Commis- sion and has not established the defence of absolute impossibility in respect of aid given to companies from the 1994 fiscal year onwards. France is therefore in breach of its obligations under Articles 5 and 6 of that decision, and (as a necessary consequence) of its obligations under the fourth paragraph of Article 249 EC. Article 10 EC 68. The duty of loyal cooperation between the Member State and the Commission during the recovery process stems from the need to ensure the immediate and effective execution of the decision and the recovery of the sums paid out in unlawful aid, which is to be effected without delay. 69. The decision is dated 16 December 2003. The French authorities have recovered none of the unlawful aid. Nor have the steps taken been effective steps to obtain its recovery. 70. France\u2019s approach towards recovering the sums due has more closely resembled the antithesis of the approach that would have led to rapid recovery, at least in part, of the unlawful aid. 71. First, the French authorities spent much time and effort on minimising both the number of companies that would be obliged to make repayments and the amounts to be repaid. In contrast, no effort was made to recover aid from beneficiaries that were clearly identifiable, from quite early on, as owing very substantial sums. 32 72. Second, France chose to apply an ad hoc recovery procedure, which required the beneficiaries actively to participate and co- operate in the recovery process. Unsurpris- ingly, its (attempted) use of such a procedure caused a number of problems. The benefi- ciaries in question were reluctant to identify themselves and to give access to company accounts and to other information in their possession. As and when recovery orders are sent out, it may well be that further difficul- ties will emerge. 33 32 \u2014 Namely, the 55 companies that owe more than EUR 1 million each, whose identity had been established by March 2005. 33 \u2014 The Commission expressed doubts regarding the alleged need for cooperation. In particular, the Commission questions whether the cooperation of all companies was necessary. ",
        "I - 8377 COMMISSION v FRANCE 73. The Commission has suggested that the need for such extensive cooperation could have been avoided if the French authorities had simply required payment of the tax from which the beneficiaries had originally been exempted and left it to the beneficiaries to adduce the necessary evidence to demon- strate that some or all of that amount fell within the categories of compatible State aid identified in Articles 2 and 3 of the decision. I agree. 74. The procedure followed by the French authorities also apparently required recovery orders to be grouped by \u2018d\u00e9partement\u2019 before they could be issued. France has not explained why that should be the case. 75. France has contended that its authorities were obliged to use an ad hoc procedure in order to surmount two problems. 76. First, France argues that it lacks a proper legal basis in national law for the recovery of those debts. As I have already indicated, this argument is without merit. If a Member State\u2019s domestic legal order lacks the neces- sary mechanisms to enable it to fulfil its Community law obligations, it is for the Member State to put them in place. This is a logical consequence of the binding nature of decisions under Article 249 EC. 77. Second, France argues that these debts cannot be recovered using the procedures which are used for the recovery of ordinary fiscal debts, because a three-year limitation period would then apply. Consequently, an ad hoc procedure had to be used \u2014 and such a procedure requires the cooperation of the beneficiaries. 78. I do not accept that argument. As a matter of Community law, France is obliged to recover the unlawful aid irrespective of whether it is classified in national law as a fiscal debt. A Member State cannot avoid its obligation to recover unlawful aid by seeking to invoke the legitimate expectations of the beneficiaries. 34 79. If the French authorities take the view that national law obliges them to use an ad hoc procedure, they must apply one that leads to the immediate and effective recovery of the unlawful aid. A procedure which is ad 34 \u2014 Case C-372/97 Italy v Commission [2004] ECR I-3679, paragraph 112. ",
        "I - 8378 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-214/07 hoc in form does not necessarily mean using a procedure which requires the beneficiaries\u2019 cooperation. The French authorities were free to choose what recovery procedure to use, subject to their overriding duty to use one that enabled France to comply with its obligations. The procedure selected appears, however, to have been singularly ineffective, and to have led to difficulties which France made no real attempt to resolve. It is diffi- cult to regard such an approach as falling within the spirit of cooperation required by Article 10 EC. 80. I also note that France intends to make new grants of aid to beneficiaries identi- fied as owing under EUR 200 000, 35 thereby taking advantage of the fact that, during the years that have elapsed between the notifi- cation of the decision and the initiation of these proceedings, the de minimis threshold has been raised from EUR 100 000 to EUR 200 000. Such an approach likewise does not strengthen the impression of a Member State acting in the spirit of loyal cooperation. 81. It is common ground that France is in breach of its obligation to provide 35 \u2014 The Commission\u2019s position is that new grants of aid should not be linked to the repayment of old grants of aid that have been declared illegal. Since these matters fall outside the scope of the present proceedings, I shall not comment further. information within the deadline set in Article 6 of the decision. Although the Commission did not set a prescribed time period for recovery under Article 5 of the decision, during the protracted exchanges with the French authorities, the Commission did impose a number of deadlines. 36 None were met. 82. The fact that when the Commission initiated proceedings \u2014 three years and four months after the decision was published \u2014 not a cent of the original aid had been re- covered is also eloquent. 83. I therefore conclude that France is likewise in breach of its obligations under Article 10 EC. 36 \u2014 These were, in order, the deadline for receipt of information about the proposed recovery measures (late March 2004); the deadline for receipt of a list of the beneficiaries owing more than EUR 1 million (1 October 2004); the deadline for receipt of a timetable for recovery (1 March 2005); the dead- line for starting to recover the aid (1 April 2005); the further deadline for information (mid June 2005); the deadline for issuing the recovery orders (early February 2006) and the deadline for providing a list of beneficiaries owing more than EUR 100 000 (7 June 2006). France itself proposed a deadline for issuing recovery orders (31 May 2006), which it likewise failed to meet. ",

Bay Larsen (Rapporteur), Judges, Advocate General: E. Sharpston, Registrar: R. Grass, having regard to the written procedure, after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 12 June 2008, gives the following Judgment By its action, the Commission of the European Communities asks the Court to declare that, by failing to implement within the prescribed period Commission Deci- sion 2004/343/EC of 16 December 2003 on the aid scheme implemented by France for the takeover of firms in difficulty (OJ 2004 L 108, p. 38; \u2018the decision\u2019), the French Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 5 and 6 of that decision, the fourth paragraph of Article 249 EC and Article 10 EC. 1 ",
        "I - 8382 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-214/07 The French Republic disputes the substance of the action and seeks to have it dismissed. Background to the dispute The decision classifies as a State aid scheme a scheme of tax exemptions provided for in Articles 44 septies, 1383 A, 1464 B and 1464 C of the French General Tax Code (\u2018the GTC\u2019). The scheme was introduced by the Finance Law for 1989, Law 88-1149 of 23 December 1988 ( Journal Officiel de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise , 28 December 1988, p. 16320), without prior notification to the Commission. Under Article 44 septies of the GTC, companies created to take over the activities of industrial firms in difficulty are exempted from corporation tax for a period of two years. In accordance with Articles 1464 B and 1464 C of the GTC, those newly created companies may also benefit, with the agreement of the competent local authorities, from exemption from business tax and property tax for a period of two years. Article 1 of the decision declares that the aid scheme is incompatible with the common market and states that it was implemented in breach of Article 88(3) EC. Article 2 of the decision excludes, however, from the classification as State aid exemptions granted which fulfil the conditions laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 69/2001 of 12 January 2001 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to de minimis aid (OJ 2001 L 10, p. 30), or by the de minimis rules ap- plicable at the time of the grant. 2 3 4 5 6 ",
        "I - 8383 COMMISSION v FRANCE Article 3 accepts, moreover, the compatibility of the aid referred to in Article 1 which fulfils the conditions laid down by the 1979 Communication of the Commission on regional aid systems (OJ 1979 C 31, p. 9), by the 1998 Commission Guidelines on national regional aid (OJ 1998 C 74, p. 9), or by Commission Regulation (EC) No 70/2001 of 12 January 2001 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to State aid to small and medium-sized enterprises (OJ 2001 L 10, p. 33). Article 5 requires, in the following terms, the recovery of aid which is unlawful and incompatible: \u2018France shall take all necessary measures to recover from its beneficiaries aid granted under the scheme referred to in Article 1, other than that referred to in Articles 2 and 3, and unlawfully made available to those beneficiaries. Recovery shall be effected without delay and in accordance with the procedures of national law provided that they allow the immediate and effective execution of this Decision. \u2026\u2019 Article 6 states: \u2018France shall inform the Commission, within two months of notification of this Deci- sion, of the measures taken and to be taken in order to comply with it.\u2019 7 8 9 ",

France shall draw up a list of companies in receipt of aid under the scheme referred to in Article 1 which does not fulfil the conditions laid down by Regulation [No 69/2001], by the de minimis rules applicable at the time of grant of the aid, by Regulation [No 70/2001], by the 1979 communication on regional aid systems or by the 1998 guidelines on national regional aid. The list shall also specify the amount of aid each company has received.\u2019 Following various exchanges and reminders subsequent to the expiry of the two- month period laid down by the decision for the communication of the measures taken and to be taken for its implementation, the Commission, considering that the French Republic had still not given effect to the decision, decided to bring the present action. 10 11 ",
        "I - 8385 COMMISSION v FRANCE The action Arguments of the parties Arguments of the Commission The Commission complains that the French Republic has not recovered any aid in implementation of the decision. It states that it accepted that implementation in respect of the period between 1991 and 1993 is absolutely impossible because, due to a lack of available tax records for that period, the relevant recipients of the aid cannot be identified. It does not, however, accept that implementation is absolutely impossible in respect of the period since 1993. As regards the companies in receipt of aid which had ceased their activity, referred to in the exchanges on the implementation of the decision, the Commission claims that, in the case of a transfer of assets, it is necessary to examine the financial condi- tions of the transaction in order to ascertain that the transfer took place in accord- ance with market conditions. 12 13 14 15 ",
        "I - 8386 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-214/07 According to case-law, it is on that condition that the aid element can be regarded as included in the purchase price, so that the buyer cannot, in principle, be regarded as having benefited from an advantage (Case C-390/98 Banks [2001] ECR I-6117, paragraph 77, and Case C-277/00 Germany v Commission [2004] ECR I-3925, para- graph 80), since the benefit of the aid is retained by the vendor. Where there is no genuine market for certain goods transferred after the cessation of activity, other points of reference or criteria can be used to assess whether the aid has been transferred to the buyer. In any event, the recovery of aid cannot be dependent on an indication of the amount of the aid in the legal instrument transferring assets. Otherwise, it would be extremely easy to undermine the effectiveness of the rules on State aid. It would suffice for the parties to a transaction below market price to fail to mention the transfer of the aid in the contract. However, the assessment of whether the aid has been transferred to the buyer cannot depend only on the will of the parties to the transaction. The Commission points out that its complaint based on Article 10 EC must not be regarded as a complaint separate from that based on the failure to implement Art - icles 5 and 6 of the decision. It is simply intended to highlight the excessive delay on the part of the French authorities to comply with that decision. 16 17 18 19 ",
        "I - 8387 COMMISSION v FRANCE Arguments of the French Republic The French Republic considers that all possible measures have been taken in order to implement the decision. Nevertheless, recovery is impossible with regard to recipient undertakings which have ceased their activities. \u2014 Recovery of the aid from recipients which have not ceased their activities The French Republic lists various difficulties in identifying the recipients, in calcu- lating the amount of the aid to be recovered, and in the choice and implementa- tion of recovery procedures. In its submission, those difficulties amount to external constraints connected to the extent and complexity of the recovery process. The difficulties encountered in identifying the recipients were the result first of all, in respect of the 1991, 1992 and 1993 fiscal years, of the rule of national law whereby financial records need be retained only for a period of 10 years. In respect of later years, they were the result of the fact that the aid scheme did not necessarily involve a specific identification of the recipients in the context of a declaratory system. An inquiry at the competent territorial services was therefore necessary. 20 21 22 23 ",
        "I - 8388 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-214/07 The French Republic contends that, on 16 March 2005, it sent to the Commission a list of 55 companies which had received between 1994 and 2002 aid in a gross amount in excess of EUR 1 million and above the Community ceiling. It adds that, on 7 July 2006, in response to a letter from the Commission of 26 April 2006 requesting it to communicate the list of all companies which had benefited from a tax exemption exceeding EUR 100 000, it sent: \u2014 a list of 464 beneficiary companies not under a reimbursement obligation, pursuant to the Community provisions on de minimis aid, regional aid and aid to small and medium-sized enterprises (\u2018SMEs\u2019); \u2014 a list of 105 beneficiary companies which, pursuant to the decision, were obliged to repay net aid of less than EUR 200 000. In its rejoinder lodged on 22 October 2007, it appends a list of 88 companies required to repay aid exceeding EUR 200 000. 24 25 26 ",
        "I - 8389 COMMISSION v FRANCE As regards the difficulties encountered in determining the amount of aid to be re- covered, the French Republic relates them, in the first place, to Articles 2 and 3 of the decision. It maintains that the amount of aid to be recovered corresponds to the extent to which the exemptions did not fall within the scope of Articles 2 and 3. However, in its submission, as with the identification of the recipient companies, the deter- mination of the amount of the aid required information to be gathered from all the departmental tax directorates by consulting the entire tax files of the companies in question. The tax declarations made at national level did not include certain infor- mation necessary for the application of the Community rules on regional aid and aid in favour of SMEs. The French Republic points out that the Commission has allowed the application of those rules to be relaxed in certain ways and that, therefore, the competent author- ities were able to apply different calculations in order to determine the amount of aid to be recovered, corresponding to the amount of the exemption reduced by the amount of the aid covered by the Community provisions on de minimis aid, regional aid and aid in favour of SMEs. It contends in the second place that the determination of the amount of aid to be recovered has also been made more difficult by the need to obtain the cooperation of the companies concerned. The competent authorities, which had to regard the recovery claims as non-fiscal claims, did not have available to them under national 27 28 29 30 ",
        "I - 8390 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-214/07 law, with regard to such claims, a formalised procedure for communication such as is provided for in the case of fiscal claims. The cooperation of the companies concerned also appeared to be necessary in numerous cases where necessary information was not included in their tax files. As regards, finally, the difficulties related to recovery procedures, the French Republic states that the procedure applicable to non-fiscal claims required the successive intervention of three authorities: the Directorate-General for Taxes, responsible for the calculation of the debts to be recovered, the prefect, in his capacity as authorising officer for the claims and thus signatory of the orders for payment, and the auditors of the Directorate-General for Public Auditing, responsible for the recovery of the debts. It adds that, in the interests of efficiency, it was decided to group the claims by department, so that each prefect would be able to sign the orders for payment in respect of all the companies established in his department. In its rejoinder, the French Republic admits that, by that stage, the orders for payment had still not been issued. \u2014 Recovery of the aid from recipients which had ceased their activity The French Republic maintains that, during its exchanges with the Commission, it relied on the absolute impossibility of recovery vis-\u00e0-vis 204 recipients which had ceased their activity. 31 32 33 ",
        "I - 8391 COMMISSION v FRANCE It explains that the Commission none the less replied that: \u2014 in the case of transfer of a recipient\u2019s assets, it was necessary to ascertain that the transaction had taken place under market conditions, so as to avoid a transfer of aid to the buyer; \u2014 in consideration of the practical difficulties of that kind of examination for all the undertakings affected, it accepted that the review could be limited to the most significant asset transfers. It maintains that, with regard to both asset transfers which are privately negotiated and those taking place within the context of proceedings for compulsory reconstruc- tion and winding-up, the tax authorities are not able to determine whether the trans- fers at issue took place under normal market conditions. Although there is a market for immovable property, there is no market for second- hand industrial assets. There is, therefore, no available point of reference for such assets in order to ascertain a market price at the time of transfer. 34 35 36 ",
        "I - 8392 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-214/07 As a result, it is impossible to determine whether, in cases where an undertaking ceases activity, the transfer of assets involved a transfer of aid to the new buyer. The French Republic states furthermore that: \u2014 no recovery is possible where the undertaking has not found a buyer and, having simply ceased to exist, it no longer has a legal representative; \u2014 in certain cases, the assets may have been acquired by a number of different buyers. In any event, recovery is also hampered by legal obstacles. Thus, with regard to undertakings subject to collective proceedings, it is not possible to recover a debt which was not presented before the liquidator within the time-limit set. 37 38 39 40 ",
        "I - 8393 COMMISSION v FRANCE Concerning privately negotiated asset transfers from undertakings which have ceased their activity, the recovery of the aid would lack any legal basis where the transfer of aid to the buyer was not mentioned in the legal instrument transferring assets. The French Republic claims, therefore, that it is absolutely impossible for it to recover the aid granted to undertakings which have ceased their activity. Findings of the Court Recovery of the aid Where a negative decision is taken in a case of unlawful aid, the recovery of that aid, ordered by the Commission, takes place according to the conditions provided for in Article 14(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [88] of the EC Treaty (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1), which states: \u2018\u2026 recovery shall be effected without delay and in accordance with the procedures under the national law of the Member State concerned, provided that they allow the immediate and effective execution of the Commission\u2019s decision. To this effect and in the event of a procedure before national courts, the Member States concerned 41 42 43 ",
        "I - 8394 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-214/07 shall take all necessary steps which are available in their respective legal systems, including provisional measures, without prejudice to Community law.\u2019 According to settled case-law, the only defence available to a Member State in opposing an application by the Commission under Article 88(2) EC for a declaration that it has failed to fulfil its obligations is to plead that it was absolutely impossible for it properly to implement the decision (see, inter alia, Case C-177/06 Commission v Spain [2007] ECR I-7689, paragraph 46 and the cited case-law). In the event of difficulties, the Commission and the Member State must, pursuant to the rule imposing on the Member States and the Community institutions recip- rocal duties of genuine cooperation, which underlies, in particular, Article 10 EC, work together in good faith with a view to overcoming those difficulties whilst fully observing the Treaty provisions and, in particular, the provisions on State aid (see Case C-415/03 Commission v Greece [2005] ECR I-3875, paragraph 42 and the cited case-law). The condition that it be absolutely impossible to implement a decision is not fulfilled where the defendant Member State merely informs the Commission of the legal, political or practical difficulties involved in implementing the decision, without taking any real steps to recover the aid from the undertakings concerned, and without proposing to the Commission any alternative arrangements for implementing the decision which could have enabled those difficulties to be overcome (see, in particu- lar, Joined Cases C-485/03 to C-490/03 Commission v Spain [2006] ECR I-11887, paragraph 74 and the cited case-law). 44 45 46 ",
        "I - 8395 COMMISSION v FRANCE In the present case, it is necessary to note from the outset that, well beyond the period prescribed by Article 6 of the decision and the extensions granted by the Commis- sion during its exchanges with the defendant Member State, no sum had been recov- ered by the French Republic by the date the application was lodged, or even by the date the rejoinder was lodged, almost four years after the decision was adopted. \u2014 Recovery of the aid from recipients which have not ceased their activity As a preliminary point, it must be stated that the aid relating to the 1991 to 1993 financial years is not at issue in the present proceedings. In respect of that aid, the Commission, prior to commencing the action, had already accepted the absolute impossibility of recovery, a view which it expressly confirmed in its application. As to the remainder, the French Republic cannot reasonably claim that the difficul- ties alleged amount to external constraints. Those difficulties, concerning the identification of the recipients, the calculation of the amount of the aid to be recovered and the choice and implementation of recovery procedures, are internal difficulties caused by the national authorities\u2019 own acts or omissions. 47 48 49 50 ",
        "I - 8396 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-214/07 Faced with those internal difficulties, the national authorities entered into exchanges with the Commission. They thus replied to requests for information, described the difficulties encountered, suggested compromises which might resolve some of those difficulties, and requested instructions. However, their participation in the exchanges was first of all subject to successive significant delays. Above all, although the Commission had initially insisted, both in the second para- graph of Article 7 of the decision and in its later written requests, on the need to draw up a list of companies subject to recovery of the aid and to carry out actual recovery without delay, and then agreed to the application of the applicable Community rules being relaxed, the French authorities: \u2014 concerned themselves with communicating to it a list of 464 companies not required to make a reimbursement; \u2014 failed to carry out, as of the first quarter of 2005, genuine steps to ensure actual recovery from the 55 companies on the list communicated on 16 March 2005, which had received between 1994 and 2002 gross aid in excess of EUR 1 million and above the Community ceiling; 51 52 53 ",
        "I - 8397 COMMISSION v FRANCE \u2014 similarly failed, as of July 2006, to take such steps vis-\u00e0-vis the 105 companies on the list communicated on 7 July 2006, required to repay net aid of less than EUR 200 000; \u2014 communicated only on 22 October 2007, in an annex to the rejoinder lodged in the present proceedings, almost four years after the decision, a list of 88 com - panies required to repay aid in excess of EUR 200 000; \u2014 admitted, in that rejoinder, that the orders for payment had still not been issued, although an initial issue had been announced on 12 April 2006 with a deadline of 31 May 2006; \u2014 invoked a concern for efficiency to justify grouping the claims by department, without, however, that concern resulting in the issue of a single order for payment. As regards the recipients which have not ceased their activity, it thus appears from the above that there was no absolute impossibility to give effect to the decision and that the complaint based on an infringement of Article 5 of the decision is well founded. 54 ",
        "I - 8398 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-214/07 \u2014 Recovery of the aid from recipients which have ceased their activity The Commission has not, either in its exchanges prior to the present proceedings or in its application, complained that the defendant Member State has failed to imple- ment the decision with regard to the companies which simply disappeared without finding a buyer. Where an undertaking is subject to collective proceedings, the re-establishment of the previous situation and the elimination of the distortion of competition resulting from the unlawfully paid aid may, in principle, be achieved by registration of the liability relating to the repayment of the aid in question in the schedule of liabilities ( Germany v Commission , paragraph 85). If the period for the presentation of claims has expired, the national authorities must, where such a procedure exists and is still available, apply any procedure to lift a time-bar so as to allow, in individual cases, the presentation of claims out of time. As regards recipients which have ceased their activity and transferred their assets, it is for the national authorities to check whether the financial conditions of the transfer complied with market conditions. In such a case, the aid element was assessed at the market price and included in the purchase price, so that the buyer cannot be regarded as having benefited from an advantage in relation to other market operators ( Germany v Commission , para- graph 80). Otherwise, it cannot be ruled out that the transferee may, if necessary, 55 56 57 58 ",
        "I - 8399 COMMISSION v FRANCE be required to repay the aid in question where it is established that it continues to benefit from the competitive advantage linked with the receipt of the aid ( Germany v Commission , paragraph 86). For the purposes of checking the financial conditions of the transfer, the national authorities may take into consideration, in particular, the form of the transfer, for example, public tendering, deemed to ensure that a sale takes place under market conditions. They may also take into consideration, in particular, any expert\u2019s report prepared at the time of the transfer. Where the assets have been acquired by a number of different buyers, there is nothing in principle to prevent the financial conditions of each of the transactions from being checked for their compliance with market conditions. In the case of a privately negotiated transfer of assets, the recovery of the aid from the transferee cannot be dependent on an express reference in the legal instrument of a transfer of that aid. Recovery can take place where the transferee should have been aware of the existence of the aid and of a review procedure instituted by the Commission. 59 60 61 62 ",
        "I - 8400 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-214/07 In the light of the above, the defendant Member State may not, in order to avoid a declaration that it has failed to fulfil its obligations, simply make general and abstract statements without referring to specific individual cases, analysed in the light of all the steps actually taken to implement the decision. To allow the contrary would amount to precluding already a priori any implemen- tation with regard to the whole category of undertakings which have ceased their activity, whereas, in their case, an absolute impossibility of implementation may be accepted, where relevant, only on the basis of their individual circumstances. In the present case, the French Republic claimed, in its exchanges with the Commis- sion, an absolute impossibility of implementation vis-\u00e0-vis 204 undertakings which have ceased their activity. However, it provides no evidence that it has taken any concrete steps to examine the situation of each of them and to determine whether or not it necessitated recovery pursuant to the criteria set out above. It does not provide evidence even of having taken advantage of the Commission\u2019s acceptance, in the context of cooperation under Article 10 EC, of a review restricted only to the most significant asset transfers. In those circumstances, it must be concluded, also with regard to recipients that have ceased their activity, that there was no absolute impossibility of implementation 63 64 65 66 ",

Approximation of laws \u2014 Electronic communications networks and services \u2014 Access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities \u2014 Directive 2002/19 \u2014 Power of the national regulatory authority to encourage and where appropriate ensure adequate access and interconnection (European Parliament and Council Directive 2002/19, Art. 5(1), first subpara.) 1. By imposing on operators of public communications networks a general obligation to negotiate agreements for access to the telecommunications network, a Member State does not correctly transpose Article 4(1) of Dir - ective 2002/19 on access to, and intercon- nection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities, which concerns the obligation to negotiate interconnection with each other, and on that basis fails to fulfil its obligations under that directive. The second sentence of Article 4(1) of that directive allows operators to offer access and interconnection to other undertakings on terms and conditions consistent with obligations imposed by the national regulatory authority. Those obligations include the obliga- tions which that authority may impose under Article 8(2) of that directive on an operator designated as having significant market power on a specific market following a market analysis. In that regard, it is apparent from reading together Articles 8 and 12(1)(b) of that directive that an obligation to nego- tiate an agreement with undertakings in good faith may be imposed by national regulatory authorities on operators with significant market power, following an analysis of that market. However, the national law is not based on two sets of rules depending on the market power of the undertakings; rather, it leads to equal treatment of all oper- ators, without allowing the national regulatory authority to take account of the specific context before inter- vening or in the course of its examin- ation of the request by the undertaking seeking access to a telecommunications network. The consequence of the obli- gation provided for under national law to negotiate access agreements in good faith is to impose such an obligation without prior evaluation of the degree of effective competition on the market concerned. The national law also does not allow the obligation to be withdrawn or amended where competition in the market intensifies. Moreover, according to recital 19 of that directive, whilst increasing compe- tition, intervention by national regula- tory authorities must balance the rights of an infrastructure owner to exploit its infrastructure for its own benefit and the rights of other service providers to access facilities that are essential for the provision of competing services.

In the present proceedings, brought under Article 226 EC, the Commission of the Euro- pean Communities seeks from the Court of Justice a declaration that the Republic of Poland has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 4(1) and the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of Directive 2002/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on access to, and interconnec- tion of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (\u2018Access Directive\u2019 or \u2018Directive 2002/19\u2019). 2 2. The claim by the Commission, to the effect that the Republic of Poland has incor- rectly transposed provisions of Community law, calls for an analysis of the limited powers of intervention afforded to the public author- ities in liberalised markets, such as the tele- communications market. 1 \u2014 Original language: Spanish. 2 \u2014 OJ 2002 L 108, p. 7. 3. Far from exhibiting a neutral attitude, when the defendant Member State trans- posed Directive 2002/19 into national law, it took action to stimulate the opening-up process by imposing on every operator a statutory obligation to negotiate access to the network, but it did not make that obli- gation conditional on a prior analysis of competition. 4. The examination of the difficulties raised by the action and the provision of a consid- ered response entail a degree of complexity, since Polish law does not preclude agree- ments between undertakings 3 and, on the contrary, requires that, at the very least, negotiations must take place. 5. Moreover, in the absence of the desired outcome, Polish law authorises 3 \u2014 Article 3 of Directive 2002/19 calls on Member States to ensure that there are no restrictions which prevent under- takings from negotiating between themselves agreements on technical and commercial arrangements for access and/or interconnection, in accordance with Community law.

Community telecommunications law has developed on two fronts which, despite their close links, may be easily distinguished by those affected. 11. Thus, in addition to the legislation applicable to operators, where the rules on interconnection and competition are inter- twined, there is another, more diffuse sphere which governs the rights of users in accord- ance with the principles of liberalisation of the sector and of guaranteeing universal service, and takes on particular significance when it affects the fundamental freedoms of individuals. 9 12. The present case clearly comes within the first of those spheres. 13. In accordance with Article 4(1) of the Access Directive: \u2018Operators of public communications networks shall have a right and, when 9 \u2014 It would be appropriate to cite, by way of example, the protection of personal data and respect for privacy on the Internet. requested by other undertakings so author- ised, an obligation to negotiate intercon- nection with each other for the purpose of providing publicly available electronic communications services, in order to ensure provision and interoperability of services throughout the Community. Operators shall offer access and interconnection to other undertakings on terms and conditions consistent with obligations imposed by the national regulatory authority pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7 and 8.\u2019 14.

In particular, without prejudice to measures that may be taken regarding undertakings with significant market power in accordance ",
        "I - 8409 COMMISSION v POLAND with Article 8, national regulatory authorities shall be able to impose, to the extent that it is necessary, obligations: (a) on undertakings that control access to end-users, including in justified cases the obligation to interconnect their networks where this is not already the case, in order to ensure end-to-end connectivity; (b) on operators to provide access to the other facilities referred to in Annex I, Part II on fair, reasonable and non- discriminatory terms and to ensure accessibility for end-users to digital radio and television broadcasting ser - vices specified by the Member State in question. 15. Although Article 18 of the Access Dir - ective set 24 July 2003 as the deadline for Member States to adopt and publish the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with its provisions, the act of accession of the Republic of Poland 10 extended the time-limit for transposition until 30 April 2004.

In order to prevent laxity, Article 27(1) provides that the president of the Urzad Komunikacji Electronicznej (Electronic Communications Authority; \u2018UKE\u2019) may indicate a time-limit for the decision-making process, which must not exceed 90 days from the request to conclude an access contract. 10 \u2014 Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the European Union is founded (OJ 2003 L 236, p. 987). 11 \u2014 Law of 16 July 2004 (Dz.

If the negotiations do not commence, if access to the telecommunications network is refused, or if the time-limit indicated expires, either party may request the president of the UKE to adopt a decision regarding the matters pending or to define the terms of the collaboration (Article 27(2)), and must include in its request a draft access contract stating the respective positions of the parties and the contractual terms which are the subject of disagreement (Article 27(3)). 19. When adopting a decision, the presi- dent of the UKE must take into account the interests of users, the obligations imposed on undertakings, the promotion of modern telecommunications services, the nature of the matters in dispute, the feasibility of the proposals and the alternative solutions, paying particular attention to the technical and economic aspects of access. 12 The presi- dent must also take extreme care to maintain the integrity and interoperability of services, by ensuring that there are no discrimin- atory conditions and that competition may develop. 13 12 \u2014 Article 28(1)(1), (2), (3) and (4). 13 \u2014 Article 28(1)(5). 20.

In its reply of 25 May 2005, the Polish Government maintained that those articles are lawful, argued that the extension of the obligation to negotiate is necessary in order to reduce the costs borne by independent operators of building new infrastructure, and acknowledged that the provisions of the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) had been indir- ectly transposed. 26. The Commission was not satisfied with those explanations and, on 4 July 2006, sent the Member State a reasoned opinion. On 4 September 2006, Poland challenged that opinion on the grounds that, although the Access Directive does not expressly provide that the obligation to negotiate access contracts must be laid down in law, that obligation encourages sustainable competi- tion and promotes interoperability, thereby protecting consumers. Accordingly, that obligation is based on the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of the Access Directive, which is a programmatic provision calling on the regulatory authorities to ensure access to and interconnection with the network. 27. On 8 May 2007, the Commission brought the present proceedings under the second subparagraph of Article 226 EC. The applicant institution and the defendant Member State have maintained their respect- ive positions throughout the proceedings. ",

Since neither party requested a hearing before the expiry of the period for making such a request, after the general meeting of 6 May 2008, the proceedings were ready for the drafting of an opinion. IV \u2014 Analysis of the complaints of failure to fulfil obligations A \u2014 Introduction 29. Since the dawn of the liberalisation of telecommunications, the Commission has made clear its concern about access to essen- tial facilities and has taken action in cases of abuse where undertakings with exclu- sive rights to the infrastructure required to provide a service refuse to allow competitors access to that infrastructure. 30. The adoption of liberal principles also necessitated the opening-up of the arrange- ments for entering the market and, to ensure that a flexible system of access was a reality, Community law provided for the amend- ment of the traditional definition of access. 31. However, the implementation of freedom of competition alone was not suffi- cient to establish fair competition. The de facto monopoly of former public operators and their long-held rights, together with their detailed knowledge of the market and the privileged position they had occupied, meant that it was necessary to encourage the emer- gence of other undertakings, by introducing accompanying measures in their favour. 32. The doctrine of essential facilities 19 is set out in the Commission Notice on the applica- tion of the competition rules to access agree- ments in the telecommunications sector (\u2018Access Notice\u2019), 20 which seeks to promote the interconnection of new operators with equal rights to the existing telecommunica- tions infrastructure and networks, owned, in most cases, by the former monopolists. 33. In that connection, the Access Notice sets out the following requirements, which are to be taken cumulatively: the facility in question is regarded as \u2018essential\u2019, in the sense that it is vital in order to be able to compete 19 \u2014 Doherty, B., Just what are essential facilities? , CMLR, 2001, pp. 397 to 436, and Richer, L., Le droit \u00e0 la paresse?

In a case which did not concern tele- communications, the Court held that, if a facility is regarded as essential, the owner must negotiate use of the facility with other undertakings, provided that the nature of their business means that they require access to the facility. However, that finding was tempered by a number of conditions which require strict interpretation and are designed to prevent abuses of a dominant position (Article 82 EC). 22 35. Access agreements are privileged mech- anisms for the attainment of unimpeded competition, and, accordingly, the Commis- sion reserved to itself the right to resolve 21 \u2014 Many of those restrictions, identified in United States case- law, are set out in paragraph 91 of the Access Notice. 22 \u2014 In Case C-7/97 Bronner [1998] ECR I-7791, the Court analysed the earlier case-law (judgments in Joined Cases 6/73 and 7/73 Commercial Solvents v Commission [1974] ECR 223; Case 311/84 CBEM [1985] ECR 3261; and Joined Cases C-241/91 P and C-242/91 P RTE and ITP v Commis\u00ad sion [1995] ECR I-743) and held that the refusal by the proprietor of the only nationwide newspaper home-delivery scheme to allow another publisher to carry out distribution, where other methods exist, such as by post and through sale in shops and at kiosks, and, moreover, where there are no technical, legal or economic obstacles making it impossible, or difficult, for competitors to provide their own delivery system, does not constitute abuse of a dominant position. disputes with a Community dimension, 23 while conferring on national courts respon- sibility for resolving disputes without such a dimension. 36. Recital 5 in the preamble to Direct- ive 2002/19 states that, in an open and competitive market, there should be no restrictions that prevent undertakings from negotiating, particularly when the agree- ments concerned have a cross-border dimen- sion, and stipulates that, in principle , 24 negotiations should take place on a commer- cial basis and in good faith. 37. However, all State intervention in this sector is aimed at safeguarding a number of public interests, such as the promotion of development, the operation of the networks, and territorial, economic and social cohesion. 38. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to restrict a market economy without cause, since its limitation is justified only in the interests of the aims pursued by Community law and in accordance with the principles of appropriateness and proportionality. 23 \u2014 Paragraph 26 of the Access Notice. 24 \u2014 Emphasis added. ",
        "I - 8414 OPINION OF MR RUIZ-JARABO \u2014 CASE C-227/07 39. Thus, recital 9 in the preamble to Dir - ective 2002/19 states that \u2018[m]andating access to network infrastructure can be justi- fied as a means of increasing competition, but national regulatory authorities need to balance the rights of an infrastructure owner to exploit its infrastructure for its own benefit, and the rights of other service providers to access facilities that are essential for the provision of competing services\u2026\u2019. 40. In that regard, the Commission claims that there has been a twofold failure by the Republic of Poland to fulfil its obligations under Directive 2002/19: first, the Commis- sion complains that the Law governs the powers of the national regulatory authority in such a way that it provides for compul- sory negotiation; second, the Commis- sion complains that the national regulatory authority does not have the power to achieve certain objectives. B \u2014 The first complaint of failure to fulfil obligations 41. The Commission complains that Article 4(1) of Directive 2002/19 was incor- rectly transposed because Poland: (1) imposes on undertakings a statutory obli- gation to conclude agreements, while the Directive provides that that is a specific obligation to remedy an irregular situation, which is binding exclusively on the national regulatory authority; (2) does not take into account the circumstances prevailing in the sector and does not differentiate between operators according to their influence; and (3) confuses the obligation to negotiate inter- connection, laid down by the Directive, with the conclusion of an access contract. 42. In the current state of telecommunica- tions in the European Union, ex ante obliga- tions are lawful only when required by the market where freedom of competition is at serious risk. 43. The Access Directive takes up that challenge and states clearly in recital 13 in its preamble, that \u2018\u2026 [t]he aim is to reduce ex ante sector specific rules progressively as competition in the market develops\u2026\u2019, although it does not discount that option where the emergence of new technologies gives rise to a bottleneck which calls for its application, for example, in the field of broadband access networks. 44. Recital 27 in the preamble to the Frame- work Directive offers some clarification, stating that there is not effective competition ",
        "I - 8415 COMMISSION v POLAND in markets where one or more undertakings operate with significant market power, when national and Community law remedies \u2018are not sufficient to address the problem\u2019. 45. The situation evolved over the years until such time as the Framework Direct- ive declared that \u2018the conditions for effect- ive competition in the telecommunications sector\u2019 had been successfully created.\u2019 25 46. Accordingly, the inclusion in the Law transposing the Community legislation 26 of an obligation to conclude agreements is contradictory and is incompatible with the fundamental principle to the effect that, by this time, freedom of competition must be established as an undisputable reality. 25 \u2014 Recital 1. 26 \u2014 Even though the action relates to the Access Directive, the fact that that directive is based on the Framework Directive cannot be ignored. 47. It might be possible to seek justification in the argument that the starting point for the Polish legislature was an absence of genuine freedom in the light of signs which distorted its market, but those uncertainties are swiftly dispelled by the argument that, in that case, the transposition effected by the Polish legis- lature would have been of a legal provision other than the Access Directive, which is part of the \u2018new regulatory framework\u2019. 48. Community law does not ignore reac- tions to certain unusual ailments which are liable to infect healthy competition. 49. However, in order to diagnose any defi- ciencies and prescribe the appropriate treat- ment in each case, there is a need for special- ised, impartial bodies, such as the national regulatory authorities which are entrusted with those tasks by Directive 2002/19. 50. At national level, Article 12(1) provides that it is for the national regulatory authority, rather than the legislature, to ensure that operators meet reasonable requests for access ",
        "I - 8416 OPINION OF MR RUIZ-JARABO \u2014 CASE C-227/07 to, and use of, specific network elements and associated facilities. 51. Moreover that obligation extends only to the cases listed non-restrictively in the article, such as where access is denied or where unreasonable terms and conditions having a similar effect would hinder the emergence of a sustainable competitive market at the retail level. 52. Those corrective measures include the obligation \u2018to negotiate in good faith with undertakings requesting access\u2019 (Article 12(1)(b) of Directive 2002/19), together with an assessment of whether such obligations would be appropriate and proportionate to the objectives set out in Article 8 of the Framework Directive (Article 12(2) of Dir - ective 2002/19), which the national regula- tory authority must perform in accordance with realistic technological and economic criteria and in the interests of appropriate protection. 27 27 \u2014 Article 12(2) refers to the technical and economic viability of using or installing competing facilities, in the light of the rate of market development, taking into account the nature and type of interconnection and access involved; the feasi- bility of providing the access proposed; the initial invest- ment by the facility owner; the need to safeguard compe- tition in the long term; any relevant intellectual property rights; and the provision of pan-European services. 53. Community law does not require the automatism imposed by the legislature of the Republic of Poland; on the contrary, Community law provides that independent bodies should decide what is appropriate in each case, after analysing the market. 28 54. The attitude of the Polish State there- fore halts the dynamism inherent in a sector which is constantly changing as a result of the continuous advances in the field of elec- tronic communications. 55. In view of the likelihood that competition will develop at different speeds, according to the market segment and the Member State, it must also be possible to withdraw obli- gations, to which end national regulatory authorities should be able to relax regulatory obligations where competition is delivering the desired results (recital 13 in the preamble to the Access Directive). 29 28 \u2014 Furthermore, Article 16(3) of the Framework Direct- ive provides that where a national regulatory authority concludes that the market is effectively competitive, it must not impose or maintain the specific obligations referred to in paragraph 2 (which include, by reference, the obligations set out in Article 8 of the Access Directive). 29 \u2014 Article 8 of the Access Directive, although it applies to different obligations (the ones laid down in Articles 9 to 13), provides that national regulatory authorities must have the power to amend or withdraw such obligations. ",
        "I - 8417 COMMISSION v POLAND 56. The Polish Law is incompatible with that need for flexibility, since, by providing for the restrictions concerned, it freezes the degree of regulation, thereby preventing the inde- pendent regulatory authority from smoth- ering the flames of intervention. 57. The Access Directive lays down the obli- gations of all operators in accordance with the principles of transparency and publicity, 30 although it places particular emphasis on the obligations relating to undertakings with \u2018significant market power\u2019, 31 a term which, in my opinion, illustrates the transition from monopoly to liberalisation and is better suited than the term \u2018dominant position\u2019 to a sector unburdened by mercantilism. 58. Although the provision of intercon- nection is defined in general terms, there is an asymmetry in the applicable conditions which vary according to the market power 30 \u2014 Saracci, F., L\u2019interconnexion, objet du droit communautaire des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications:exemple de r\u00e9gulation (application compar\u00e9e France\u00adItalie) , Atelier national de reproduction de th\u00e8ses, 2004, p. 97, points out that telecommunications are invigorated by the traditional principles of Community law, such as equality and non-discrimination, classified by the Court as fundamental rights (judgments in Joined Cases 117/76 and 16/77 Ruckdeschel [1977] ECR 1753, and Case 149/77 Defrenne [1978] ECR 1365). 31 \u2014 Under Article 14(2) of the Framework Directive, an under- taking has significant market power if, either individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a position equivalent to dom - inance, with economic strength such that it may behave to an appreciable extent independently of competitors, customers and ultimately consumers. of the undertaking concerned; initially, as regards an undertaking with significant market power, no additional market analysis is required 32 but merely a justification as to the appropriateness of those conditions. 33 59. Article 8 of the Access Directive refers explicitly to the concept of \u2018an operator\u2026 having significant market power on a specific market\u2019, and is the subject of two references from other provisions of the directive. 60. Article 4 of the Access Directive makes the offer of access and interconnection conditional on obligations imposed by the national regulatory authority in accordance with Article 8. 61. Article 12, which lays down the obliga- tion to negotiate in good faith, also refers to Article 8, in that the obligations imposed by national regulatory authorities must comply with its provisions. 32 \u2014 Which is based in general terms on Article 16 of Directive 2002/21. 33 \u2014 Recital 15 in the preamble to Directive 2002/19.

        "I - 8418 OPINION OF MR RUIZ-JARABO \u2014 CASE C-227/07 62. However, the Polish Law does not provide for two sets of rules depending on the market power of the undertaking concerned. 63. Furthermore, the fact that the Polish Law treats \u2018access\u2019 34 and \u2018interconnec- tion\u2019 35 in the same way for the purposes of Article 4(1) of Directive 2002/19 unquestion- ably supports the claim that Poland has failed to fulfil its obligations. 36 64. Interconnection concerns relationships between individuals, is similar in nature to a private law institution, 37 and constitutes a mechanism for interaction between differ- ently designed networks. 65. By contrast, the concept of access gives rise to more far-reaching legal effects than the simple interconnection of infrastruc- tures, in that it entails making available a 34 \u2014 Defined in Article 2(a) of Directive 2002/19. 35 \u2014 Defined in Article 2(b) of Directive 2002/19. 36 \u2014 It is surprising that Article 2(6)(a) of the Polish Law on tele- communications describes connection as another element of access. 37 \u2014 Saracci, F., op. cit. , p. 106, and Strubel, X., Br\u00e8ves observa\u00ad tions sur la nature juridique du contrat d\u2019interconnexion de r\u00e9seaux de t\u00e9l\u00e9comunications , Lex Electronica, No 4/1998, in www.lex-electronica.org. whole range of facilities or services, including interconnection, which is a specific type of access implemented between public network operators (Article 2(b), in fine, of Directive 2002/19). 66. In that regard, the disputed provision does not comply with the requirements of the principle of minimum intervention, which reflects the principle of proportionality, a concept which has been clearly defined in the case-law of the Court 38 and is founded on appropriateness, necessity and the cost- benefit relationship. 67. The argument of the Government of Poland, to the effect that telecommunica- tions companies have accepted its legisla- tion without complaint, is irrelevant, since individuals are unable to monitor the correct application of Community law, in the same way as mere administrative practices, which 38 \u2014 In my view, the following early cases are worthy of note: Case 11/70 Internationale Handelgesellschaft [1970] ECR 1125; Case 5/73 Balkan [1973] ECR 1091; Case 36/75 Rutili [1975] ECR 1219; Case 118/75 Watson and Belmann [1976] ECR 1185; Case 114/76 Bela M\u00fchle [1977] ECR 1211; Case 122/78 Buitoni [1979] ECR 677; Case 240/78 Atalanta [1979] ECR 2137; and Case 44/79 Hauer [1979] ECR 3727.

Therefore, the mechanisms provided for in the Polish Law on telecommunica- tions differ from the ones set out in the Access Directive. The Polish Law is incom- patible with the directive in that it converts the exception into the rule, treats the possi- bility for the national regulatory authority to require the negotiation of interconnection in the same way as a general obligation to conclude access contracts, and, furthermore, imposes on the regulatory authority an obli- gation to intervene which the authority is unable to withdraw or even amend.

Although I agree with the defendant Government that Article 8 of the Framework Directive is drafted in extremely general terms, the particular legislative technique used for directives occasionally creates a high degree of abstraction in order to allow the Member States sufficient latitude and thereby maintain their effectiveness. 72. In any event, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Article 8 lay down, respectively, the 40 \u2014 Article 5 of Directive 2002/19 refers to the objectives in Article 8 of Directive 2002/21. ",

In the judgment in Centro Europa 7 41 (paragraph 81), the Court held that Article 8 of the Framework Directive places on the Member States the obligation to ensure that the national regulatory authorities take all reasonable measures aimed at promoting effective, unimpeded competition in the provision of electronic communications ser - vices. That finding does not support the mere programmatic nature which Poland asserts is attributable to the provision. 74. In that connection, the uniform appli- cation of Community law and the principle of equality require that the terms and the scope of a provision must also be applied uniformly, particularly where that provision makes no express reference to the law of the Member States. 42 75. The Court has explained that the trans- position of Community legislation into national law does not necessarily require the Community provision to be enacted in 41 \u2014 Case C-380/05 Centro Europa 7 [2008] ECR I-349. 42 \u2014 Judgments in Case 327/82 Ekro [1984] ECR 107; Case C-287/98 Linster [2000] ECR I-6917; and Case C-195/06 \u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk [2007] ECR I-8817. precisely the same words and it will suffice if the legal context ensures the full application of the Community provision in a sufficiently clear and precise manner. 43 76. The argument to the effect that activities incompatible with the Community provi- sions do not take place within the Member State concerned does not justify the absence of applicable provisions in national law. 44 77. For the purposes of resolving the diffi- culty, it must be noted that Article 5(1) of the Access Directive imposes on regulatory authorities the continuing obligation 45 to analyse the market in order to encourage and ensure adequate access and interconnection, and interoperability of services. 78. Accordingly, the authorisation which the Commission complains is absent from the Polish Law must be aimed not only at 43 \u2014 Judgment in Case 252/85 Commission v France [1988] ECR 2243. 44 \u2014 Judgment in Case C-339/87 Commission v Netherlands [1990] ECR I-851. 45 \u2014 On this point, I agree with the arguments put forward by the Polish Government.

Article 5 of Directive 2002/19 provides, \u2018[i]n particular\u2019, for a number of obligations which the regulatory authorities must be in a position to impose in order to ensure end-to- end connectivity and access for end-users to digital radio and television broadcasting ser - vices (second subparagraph of Article 5(1)). 80. However, those obligations are not laid down in a restricted manner but rather in a way which allows national regulatory author- ities sufficient latitude to impose them in conditions of efficiency, sustainable competi- tion, and maximum benefit to end-users. 81. That view is borne out by the judgment of the Court in Telef\u00f3nica de Espa\u00f1a , 46 which concerned the powers of national 46 \u2014 Case C-79/00 Telef\u00f3nica de Espa\u00f1a [2001] ECR I-10075. regulatory authorities under Directive 97/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1997 on interconnec- tion in telecommunications with regard to ensuring universal service and interoper- ability through application of the principles of Open Network Provision. 47 82.

In the light of those factors, which demonstrate that the powers of the regula- tory authorities are not clearly defined, the argument of the Commission is vitiated by a lack of proof 52 and is incompatible with the complaint that Article 5 of the Access Dir - ective was incorrectly transposed, since, in line with the foregoing considerations, Art - icles 26 to 30 of the Polish Law on telecom- munications afford the national regulatory authority wide powers of intervention. 53 84. In addition, although I agree with the applicant that it is not appropriate to make those powers conditional on the existence of a prior dispute between operators, it is not possible to infer a prohibition in those terms from the Access Directive, since, although Articles 26 to 30 of the Polish Law are restricted to the context of an adminis- trative procedure, that is not the case with Article 45 of the Law, which expressly calls on the president of the UKE to lay down the necessary regulatory obligations to comply with the requirements of Article 1(2) and (3) of the Law on telecommunications, which are the same as the ones set out in Article 8 of the Framework Directive. 52 \u2014 In Case C-387/06 Commission v Finland , an action for failure to fulfil obligations the facts of which were similar to those of the present case, the Court dismissed the claim that the national provision restricted the powers of the regulatory authority on the grounds that the Commission had neither analysed the provision in detail nor proved that the national body was unable to adopt the measures required to achieve the aims of Article 8 of the Framework Directive. 53 \u2014 Leaving aside the fact that those articles infringe the dir - ective, which is the reason why it is appropriate to uphold the first complaint of failure to fulfil obligations. 85.

Legal context Community law Recital 6 in the preamble to that directive states: \u2018In markets where there continue to be large differences in negotiating power between undertakings, and where some undertakings rely on infrastructure provided by others for delivery of their services, it is appropriate to establish a framework to ensure that the market functions effectively. National regulatory authorities should have the power to secure, where commercial negotiation fails, adequate access and interconnection and interoperability of services in the interest of end-users. In particular, they may ensure end-to-end connectivity by imposing proportionate obli- gations on undertakings that control access to end-users. Control of means of access may entail ownership or control of the physical link to the end-user (either fixed or mobile), and/or the ability to change or withdraw the national number or numbers needed to access an end-user\u2019s network termination point. This would be the case for example if network operators were to restrict unreasonably end-user choice for access to Internet portals and services.\u2019 2 ",
        "I - 8427 COMMISSION v POLAND Recital 14 states: \u2018Directive 97/33/EC laid down a range of obligations to be imposed on undertakings with significant market power, namely transparency, non-discrimination, accounting separation, access, and price control including cost orientation. This range of possible obligations should be maintained but, in addition, they should be established as a set of maximum obligations that can be applied to undertakings, in order to avoid over- regulation. Exceptionally, in order to comply with international commitments or Community law, it may be appropriate to impose obligations for access or intercon- nection on all market players, as is currently the case for conditional access systems for digital television services.\u2019 According to recital 19 of the directive: \u2018Mandating access to network infrastructure can be justified as a means of increasing competition, but national regulatory authorities need to balance the rights of an infrastructure owner to exploit its infrastructure for its own benefit, and the rights of other service providers to access facilities that are essential for the provision of competing services. Where obligations are imposed on operators that require them to meet reasonable requests for access to and use of networks elements and associ- ated facilities, such requests should only be refused on the basis of objective criteria such as technical feasibility or the need to maintain network integrity. Where access is refused, the aggrieved party may submit the case to the dispute resolutions pro - cedure referred to in Articles 20 and 21 of Directive 2002/21/EC [of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) (OJ 2002 L 108, p. 33; \u201cthe Framework Directive\u201d)].

        "I - 8443 COMMISSION v POLAND The pre-litigation procedure By letter of formal notice sent on 21 March 2005, the Commission informed the Republic of Poland of its concerns regarding the transposition into national law of Article 4(1) and the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of the Access Directive. That Member State replied to it by letter of 20 May 2005. On 4 July 2006, the Commission issued a reasoned opinion requesting that Member State to take the measures necessary to comply with the opinion within two months of its receipt. The Polish authorities replied to that opinion on 4 September 2006. As it was not satisfied with that reply, the Commission decided to institute these proceedings. The action The first complaint, alleging non\u00adconformity of Article 26 of the Law on telecommuni\u00ad cations with Article 4(1) of the Access Directive Arguments of the parties In its first plea, the Commission contends that the obligation to negotiate intercon- nection laid down in Article 4(1) of the Access Directive applies to all operators of 21 22 23 ",
        "I - 8444 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-227/07 public telecommunications networks and concerns the interconnection of networks. The latter is a particular type of access which is implemented between the various operators of public networks and does not involve any other form of access. The national regulatory authority only intervenes in exceptional circumstances. In the Commission\u2019s view, it follows from recitals 6 and 14 and Articles 8(3), 5(1) and 12 of the Access Directive that, first of all, an evaluation must be carried out to deter- mine whether the market concerned is subject to ex ante regulation and to assess the level of competition on that market. Secondly, the national regulatory authorities are required to take account of a range of factors and to examine the impact of the access obligation on long-term competition in that market. Thirdly, under Article 5(1) of the Access Directive, national regulatory authorities must be expressly empowered to impose an obligation to negotiate access to telecommunications networks on all operators, including those without significant market power. Fourthly, one of the basic tenets of the Community legal framework for electronic communications is the principle that intervention by national regulatory authorities is limited to those cases where free market mechanisms are not functioning or are not leading to satisfactory results. According to the Commission, however, Article 26(1) of the Law on telecommunica- tions has the effect of imposing a general obligation to negotiate in good faith agree- ments on access to telecommunications networks. In the Commission\u2019s view, the significance of such an obligation being imposed by statute is not only that the regulatory authority is not required to ascertain whether the imposition of that obligation encourages access to telecommunications networks, but also that it entails no weighing-up of the interests of the operator of the network concerned and of the undertakings seeking access to that network and no assess- ment of the effect of imposing that obligation in a particular market. The authority is also not required to indicate whether the conditions laid down in Article 5(1) of the Access Directive have been satisfied. 24 25 26 ",
        "I - 8445 COMMISSION v POLAND Furthermore, the Commission maintains that the Republic of Poland\u2019s position is based on two false premises. The first is that the Access Directive provides that the regulatory authority may require any operator of a telecommunications network to negotiate access to that network, without taking account of the actual situation. The second is that the fact of holding negotiations is not very onerous for operators of telecommunications networks, since it has no effect on their investment decisions and thus on the conditions of competition. Finally, the Commission submits, first, that the approach under the Polish Law on telecommunications does not enable the principle of legal certainty to be imple- mented more effectively than the approach under the Access Directive, and, further- more, that the latter directive does not provide for a right to require negotiations to be opened, but merely for the national regulatory authority to be empowered to impose, following a market analysis, an obligation to negotiate on operators of tele- communications networks with significant market power or, in certain cases, on any operator. The Republic of Poland contests the merits of this first complaint. It submits that interpreting the Access Directive on the basis of its purpose and function leads to the conclusion that, by laying down an obligation to enter into negotiations not only for the purposes of interconnection of telecommunications networks, but also for the purpose of access to those networks, the provisions of Article 26 of the Law on telecommunications are not contrary to Article 4(1) of that directive. In that regard, that Member State maintains, first of all, that requiring an operator of a telecommunications network to enter into negotiations with an undertaking which seeks access to that network constitutes a form of encouraging access to telecom- munications networks, since maximum utilisation of existing infrastructures by all interested parties can thereby be achieved. 27 28 29 30 ",
        "I - 8446 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-227/07 The Member State further maintains that the approach by which national bodies are given powers to require such an operator to enter into negotiations at the request of an undertaking wishing to access the network in question and its own approach of guaranteeing to such an undertaking the right to require that negotiations will be entered into lead to similar results for that operator. Secondly, the Republic of Poland takes the view that its approach is the best way of implementing the principle of legal certainty, since operators are able to ascertain precisely the extent of their obligations under the Law on telecommunications. The Member State also submits that it can be inferred from recital six and from the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of the Access Directive that any undertaking has the de facto right to request the operator of a public telecommunications network to hold negotiations on access to that network and that, if it fails to do so, the under- taking can apply to the regulatory authority. As a result, the decision of the regula- tory authority by which the operator concerned is required to enter into negotiations may be regarded as declaratory in nature since it confirms the existence of an obliga- tion on the operator to that effect, and thus the undertaking\u2019s corresponding right to require access. Therefore, this right and the symmetrical obligation on operators to which it gives rise are fully justified by the purpose of the directive. Finally, according to the Member State, during the three years in which the Law on telecommunications has been in force, there have been no undesirable effects either on operators or on the development of competition as a result of it. 31 32 33 34 ",
        "I - 8447 COMMISSION v POLAND Findings of the Court It should be noted at the outset that the Republic of Poland accepts that Article 26(1) of the Law on telecommunications is a general statutory provision requiring any operator of a public telecommunications network to negotiate in good faith the conclusion of an agreement on access to that network at the request of any under- taking wishing to obtain such access, since such negotiations relate not only to agree- ments on interconnection but also to agreements governing access to the network. It must be borne in mind that the obligation on all operators of public telecommuni- cations networks to negotiate when requested by other undertakings so authorised, as is apparent from Article 4(1) of the Access directive, concerns interconnection which, in accordance with the definition provided in Article 2(b) of that directive, \u2018is a specific type of access implemented between public network operators\u2019. Contrary to Article 26 of the Law on telecommunications, this obligation therefore does not concern other forms of access to networks, such as those defined in Article 2(a) of the directive and those provided for in the Law on telecommunications. It must also be pointed out that the second sentence of Article 4(1) of the Access Directive allows operators to offer access and interconnection to other undertak- ings on terms and conditions consistent with obligations imposed by the national regulatory authority. Those obligations include the obligations which that authority may impose under Article 8(2) of the Access Directive on an operator designated as having significant market power on a specific market following a market analysis. 35 36 37 ",
        "I - 8448 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-227/07 In that regard, it is apparent from reading together Articles 8 and 12(1)(b) of the Access Directive that an obligation to negotiate an agreement with undertakings in good faith may be imposed by national regulatory authorities on operators with significant market power, following an analysis of that market. As the Advocate General has pointed out in point 62 of his Opinion, Article 26 of the Law on telecommunications is not based on two sets of rules depending on the market power of the undertakings; rather, it leads to equal treatment of all operators, without allowing the national regulatory authority to take account of the specific context before intervening or in the course of its examination of the request by the undertaking seeking access to a telecommunications network. The consequence of the obligation provided in the Law on telecommunications to negotiate access agreements in good faith is to impose such an obligation without prior evaluation of the degree of effective competition on the market concerned. The Law also does not allow the obligation to be withdrawn or amended where competi- tion in the market intensifies. Moreover, according to recital 19 of the Access Directive, whilst increasing compe- tition, intervention by national regulatory authorities must balance the rights of an infrastructure owner to exploit its infrastructure for its own benefit and the rights of other service providers to access facilities that are essential for the provision of competing services. Furthermore, under Article 12(2) of the Access Directive, intervention by national regulatory authorities is circumscribed by the need take account of the factors set out in that provision, including the need to safeguard competition in the long-term and 38 39 40 41 42 ",
        "I - 8449 COMMISSION v POLAND to assess the proportionality of obligations which that authority intends to impose as regards access to specific network elements and their use in relation to the objectives set out in Article 8 of the Framework Directive. By not providing for intervention by the national regulatory authority prior to im- position of an obligation to negotiate access agreements, the Law on telecommunica- tions does not allow for any assessment of the circumstances in accordance with the factors set out in Article 12(2). It follows that, by imposing on operators of public communications networks a general obligation to negotiate agreements for access to the telecommunications network, the Republic of Poland has not correctly transposed Article 4(1) of the Access Directive. This finding is not undermined by the Member State\u2019s argument to the effect that a more dynamic and purposive approach to interpreting the directive would enable a more rapid development of technologies to take place. Indeed, the national regulatory authority should intervene only to ensure efficient functioning of the market. To that end, the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of the Access Directive provides that the authority is under a duty to promote efficiency and sustainable competition and to give the maximum benefit to end-users. 43 44 45 46 ",
        "I - 8450 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-227/07 As regard the Member State\u2019s argument that the Law on telecommunications strengthens observance of the principle of legal certainty, it suffices to state that this principle does not permit any derogation from the rules laid down by the Access Directive. It follows from the foregoing that the first complaint is well founded. Accordingly, it must be held that by not transposing Article 4(1) of the Access Dir - ective correctly, the Republic of Poland has failed to fulfil its obligations under that directive. The second complaint, based on non\u00adconformity of the Law on telecommunications with the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of the Access Directive Arguments of the parties By its second complaint, the Commission submits that Articles 26 to 30 of the Law on telecommunications do not ensure correct transposition of first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of the Access Directive. It is apparent from those Articles 26 to 30 and from Articles 45 and 136 of the Law that all operators of public communications networks are required to negotiate access to those networks and that the president of the national regulatory authority may decide on the time-limit for closure of this type of negotiations and that, if the parties fail to reach an agreement, the president may, at the request of one of the parties, adopt a decision granting access which will 47 48 49 50 ",
        "I - 8451 COMMISSION v POLAND replace the access agreement on the points to which the decision relates and may thus impose obligations on undertakings irrespective of their position in the market. In this regard, the Commission maintains, first of all, that Article 5(1) of the Access Directive cannot be implemented by a general statutory provision, since it requires national regulatory authorities to be empowered to act only in certain cases. This power is limited by the reference to the objectives set out in Article 8 of the Frame- work Directive and by the requirements imposed under Article 5(3) of the Access Directive. Article 5(1) is not a mere programmatic provision, but a provision indi- cating the decisions which the national regulatory authorities must be empowered to take. It is an exception to the general principle enshrined in Article 8 of the Access Directive, which must be interpreted restrictively. Secondly, it submits that Article 5(4) of the Access Directive does not by itself permit regulatory obligations to be imposed on all undertakings, but only on those with significant market power, or, irrespective of their market power, in the circumstances mentioned in Article 8(3) of the directive. The obligations referred to in Articles 9 to 13 of the directive cannot be imposed on the basis of the procedure described in Article 5(4). Thirdly, the Commission asserts that Article 5(1) of the Access Directive does not make the national regulatory authority\u2019s power dependent on the existence of any dispute between undertakings. 51 52 53 ",
        "I - 8452 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-227/07 The Republic of Poland challenges that complaint. It submits, first, that the two rules deriving from the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of the Access Directive, under which the national regulatory authority is required to encourage, and where appro- priate, ensure network access, interconnection and interoperability of services, are very general in nature and constitute programmatic norms. Such rules are binding on the Member States only as to the objective to be attained, the achievement of which they are required to ensure in the framework of their policy on access to tele- communications networks. This interpretation is confirmed by the general scheme of the Access Directive, since Article 5 is inserted in Chapter II thereof, under the heading \u2018General Provisions\u2019. The defendant Member State also argues that the objectives set out in Article 8 of the Framework Directive are defined generally such that the fact of referring to them leaves the national regulatory authorities a wide discretion. In addition, even if the objectives of the authorities\u2019 activities were precisely defined, this would not ensure that the undertakings operating in the market could foresee the obligations to which they would be subject. The principle of legal certainty, however, requires rules of law to be clear and precise. The general regulatory powers are also not limited by the criteria set out in Article 5(3) of the Access directive, which concern the obligations and requirements imposed under Article 5(1) and (2) thereof. 54 55 56 57 ",
        "I - 8453 COMMISSION v POLAND The Member State concludes that transposition of the said Article 5 cannot be effected verbatim, by providing for a general power for national regulatory author- ities to encourage and ensure access to telecommunications networks. The Republic of Poland submits, secondly, that this complaint relates only to the non-conformity of Polish law with the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of the Access Directive and not with the second subparagraph. It further asserts that the Commission does not take account of the fact that the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) contains two legal rules. The first of those rules, estab- lishing a general obligation to encourage access, interconnection and interoperability of services in each case, irrespective of the circumstances, which is why the national regulatory authority must act on an on-going basis, is implemented by Chapter 2 of the Law on telecommunications. The second relates to the obligation to ensure network access, which is laid down in Articles 28 and 29 of the Law. Findings of the Court By its second complaint, the Commission requests that the Court declare that the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of the Access Directive, requiring national regula- tory authorities to be given the power to intervene specifically in order to ensure compliance with the objectives of Article 8 of the Framework Directive, has not been correctly transposed by the Law on telecommunications. 58 59 60 61 ",
        "I - 8454 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-227/07 It must be pointed out, first, that the regulatory tasks of the national regulatory authority are set out in Articles 8 to 13 of the Framework Directive. Article 8(1) thereof provides that Member States are to ensure that, in carrying out those tasks, the national regulatory authorities take all reasonable measures which are aimed at achieving the objectives set out in paragraphs 2 to 4 of that article. Furthermore, the Court has interpreted Article 8 as placing on the Member States the obligation to ensure that the national regulatory authorities take all reasonable measures aimed at promoting competition in the provision of electronic commu- nications services, ensuring that there is no distortion or restriction of competition in the electronic communications sector and removing remaining obstacles to the provision of those services at European level (Case C-380/05 Centro Europa 7 [2008] ECR I-349, paragraph 81). Secondly, the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of the Access Directive refers to the powers and responsibilities of the national regulatory authorities in respect of access and interconnection. It provides that, acting in pursuit of the objectives set out in Article 8 of the Framework Directive, those authorities are to encourage and where appropriate ensure adequate access and interconnection, and interoperability of ser - vices, while promoting efficiency, sustainable competition, and giving the maximum benefit to end-users. It follows that the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of the Access Directive is limited to providing for a general power for the national regulatory authorities for the purpose of achieving the objectives of Article 8 of the Framework Directive in the specific context of access and interconnection. 62 63 64 65 ",
        "I - 8455 COMMISSION v POLAND Thirdly, as the Advocate General has observed in point 83 of his Opinion, Art - icles 26 to 30 of the Polish Law on telecommunications afford the national regulatory authority wide powers of intervention. Fourthly, it is to be remembered that, according to settled case-law, in proceedings for failure to fulfil obligations it is incumbent upon the Commission to prove the alleged failure. It is the Commission\u2019s responsibility to place before the Court the information needed to enable the Court to establish that the obligation has not been fulfilled, (Case C-387/06 Commission v Finland , paragraph 25 and the case-law cited). It must be held that by doing no more than submitting that the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of the Access Directive cannot be implemented by a general statutory provision, but only by wording which sets out decisions which the national regula- tory authority is empowered to take, without showing that the relevant provisions of the Law on telecommunications do not achieve the objectives of the Framework Directive, the Commission has not sufficiently established that those provisions do not ensure the correct transposition of the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of the Access Directive. It follows that the second complaint must be rejected. 66 67 68 69 ",
        "I - 8456 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-227/07 Costs Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party\u2019s pleadings. Under the first subparagraph of Article 69(3) of those rules, the Court may never- theless order that the costs be shared or that the parties bear their own costs where each party succeeds on some and fails on other heads, or where the circumstances are exceptional. Since the Commission and the Republic of Poland have each been partially unsuccessful in their pleadings, they should bear their own costs. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby: 1.

Freedom of movement for persons \u2014 Freedom of establishment \u2014 Freedom to provide ser \u00ad vices \u2014 Concession to operate a public service (Arts 43 EC and 49 EC) 1. Articles 43 EC and 49 EC, the principles of equal treatment and of non-discrim- ination on grounds of nationality and the concomitant obligation of transpar- ency do not preclude a public authority from awarding, without calling for competition, a public service conces- sion to an inter-municipal cooperative society of which all the members are public authorities, where those public authorities exercise over that coopera- tive society control similar to that exer- cised over their own departments and where that society carries out the essen- tial part of its activities with those public authorities. In order to determine whether a conces- sion-granting public authority exercises a control similar to that which it exercises over its own departments, it is neces- sary to take account of all the legislative provisions and relevant circumstances. It must follow from that examination that the concessionaire in question is subject to a control which enables the conces- sion-granting public authority to influ- ence that entity\u2019s decisions. It must be a case of a power of decisive influence over both strategic objectives and significant decisions of that entity. In that regard, where decisions regarding the activities of an inter-municipal co- operative society owned exclusively by public authorities are taken by bodies, created under the statutes of that society, which are composed of representatives of the affiliated public authorities, the control exercised over those decisions by the public authorities may be regarded as enabling those authorities to exer- cise over the cooperative society control similar to that exercised over their own departments. (see paras 28, 42, operative part 1, 2) 2. Where a public authority joins an inter- communal cooperative of which all the members are public authorities in order to transfer to that cooperative society the management of a public service, it is possible, in order for the control which those member authorities exercise over the cooperative to be regarded as similar to that which they exercise over their own departments, for it to be exercised jointly by those authorities, decisions being taken by a majority, as the case may be. ",
        "I - 8459 CODITEL BRABANT Such control must be similar to that which the authority exercises over its own departments, but not identical in every respect. The control exercised over the concessionaire must be effective, but it is not essential that it be exercised individually. Where a number of public authorities elect to carry out their public service tasks by having recourse to a municipal concessionaire, it is usually not possible for one of those authorities, unless it has a majority interest in that entity, to exercise decisive control over the deci- sions of the latter. To require the control exercised by a public authority in such a case to be individual would have the effect of requiring a call for competi- tion in the majority of cases where a public authority seeks to join a grouping composed of other public authorities, such as an inter-municipal cooperative society. Such a result, however, would not be consistent with Community rules on public procurement and concession contracts. Indeed, a public authority has the possibility of performing the public interest tasks conferred on it by using its own administrative, technical and other resources, without being obliged to call on outside entities not forming part of its own departments. That possibility for public authorities to use their own resources to perform the public interest tasks conferred on them may be exer- cised in cooperation with other public authorities. Therefore, where a number of public authorities own a concessionaire to which they entrust the performance of one of their public service tasks, the control which those public author- ities exercise over that entity may be exercised jointly. As regards collective decision-making bodies, the proced- ure which is used for adopting deci- sions \u2014 such as, inter alia, adoption by majority \u2014 is of no importance.

The reference by the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State), Belgium, concerns the scope of Community procurement law. It concerns the question as to whether procure- ment law is applicable where a regional authority, in this case a municipality, dele- gates the management of its cable televi- sion network to a body that is purely an inter-municipal cooperative entity 2 with the involvement of that municipality, yet without drawing on any private capital. The present case involves inter-municipal cooperation in the form of a cooperative and the questions submitted by the referring court concern the first of the well-known Teckal criteria: control similar to that exercised over an en- tity\u2019s own department. 2.

        "I - 8462 OPINION OF MRS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-324/07 II \u2014 Facts of the main proceedings and questions referred for a preliminary ruling 8. The cable television network of the Municipality of Uccle was administered by the cable television company Coditel on the basis of contracts dating from 1969 to 1999. As at the end of the contracts on 31 December 1999, the municipality made use of its contractual right to buy the cable television network situated on its territory from Coditel. 9. In October 1999, the Uccle municipal council decided, first, to put out the ope - ration and improvement of the municipal cable television network to tender by a concessionaire for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2009. Second, the draft was approved for a further additional contract with Coditel to secure the public cable television service pending appointment of the future concessionaire. Finally, provision was made by way of the additional contract for Coditel to administer the network until 31 December 2001. 10. Coditel applied at the end of 1999 for the concession to operate the cable televi- sion network of the Municipality of Uccle. At the request of the municipality in April 2000 Coditel also lodged an offer to buy the cable television network, 3 as moreover did the other companies that had participated in the tender. 11. In May 2000, the Uccle municipal council resolved to sell the network rather than grant a concession. Under the terms of the relevant tender Coditel in October 2000 submitted a purchase bid. The prices offered in response to the tender ranged from BEF 750 million to 1 billion; the only offer which was in conformity with the tender and permissible, namely the Coditel bid, was the lowest. 12. Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 also responded to the call for tenders but not with a purchase bid but with an offer of affiliation. 13. Since the prices offered to the Munici- pality of Uccle were clearly lower than the 3 \u2014 Following the request by the Municipality of Uccle Coditel enquired of it whether the offer to buy the network was a criterion in the evaluation of the bids submitted in the context of the tendering procedure for the award of the network operating concession, whether such offer replaced the current tendering procedure and whether it had been addressed to the other participants involved in the tendering procedure. On 28 April 2000, the Municipality of Uccle replied that it had made the same enquiry of four com - panies that had submitted bids in the context of the tendering procedure, that the offer to buy the network did not replace the tendering procedure and was also not a criterion for evaluating the bids submitted and finally that \u2018as the College has received a purchase proposal (conditional at present), it considers that this option cannot be excluded a priori and may be one of the factors in the current considerations about the future of the network; hence, before submitting a proposal to the Council for a decision to award (or not to award) an operating concession, it has been decided, in the interests of full information and equality between the candi- dates, to consult each of them\u2019.

Also on 23 November 2000, the Uccle municipal council resolved that the munici- pality should become a member of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 (second decision challenged in the main proceedings). This resolution states inter alia that Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 has made an offer of affili- ation to the Municipality of Uccle involving the municipal network as capital contribu- tion and the subscription of company shares, the payment of an annual fee 5 together with the offer to create, if it were to join, an inde- pendent operational sub-sector of its own 4 \u2014 See on that point resolution of the municipal council of 23 November 2000. This difference may doubtless be accounted for by reference to the prevailing economic situation: the share prices of some of the foremost high- technology companies had fallen to a historical low in the previous months, thus rendering conditions for a time extremely unfavourable. 5 \u2014 According to the relevant resolution of the municipal council of 23 November 2000, the annual fee payable is made up as follows: (a) fixed fee equal to 10% of the income from basic subscriptions for cable television (on the basis of 31 000 subscribers and an annual subscription fee of BEF 3 400 (before VAT and royalties): BEF 10 540 000 per year); (b) payment of 5% of the turnover of Canal+ and of the bouquet; (c) payment of the entire profit on all the services provided. with decision-making powers. 6 The muni- cipal council further stated in that resolution that affiliation to Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 would produce a number of advantages for the Uccle munici- pality: autonomy in decision-making, consid- erable revenues, retention of ownership of the network and agreement of the option of a rapid and uncomplicated withdrawal in the event of a future interesting purchase bid. 15. On 30 November 2000 Coditel lodged with the First Minister of the Government of the Bruxelles-Capitale region substantiated a complaint seeking the setting aside of the resolution of the Uccle municipal council of 23 November 2000 concerning the affiliation of that municipality to Brut\u00e9l\u00e9. 16. On 7 December 2000, the extraordin- ary general assembly of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 voted in favour of the affiliation of the Municipality of Uccle (third decision challenged in the main proceedings). 6 \u2014 In that connection the resolution of the municipal council of 23 November 2000 states as follows: This autonomy relates, inter alia, to: \u2014 choice of programmes transmitted; \u2014 the subscription and joining rates; \u2014 investment and works policy; \u2014 the rebates or benefits to be granted to specific groups of persons; \u2014 the nature and terms relating to other services to be provided via the network and the possibility of entrusting the inter-municipal cooperative with projects of interest to the municipality that accord with the objectives defined in its statutes, such as the creation of a municipal intranet and a website as well as the training and further training of staff for this purpose. In this context: \u2014 Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 would draw up an accounting and operating balance sheet for activities on Uccle\u2019s network; \u2014 [The Municipality of] Uccle would have a director on the governing council of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 as well as three directors on the board of the Brussels operating sector, one auditor and one municipal expert.

        "I - 8464 OPINION OF MRS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-324/07 17. On 19 December 2000, the First Minister of the Brussels city region informed the Municipality of Uccle that its conditional affiliation 7 with Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 gave rise to no objection (fourth decision challenged in the main proceedings). On 2 January 2001 the First Minister of the Bruxelles-Capitale region informed the applicant that he had raised no objection to the affiliation of the Municipality of Uccle with Brut\u00e9l\u00e9. 18. Coditel brought an action on 22 January 2001 for a declaration that the four above- mentioned decisions were null and void. 19. In the main proceedings the referring Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat has already dismissed the proceedings against two of these decisions (the third and fourth contested decisions) as inadmissible. To the extent to which the action is in its view admissible, it is in par - ticular important to assess the decision by which the Uccle municipal council resolved to become a member of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9. 20. By order of 3 July 2007, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat referred the following questions to the Court of Justice: 7 \u2014 According to the resolution dated 23 November 2000, the affiliation was expressed to be subject to the condition that a resolution be passed by the general assembly of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9, in which all members agreed not to oppose any subsequent withdrawal of the Municipality of Uccle. \u2018(1) May a municipality, without calling for competition, join a cooperative society grouping together exclusively other municipalities and associations of municipalities (a so-called pure inter- municipal cooperative) in order to transfer to that cooperative society the operation of its cable television network, in the knowledge that the cooperative society carries out the essential part of its activities for and with its own members and that decisions regarding those activ- ities are taken by the board of directors and the sector boards within the limits of the delegated powers granted to them by the board of directors, those statu- tory bodies being composed of repre- sentatives of the public authorities and the decisions of those corporate bodies being taken in accordance with the vote expressed by the majority of those representatives? (2) Can the control thus exercised over the decisions of the cooperative society, via the statutory bodies, by all the members of the cooperative society \u2014 or, in the case of operational sectors or sub- sectors, by some of those members \u2014 be regarded as enabling them to exercise over the cooperative society control similar to that exercised over their own departments? (3) For that control to be regarded as similar, must it be exercised individually by each member, or is it sufficient that it be exer- cised by the majority of the members?\u2019 ",
        "I - 8465 CODITEL BRABANT 21. The referring court explains that the affiliation of the Municipality of Uccle to Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 falls not within the sector of public contracts for services but within that of public service concessions. In that connec- tion, even though the Community direct- ives on public contracts are not applicable, the fundamental rules of primary Commu- nity law in general and the prohibition on discrimination on grounds of nationality in particular, which entails inter alia a transpar- ency obligation, do apply. 22. From the referring court\u2019s perspective there is much to be said for the fact that the Municipality of Uccle as awarding authority was not entitled directly and immediately to have recourse to affiliation to Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 without conducting a tendering procedure or a comparative examination of bids submitted. Specifically, the municipality, in order to satisfy the requirements of Community law, ought to have conducted a fresh tendering procedure in order to examine whether the grant of a concession over its cable televi- sion network service to Coditel or another economic operator would not have been a more favourable possibility than that finally chosen. 23. However, in order to enable it to conduct a definitive analysis, it is essential to obtain further clarification as to criteria arising out of the Teckal 8 judgment, in particular in regard to the nature of the control exer- cised by the concession-granting authority over the concessionaire. For under that case 8 \u2014 Case C-107/98 [1999] ECR I-8121, paragraph 50. law, the transparency requirements under Community law could only be suspended if two conditions that were to be narrowly interpreted were separately met, first that the control exercised by the concession-granting authority over the concessionaire is similar to that exercised over its own departments and, second, that the latter body essen- tially performs its activity for the authority controlling it. 24. In that connection Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 claimed that it was a purely inter-municipal entity whose activities were intended for the affiliated municipalities and reserved to them, and that its statutes permitted the Municipality of Uccle to create an independent operational subsection of its own with decision-making powers, which enabled the latter to exercise precisely the same direct control over the activities of the cooperative society in this subsection as over its own departments. The Municipality of Uccle has a member on the governing council of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 and three members on the board of the Brussels oper- ating section, an auditor and a municipal expert. Moreover, the Municipality of Uccle could at any time withdraw from the co- operative entity which was further evidence indicating that it was completely in control of the operation of its cable television network. 25. According to the referring court, the statutes of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 provide that the co - operative members are municipalities together ",
        "I - 8466 OPINION OF MRS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-324/07 with an inter-municipal body, which in its turn is made up solely of municipalities. The cooperative society is not open to private individuals. The governing council comprises representatives of the municipalities \u2014 a maximum of three per municipality \u2014 who are appointed by the general assembly which in itself comprises representatives of the municipalities. The governing council has the widest powers. The municipalities are divided into two sections of which one comprises the Brussels region municipal- ities that may be divided into sub-sectors. Within each sector a sector board is set up consisting of board members appointed on a proposal by the municipalities by the general assembly and sitting in various compositions that reflect proportions of shares held in respect of each sector. The governing council may delegate to the sector boards powers in respect of specific questions concerning the sub-sectors \u2014 such as the conditions for the application of tariffs, the extension and investment plan, the financing of invest- ments and advertising campaigns \u2014 and problems common to the various sub- sectors within the operational sector. The other statutory bodies are the general assembly whose decisions are binding on all members, the Director General, the board of experts consisting of municipal experts, and the auditors. The Director General, the experts and the auditors are appointed on a case-by- case basis by the governing council or the general assembly, as the case may be. 26. The referring court draws from this the inference that the decision-making autonomy of the Municipality of Uccle is not as comprehensive as Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 alleges. For example, the governing council exercises the widest powers whilst this municipality is represented by only one representative. It is true that all decisions are taken by bodies of the cooperative society that consist solely of representatives of affiliated municipalities and inter-municipal bodies, yet that does not result in a situation in which each of those members individually has the same decisive influence in regard to the cooperative society as in the case of an autonomous internal organisation of activity. 27. In light of the second condition arising out of the Teckal judgment 9 \u2014 \u2018in the case where \u2026 at the same time, that person carries out the essential part of its activ- ities with the controlling local authority or authorities\u2019 \u2014 the referring court explains that it is not disputed that the cooperative society conducts its activity essentially for its members. On this precondition the referring court has raised no question for a prelim- inary ruling. III \u2014 Parties\u2019 submissions 28. Coditel, the Municipality of Uccle, Brut\u00e9l\u00e9, the Belgian, German and Nether- lands Governments and the Commission 9 \u2014 Set out above in footnote 8, paragraph 50. ",

They presented oral argument at the sitting on 9 April 2008, with the exception of the Municipality of Uccle, which was not represented. 29. Essentially, all parties agree that this is a case involving the sector of the award of public concessions that is not subject to the directives on procurement but to the general requirement of transparency. 10 30. Except for Coditel all are agreed that the second Teckal criterion would appear to be satisfied on the basis of the particulars provided in the request for a preliminary ruling. 31. On the first Teckal criterion there are opposing viewpoints. 32. Coditel and the C ommission consider that this criterion is not satisfied; the direct 10 \u2014 The Netherlands Government explains that the particulars in the order for reference are not comprehensive enough to be able in fact to evaluate this aspect. affiliation of the Municipality of Uccle to the Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 cooperative society conflicts with the transparency requirement. 33. Coditel points out that before affiliation to Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 the Municipality of Uccle had no relationship with the cooperative, with the result that the Teckal case-law is in no way relevant. Moreover, the Municipality of Uccle holds only 8.26% of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s shares (76 out of a total of 920). In addition, Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 provides its services such as cable television, telephone and Internet on a commercial basis and in competition with other private service providers. The internal structure of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 is essentially similar to the internal structure of a private undertaking. The Municipality of Uccle does not have the capacity to control Brut\u00e9l\u00e9; rather it is questionable whether there can be actual collective control by the cooperative members owing to the large number of members and possible diver- gences of interests. In light of the judgment in Carbotermo , 11 it is not a determinant factor that 100% of the capital in Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 is owned by municipalities and regional author- ities. In that connection it is in particular not sufficient that the Municipality of Uccle was granted an operating sub-sector. 34. The C ommission also deals in its submis- sions with the internal decision-making structures of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 and considers in that 11 \u2014 Case C-340/04 Carbotermo and Consorzio Alisei [2006] ECR I-4137, paragraph 37.

        "I - 8468 OPINION OF MRS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-324/07 connection that it is unable to discern a power of decisive influence 12 on the part of an individual municipality such as Uccle. Brut\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s board of directors possesses wide- ranging powers and in particular also deter- mined tariffs. The Municipality of Uccle has in each respect only a shared influence and is not freely in a position to enforce its will, which is however a precondition for satis- fying the first Teckal criterion. 35. The Municipality of Uccle and Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 , who conversely are of the view that the first Teckal criterion is satisfied, underscore the aspect of the absolute inter-municipal nature of the cooperative society, both under its statutes and under Belgian law. 36. The Municipality of Uccle points out that by its affiliation it retained \u2018similar control\u2019 over the municipal cable television network as laid down in Teckal . It should be emphasised that the Court does not allude to \u2018identical\u2019 but to \u2018similar\u2019 control. To require complete and individual control by a municipality over an inter-municipal form of cooperation would render such cooperation 12 \u2014 In this connection the Commission refers to judgments in Case C-458/03 Parking Brixen [2005] I-8585, paragraph 65, and Carbotermo and Consorcio Alisei (cited in footnote 11 above). impossible, which by definition is dependent on the collaboration of a multiplicity of persons. 37. Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 makes reference only in the alternative to satisfaction of the first Teckal criterion, and points in particular to the judgment in Asemfo, paragraphs 57 et seq. Primarily, Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 argues that Articles 43 EC and 49 EC and the principles of equal treatment, non-discrimination and transpar- ency are to be interpreted in such a way as not in themselves to preclude a municipality from joining, without calling for competi- tion, a purely inter-municipal cooperative, without any involvement of private capital and as constituted in particular to attain deliberate aims in the municipal and the general interest. It may be inferred from the judgment in Stadt Halle und RPL Lochau , paragraph 48, that municipalities are en- titled themselves to perform their tasks that are in the general interest. However, to apply the rules of Community procurement law to inter-municipal cooperation would force the municipalities to outsource their func- tions using the market. Belgian law expressly grants municipalities the option of engaging in inter-municipal cooperation. 13 The rela- tionship between the Municipality of Uccle and the Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 cooperative society was not founded in contract but by affiliation which is governed by law and by Brut\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s statutes. Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 is purely built on inter-municipal cooperation, according to its statutes is not open to private capital and performs its func- tions in the interest of the municipalities. The aim of the cooperation is to make available to 13 \u2014 Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 refers to the Belgian constitution and to the Belgian law on inter-municipal cooperatives (cited in points 6 and 7 of this Opinion above). ",
        "I - 8469 CODITEL BRABANT users as wide as possible a selection of televi- sion programmes under the most favourable conditions and in appropriate cases to extend the services offered to radio and various communications media. Finally and thirdly, Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 contends that the Municipality of Uccle within the context of the cooperative society, in particular also through the in- ternal decision-making structure and with the separate sub-sector, exercises the control at issue here that is similar to that exercised over its own departments. 38. The Belgian Government is of the opinion that the first question referred is to be replied to affirmatively. Without a tendering procedure a municipality may affiliate itself to a cooperative society such as Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 which consists solely of other municipalities and regional authorities, in order to transfer to it the management of its cable television network, if the coopera- tive conducts its activity essentially only for and with its members, and the decisions in connection with that activity are taken by the governing council and the sector boards, within the limits of the delegated powers granted to them by the governing council, and those statutory bodies being consist of representatives of the public authorities and decisions are passed by a majority of the latter. 39. Brut\u00e9l\u00e9, which is not open to private capital, cannot be regarded as a third party in relation to the Municipality of Uccle. The concession for the cable television network was not awarded externally but retained its internal nature. 40. The other questions referred for a preliminary ruling arise solely out of the fact that inter-municipal cooperation is a form of cooperation, which in the nature of things associates different municipalities that co- operate together. In this connection it should be emphasised that decentralised administra- tions have the right to opt for cooperation in order to secure efficient management. This involves inter alia cooperation between small and larger regional authorities. In regard to smaller regional authorities there is often an inherent necessity to tackle overlapping tasks jointly in an overarching larger structure. To determine how such cooperation between regional authorities are organised and controlled internally, is a matter for the ap- plicable law and the relevant administrations of the Member States. In this respect there is wide variety of internal models of organisa- tion and control. It cannot be inferred from a form of cooperation that takes account of the different size of the cooperating regional authorities in relation to control that the control is not similar to that exercised over its own departments. In addition it follows from the nature of inter-municipal cooperation that within this context a municipality does not decide on its own but that decisions are taken by majority, indeed with a view to the common purpose. Control by majority deci- sions may be deemed to constitute \u2018similar control\u2019 within the meaning of the case-law. In regard to the Municipality of Uccle, that is represented in the decision making bodies ",
        "I - 8470 OPINION OF MRS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-324/07 of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 by its representatives, it may in the final analysis be stated that it exercises over Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 a similar control to that exercised over its own departments. 41. The German Government is of the view that the principles and rules of procure- ment law do not apply to a case such as the present one ab initio since both Teckal criteria are satisfied. In the case of several \u2018controlling authorities\u2019 those criteria are to be construed as meaning that if the public awarding body jointly owns the contractor together with other legal persons, no dilution of control can be inferred from the jointly exercised control by the various authorities. For example, departments that are organ- isationally uniform could be established by several regional authorities in common and jointly \u2018operated\u2019; in such cases it would be aberrant to take the view that the control exercised by individual regional authorities is deficient or incomplete. In German law governing administrative organisation there are many examples of that, thus the finan- cial authorities (\u2018Oberfinzanzdirektionen\u2019) are both departments of the Federation and of the Land. In some L\u00e4nder states district administrative authorities are both depart- ments of the district and at the same time lower state authority of the Land. Many L\u00e4nder, for example Brandenburg and Berlin operate a joint supreme administrative court (\u2018Oberverwaltungsgericht\u2019). It would be regarded as completely aberrant to assume deficient or incomplete degree of control by the regional authority over authorities that are operated jointly by several regional authorities. Exactly in the same way control exercised over a contractor in the ownership of several public legal persons is jointly exer- cised but no less effective for that. That is so in the case of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 because only munici- palities are involved which jointly exercised their powers of control as over a (joint) department. 42. If, because the public awarding body has to exercise control over the contractor jointly with other principals, one were to conclude that there was inadequate control and the rules of procurement law were therefore applicable, that would have serious conse- quences for the requisite margin of discre- tion in the configuration of inter-municipal cooperation. The option in favour of such a form of inter-municipal cooperation would then always be subject to a tendering pro- cedure. That would be to set back inter-muni- cipal cooperation as a form of arrangement for organising the tasks of the State as opposed to the performance of tasks independently, which would render procurement law never applicable. Procurement law would then be exerting an entirely nonsensical pres- sure on the municipalities to desist in ap- plicable cases from cooperating with other ",
        "I - 8471 CODITEL BRABANT municipalities. Yet that was never the ob- jective of procurement law. Rather procure- ment law applies only when the municipality calls on the market for the purposes of fulfilling its tasks. 43. Finally, the German Government points out that the right to municipal self- administration is protected at European level by the European Charter of municipal self- administration. 14 It enshrines the right of municipalities to perform tasks on their own and also to engage in inter-municipal co - operation without first conducting a competi- tive tendering procedure. 44. The Netherlands Government proposes that the reply to the first question referred should be affirmative. On the second ques- tion it must be pointed out against the back- ground of the first of the two criteria in the Teckal judgment, the subsequent case-law and the particulars contained in the order for reference that in regard to Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 the muni- cipalities involved and the municipal asso- ciations are in the position to exercise de- cisive influence. That is borne out by the fact that they jointly hold the whole of the share capital and private capital is excluded. The finding of decisive influence is confirmed by 14 \u2014 The European Charter on Local Self-Government, opened for signature by the Member States of the Council of Europe on 15 October 1985 in Strasbourg, has been in force since 1 September 1988 (for more particulars see: http://conventions.coe.int). the fact that the municipalities and muni- cipal associations are entirely in control of the decision-making bodies of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9, for the latter comprise their representatives. In that way the municipalities and municipal asso- ciations are in a position to exercise decisive influence both on the strategic aims and on important decisions such as for example the fixing of tariffs. Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 has no autonomy and therefore cannot be regarded as a third party in relation to the municipalities and muni- cipal associations. As to the third question it should be said that it is sufficient in regard to \u2018control similar to that exercised over its own departments\u2019 for the municipalities and municipal associations concerned to exercise control jointly. IV \u2014 Legal assessment 45. Since the questions referred relate to different aspects of the same question I shall examine them together. 46. The question is whether the affiliation of a municipality such as Uccle to a purely inter-municipal cooperative society such as ",

The aspects exer- cising the referring court concern in particu- lar the internal decision-making structures, that is to say decisions by statutory bodies such as the governing council and sector boards on the one hand and decisions essen- tially of an individual nature but adopted by way of majority decision-making on the other hand. Can such decision-making struc- tures comply with the criterion in the case- law of \u2018control similar to that exercised over its own departments\u2019? 47. The referring court considers that dom - inant control over the cooperative society and its decisions is exercised by the regional authorities jointly by way of the coopera- tive statutory organs which thereby enjoy a certain autonomy vis-\u00e0-vis their members. That does not constitute \u2018control similar to that exercised over its own departments\u2019 and the referring court is therefore inclined to regard the first grounds of action as substantiated. 48. In order to classify the questions it should be stated in advance that, as the referring court has already rightly stated, under settled case-law, none of the Community dir - ectives in the sector of public procurement 15 applies 16 to the award of public service concessions. 17 The fact that the situation in the main proceedings occurred in the sector of service concessions and not in the sector of contracts for services, may be inferred from the fact that it is not the regional authority that pays the remuneration for the service provided but that the consideration consists of the right to exploit its own service, 18 which is associated with the assumption of operating risk. 19 15 \u2014 Inter alia Council Directive 92/50/EEC of 18 June 1992 relating to the coordination of procedures for the award of public service contracts (OJ 1992 L 209, p. 1).

Since at the material time in regard to the events in the main proceedings concerning the award of service concessions by public agencies no directive coordinating the proceedings was in existence, 20 the conse- quences under Community law of the award of such concessions fall to be examined as before solely in light of primary law and in particular of the fundamental freedoms laid down in the EC Treaty. 21 50. Accordingly requirements are imposed concerning equal treatment and transparency, 22 for the award of public service concessions in particular in regard to the prohibition on indirect discrimination on grounds of nationality under Articles 12 EC, 43 EC and 49 EC, 23 which as a rule render a call for tenders essential. 20 \u2014 The situation was hardly altered by the subsequent Dir - ective 2004/18 (cited in footnote 18 above) since although it defines the concept of a service concession; this none the less does not apply to such concessions under Article 17 of this Directive.

Case law permits an exception for quasi in-house performance of tasks, 24 beginning with Teckal 25 and further elaborated 26 and applied to all Community provisions in the sector of public contracts or public service concessions, 27 in the case of a procedure that is configured in such a way as to constitute an internal administrative measure. 28 Under settled case-law a call for tenders is not mandatory \u2014 even if the contractual partner is an establishment legally distinct from the public awarding body \u2014 if two precondi- tions are met. First, the public body that is an awarding authority must exercise over the establishment in question a degree of control similar to that which it exercises over its own departments, and, secondly, that establish- ment must perform its activity essentially for the public body or bodies which own its shares. 29 24 \u2014 The term is not used uniformly, often the terms (quasi) \u2018in-house award\u2019 or \u2018in-house business\u2019 (in the wider sense) are used. 25 \u2014 Cited in footnote 8 above. 26 \u2014 See in particular judgments in Stadt Halle and RPL Lochau (cited in footnote 15 above, paragraph 49); Coname (cited in footnote 17 above, paragraphs 23 to 26); Parking Brixen (cited in footnote 12 above, paragraph 56 et seq.); ANAV (cited in footnote 21 above, paragraph 24); Carbotermo and Consorzio Alisei (cited in footnote 11 above, paragraphs 36 and 37); Case C-295/05 Asemfo [2007] ECR I-2999, para- graphs 55 to 57, and Case C-220/06 Asociaci\u00f3n Profesional de Empresas de Reparto y Manipulado de Correspondencia [2007] ECR I-12175 paragraph 58). 27 \u2014 In Parking Brixen (cited in footnote 12 above, paragraph 61) the Court of Justice made plain that both the Teckal criteria apply not only in the area of Community procurement directives but generally in the area of Community procure- ment law. 28 \u2014 Flamme/Flamme/Dardenne, cited in footnote 20 above, p. 32, paragraph 20 emphasise referring to paragraphs 49 and 50 of the judgment in Teckal (cited in footnote 8 above), that the basis of the exception for \u2018quasi in-house perform- ance of tasks\u2019 is the fact that an entity cannot \u2018contract with itself\u2019. 29 \u2014 See judgments in Teckal (cited in footnote 8 above, para- graph 50); Stadt Halle and RPL Lochau (cited in footnote 15 above, paragraph 49); Case C-84/03 Commission v Spain [2005] ECR I-139, paragraph 38; Case C-29/04 Commission v Austria [2005] ECR I-9705, paragraph 34; Carbotermo and Consorcio Alisei (cited in footnote 11 above, paragraph 33), and Asemfo (cited in footnote 26 above, paragraph 55).

        "I - 8474 OPINION OF MRS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-324/07 A \u2014 First Teckal criterion 52. It is however necessary to analyse the first requirement, namely the exercise of \u2018control similar to that over its own departments\u2019. 1. Exclusion of semi-public undertakings 53. It is unmistakeably to be inferred from settled case-law since the judgment in Stadt Halle und RPL Lochau 30 that semi- public undertakings are in no way deemed to be entities over which similar control is 30 \u2014 The much quoted judgment in Stadt Halle and RPL Lochau (cited in footnote 15 above) provides at paragraph 49: \u2018In accordance with the Court\u2019s case-law, it is not excluded that there may be other circumstances in which a call for tenders is not mandatory, even though the other contracting party is an entity legally distinct from the contracting authority. That is the case where the public authority which is a contracting authority exercises over the separate entity concerned a control which is similar to that which it exercises over its own departments and that entity carries out the essential part of its activities with the controlling public authority or authorities (see, to that effect, Teckal , [cited in footnote 8 above] paragraph 50). It should be noted that, in the case cited, the distinct entity was wholly owned by public author- ities. By contrast, the participation, even as a minority, of a private undertaking in the capital of a company in which the contracting authority in question is also a participant excludes in any event the possibility of that contracting authority exercising over that company a control similar to that which it exercises over its own departments\u2019. Belorgey/ Gervasoni/Lambert, \u2018Qualification de march\u00e9 public\u2019, AJDA 2005, p. 1113 et seq., p. 1114, referring to Case C-18/01 Korhonen and Others [2003] ECR I-5321, take the view that the judgment in Stadt Halle confirmed expressly what the case-law had until then implied. exercised as over own departments, irre- spective of the degree to which the private capital involvement is a minority holding. 31 In that connection it is enough for there to be a possibility of private capital involvement even if there is (as yet) none. 32 An assign- ment to private persons of shares occurring shortly after the award must also be taken into consideration. 33 54. In circumstances such as those of the present case the private capital aspect of the question must plainly be answered in the negative. There is no private capital involve- ment; nor, further, is Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 open to private capital. 2. Other relevant circumstances 55. However, it is plain from the case-law that the mere finding that private capital 31 \u2014 See also Coname judgments (cited in footnote 17 above, paragraph 26); Commission v Austria (cited in footnote 29 above, paragraph 46); ANAV (cited in footnote 21 above, paragraph 31), and Case C-220/05 Auroux and Others [2007] ECR I-389, paragraph 64.

It appears from some of the judgments that deal with the first of the two Teckal criteria that the assessment must \u2018take account of all the legislative provisions and relevant circumstances\u2019. 35 \u2018It must follow from that examination that the conces- sionaire in question is subject to a control enabling the concession-granting public authority to influence the concessionaire\u2019s decisions. It must be a case of a power of decisive influence over both strategic ob- jectives and significant decisions.\u2019 36 57. The range of criteria that may be rele- vant in this regard is apparent in particu- lar from the judgment in Parking Brixen : conversion into a company limited by shares, broadening of the objects of the company, obligatory opening up of the company in the short term to other capital, significant expansion of the geographical area of the 34 \u2014 See, inter alia, also Probst/Wurzel, \u2018Zul\u00e4ssigkeit von In-house-Vergaben und Rechtsfolgen des Abschlusses von vergaberechtswidrigen Vertr\u00e4gen\u2019 [Permissibility of In-house awards and legal consequences of the conclusion of contracts contrary to procurement law], in: European Law Reporter 2007, p. 257 et seq., p. 261. 35 \u2014 Parking Brixen (cited in footnote 12 above, paragraph 65) and Carbotermo and Consorcio Alisei (cited in footnote 11 above, paragraph 36). 36 \u2014 Parking Brixen (cited in footnote 12 above, paragraph 65) and Carbotermo and Consorcio Alisei (cited in footnote 11 above, paragraph 36). company\u2019s activities and considerable powers conferred on the administrative board in this judgment taken as a whole meant that the relevant company had in the view of the Court of Justice become market orientated and achieved a degree of autonomy with the result that the concession-granting public authority was not exercising control over the concessionaire similar to that exercised over its own departments. 37 58. Two basic criteria were therefore plainly decisive in determining the relevant ques- tions in the Parking Brixen case: the degree to which the concessionaire was market orientated and the degree of its autonomy. 38 These categories equate to those in the Teckal judgment, which, in paragraph 51, also stated as a criterion the degree of inde- pendent decision-making capacity present or absent in the relevant body as compared to the public authority or authorities. 39 59.

In Parking Brixen the Court of Justice took the view that Stadtwerke Brixen AG had become so market oriented as to render it difficult for the municipality to control it and listed a total of five reasons why that was so, 40 including the obligatory opening of the company, in the short term, to other capital and the expansion of the geographical area of the company\u2019s activities, to the whole of Italy and abroad. 41 61.

It must therefore be observed that in these cases various special circumstances came together which led to an overall view being formed. 44 3.

This is supported by the implica- tions of developments in the case-law of the Court of Justice set out below. 64. The exact wording of the Carbotermo judgment mentioned above in which there were further circumstances that precluded the situation in that case from being deemed exempt from the tendering requirement, is as follows: \u2018[t]he fact that the contracting authority holds, alone or together with other public authorities, all of the share capital in a successful tenderer tends to indicate, without being decisive, that that contracting authority exercises over that company a control similar to that which it exercises over its own depart- ments, as contemplated in paragraph 50 of Teckal .\u2019 46 65. In the subsequent paragraphs of the Carbotermo judgment it becomes apparent that this qualification of the words \u2018without being decisive\u2019 constitutes a reference to the 45 \u2014 Commission v Spain (cited in footnote 29 above, paragraph 40). 46 \u2014 Carbotermo and Consorcio Alisei (cited in footnote 11 above, paragraph 37). further circumstances mentioned namely: dilution of control owing to the intermediary of a holding company even if the capital of the latter is held as to 99.98% by the local or regional authority in question, as well as too far-reaching powers on the part of the boards in both the holding company and in the public limited company established by the holding company, in a situation where the latter were to be entrusted with the performance of tasks. 47 In the view of the Court of Justice, the applicable articles of association did not reserve to the regional authority concerned any control or specific voting powers in order to circumscribe the freedom of action conferred on those boards of directors. The control exercised by the regional authority over those two com - panies consisted essentially in the latitude conferred by company law on the majority of shareholders, which appreciably limited its power to influence the decisions of those companies. 48 66. In contrast the more recent judgment in Asemfo shows that mere cooperation between municipalities is in general to be regarded as fulfilling the first Teckal cri - terion \u2014 \u2018similar control to that exercised over its own departments\u2019 \u2014 without further analysis of the internal decision-making structures and majority shareholding rela- tionships being called for.

There are therefore many reasons for taking the view that where the awarding authority or concession-awarding authority, either alone or in conjunction with other public authorities, 50 owns the entire share capital in a body that is awarded a contract or concession this as a rule shows that it or they exercise control over that body as over their own departments within the meaning of paragraph 50 of the judgment in Teckal . This rule can be displaced, 51 but, as demon- strated above, 52 only by the concurrence of special circumstances. 4. Criteria for a detailed analysis of the power of control 68.

The Teckal case already related to a situ- ation of inter-municipal cooperation, 53 in which the question of control against the background of the size of shareholdings was alluded to: it concerned a consortium of 45 municipalities in Reggio Emilia, in which the municipality of Viano, to which the case related, held a 0.9% shareholding. Advocate General Cosmas observed in this regard that it was \u2018unlikely that it could be maintained that the Municipality of Viano exercises over that consortium the kind of control which an entity exercises over an internal body\u2019. 54 The judgment itself is silent on this point and in particular the criterion for control in paragraph 50 55 does not go into this aspect. However, it must be noted that the Court of Justice did not in this judgment answer in the negative the question of the power of control enjoyed by a municipality with a relatively 53 \u2014 This is also pointed out by Pape/Holz, \u2018In-house-trans- actions exempt from the tendering requirement\u2019, NJW 2005, p. 2264 et seq. p. 2265. Their perspective is that on a purely formal view a cooperative comprising several public authorities cannot be deemed to be an in-house transaction because owing to the rights of co-determination enjoyed by the other shareholders it could not be determined beyond peradventure that every shareholder could exercise control similar to that exercised over its own departments; yet, on a functional view it was reasonable to regard it as an in-house transaction. 54 \u2014 Opinion of Advocate General Cosmas of 1 July 1999 in Teckal (cited in footnote 8 above, point 61). 55 \u2014 Teckal (cited in footnote 8 above).

In the meantime, however, this issue was answered to the opposite effect in the Coname judgment in 2005 inasmuch as a 0.97% holding in the share capital was adjudged to be insufficient. 56 71. However, the judgment in Asemfo clari- fied that the size of the shareholding of an individual public body in a cooperative of public bodies no (longer) acts as the relevant yardstick as regards the possibility of control. The Court of Justice expressly stated that even a share in a cooperative of as little as 0.25% of the capital of such a cooperative (1% of the capital was held by four autonomous regions which each held one share) does not prevent the tasks from being regarded 56 \u2014 Judgment in Coname (cited in footnote 17 above), para- graphs 23 and 24.

Moreover, it is noteworthy in regard to the main proceedings giving rise to the abovementioned judgment that the power of control over the entity entrusted with the relevant tasks clearly lies with the central state administration, which is the main shareholder and not with the four autono- mous communities whose shareholdings together amount to 1% of the capital. 58 This fact did not prevent the Court of Justice from regarding the first criterion in Teckal 57 \u2014 Asemfo (cited in footnote 26 above), paragraphs 58 to 60. Paragraph 59 states: \u2018In that regard, the argument cannot be accepted that that condition is met only for contracts performed at the demand of the Spanish State, excluding those which are the subject of a demand from the Auton- omous Communities as regards which Tragsa must be regarded as a third party.\u2019 It is clear from paragraph 61 that this finding does not refer to all Spanish autono- mous regions, although Tragsa acts for all of them (see the Opinion of Advocate General Geelhoed of 28 September 2006, Asemfo, cited in footnote 26 above, points 13 and 14), but to those which hold a share in the capital of Tragsa. 58 \u2014 In Asemfo (cited in footnote 26 above, paragraph 13, para- graph 5 therein) it is stated in regard to national law that: \u2018The functions of organisation, supervision and control concerning Tragsa and its subsidiaries shall be exercised by the Ministerio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentaci\u00f3n (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) as well as by the Ministerio de Medio Ambiente (Ministry of the En- vironment)\u2019. Thus competence for control lies with central government and not with the autonomous regions. Thus, Advocate General Geelhoed observes in his Opinion of 28 September 2006 in Asemfo (cited in footnote 26 above, point 51), that the autonomous regions themselves exer- cised no powers of control and that such powers could not be inferred from their capacities as shareholders. Powers of control all resided with the principal shareholder, the Spanish State, that is to say the central government. Thus the judgment itself states in paragraph 51: \u2018Finally, under Article 3(6) of Royal Decree 371/1999, Tragsa\u2019s relations with those public bodies, inasmuch as that company is an instrument and a technical service of those bodies, are not contractual, but in every respect internal, dependent and subordinate.\u2019 Furthermore, in paragraphs 59 to 61 argu- ments quite different from the internal decision-making structures are deployed in regard to the question of the power of control enjoyed by the autonomous regions, such as namely the legal requirement to perform contracts, the fact that tariffs are fixed by the State and that the relation- ship is not contractual.

Interim conclusion 75. It is clear from the legal analysis that pure inter-municipal cooperation as a rule ought to be possible without being subject to the tendering requirement, if there are no other specific circumstances which show that the degree of market orientation and the degree of autonomy of the inter-municipal body has exceeded the bounds of inter-municipal cooperation that are neutral in procurement law terms in order to complete tasks that are in the general interest. 63 \u2014 See, amongst others, Dreher, \u2018Das in-house-Gesch\u00e4ft\u2019 [The in-house contract], NzBau 2004, p. 14 et seq., p. 17, who puts the emphasis on the lack of any decision-making power on the part of the party awarded the contract.

Even if no legal certainty has been achieved hitherto 64 in relation to the exact boundary affecting criteria such as \u2018degree of market orientation\u2019 and \u2018degree of autonomy\u2019, in other words it is not clear where exactly the boundary of inter-municipal cooperation that is neutral in procurement law terms is to be drawn in performing tasks in the general interest, there is no indication that cooper- ation within Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 would go beyond those boundaries. 77. It is a matter for the national courts, in this instance the referring court, to weigh up these matters in the specific case. Such an examination ought not in this case to produce a finding that any of the boundaries indicated above had been exceeded. For the internal decision-making structures of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 are characterised by the collective influence of the regional authorities participating by way of majority decision. They exercise their influence not only in the general assembly but also in the governing council, which is made up of representatives of the munici- palities. Thus the question of the power of control is already answered adequately and 64 \u2014 On the generally lacking legal certainty in regard to a series of unspecified legal concepts and demarcation problems in light of the Teckal criteria see, amongst others, also Jennert (cited in footnote 41 above, pp. 625 and 626), who welcomes the increase in legal certainty as a result of the concrete and practical criteria in that judgment. At the same time he points up open questions in particular in regard to the subsequent disposal of shares to private persons by a muni- cipal cooperative mandated long before under the terms of the in-house case-law and suggests that the disposal of shares is subject to the principle of equal treatment and the transparency requirement; Opinion of Advocate General Stix-Hackl of 12 January 2006, Carbotermo and Consorcio Alisei (cited in footnote 11 above), point 17; S\u00f6bbeke, \u2018Zur Konzeption des Kontrollerfordernisses bei vergabefreien Eigenschaften\u2019 [On the control requirements in the case of tender-exempt in-house transactions], Die \u00d6ffentliche Verwaltung [Public Administration] 2006, p. 996 et seq. p. 997, states that the ill-defined areas that have complicated the application of the in-house principle since the Teckal judgment as an exception from the tendering requirement, have been successively reduced by the Stadt Halle and Carbotermo judgments. affirmatively. In addition, in relation to the sub-sectors, a preponderance of individual- municipal decisions may in fact discerned. Brut\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s market orientation relates to tasks which are in the general interest such as cable television, telephone and Internet and does not suggest that any level that is neutral in procurement law terms was exceeded, notwithstanding the imprecision of the rele- vant criteria in this connection. 78. Everything therefore points in a case such as this to cooperation between public bodies without any requirement for a tendering procedure. 79. Contrary to the view of Coditel in this context, it is of no significance that Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 offers its services to users commercially and is therefore automatically in competition 65 with other private bidders. 65 \u2014 Nor, likewise, is it material to the assessment that such quasi in-house performance of contracts would preclude other undertakings that would also be prepared to take on the relevant work from competing for the contract because this effect is inherent in quasi in-house performance of contracts (Egger, cited in footnote 2 above, p. 163, paragraph 600).

        "I - 8482 OPINION OF MRS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-324/07 6. Value of inter-municipal cooperation 80. Although the questions referred have in my view already been answered, I should like briefly to underscore the conclusion and at the same time to deal with counter arguments advanced by Coditel and the Commission. 81. Public procurement law is and remains one of the most influential policy instru- ments of the Member States and institu- tions of the EU in the process of European integration. 66 This potential cannot however be used indiscriminately; rather its purpose must be brought into harmony with the values of other policy areas. 82. If, as the referring court, Coditel and the Commission propose, one were to require the municipalities concerned to have \u2018 compre- hensive decision-making autonomy\u2019, in the sense that the relevant municipality exercises \u2018dominance\u2019 over the relevant inter-muni- cipal cooperative (\u2018dominance over the co- operative society\u2019), then inter-municipal cooperation would in future be rendered virtually impossible. For it is an important feature of genuine cooperation that decisions are made as equals and that one of the 66 \u2014 Bovis, Public Procurement in the European Union , 2005, p. 240. partners in the cooperative does not domi- nate. It is therefore plain from the observa- tions of Coditel and the Commission in the procedure and at the hearing that the yard- sticks proposed by these two parties mean that it is a requirement that an individual regional authority must as it were be able to control a cooperative alone. It is obvious that such a case cannot in fact be regarded as cooperation or collaboration. 83. As stated, that would render virtual impossible even pure inter-municipal co- operation. Inter-municipal cooperating regional authorities would then always have to reckon with the likelihood of having to award their tasks to private third parties making more favourable bids; that would be tantamount to the compulsory privatisation by means of procurement law of public- interest tasks. 67 84. To construe the first Teckal criterion so narrowly would be to attach disproportionate weight to competition-law objectives at the 67 \u2014 See also the Opinion of Advocate General Kokott in Parking Brixen (cited in footnote 12 above), point 68.

This is rightly emphasised by the govern- ments participating in the proceedings before the Court of Justice. The right to municipal self-government is not reflected only in the legal provisions of the Member States but, as the German Government correctly pointed out, also in the European Charter on Local Self-Government drawn up within the frame- work of the Council of Europe signed by all EU Member States and also ratified by most of them. 69 Article 263 of the EC Treaty makes provision for the Committee of the Regions comprising representatives of regional and local authorities. Inherent in this provision is a certain recognition of self-government alongside the possibility of providing insti- tutionalised machinery for bringing to bear regional and municipal perspectives. Finally 68 \u2014 See also the Opinion of Advocate General Kokott in Parking Brixen (cited in footnote 12 above), point 71. It is not the general application of procurement law to public-public entities that interferes with rights to self-administration (see on this, Egger, cited in footnote 2 above, p. 168, para- graph 621), but the excessive application thereof. See also \u2018Rekommunalisierung und Europarecht nach dem Vertrag von Lissabon\u2019, Wettbewerb in Recht und Praxis (WRP) 2008, p. 73 et seq., p. 85: municipal self government must be preserved in its basic structures even if it does not have carte blanche to disregard fundamental European freedoms. 69 \u2014 Cited in footnote 14 above. Article 6(1) provides that, without prejudice to more general statutory provisions, local authorities must be able to determine their own internal administrative structures in order to adapt them to local needs and ensure effective management. the Treaty of Lisbon 70 stresses the role of regional and local self-government for the relevant national identity to which heed is to be paid. 86. Municipalities have themselves to decide whether they wish to carry out their general- interest tasks with their own administrative, technical and other means, without being compelled to have recourse to external establishments that do not form part of their own departments, 71 or whether they wish to carry them out with the assistance of an establishment legally distinct from them in their capacity as public entity awarding the contract or concession. If they opt for the second alternative, it is open to them to carry out these tasks of theirs on their own or in \u2018pure\u2019 cooperation with other public author- ities 72 \u2018controlled similarly to their own departments\u2019 and with the law on aid and procurement being largely suspended 73 or 70 \u2014 Treaty of Lisbon amending the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, signed at Lisbon, 13 December 2007 (OJ 2007, C 306, p. 1), Article 3a of the future EU Treaty, not yet in force.

To tackle the many traditional 76 and new 77 tasks of municipalities \u2014 and local authorities in general \u2014 is, particularly in times of restricted budgets, not always easy, especially for smaller authorities. 78 In addition, many tasks, in particular in the areas of environment and transport are not 74 \u2014 And where appropriate with the assistance of the requisite outside know-how. 75 \u2014 Jennert (cited in footnote 41 above), p. 626. 76 \u2014 The more or less traditional tasks of municipalities and authorities must include inter alia basic services for example provision of energy and water supplies, public transport and waste disposal, education and cultural establishments and hospitals (for examples, see inter alia, Frenz, cited in footnote 68 above, and Papier, \u2018Kommunale Daseinsvor- sorge im Spannungsfeld zwischen nationalem Recht und Gemeinschaftsrecht\u2019, [Communal basic services in the area of tension between national law and Community law] Deut\u00ad sche Verwaltungsbl\u00e4tter (DVBl) 2003, p. 686 et seq. 77 \u2014 To define public tasks which are in the general interest as \u2018state\u2019 tasks would be erroneously to fail to take account of the fact that the claims citizens make of their munici- palities are undergoing changes particularly over the course of time. In addition the concept of tasks in the general interest in Community procurement law cannot merely be equated with tasks securing existential requirements. Thus for example in the judgement in joined in Joined Cases C-223/99 and C-260/99 Agor\u00e0 and Excelsior [2001] ECR I-3605, paragraph 33 et seq.) it was held that the holding of fairs and exhibitions was an activity in the general interest because it was not only the interests of exhibitors and dealers that were involved but also the boost to trade which flows from the information provided to consumers (in the context of the interpretation of Article 1(b) of Dir - ective 92/50 cited in footnote 15 above. At issue was classification as a public law entity, which was not the case in Agor\u00e0 and Excelsior, because the task was held not to be a task of a non-commercial kind). 78 \u2014 See also on this Kotschy, cited in footnote 37 above, p. 853. confined to the municipality. 79 Conversely, inter-municipal cooperation without calling on private capital is owing to its synergistic effects a method used in many Member States for performing public functions in an efficient and cost-effective manner. 80 B \u2014 Second Teckal criterion 88. This does not need to be gone into further here: the referring court says no question rises in this regard. 81 79 \u2014 For many regional authorities overarching tasks with a trans-regional aspect arise for example in the sectors of local public transport, agricultural development and envir- onmental protection; in tackling these tasks cooperation represents a natural and obvious solution. An example of such cooperation is to be found in the case of Asemfo (cited in footnote 26 above). 80 \u2014 In addition to the submissions of the participating govern- ments see on that also, S\u00f6bbeke, cited in footnote 64 above, p. 999; Fl\u00f6mer/Tomerius, Interkommunale Zusammenar- beit unter Vergaberechtsvorbehalt?

Where such a cooperative comprises solely municipalities and associations of municipalities (public authorities) \u2014 without any private-capital involvement \u2014 that indicates in principle that the criterion as to exercise of similar control as that exercised over its own departments is satisfied. In circumstances such as those in the present case, control exercised by way of majority decision over the governing bodies of the cooperative comprising representatives of the municipalities and asso- ciations of municipalities is to be deemed to be control similar to that exercised over the municipality\u2019s own departments.

On 28 October 1999, the munici- pality decided to purchase the network with effect from 1 January 2000. To that end, the Municipality of Uccle launched a call for tenders \u2014 also by decision of 28 October 1999 \u2014 with a view to granting the right to operate the network to a concessionaire. Four companies, including Coditel, submitted tenders.

A notice of a call for purchase tenders was published in the Bulletin des adjudica\u00ad tions on 15 September 2000. Five companies, including Coditel, submitted purchase bids. In addition, Brut\u00e9l\u00e9, an inter-municipal cooperative society, submitted to the Municipality of Uccle an offer of affiliation as an associated member instead of a purchase bid.

        "I - 8493 CODITEL BRABANT Whereas within that framework: \u2014 Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 would draw up an income statement and balance sheet for activities on Uccle\u2019s network; \u2014 [the Municipality of] Uccle would have a director on the governing council of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 and three directors on the board of the Brussels operating sector, one appointee on the board of auditors and one as a municipal expert. Whereas Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 undertakes to cover the entire Uccle network and to increase the capacity of the network so that it can offer, within one year at most, if the munici- pality so wishes, all the following services: \u2014 expansion of the TV range: additional programmes and \u201cthe bouquet\u201d; \u2014 pay-per-view programmes; \u2014 Internet access; \u2014 voice telephony; \u2014 video surveillance; ",

Whereas the proposed annual fee consists of the following: (a) fixed fee equal to 10% of the income from basic subscriptions for cable television (on the basis of 31 000 subscribers and an annual subscription fee of BEF 3 400 (before VAT and royalties): BEF 10 540 000 per year); (b) payment of 5% of the turnover of Canal+ and of the bouquet; (c) payment of the entire profit on all the services provided.\u2019 It is clear from the order for reference that the Municipality of Uccle had to subscribe for 76 shares in Brut\u00e9l\u00e9, in the amount of BEF 200 000 per share. Moreover, the municipality requested, and obtained, from Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 the option of withdrawing unilat- erally from that inter-municipal cooperative at any time. It is also apparent from the order for reference that Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 is an inter-municipal cooperative society whose members are municipalities and an inter-municipal asso- ciation whose members in turn are solely municipalities. Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 is not open to private members. Its governing council consists of representatives of the munici- palities (a maximum of three per municipality), who are appointed by the general assembly, which is itself composed of representatives of the municipalities. The governing council enjoys the widest powers. 15 16 ",
        "I - 8495 CODITEL BRABANT The order for reference further makes clear that the municipalities are divided into two sections, one of which groups together the municipalities in the Brussels region, which may be divided into sub-sectors. Within each sector, there is a sector board consisting of directors appointed by the general assembly, sitting in separate groups representing the holders of shares for each of the sectors, from among candidates proposed by the municipalities. The governing council may delegate to the sector boards its powers with regard to matters affecting the sub-sectors, such as the condi- tions for the application of charges, the programme of works and investment, the financing thereof, advertising campaigns and problems common to the various sub- sectors within the operational sector. The constitutional bodies under Brut\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s stat- utes (\u2018the statutory bodies\u2019) additionally comprise the general assembly, whose deci- sions are binding on all members; the Director General; the board of experts, who are municipal officials and equal in number to the directors whom they are tasked with assisting; and the board of auditors. The Director General, the experts and the auditors are appointed by the governing council or the general assembly, as the case may be. Furthermore, according to the order for reference, Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 carries out the essential part of its activities with its members. By application lodged on 22 January 2001, Coditel brought an appeal before the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State) (Belgium), inter alia, for annulment of the deci- sion of 23 November 2000 whereby the Municipality of Uccle became a member of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9. In that appeal, Coditel took issue with the municipality for joining Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 and entrusting it with the management of its cable television network, without comparing the advantages of that arrangement with the advantages of granting another operator a concession for running the network. Coditel claimed that, by proceeding in that manner, the Municipality of Uccle had infringed, inter alia, the principle of non-discrimination and the obligation of transparency enshrined in Community law. Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 contested that claim, maintaining that it is \u2018purely\u2019 an inter-municipal co- operative whose activities are intended and reserved for the member municipalities 17 18 19 20 ",
        "I - 8496 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-324/07 and that its statutes allow the Municipality of Uccle, as an operational sub-sector, to exercise immediate and precise control over Brut\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s activities in that sub-sector, identical to the control that that municipality would exercise over its own internal departments. The Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat takes the view that the affiliation of the Municipality of Uccle to Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 does not constitute a public service contract but a public service concession for the purposes of Community law. Although the Community public procurement directives do not apply to public service concessions, the principle of non-discrim- ination on grounds of nationality implies an obligation of transparency in the award of concessions, in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice deriving from the judgment in Case C-324/98 Telaustria and Telefonadress [2000] ECR I-10745. In order to satisfy the requirements of Community law, the Municipality of Uccle ought, in principle, to have issued a call for competition in order to examine whether the award of the concession for its cable television service to economic operators other than Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 constituted a more attractive course of action than that chosen. The Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat asks whether those requirements of Community law are to be set aside in the light of the judgment in Case C-107/98 Teckal [1999] ECR I-8121, according to which those requirements do not apply where the concession-granting public authority exercises control over the concessionaire and where the concession- aire carries out the essential part of its activities with that authority. In those circumstances, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: \u2018(1) May a municipality, without calling for competition, join a cooperative society grouping together exclusively other municipalities and associations of munici- palities (a so-called \u201cpure\u201d inter-municipal cooperative) in order to transfer to that cooperative society the management of its cable television network, in the knowledge that the cooperative society carries out the essential part of its activ- ities for and with its own members and that decisions regarding those activities are taken by the governing council and the sector boards within the limits of the delegated powers granted to them by the governing council, those statutory bodies being composed of representatives of the public authorities and the deci- sions of those bodies being taken in accordance with the vote expressed by the majority of those representatives? 21 22 ",
        "I - 8497 CODITEL BRABANT (2) Can the control thus exercised over the decisions of the cooperative society, via the statutory bodies, by all the members of the cooperative society \u2014 or, in the case of operational sectors or sub-sectors, by some of those members \u2014 be regarded as enabling them to exercise over the cooperative society control similar to that exercised over their own departments? (3) For that control to be regarded as similar, must it be exercised individually by each member, or is it sufficient that it be exercised by the majority of the members?\u2019 The questions referred Questions 1 and 2 In the light of the connection between them, Questions 1 and 2 should be examined together. It is apparent from the referral decision that, by becoming a member of Brut\u00e9l\u00e9, the Municipality of Uccle entrusted it with the management of its cable television network. It is also apparent that Brut\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s remuneration comes not from the munici- pality but from payments made by the users of that network. That method of remu- neration is characteristic of a public service concession (Case C-458/03 Parking Brixen [2005] ECR I-8585, paragraph 40). 23 24 ",
        "I - 8498 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-324/07 Public service concession contracts do not fall within the scope of Council Dir - ective 92/50/EEC of 18 June 1992 relating to the coordination of procedures for the award of public service contracts (OJ 1992 L 209, p. 1), which was applicable at the material time. Notwithstanding the fact that such contracts fall outside the scope of that directive, the authorities concluding them are bound to comply with the funda- mental rules of the EC Treaty, the principles of equal treatment and non-discrimin- ation on grounds of nationality, and the concomitant obligation of transparency (see, to that effect, Telaustria and Telefonadress , paragraphs 60 to 62, and Case C-231/03 Coname [2005] ECR I-7287, paragraphs 16 to 19). Without necessarily implying an obligation to launch an invitation to tender, that obligation of transparency requires the concession-granting authority to ensure, for the benefit of any potential conces- sionaire, a degree of advertising sufficient to enable the service concession to be opened up to competition and the impartiality of the procurement procedures to be reviewed (see, to that effect, Telaustria and Telefonadress , paragraph 62, and Coname , paragraph 21). The application of the rules set out in Articles 12 EC, 43 EC and 49 EC, as well as of the general principles of which they are the specific expression, is precluded if the control exercised over the concessionaire by the concession-granting public authority is similar to that which the authority exercises over its own departments and if, at the same time, that entity carries out the essential part of its activities with the controlling authority or authorities (see, to that effect, Teckal , paragraph 50, and Parking Brixen , paragraph 62). As regards the second of those conditions, the national court stated in the order for reference that Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 carries out the essential part of its activities with its members. Accordingly, the scope of the first condition \u2014 that the control exercised over the concessionaire by the concession-granting public authority or authorities must be similar to that which the authority exercises over its own departments \u2014 remains to be examined. 25 26 27 ",
        "I - 8499 CODITEL BRABANT In order to determine whether a concession-granting public authority exercises a control similar to that which it exercises over its own departments, it is neces- sary to take account of all the legislative provisions and relevant circumstances. It must follow from that examination that the concessionaire in question is subject to a control which enables the concession-granting public authority to influence that entity\u2019s decisions. It must be a case of a power of decisive influence over both stra- tegic objectives and significant decisions of that entity (see, to that effect, Parking Brixen , paragraph 65, and Case C-340/04 Carbotermo and Consorzio Alisei [2006] ECR I-4137, paragraph 36). Of the relevant facts which can be identified from the order for reference, it is appro- priate to consider, first, the holding of capital by the concessionaire, secondly, the composition of its decision-making bodies, and thirdly, the extent of the powers conferred on its governing council. As regards the first of those facts, it should be borne in mind that, where a private undertaking holds a share of the capital of a concessionaire, this precludes the possi- bility for a concession-granting public authority to exercise over that concessionaire a control similar to that which it exercises over its own departments (see, to that effect, Case C-26/03 Stadt Halle and RPL Lochau [2005] ECR I-1, paragraph 49). On the other hand, the fact that the concession-granting public authority holds, alone or together with other public authorities, all of the share capital in a conces- sionaire, tends to indicate \u2014 generally, but not conclusively \u2014 that that contracting authority exercises over that company a control similar to that which it exercises over its own departments ( Carbotermo and Consorzio Alisei , paragraph 37, and Case C-295/05 Asemfo [2007] ECR I-2999, paragraph 57). 28 29 30 31 ",
        "I - 8500 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-324/07 It is clear from the order for reference that, in the case before the referring court, the concessionaire is an inter-municipal cooperative society whose members are munici- palities and an inter-municipal association whose members in turn are solely muni- cipalities, and is not open to private members. Secondly, it is clear from the file that Brut\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s governing council consists of repre- sentatives of the affiliated municipalities, appointed by the general assembly, which is itself composed of representatives of the affiliated municipalities. In accordance with Article 12 of the Law on inter-municipal cooperatives, the representatives at the general assembly are appointed by the municipal council of each municipality from among the municipal councillors, the mayor and the aldermen. The fact that Brut\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s decision-making bodies are composed of representatives of the public authorities which are affiliated to Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 shows that those bodies are under the control of the public authorities, which are thus able to exert decisive influence over both Brut\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s strategic objectives and significant decisions. Thirdly, it is evident from the file that Brut\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s governing council enjoys the widest powers. In particular, it fixes the charges. It also has the power \u2014 but is under no obligation \u2014 to delegate to the sector or sub-sector boards the resolution of certain matters particular to those sectors or sub-sectors. The question arises as to whether Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 has thus become market-oriented and gained a degree of independence which would render tenuous the control exercised by the public authorities affiliated to it. 32 33 34 35 36 ",
        "I - 8501 CODITEL BRABANT In this regard, it should be pointed out that Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 does not take the form of a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par actions , or a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme , either of which is capable of pursuing objectives independently of its shareholders, but of an inter-municipal cooperative society governed by the Law on inter-municipal cooperatives. Moreover, in accordance with Article 3 of that Law, inter-municipal cooperatives are not to have a commercial character. It seems to be apparent from that Law, which is supplemented by Brut\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s statutes, that Brut\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s object under its statutes is the pursuit of the municipal interest \u2014 that being the raison d\u2019\u00eatre for its creation \u2014 and that it does not pursue any interest which is distinct from that of the public authorities affiliated to it. Subject to verification of the facts by the referring court, it follows that, despite the extent of the powers conferred on its governing council, Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 does not enjoy a degree of independence sufficient to preclude the municipalities which are affili- ated to it from exercising over it control similar to that exercised over their own departments. Those considerations are all the more applicable where decisions relating to the activ- ities of the inter-municipal cooperative society are taken by the sector or sub-sector boards, within the limits of the delegated powers granted to them by the governing council. Where one or more affiliated municipalities are recognised as constituting a sector or sub-sector of that society\u2019s activities, the control which those municipalities may exercise over the matters delegated to the sector or sub-sector boards is even stricter than that which they exercise in conjunction with all the members within the plenary bodies of that society. It follows from the foregoing that, subject to verification of the facts by the referring court as regards the degree of independence enjoyed by the inter-municipal coopera- tive society in question, in circumstances such as those of the case before the refer- ring court, the control exercised, via the statutory bodies, by the public authorities 37 38 39 40 41 ",
        "I - 8502 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-324/07 belonging to such an inter-municipal cooperative society over that society\u2019s deci- sions may be regarded as enabling those authorities to exercise over that cooperative society control similar to that exercised over their own departments. Accordingly, the answer to Questions 1 and 2 must be that: \u2014 Articles 43 EC and 49 EC, the principles of equal treatment and of non-discrim - ination on grounds of nationality, and the concomitant obligation of transparency, do not preclude a public authority from awarding, without calling for compe- tition, a public service concession to an inter-municipal cooperative society of which all the members are public authorities, where those public authorities exercise over that cooperative society control similar to that exercised over their own departments and where that society carries out the essential part of its activ- ities with those public authorities; \u2014 Subject to verification of the facts by the referring court as regards the degree of independence enjoyed by the inter-municipal cooperative society in question, in circumstances such as those of the case before the referring court, where deci- sions regarding the activities of an inter-municipal cooperative society owned exclusively by public authorities are taken by bodies, created under the statutes of that society, which are composed of representatives of the affiliated public authorities, the control exercised over those decisions by the public authorities may be regarded as enabling those authorities to exercise over the cooperative society control similar to that exercised over their own departments. 42 ",
        "I - 8503 CODITEL BRABANT Question 3 By Question 3, the national court is essentially asking whether, where a public authority joins an inter-communal cooperative of which all the members are public authorities in order to transfer to that cooperative society the management of a public service, it is necessary, in order for the control which those member author- ities exercise over the cooperative to be regarded as similar to that which they exer- cise over their own departments, for that control to be exercised individually by each of those public authorities or whether it can be exercised jointly by them, decisions being taken by a majority, as the case may be. First, it should be pointed out that, according to the case-law of the Court, where several public authorities control a concessionaire, the condition relating to the essential part of that entity\u2019s activities may be met if account is taken of the activities which that entity carries out with all those authorities (see, to that effect, Carbotermo and Consorzio Alisei , paragraphs 70 and 71, and Asemfo , paragraph 62). It would be consistent with the reasoning underlying that case-law to consider that the condition as to the control exercised by the public authorities may also be satis- fied if account is taken of the control exercised jointly over the concessionaire by the controlling public authorities. According to the case-law, the control exercised over the concessionaire by a conces- sion-granting public authority must be similar to that which the authority exer- cises over its own departments, but not identical in every respect (see, to that effect, Parking Brixen , paragraph 62). The control exercised over the concessionaire must be effective, but it is not essential that it be exercised individually. 43 44 45 46 ",
        "I - 8504 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-324/07 Secondly, where a number of public authorities elect to carry out their public service tasks by having recourse to a municipal concessionaire, it is usually not possible for one of those authorities, unless it has a majority interest in that entity, to exercise decisive control over the decisions of the latter. To require the control exercised by a public authority in such a case to be individual would have the effect of requiring a call for competition in the majority of cases where a public authority seeks to join a grouping composed of other public authorities, such as an inter-municipal coopera- tive society. Such a result, however, would not be consistent with Community rules on public procurement and concession contracts. Indeed, a public authority has the possibility of performing the public interest tasks conferred on it by using its own administra- tive, technical and other resources, without being obliged to call on outside entities not forming part of its own departments ( Stadt Halle and RPL Lochau , paragraph 48). That possibility for public authorities to use their own resources to perform the public interest tasks conferred on them may be exercised in cooperation with other public authorities (see, to that effect, Asemfo , paragraph 65). It must therefore be recognised that, where a number of public authorities own a concessionaire to which they entrust the performance of one of their public service tasks, the control which those public authorities exercise over that entity may be exercised jointly. As regards collective decision-making bodies, the procedure which is used for adopting decisions \u2014 such as, inter alia, adoption by majority \u2014 is of no importance. 47 48 49 50 51 ",
        "I - 8505 CODITEL BRABANT That conclusion is not undermined by Coname . Admittedly, the Court consid- ered in that judgment that a 0.97% interest is so small as to preclude a municipality from exercising control over the concessionaire managing a public service (see Coname , paragraph 24). However, in that passage of the judgment, the Court was not concerned with the question whether such control could be exercised jointly. Furthermore, in a later judgment \u2014 namely, Asemfo , paragraphs 56 to 61 \u2014 the Court recognised that in certain circumstances the condition relating to the control exercised by the public authority could be satisfied where such an authority held only 0.25% of the capital in a public undertaking. Consequently, the answer to Question 3 must be that, where a public authority joins an inter-communal cooperative of which all the members are public authorities in order to transfer to that cooperative society the management of a public service, it is possible, in order for the control which those member authorities exercise over the cooperative to be regarded as similar to that which they exercise over their own departments, for it to be exercised jointly by those authorities, decisions being taken by a majority, as the case may be. Costs Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. 52 53 54 55 ",
        "I - 8506 JUDGMENT OF 13. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-324/07 On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Articles 43 EC and 49 EC, the principles of equal treatment and of non- discrimination on grounds of nationality and the concomitant obligation of transparency do not preclude a public authority from awarding, without calling for competition, a public service concession to an inter-municipal cooperative society of which all the members are public authorities, where those public authorities exercise over that cooperative society control similar to that exercised over their own departments and where that society carries out the essential part of its activities with those public authorities. 2. Subject to verification of the facts by the referring court as regards the degree of independence enjoyed by the inter-municipal cooperative society in ques- tion, in circumstances such as those of the case before the referring court, where decisions regarding the activities of an inter-municipal cooperative society owned exclusively by public authorities are taken by bodies, created under the statutes of that society, which are composed of representatives of the affiliated public authorities, the control exercised over those decisions by the public authorities may be regarded as enabling those authorities to exercise over the cooperative society control similar to that exercised over their own departments. 3. Where a public authority joins an inter-communal cooperative of which all the members are public authorities in order to transfer to that cooperative society the management of a public service, it is possible, in order for the control which those member authorities exercise over the cooperative to be regarded as similar to that which they exercise over their own departments, for it to be exercised jointly by those authorities, decisions being taken by a majority, as the case may be.

A student who is a national of a Member State and travels to another Member State in order to study there and who ceased all employment during the period at issue in order to pursue his studies, without however having abandoned his plan to continue his career in that latter Member State, where he main- tained his residence, cannot, in order to obtain a maintenance grant, rely on Article 7 of Regulation No 1251/70 on the right of workers to remain in the territory of a Member State after having been employed in that State, which provides that a worker who is a national of a Member State is to enjoy in the terri- tory of another Member State \u2018the same social and tax advantages as national workers\u2019. The conditions of entitlement to the worker\u2019s right to remain in the host Member State are set out exhaustively in Article 2 of Regulation No 1251/70. Since the situation of the student in question does not fall within any of the cases set out in that article, such a student cannot be regarded as a \u2018[national] of a Member State who [has] worked as [an employed person] in the territory of another Member State\u2019 within the meaning of Article 1 of Regulation No 1251/70, and that regulation thus is not applicable.

        "I - 8509 F\u00d6RSTER Member States of a requirement of five years\u2019 prior residence. It is legitimate for a Member State to grant assistance covering maintenance costs only to students who have demon- strated a certain degree of integration into the society of that State. In that regard, the existence of a certain degree of integration may be regarded as estab- lished by a finding that the student in question has resided in the host Member State for a certain length of time. As regards, specifically, the compatibility with Community law of a condition of five years\u2019 uninterrupted residence, it is appropriate for the purpose of guaran- teeing that the applicant for the main- tenance grant at issue is integrated into the society of the host Member State. Furthermore, such a condition of five years\u2019 uninterrupted residence cannot be held to be excessive having regard, inter alia, to the requirements put forward with respect to the degree of integration of non-nationals in the host Member State. Moreover, in order to be propor- tionate, a residence requirement must be applied by the national authorities on the basis of clear criteria known in advance. By enabling those concerned to know, without any ambiguity, what their rights and obligations are, the residence requirement laid down by the national legislation at issue is, by its very exist- ence, such as to guarantee a significant level of legal certainty and transparency in the context of the award of mainten- ance grants to students. Thus, the resi- dence requirement of five years, such as that laid down in the national legislation, does not go beyond what is necessary to attain the objective of ensuring that students from other Member States are to a certain degree integrated into the society of the host Member State. That finding is without prejudice to the option for Member States to award mainten- ance grants to students from other Member States who do not fulfil the five year residence requirement should they wish to do so.

By order of 16 March 2007, received at the Court on 22 March 2007, the Higher Social Security Court (Centrale Raad van Beroep), (Netherlands) has referred several questions for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC concerning the interpretation of Community legislation on the right of workers to move and reside freely and the Treaty provisions on citizenship of the Union in conjunction with Article 12 EC. 2. The reference was made in the course of proceedings brought by Ms F\u00f6rster, a German national who had moved to the Netherlands to pursue a course of higher education and who initially also performed paid work there during her studies, against the Hoofddirectie van de Informatie Beheer Groep (\u2018the IBG\u2019), the administrative body charged with the enforcement of Nether- lands legislation relating to the financing of studies. Ms F\u00f6rster challenges the IBG\u2019s 1 \u2014 Original language: English. refusal to grant her financial assistance to cover study and maintenance costs (\u2018study finance\u2019) in relation to a period during which she was no longer economically active, on the grounds that she neither retained the status of a Community worker nor fulfilled the requirement, as applied by the IBG, of lawful residence in the Netherlands for a continu- ous period of at least five years. 3. Thus the present case essentially raises two issues. The first is the question whether a (migrant) student in Ms F\u00f6rster\u2019s situation can invoke the right of a Community worker to equal treatment in order to claim study finance, in spite of the fact that at the time in question she had ceased her previous occu- pational activities and was thus economically inactive. 4. Secondly, the referring court wishes to ascertain, in substance, whether a student like Ms F\u00f6rster, as a citizen of the Union, can ",
        "I - 8512 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-158/07 in any event rely on the principle of equal treatment enshrined in the first paragraph of Article 12 EC in order to obtain study finance and, in particular, whether and under what conditions the eligibility for such a grant may be made dependent on the requirement that the student concerned be lawfully resident in the host Member State for a period of five years before applying for financial support. 5. The Court is thus invited to refine its Bidar case-law and, in particular, its finding that it is legitimate for a Member State to grant financial assistance only to students who have demonstrated a \u2018certain degree of integration into the society of that State\u2019. 2 II \u2014 Legal Framework A \u2014 Community law 6. Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of the Council of 15 October 1968 on 2 \u2014 Case C-209/03 [2005] ECR I-2119, paragraph 57. freedom of movement for workers within the Community 3 provides: \u20181. A worker who is a national of a Member State may not, in the territory of another Member State, be treated differently from national workers by reason of his nationality in respect of any conditions of employment and work, in particular as regards remuner- ation, dismissal, and should he become un- employed, reinstatement or re-employment. 2. He shall enjoy the same social and tax advantages as national workers.\u2019 7.

Article 3 of Directive 93/96 provides: \u2018This Directive shall not establish any en- titlement to the payment of maintenance grants by the host Member State on the part of students benefiting from the right of residence.\u2019 9. Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1251/70 of the Commission of 29 June 1970 on the right of workers to remain in the territory of a Member State after having been employed in that State 5 reads as follows: \u20181. The following shall have the right to remain permanently in the territory of a Member State: (a) a worker who, at the time of termination of his activity, has reached the age laid down by the law of that Member State for entitlement to an old-age pension and who has been employed in that State for at least the last twelve months and has resided there continuously for more than three years; \u2026\u2019 10.

        "I - 8514 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-158/07 11. Regulation No 1612/68 was amended, and Directive 93/96 repealed, by Direct- ive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, 6 which the Member States, in accordance with Article 40, had to transpose by 30 April 2006. 12. According to Article 16(1) of Directive 2004/38: \u2018Union citizens who have resided legally for a continuous period of five years in the host Member State shall have the right of per - manent residence there. \u2026\u2019 13. Article 24 of Directive 2004/38, entitled \u2018Equal treatment\u2019, provides as follows: \u20181. Subject to such specific provisions as are expressly provided for in the Treaty and 6 \u2014 OJ 2004 L 158, p. 77, as corrected in OJ 2004 L 229, p. 35. secondary law, all Union citizens residing on the basis of this Directive in the terri- tory of the host Member State shall enjoy equal treatment with the nationals of that Member State within the scope of the Treaty. The benefit of this right shall be extended to family members who are not nationals of a Member State and who have the right of resi- dence or permanent residence. 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the host Member State shall not be obliged to confer entitlement to social assistance during the first three months of residence or, where appropriate, the longer period provided for in Article 14(4)(b), nor shall it be obliged, prior to acquisition of the right of permanent residence, to grant maintenance aid for studies, including vocational training, consisting in student grants or student loans to persons other than workers, self-employed persons, persons who retain such status and members of their families.\u2019 B \u2014 Relevant national law 14. The rules governing study finance grants are laid down in the Law on the financing of studies (Wet studiefinanciering, \u2018the WSF ",
        "I - 8515 F\u00d6RSTER 2000\u2019). One of the requirements relates to the student\u2019s nationality. That aspect is covered by Article 2.2 of the WSF 2000, which in the period from 1 September 2000 to 21 November 2003 read as follows: \u2018Study finance may be granted to: (a) students who possess Netherlands nationality, (b) students who do not possess Netherlands nationality but are resident in the Neth- erlands and are treated as Netherlands nationals in respect of the financing of studies by virtue of a treaty or a decision of an organisation of public international law, or (c) students who do not have Netherlands nationality but are resident in the Neth- erlands and belong to a group of persons who, by administrative order, are treated as Netherlands nationals in respect of the financing of studies.\u2019 15. Paragraph 2 of Article 2.2., added with effect from 21 November 2003, reads as follows: \u2018In derogation from Article 2.2(1)(b), the requirement that a student be resident in the Netherlands shall not apply to a student on whom that requirement may not be imposed because of a Treaty or a decision of an organisation of public international law. By or pursuant to an administrative order, rules may be laid down in connection with the satisfactory implementation of this paragraph.\u2019 16. On 4 March 2005 the IBG, the admin- istrative body responsible for enforcing the WSF 2000, adopted the Policy rule on the monitoring of migrant workers (Beleidsregel controlebeleid migrerend werknemerschap). 7 It entered into force on 23 March 2005 and concerns the monitoring of periods of study finance with effect from the calendar year 2003. It requires the IBG to proceed from the assumption that any student who has worked for an average of 32 hours or more per month in the moni- tored period automatically enjoys the status 7 \u2014 AG/OCW/MT-05.11.

If, however, a student does not satisfy the 32-hour criterion, the IBG undertakes a more detailed investigation into the specific circumstances of the case. 17. Following the Court\u2019s ruling in Bidar , 8 the IBG on 9 May 2005 further adopted the Policy rule on the adaptation of applica- tions for study finance for students from the EU, EEA and Switzerland (Beleidsregel aanpassing aanvraag studiefinanciering voor studenten uit EU, EER en Zwitserland, \u2018the Beleidsregel of 9 May 2005\u2019), 9 which, in accordance with its Article 5, entered into force at the time of its publication with retro- active effect from 15 March 2005. 18. Article 2(1) and (2) of the Beleidsregel of 9 May 2005 reads as follows: \u20181. A student who is a national of a Member State of the European Union or of another State which is party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2 May 1992 or of Switzerland may, on application, 8 \u2014 Cited in footnote 2. 9 \u2014 AGOCenW/MT/05. be eligible for study finance pursuant to the WSF 2000\u2026 if, prior to the application, he has been lawfully resident in the Nether- lands for an uninterrupted period of at least five years. The other provisions of the WSF 2000\u2026 shall apply without qualification. 2. The residence requirement laid down in the first paragraph is assumed to have been satisfied if the student has been registered on the municipal personal records database (GBA) during the period referred to.\u2019 19. Since 11 October 2006 the matter has been governed by legislation and the Beleidsregel of 9 May 2005 has been withdrawn. III \u2014 Factual background, procedure and questions referred 20. According to the order for reference and information provided at the hearing, the facts of the case are as follows. ",
        "I - 8517 F\u00d6RSTER 21. Jacqueline F\u00f6rster, a German national, was born on 18 June 1979 and grew up in Grevenbroich, Germany, which is 49 kilo- metres from the Dutch\u2013German border. 22. On 5 March 2000 Ms F\u00f6rster settled in the Netherlands, where she immediately enrolled for training as a primary teacher and, on 1 September 2000, on a course in educational theory leading to a bachelor\u2019s degree at the College of Amsterdam (Hoge- school van Amsterdam). 23. From 16 March 2000 she also carried out, via an employment agency, various jobs in call centres. 24. From October 2002 until June 2003 she underwent full-time paid practical training at a Dutch school providing secondary special education for pupils with behavioural prob- lems and/or psychiatric disturbances. 25. After that practical training she under- took no further paid employment in 2003. Since July 2004 she has again been employed in the Netherlands. 26. According to the order for reference, Ms F\u00f6rster has always been lawfully resident in the Netherlands. 27. From September 2000 the IBG granted Ms F\u00f6rster study finance. That grant was periodically extended, always on the assump- tion that in the following period Ms F\u00f6rster would be regarded as a worker within the meaning of Article 39 EC who, pursuant to Article 7(2) of Regulation No 1612/68, had to be treated as a student of Netherlands nationality in respect of study finance. 28. Her entitlement to study finance ended on 1 September 2004, once she had passed the final examination in the course in educa- tional theory leading to a bachelor\u2019s degree. 29. Initially, Ms F\u00f6rster was also granted study finance during the second half of 2003. However, following a check, the IBG eventually ruled, by its decision of 3 March 2005, that Ms F\u00f6rster had not been gain- fully employed since July 2003 and could no ",
        "I - 8518 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-158/07 longer be regarded as a Community worker. She was therefore ordered to repay the study finance relating to the second half of 2003, plus a sum for a public transport ticket covering that period which had been paid for by the IBG. 30. Ms F\u00f6rster appealed against that decision to the Rechtbank Alkmaar (Alkmaar District Court), arguing that she had performed so many hours of paid employment in the first half of 2003 that she should be regarded as having also been a Community worker in respect of the second half of 2003. In the alternative, she submitted that, as a citizen of the Union fully integrated into Dutch society, she was eligible for study finance in that period pursuant to the Bidar judgment. 10 31. The IBG denied that Ms F\u00f6rster could be regarded as a Community worker in the second half of 2003 and considered that its decision was consistent with Community law as interpreted in Bidar . It took the view that students in her situation who do not derive any rights from a specific provision 10 \u2014 Cited in footnote 2. prohibiting discrimination are eligible for study finance only on condition that they have been lawfully resident in the Nether- lands for at least five years, which was not yet the case with Ms F\u00f6rster in 2003. 32. In its judgment of 12 September 2005, the Rechtbank Alkmaar dismissed the appeal. It considered, on the one hand, that in the second half of 2003 Ms F\u00f6rster did not undertake genuine and effective employment and was therefore not to be regarded as a Community worker and, on the other hand, that she could not rely on the Bidar ruling since she had not been in any way integrated into Dutch society before her studies. 33. The main proceedings before the Cent- rale Raad van Beroep concern the appeal brought by Ms F\u00f6rster against that judg- ment. She argues, principally, that, at the material time, she was already so integrated into Dutch society that she was entitled under Community law to study finance for the second half of 2003 and, alternatively, that she should be regarded as having been a Community worker throughout 2003. The IBG, for its part, maintains its position. ",
        "I - 8519 F\u00d6RSTER 34. Referring, in particular, to the Court\u2019s judgments in Ninni\u00adOrasche 11 and Fahmi and Amado , 12 the referring court agrees, for the time being, with the IBG\u2019s view that Ms F\u00f6rster cannot be deemed to have retained the status of Community worker in the second half of 2003, since the beginning of her studies did not follow on from activities previously undertaken in the Netherlands and there was no question of involuntary unemployment which might have caused her to consider herself compelled to undergo training. 35. It notes, however, that Ms F\u00f6rster may derive an entitlement to study finance from the legislation on former workers or the rules concerning citizenship of the Union in conjunction with the prohibition of discrim- ination on grounds of nationality laid down in Article 12 EC. 36. That raises several questions. First, the referring court is uncertain about the scope of Regulation No 1251/70, particularly as to whether Article 7 thereof also applies to students who came to the Netherlands principally to study and initially worked as employed persons on a limited scale while 11 \u2014 Case C-413/01 [2003] ECR I-13187. 12 \u2014 Case C-33/99 [2001] ECR I-2415. continuing to study, but who have mean- while ceased to work. 37. Second, the referring court points out that a number of as yet unanswered ques- tions of interpretation in respect of citi- zenship of the Union and Article 12 EC have arisen during the main proceedings, including whether, in the light of Bidar, 13 Directive 93/96 precludes a student in Ms F\u00f6rster\u2019s situation, who came to the Neth- erlands primarily to study, from relying on Article 12 EC in order to obtain study finance. 38. Furthermore, the referring court asks what conclusions should be drawn from the Bidar 14 and Trojani 15 judgments in relation to the five years of residence required under the Beleidsregel of 9 May 2005 as applied by the IBG. 13 \u2014 Cited in footnote 2. 14 \u2014 Cited in footnote 2. 15 \u2014 Case C-456/02 [2004] ECR I-7573. ",
        "I - 8520 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-158/07 39. In particular, it would like to know, first, whether, in matters of study finance, Union citizens can rely on the first paragraph of Article 12 EC at all before they have been lawfully resident in the host Member State for a certain period or are in possession of a residence permit. 40. Second, it wonders whether a residence requirement provided for under national law is consistent with Article 12 EC if it is imposed solely on nationals of other Member States. 41. Third, if such a requirement can be justified in principle, the question arises whether the five-year residence require- ment, as applied by the IBG, complies with that article. In that regard, the referring court notes that the fact that that period is derived from Directive 2004/38 suggests that it is lawful. If so, it wonders to what extent it may be imposed without qualification in individual cases if other factors indicate a substantial degree of integration into Nether- lands society, such as the particular choice of study or having a Dutch partner. 42. Finally, the order for reference notes that the decision, based on the Beleidsregel of 9 May 2005, to deny Ms F\u00f6rster study finance for the second half of 2003 on the ground that she had not been lawfully resi- dent in the Netherlands for a continuous period of at least five years, is founded on an interpretation of the Bidar judgment and thus on a criterion which could not have been known at the relevant time, which may be at odds with the ruling in Collins 16 that a residence requirement must rest on clear criteria known in advance. The refer- ring court emphasises, however, that there is no question of arbitrariness and that, as it is a period in the past which is concerned, the legal certainty of the interested party does not seem to be at issue. It points out, more- over, that the IBG published the Beleidsregel of 9 May 2005 a short time after the Bidar judgment. 43. It is against that background that the Centrale Raad van Beroep has stayed proceedings and referred the following ques- tions to the Court: \u2018(1) Does Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 1251/70 also apply to students who came to the Netherlands principally to study and initially worked as employed persons on a limited scale while continu- ing to study, but have meanwhile ceased to work? 16 \u2014 Case C-138/02 [2004] ECR I-2703, paragraph 72. ",
        "I - 8521 F\u00d6RSTER (2) Does Directive 93/96 preclude students as referred to in Question 1 from successfully relying on Article 12 EC to claim full study finance? (3) (a) Does the rule that citizens of the Union who are not economically active can rely on Article 12 EC only if they have resided lawfully in the host Member State for a certain period or are in possession of a residence permit also apply to assistance to cover the main- tenance costs of students? (b) If so, is it permissible to impose during that period a residence duration requirement only on nationals of Member States other than the host Member State? (c) If so, is the application of a five-year residence duration requirement consistent with Article 12 EC? (d) If not, what residence duration may be required? (4) Should a shorter period of lawful resi- dence be required in individual cases if factors other than the duration of resi- dence indicate a substantial degree of integration into the society of the host Member State? (5) If, as is evident from a judgment of the Court of Justice, persons are able to derive, with retroactive effect, more rights from Article 12 EC than was previ- ously assumed, may justified require- ments connected therewith be imposed in respect of periods in the past if those requirements were published shortly after the publication of the judgment?\u2019 IV \u2014 Legal analysis A \u2014 Introductory remarks 44. As is evident from the description of the facts provided in the order for reference, the essential question in the present dispute is whether, in the circumstances of the case, Ms F\u00f6rster is entitled under Community law ",
        "I - 8522 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-158/07 to equal treatment in respect of the grant of study finance for university education. 45. Ms F\u00f6rster\u2019s claim relates to a period during which she was not pursuing any occu- pational activity and was thus not econom- ically active. As has been observed before, 17 that circumstance is decisive in Commu- nity law, which \u2014 in particular as regards the enjoyment of social benefits \u2014 broadly draws a distinction between economically active persons (workers and self-employed persons) on the one hand, and economically inactive persons on the other. As a rule, the first category of persons has more extensive entitlements under Community law than the second. 46. Thus, for example, the Court\u2019s case-law distinguishes between, on the one hand, Member States\u2019 nationals such as job-seekers who have not yet entered into an employ- ment relationship and who benefit from the principle of equality of treatment only as regards access to employment, and, on the other, those who have already entered the employment market of the host Member 17 \u2014 See, to that effect, the Opinions of Advocate General Geelhoed in Trojani , cited in footnote 15, point 10, and Bidar , cited in footnote 2, point 12. State and may, on the basis of Article 7(2) of Regulation No 1612/68, claim the same social and tax advantages as national workers. 18 47. Accordingly, as regards the rights of migrant students to obtain social benefits, the situation is that, at least under Direct- ive 93/96 as well as, prior to the completion of five years of continuous residence, under Directive 2004/38, a \u2018pure\u2019, economically inactive migrant student has in principle no entitlement to the payment of maintenance grants by the host Member State. However, a student who also qualifies as a worker within the meaning of Article 39 EC can avail himself of Article 7(2) of Regulation No 1612/68, which confers on workers of any Member State the right to receive in another Member State the same treatment as its own nationals as regards entitlement to social advantages. 19 48. It was actually on that basis, in other words on account of her status as a Commu- nity worker, that Ms F\u00f6rster was initially granted study finance in the Netherlands. 18 \u2014 See, to that effect, Collins , cited in footnote 16, para- graphs 30 and 31, and Case 316/85 Lebon [1987] ECR 2811, paragraph 26. 19 \u2014 See, as to that, below at points 65 and 66. ",
        "I - 8523 F\u00d6RSTER That finance was, however, subsequently revoked in relation to the second half of 2003 on the ground that during that period she was no longer in an employment rela- tionship, a fact which is not disputed in the present proceedings. 49. In that respect, the referring court has rightly recognised that, under specific Community legislation such as Regula- tion No 1251/70 and in accordance with the Lair 20 and Ninni\u00adOrasche 21 judgments, migrant workers are guaranteed certain rights in relation to social advantages linked to their status as a worker even when they are no longer in an employment relationship. 50. That court agrees, however, \u2018for the time being\u2019 with the view that Ms F\u00f6rster cannot be deemed to have retained the status of Community worker within the meaning of Article 39 EC and Article 7(2) of Regula- tion No 1612/68. Question 1 consequently refers only to Regulation No 1251/70. The Commission\u2019s suggestion to the contrary nevertheless merits consideration in my view. In the first part of my assessment I 20 \u2014 Case 39/86 [1988] ECR 3161. 21 \u2014 Cited in footnote 11. shall therefore examine the question whether or under what circumstances a student in a situation such as that in question may avail himself of the right to be treated equally in respect of student finance, either by virtue of Regulation No 1251/70 or as a worker on the basis of Regulation No 1612/68. 51. It should be recalled in this context that the fact that the national court has referred a question which mentions specific provi- sions of Community law does not prevent the Court, irrespective of what appears in that question, from providing the national court with all those elements for the interpretation of Community law which may enable it to reach a decision in the case before it. 22 52. In any event, for students unable to claim a specific right to equal treatment such as is accorded to a Community worker, the intro- duction of Union citizenship has opened 22 \u2014 See, for example, Case C-241/89 SARPP [1990] ECR I-4695, paragraph 8, and Trojani , cited in footnote 15, paragraph 38. ",
        "I - 8524 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-158/07 another possible avenue to, inter alia, the right to equal treatment in respect of main- tenance grants. 53. As the Court has declared, Union citi- zenship is destined to be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States and enables those who find themselves in the same situation to receive the same treatment in law irrespective of their nationality. 23 As regards, more particularly, social assistance benefits, the Court has breathed life into that status in cases such as Mart\u00ednez Sala , Trojani and Bidar by holding that a citizen of the Union who is not economically active may rely on the first paragraph of Article 12 EC where he has been lawfully resident in the host Member State for a certain time or possesses a residence permit. 24 54. It is thus fair to say that the concept of Union citizenship, as developed by the case-law of the Court, marks a process of emancipation of Community rights from their economic paradigm. That is in fact 23 \u2014 See, for example, Cases C-413/99 Baumbast and R [2002] ECR I-7091, paragraph 82; C-184/99 Grzelczyk [2001] ECR I-6193, paragraph 31; and C-148/02 Garcia Avello [2003] ECR I-11613, paragraph 22. 24 \u2014 Case C-85/96 Mart\u00ednez Sala [1998] ECR I-2691, para- graph 63; Trojani , cited in footnote 15, paragraph 43; and Bidar , cited in footnote 2, paragraph 37. the objective invoked by the statement of the Court that Union citizenship is destined to become the \u2018fundamental status of nationals of the Member States\u2019.

Thus, whereas rights to social bene- fits were originally linked to the pursuit of economic activities (in particular in the form of paid employment, which underpins the concept of a worker), they may now also be available to economically inactive citizens on the basis of the principle of non-discrim- ination. Whereas a Member State was previ- ously required to assume full social responsi- bility and provide welfare for those who had already entered its employment market 26 and who thus made some contribution to its economy, such financial solidarity is now in 25 \u2014 See also, to similar effect, the Opinions of Advocate General Cosmas in Case C-378/97 Wijsenbeek [1999] ECR I-6207, points 84 to 86, and of Advocate General Poiares Maduro in Case C-72/03 Carbonati Apuani [2004] ECR I-8027, points 68 and 69. 26 \u2014 See Case 235/87 Matteucci [1988] ECR 5589, paragraph 16.

As the Court pointed out in Grzel\u00ad czyk and Bidar , Member States are required to show \u2018a certain degree of financial soli- darity\u2019 in the organisation and application of their social assistance systems, as opposed, one might add, to unlimited solidarity. 27 As regards assistance covering the maintenance costs of students, the Court accepted in Bidar that Member States are permitted to ensure that the grant of social assistance does not become an unreasonable burden upon them and that the grant of such assistance may be limited to students who have demonstrated \u2018a certain degree of integration\u2019. 28 57. Against that background and in the light of the Bidar ruling, the referring court\u2019s Questions 2, 3 and 4, which I shall address together in the second part of my assess- ment, seek to ascertain whether, in the circumstances of her case, Ms F\u00f6rster can avail herself of her right as a Union citizen to 27 \u2014 See Grzelczyk , cited in footnote 23, paragraph 44, and Bidar , cited in footnote 2, paragraph 56. 28 \u2014 Bidar , cited in footnote 2, paragraphs 56 and 57; see also, to that effect, Joined Cases C-11/06 and C-12/06 Morgan and Bucher [2007] ECR I-9161, paragraph 43. equal treatment under Article 12 EC in order to obtain study finance for the second half of 2003. To put it another way, is it compatible with that article to make the grant of study finance to migrant students conditional without exception upon the fulfilment of a residence requirement of five years? 58. As the Commission has rightly observed, Article 12 EC, which enshrines the general principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, applies independently only to situations governed by Community law for which the Treaty lays down no specific rules of non-discrimination. It is therefore only necessary to express a view on that article if the case in the main proceedings does not fall under Article 39 EC and Article 7 of Regula- tion No 1612/68, which gives specific expres- sion to the right of Community workers to equal treatment. 29 59. Finally, in the third part of my analysis I will address Question 5, which concerns the alleged retroactive imposition by the Nether- lands authorities of additional requirements in respect of the right of migrant students to study finance. 29 \u2014 See, to that effect, Case C-40/05 Kai Lyyski [2007] ECR I-99, paragraphs 33 and 34, and Case C-387/01 Weigel [2004] ECR I-4981, paragraphs 57 to 59.

Main arguments of the parties 60. In the present proceedings, written observations have been submitted by the Netherlands, German, Austrian, Belgian, Swedish, Finnish and United Kingdom Governments as well as by the Commission and Ms F\u00f6rster. Apart from the Austrian and Finnish Governments, those parties were represented at the hearing on 23 April 2008, at which, additionally, the Danish Govern- ment was represented. 61. The Commission takes the view that, contrary to what the referring court suggests, Ms F\u00f6rster can be regarded as a Community worker within the meaning of Article 39 EC and Regulation No 1612/68 as interpreted by the Court in particular in Lair , 30 Brown 31 and Ninni\u00adOrasche , 32 since the circum- stances of the case imply a substantial con - tinuity between her practical training and her studies. With regard to the second half of 30 \u2014 Cited in footnote 20. 31 \u2014 Case 197/86 [1988] ECR 3205. 32 \u2014 Cited in footnote 11. 2003, she can therefore rely on Article 7(2) of Regulation No 1612/68 in order to obtain the study finance in question, which constitutes a \u2018social advantage\u2019 within the meaning of that regulation. 62. The Austrian, Danish, German, Neth- erlands and Swedish Governments essen- tially contradict that view. At the hearing, the Netherlands and German Governments stated that in their view previous prac- tical training cannot lead to the status of a Community worker in respect of the period after its termination. In that regard, the present case must be distinguished from Lair 33 and Ninni\u00adOrasche , 34 according to which there must be continuity between the previous activity as an employed person and the subsequent course of studies. Nor did Ms F\u00f6rster become unemployed involuntarily within the meaning of that case-law, since it lies in the nature of such practical training that it is only temporary. 63. As regards Regulation No 1251/70, Ms F\u00f6rster submits that she can rely on Article 7 of that regulation in order to claim the study finance for the second half of 2003. 64. By contrast, all the other parties which have submitted observations on that 33 \u2014 Cited in footnote 20. 34 \u2014 Cited in footnote 11. ",
        "I - 8527 F\u00d6RSTER point essentially agree that, in accordance with Article 1 of Regulation No 1251/70, that regulation is either inapplicable rationae personae or irrelevant to the present case. 2. Appraisal 65. Under Article 7(2) of Regulation No 1612/68, a worker who is a national of a Member State and avails himself of the freedom of movement of workers is to enjoy the same social advantages in the host Member State as national workers. 66. The Court has already held that a main- tenance and training grant for the pursuit of university studies leading to a professional qualification constitutes a social advantage within the meaning of that article. 35 It is common ground that the study finance in question constitutes such an advantage. 36 35 \u2014 See, to that effect, Matteucci , cited in footnote 26, para- graph 23; Lair , cited in footnote 20, paragraphs 23, 24 and 28; Brown , cited in footnote 31, paragraph 25; and Case C-3/90 Bernini [1992] ECR I-1071, paragraph 23. 36 \u2014 See in particular, to that effect, Fahmi and Amado , cited in footnote 12, paragraph 45. 67. Persons qualifying as workers within the meaning of Article 39 EC and Article 7(2) of Regulation No 1612/68 can therefore avail themselves of their right to be treated equally with regard to the grant of the study finance in question. 68. It is settled case-law that the concept of \u2018worker\u2019 referred to in those provisions has a specific Community meaning and must not be interpreted narrowly. Any person who pursues activities which are effective and genuine, to the exclusion of activities on such a small scale as to be regarded as purely marginal and ancillary, must be regarded as a \u2018worker\u2019. According to that case-law, the essential feature of an employment relation- ship is that, for a certain period of time, a person performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for which he receives remuneration. 37 69. It is important to note that in the present case both the national authorities and the referring court clearly proceed from the assumption that, in the period prior to the second half of 2003, Ms F\u00f6rster was in a 37 \u2014 See, in particular, Cases 66/85 Lawrie\u00adBlum [1986] ECR 2121, paragraphs 16 and 17; Mart\u00ednez Sala , cited in foot- note 24, paragraph 32; and Case C-337/97 Meeusen [1999] ECR I-3289, paragraph 13.

Accordingly, Ms F\u00f6rster was also granted study finance in accordance with Regulation No 1612/68 and on the basis of the Netherlands rules requiring an average of 32 hours of paid employment per month to be undertaken. There is thus no reason to doubt that up until June 2003 Ms F\u00f6rster satisfied the necessary conditions to be classified as a worker, as required by the provisions relating to the free movement of workers, namely that her occu- pational activities were effective and genuine and not purely marginal and ancillary. 70. It may be remembered in this context that, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, the fact that the occupational activities consist of preparatory training or part-time activity does not as such preclude the person under- taking them from having the status of a worker. 38 71. On the other hand, it is also common ground that during the second half of 2003 Ms F\u00f6rster was no longer employed. 38 \u2014 See Lawrie\u00adBlum , cited in footnote 37, paragraphs 19 to 21, and Case 53/81 Levin [1982] ECR 1035, paragraph 17. 72. Although, as a rule, the person concerned loses his status of worker once the employ- ment relationship has ended, that status may, as I have mentioned above, nevertheless produce certain effects thereafter. 39 73. Thus, in the first place, Article 7 of Regu- lation No 1251/70 on the right of workers to remain in the territory of a Member State after having been employed, to which Ques- tion 1 expressly refers, extends the right to equality of treatment laid down in Regulation No 1612/68 to persons \u2018coming under the provisions of this Regulation\u2019. 74. However, I share the view taken by the vast majority of the parties presenting observations in the current proceedings that Regulation No 1251/70 does not apply ratione personae to a person in Ms F\u00f6rster\u2019s situation. Article 1 of that regulation cannot reasonably be read in isolation from Article 2, which specifies which workers have the right to remain permanently in the territory of a Member State. Those are workers whose 39 \u2014 See point 49 above; see also Mart\u00ednez Sala , cited in foot- note 24, paragraph 33. ",
        "I - 8529 F\u00d6RSTER working relationship has ended because of their age, their incapacity to work or their employment in another Member State. Since, obviously, a person in the situation described in this case falls within none of those cat - egories, Article 7 of Regulation No 1251/70 is not applicable. 75. Question 1 must therefore be answered in the negative. 76. In the second place, however, it must be examined whether a student in circum- stances such as those at issue in the main proceedings may benefit from the Lair , Brown , Raulin and Ninni\u00adOrasche case-law. In those judgments the Court held that a national of another Member State who has undertaken university studies in the host State leading to a professional qualification, after having engaged in occupational activity in that State, must be regarded as having retained his status as a worker provided that there is a link or, as the Court also referred to it, \u2018continuity\u2019 between the previous occupa- tional activity and the studies undertaken. 40 40 \u2014 See Lair , cited in footnote 20, paragraph 39; Brown , cited in footnote 31, paragraph 26; Case C-357/89 Raulin [1992] ECR I-1027, paragraph 21; and Ninni\u00adOrasche , cited in footnote 11, paragraph 35. This does not, however, apply to workers who, after ceasing to exercise their occupational activity in the host Member State, have decided to return to their Member State of origin (which is not the case here). See to that effect Fahmi and Amado , cited in footnote 12, paragraphs 46 and 47. 77. The Court has specified that such con - tinuity may not, however, be required where a migrant has involuntarily become un - employed and is obliged by conditions on the job market to undertake occupational retraining in another field of activity. In that regard, the Court took account of the fact that continu- ous careers are nowadays less common than was formerly the case and occupational activ- ities are therefore occasionally interrupted by periods of training or retraining. 41 78. Finally, the Court has refused to extend the enjoyment of the rights flowing from the status of a worker to circumstances where there is a question of abuse. That would for example be the case if it were established that a national of a Member State entered another Member State for the sole purpose of enjoying, after a very short period of occu- pational activity, the benefit of the student assistance system in that State 42 or where it is established that a person acquired the status as a worker exclusively as a result of his being accepted for admission to univer- sity to undertake the studies in question. In such circumstances, the employment rela- tionship, which is the only basis for the rights deriving from Regulation No 1612/68, is merely ancillary to the studies to be financed by the grant. 43 41 \u2014 See in particular Lair , cited in footnote 20, paragraphs 37 and 38, and Ninni\u00adOrasche , cited in footnote 11, paragraph 35. 42 \u2014 See, to that effect, Lair , cited in footnote 20, paragraph 43. 43 \u2014 See, to that effect, Brown , cited in footnote 31, para- graphs 27 and 28.

        "I - 8530 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-158/07 79. It is ultimately for the national court to conduct the factual examination necessary to determine whether, in accordance with the various criteria arising from the case- law referred to above, the applicant in the main proceedings may be regarded as having retained the status of a worker after the termination of her occupational activity. 44 However, the information provided to the Court in the present case allows the following remarks to be made. 80. First, contrary to what the German Government in particular has suggested, the fact that a person came to the host Member State \u2018principally to study\u2019, as the refer- ring court mentioned in Question 1, and from the outset was pursuing studies while working as an employed person, does not as such preclude that person, in my view, from relying on the abovementioned case-law. 81. What is decisive in that respect is whether that person has actually pursued substantial work, i.e. occupational activ- ities which are effective and genuine and not purely marginal and ancillary within the 44 \u2014 See, to that effect, Ninni\u00adOrasche , cited in footnote 11, paragraph 41. meaning of the concept of \u2018worker\u2019. 45 If it is established that a person objectively meets those conditions, the fact that he is, at the same time, also to be regarded as a student cannot deprive him of the status of worker and the ensuing rights. Nor, by the same token, should the possibility that the prin- cipal motive is the pursuit of studies in itself affect his classification as a worker. 82. That view is borne out by the recent judg- ment in Payir, Akyuz and Ozturk concerning Article 6(1) of Decision No 1/80 of the Asso- ciation Council of 19 September 1980 on the development of the Association, in which the Court addressed the question whether in cases where Turkish nationals \u2014 whose activities otherwise satisfy the three condi- tions laid down in that Article \u2014 have au pair or student status, they are thereby precluded from the status of workers and from being duly registered as belonging to the labour force of a Member State, within the meaning of that provision. The Court answered in the negative, holding that the persons concerned can fully rely on the rights which that provi- sion confers upon them, provided that the objective conditions laid down in that provi- sion are met, without it being necessary to take into account the reasons for which the person concerned was first granted the right 45 \u2014 See point 68 above. ",
        "I - 8531 F\u00d6RSTER to enter or any temporal limitations attached to his right to work. 46 83. Second, as regards the condition that either there is continuity between the activity as an employed person and the subsequent studies or the person concerned has involun- tarily become unemployed, it appears from Ms F\u00f6rster\u2019s submissions that she ceased to work in the second half of 2003 on the grounds that she had to focus on finishing her studies. Under such circumstances, her situation cannot in my view be described as constituting involuntary unemployment. I nevertheless agree with the Commission that the criterion of continuity may be fulfilled in the present case, both from a temporal and a material point of view. 84. In that respect, it should be noted, first of all, that the paid practical training preceding the second half of 2003 consisted in secondary special education for pupils with behavioural problems and/or psychiatric disturbances, an activity which is certainly 46 \u2014 Case C-294/06 [2008] ECR I-203, paragraphs 34, 43 and 46. related, in terms of content, to her studies in educational theory. 47 85. In applying the criterion of continuity, it should also be borne in mind that, as the Court has already alluded in Lair , 48 continu- ous careers are less common in today\u2019s working environment than was formerly the case. In particular, younger people at the beginning of their professional lives are, for a number of reasons, often expected or even forced by the conditions in the job markets to show flexibility with their education and training as well as their first steps in employ- ment. The requirement of continuity should therefore not be interpreted too strictly, in order to avoid excluding a substantial part of working students from the benefits of their rights as Community workers despite the fact that they have already been economically active and have entered the employment market of the host Member State. 86. Third, there appears to be no evidence of abuse in the present case. In particular, in 47 \u2014 In my view, it is not necessary to establish that continuity also existed in relation to the work pursued prior to the practical training, since that training on its own constitutes in any event effective and genuine, as opposed to purely marginal and ancillary, activities, thus allowing Ms F\u00f6rster to be classified as a worker. 48 \u2014 See point 77 above. ",
        "I - 8532 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-158/07 view of the fact that Ms F\u00f6rster had been in substantial paid employment relationships for more than three years before ceasing to work, it cannot be argued that she entered another Member State for the sole purpose of enjoying the benefit of the student assist- ance system in that State. 49 87. Additionally, it emerged at the hearing that Ms F\u00f6rster also came to the Netherlands and commenced work and studies there because of her personal relationship with a Netherlands resident. That fact may serve to indicate that she did not enter that State for the sole purpose of benefiting from its student assistance system. 50 88. Furthermore, there appears to be no reason to assume that she was employed purely because she was accepted for admis- sion to university, which would have resulted in her employment having to be regarded as merely ancillary to her studies. 89. It follows from all the above consider- ations that Article 7 of Regulation No 1251/70 49 \u2014 See point 78 above. 50 \u2014 Cf. Ninni\u00adOrasche , cited in footnote 11, paragraph 47. does not apply to a student in a situation such as that at issue in the present case in so far as that student falls within none of the categories of workers referred to in Article 2 of that regulation. 90. However, a student in a situation such as that in the present proceedings can in prin- ciple avail himself in the host Member State of his right as a Community worker under Article 7(2) of Regulation No 1612/68 to the same social advantages as a national worker in order to obtain study finance such as that in issue. It is, however, for the national court to establish whether the various condi- tions set out above as regards the retention of the status of a worker after termination of employment are actually fulfilled in the present case.

        "I - 8533 F\u00d6RSTER treated equally in respect of study finance from his status as a Community worker. I will nevertheless address, wholly in the alterna- tive, Questions 2 to 4, which seek to ascer- tain whether a student in the circumstances underlying the present case can successfully rely on Article 12 EC to claim the right to study finance. 1. Main arguments of the parties 92. Ms F\u00f6rster submits that Directive 93/96 cannot preclude students in her situation from relying on Article 12 EC to claim study finance, as a Treaty provision ranks higher than a directive. As regards Bidar , 51 she maintains that, in addition to the require- ment of lawful residence at the time when the study assistance is applied for, the decisive criterion is whether the person concerned is substantially integrated into the society of the host Member State, which cannot simply be equated with a certain length of lawful residence. She notes in that respect that a duration of residence of five years is substan- tially longer than the three years accepted in 51 \u2014 Cited in footnote 2. Bidar and prevents most students from being eligible for study finance at all. 93. In her view, Member States should assess in each individual case whether the person concerned demonstrates a sufficient degree of integration into the society of the host Member State, account being taken of personal factors. 94. The Commission addresses Questions 2 to 5 only in consideration of the possibility that the Court does not follow its view that Ms F\u00f6rster can rely as a Community worker on Article 39 EC and Article 7 of Regula- tion No 1612/68. It submits, first of all, that the present case has to be assessed in the light of the Community law applicable at the material time, i.e. Articles 12 EC and 18 EC, Directive 93/96 and Directive 90/364/EEC of 28 June 1990 on the right of residence. 52 Directive 2004/38 is, by contrast, not applicable. 52 \u2014 OJ 1990 L 180, p. 26. ",
        "I - 8534 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-158/07 95. Although the Commission in principle concurs with Ms F\u00f6rster, it explained at the hearing that Directive 93/96 precludes a person who derives his right of residence only from that directive and no other provi- sion of Community law from relying success- fully on Article 12 EC to claim study finance, as is also apparent from Bidar . By contrast, an economically inactive citizen of the Union who has been lawfully resident in the host Member State for a certain period of time, within the meaning of Directive 90/364, or who possesses a residence permit, can successfully invoke Article 12 EC. 96. The five-year residence requirement, as applied by the Netherlands Govern- ment, cannot as a consequence be regarded as being discriminatory as such, since it can be assumed that the nationals of the host Member State, who have as a rule lived in that country all their lives, satisfy the cri - terion of a certain degree of integration. 97. In the view of the Commission, the residence requirement must, however, be applied in a less absolute manner in respect of Ms F\u00f6rster than the Member States have suggested. Depending on the circumstances, other criteria must be taken into account in order to establish the degree of integration, such as whether the person concerned is born close to the border or has already worked in the host Member State. It emphasises that under Article 37 of Directive 2004/38 the Member States are free to use criteria more favourable than the five years of residence provided for under Article 24(2) of that directive, although it admits that they are not obliged to do so. 98. All the governments which have submitted observations in the present proceedings essentially agree, albeit on the basis of slightly differing arguments, that the questions referred should be answered to the effect that a student in factual circumstances such as those in the present case cannot successfully rely on Article 12 EC in order to claim a study allowance. 99. In respect of Directive 93/96, the Neth- erlands, Belgian and Danish Governments state that, according to Bidar , a distinction must be drawn between persons who move to another Member State with the primary objective of pursuing studies there and persons who settle in another Member State ",
        "I - 8535 F\u00d6RSTER for other reasons and subsequently decide to take up studies. The former category of students falls within the scope of Direct- ive 93/96, which prevents them from relying on Article 12 EC to obtain study allowance, whereas the latter category has the right under that article to be treated on the same basis as nationals in that respect. According to the Netherlands, Danish and Swedish Governments, among others, Article 3 of Directive 93/96, which excludes the entitle- ment to an award of a maintenance grant, constitutes an example of a restrictive provi- sion or limitation within the meaning of Article 18(1) EC. According to the Austrian Government, by contrast, that directive does not in principle prevent students from relying on Article 12 EC in relation to the right to be paid maintenance grants. 100. The governments agree, in essence, that Member States are not precluded from making such a grant dependent on a five- year residence requirement such as the one at issue in the present case, which is a clear and sufficient criterion, or on the possession of a permanent residence permit. There is, moreover, a consensus that there is no obli- gation to engage in a specific assessment in individual cases of integration into the society concerned or to use criteria other than the duration of residence, although Member States remain free to do so, and they may grant study assistance on more generous terms if they so wish. 101. In that respect, most governments have relied on Directive 2004/38, in par - ticular Article 24(2) in conjunction with Article 16(1) as well as Article 37 thereof, whilst acknowledging that that directive is not applicable ratione temporis to the present case. Various Member States have also emphasised the broad margin of discre- tion they enjoy as regards the allocation of social assistance. 102. In particular, the Netherlands and United Kingdom Governments also point out that, as the Court indicated in Bidar , 53 a more generous grant of student allowances could impose an unreasonable financial burden on the Member States in view of the number of foreign students. That could have consequences for the overall level of assist- ance granted. Several governments also note that an individual assessment of the degree of integration would be either impossible from an administrative point of view or, as the German Government maintains, at odds with the principles of legal certainty and legality. 53 \u2014 Cited in footnote 2.

        "I - 8536 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-158/07 2. Appraisal 103. The questions to be addressed here can essentially be broken down into two main issues. The referring court wishes to know, firstly, whether a student in a situ- ation such as that in the main proceedings can in principle rely, in the light of Bidar , on Article 12 EC in respect of assistance to cover the maintenance costs of students, such as the study finance at issue. If so, that court refers, secondly, to the rule in the Nether- lands according to which the grant of study finance depends solely on the fulfilment of a five-year residence requirement and asks under what conditions such a student may in fact have the right to study finance on the basis of that article. Although those ques- tions can to a large extent be answered by reference to Bidar and the case-law cited in that judgment, that case-law has to be quali- fied in certain respects in the light of the circumstances of the present case. 104. According to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, which is summarized in Bidar , a citizen of the Union lawfully resident in the territory of the host Member State can rely on Article 12 EC in all situations which fall within the scope ratione materiae of Community law. 54 54 \u2014 See Bidar , cited in footnote 2, paragraph 32; Mart\u00ednez Sala , cited in footnote 24, paragraph 63; and Grzelczyk , cited in footnote 23, paragraph 32. 105. It is also settled case-law that such situ- ations include those involving the exercise of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty and those involving the exercise of the right to move and reside within the terri- tory of the Member States, as conferred by Article 18 EC. 55 106. Moreover, the Court has emphasised that there is nothing in the text of the Treaty to suggest that students who are citizens of the Union, when they move to another Member State to study there, lose the rights which the Treaty confers on citizens of the Union. 56 107. Furthermore, as the Court has already held in D\u2019Hoop , a national of a Member State who goes to another Member State and pursues secondary education there exer- cises the freedom to move guaranteed by Article 18 EC. 57 108. Finally, as regards social assistance benefits, the Court recalled in Bidar that a citizen of the Union who is not economi- 55 \u2014 Bidar , cited in footnote 2, paragraph 33; Case C-274/96 Bickel and Franz [1998] ECR I-7637, paragraphs 15 and 16; Grzelczyk , cited in footnote 23, paragraph 33; Garcia Avello , cited in footnote 23, paragraphs 22 and 23; and Morgan and Bucher , cited in footnote 28, paragraph 23. 56 \u2014 Bidar , cited in footnote 2, paragraph 34, and Grzelczyk , cited in footnote 23, paragraph 35. 57 \u2014 Case C-224/98 [2002] ECR I-6191, paragraphs 29 to 34.

In respect of the present case, a citizen of the Union, such as Ms F\u00f6rster, who goes to another Member State and pursues occupa- tional activities and studies there undeniably avails herself thereby of the right to move and reside freely in another Member State pursuant to Article 18 EC. In addition, it is not disputed that Ms F\u00f6rster has always been lawfully resident in the Netherlands since the commencement of her studies, including during the second half of 2003. 110. It follows that a citizen of the Union in Ms F\u00f6rster\u2019s situation can in principle rely on Article 12 EC in all situations falling within the scope of Community law. 111. In that regard, the Court ruled in Bidar that, contrary to the earlier case-law in Brown 58 \u2014 See, to that effect, Bidar , cited in footnote 2, paragraph 37; Mart\u00ednez Sala , cited in footnote 24, paragraph 24; and Trojani , cited in footnote 15, paragraph 43. and Lair 59 and in view of the development of Community law since then, assistance, whether in the form of subsidised loans or of grants, provided to students lawfully resi- dent in the host Member State to cover their maintenance costs falls within the scope of application of the Treaty for the purposes of the prohibition of discrimination laid down in the first paragraph of Article 12 EC. 60 112. In the light of the above it can therefore be concluded, at least provisionally, that a student such as the one in the present case who resided lawfully for a certain period in the host Member State can in principle, subject to further conditions to be addressed below, rely on Article 12 EC to claim study finance such as that at issue. 113. However, both the order for refer- ence and the submissions of the parties reveal uncertainty as to the impact of Dir - ective 93/96 on that finding and the relevance of the fact that a person comes to another Member State \u2018principally\u2019 to study. In particular, it has been argued that the present case must be distinguished from Bidar on the ground that the applicant in that case 59 \u2014 See Lair , cited in footnote 20, paragraph 15, and Brown , cited in footnote 31, paragraph 18. 60 \u2014 See in particular paragraphs 42 and 48 of that judgment (cited in footnote 2).

It is true that the Court stated in Bidar that Article 3 of Directive 93/96 does not preclude a national of a Member State who, by virtue of Article 18 EC and Dir - ective 90/364, is lawfully resident in the terri- tory of another Member State from relying during that residence on the fundamental principle of equal treatment enshrined in Article 12(1) EC. 61 115. However, I do not think it follows that that principle would not apply to a person who derives his or her right to reside, instead, from Directive 93/96. The Court has consist- ently held since Baumbast and R that Union citizens can in any event derive their right to reside in the territory of another Member State directly from Article 18(1) EC. 62 116. That article admittedly subjects the right of residence to the limitations and 61 \u2014 At paragraph 46 of the judgment (cited in footnote 2). 62 \u2014 Cited in footnote 23, paragraph 84. conditions imposed by the Treaty and the measures adopted to give it effect. Among such limitations and conditions are those laid down, as regards employed persons, by Council Directive 68/360/EEC, 63 as regards students, by Directive 93/96 and as regards nationals of Member States who do not enjoy a right of residence under other provisions of Community law, by Directive 90/364. 64 117. However, it appears from Grzelczyk and, to an even greater extent, from Trojani , that the Court makes a distinction between, on one hand, the right of residence and the conditions to which it is subject and, on the other, the possibility for a citizen of the Union to rely on the principle of equal treat- ment enshrined in Article 12 EC, for example when claiming social benefits. The implica- tion is that Member States may make the right to reside subject to the conditions and limitations provided for under the various residence directives, but when and as long as a Union citizen is lawfully resident in the host Member State concerned, be it by virtue of Community law or even just national law, as in the case of Mr Trojani, 65 that Union citizen is entitled to equal treatment. Conse- quently, the only way open to a Member State 63 \u2014 Directive of 15 October 1968 on the abolition of restric- tions on movement and residence within the Community for workers of Member States and their families (OJ, English Special Edition, 1968(II), p. 485). 64 \u2014 See also, to that effect, Case C-408/03 Commission v Belgium [2006] ECR I-2647, paragraph 65. 65 \u2014 See, to that effect, Trojani , cited in footnote 15, paragraph 37. ",
        "I - 8539 F\u00d6RSTER to avoid granting the benefit is to terminate the Union citizen\u2019s residence. 66 118. That case-law thus suggests, arguably, that secondary Community law laying down conditions and limitations to the right of residence is to be regarded, by virtue of the reference contained in Article 18(1) EC, as a type of lex specialis in relation to that article, but not in respect of Article 12 EC. 119. Furthermore, the Court has already stated in Grzelczyk that, whilst Article 3 of Directive 93/96 makes it clear that that direct- ive does not establish any right to mainten- ance grants by the host Member State for students benefiting from the right of resi- dence, there are no provisions in the dir - ective that preclude those to whom it applies from receiving social security benefit. 67 120. In other words, even if Directive 93/96 provides no right to maintenance assist- ance, such a right may still apply to students falling within that directive, by virtue of 66 \u2014 See, to that effect, Grzelczyk , cited in footnote 23, para- graphs 37 to 42, and Trojani , cited in footnote 15, in par - ticular paragraphs 36, 37 and 43 to 46; cf. also, to that effect, Bidar , cited in footnote 2, paragraphs 36 and 47. 67 \u2014 See Grzelczyk , cited in footnote 23, paragraph 39. another provision of Community law such as Article 12 EC. 121. As to the issue of the student in the main proceedings coming \u2018principally to study\u2019, the referring court has itself observed that the intention with which persons come to the host Member State is difficult to determine. Moreover, such an intention is not decisive in respect of the applicability of Directive 93/96. It is therefore not relevant in the present context. 122. It follows from the above that Article 3 of Directive 93/96 does not preclude a national of a Member State who is lawfully resident in the territory of another Member State from relying during that residence on the fundamental principle of equal treat- ment enshrined in Article 12(1) EC to claim study finance such as that at issue in the main proceedings in the host Member State, even if his right of residence is based on that directive. 123. It remains to be examined, in respect of Questions 3(b), (c) and (d) and 4, whether that article permits a Member State to make the entitlement of nationals of other Member ",
        "I - 8540 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-158/07 States to such study finance conditional upon having completed five years of residence. 124. It appears from Bidar that although the Member States must, in the organisation and application of their social assistance systems, show a certain degree of financial solidarity with nationals of other Member States, it is permissible for a Member State to ensure that the grant of assistance to cover the main- tenance costs of students from other Member States does not become an unreasonable burden which could have consequences for the overall level of assistance which may be granted by that State. 68 125. As the Court stated in that judgment, it is therefore legitimate for a Member State to grant assistance covering maintenance costs only to students who have demonstrated a certain degree of integration into the society of that State. 69 126. However, the Court made it clear that a Member State cannot require students to establish a link with its employment 68 \u2014 Paragraph 56 of that judgment (cited in footnote 2) with reference to Grzelczyk , cited in footnote 23, paragraph 44. 69 \u2014 Paragraph 57 of that judgment. See also, to that effect, Morgan and Bucher , cited in footnote 28, paragraph 43; see also, as to that criterion in the context of a pension granted to civilian victims of war or repression, Case C-192/05 Tas\u00ad Hagen and Tas [2006] ECR I-10451, paragraph 34, and Case C-499/06 Nerkowska [2008] ECR I-3993, paragraph 37. market, 70 a requirement which the Court has held on several occasions to be legitimate in relation to social allowances. 71 127. The Court held in Bidar that the condi- tion of a sufficient degree of integration into society may be established by a finding that the student in question has resided in the host Member State for a certain length of time. It accepted that the requirement of three years\u2019 residence provided for by the national legislation at issue in that case was an appropriate length of time. 72 128. The present case raises the question whether, in the light of that judgment, a requirement of five years\u2019 residence corres- ponds to the legitimate aim of ensuring that an applicant for assistance has demonstrated a certain degree of integration into society. As several governments have emphasised 70 \u2014 Bidar , cited in footnote 2, paragraph 58. 71 \u2014 See, for instance, D\u2019Hoop , cited in footnote 57, paragraph 38, and Collins , cited in footnote 16, paragraph 67. 72 \u2014 See to that effect paragraphs 59 to 61 (case cited in footnote 2). ",
        "I - 8541 F\u00d6RSTER in their submissions, Member States enjoy wide discretion in terms of the criteria used to assess the degree of connection to society in respect of a social benefit as the student finance at issue in the main proceedings. However, they must still abide by the limits imposed by Community law, in particular the principle of proportionality. 73 129. Member States are obviously allowed to some extent to apply general conditions which require no further individual assess- ment, such as the three years\u2019 residence requirement at issue in Bidar . However, the case-law of the Court also suggests that the condition imposed may not be so general in scope that it systematically excludes students, regardless of their actual degree of integration into society, from being able to pursue their studies under the same condi- tions as nationals of the host Member State. In other words, the criterion used must still be indicative of the degree of integration into society. 74 73 \u2014 See, to that effect, Nerkowska , cited in footnote 69, paragraph 38; Tas\u00adHagen and Tas , cited in footnote 69, paragraph 36; Morgan and Bucher , cited in footnote 28, paragraph 46; and Case C-76/05 Schwarz and Gootjes\u00ad Schwarz [2007] ECR I-6849, paragraph 79. 74 \u2014 See to that effect the reasoning in Bidar , cited in footnote 2, paragraphs 61 and 62, in respect of the requirement that the student must be settled in the host Member State, and Morgan and Bucher , cited in footnote 28, paragraph 46. 130. In my view, that is not the case with a five-year residence requirement, since it can reasonably be assumed that a number of students may have established a substantial degree of integration into society well before the expiry of that period. That is especially the case with students who, like Ms F\u00f6rster, have also pursued occupational activities in the host Member State in addition to their studies. In fact, as has been submitted by Ms F\u00f6rster, a residence requirement of five years may prevent students who make use of their right to move to another Member State and study there from benefiting from their right to equal treatment as citizens of the Union in respect of study allowances, regard- less of the actual link they may have estab- lished with the society of the host Member State. That cannot in my view be considered proportionate. 131. It is true that Directive 2004/38 places Member States under no obligation to grant maintenance aid for studies prior to acquisition of the right of permanent resi- dence and thus not before five years have expired. However, apart from the fact that that directive is not applicable to the facts of the present case, it cannot detract from the requirements flowing from Article 12 EC and the general principle of proportionality. ",
        "I - 8542 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-158/07 132. Rather, a period of five years of continu- ous residence in the host Member State marks the outer limit within which it may still be possible to argue that a student pursuing studies in another Member State has not established a sufficient degree of integration into the society of that State to qualify for equal treatment, as provided for by Article 12 EC, in respect of social benefits such as student maintenance grants. 133. When a student has already been resi- dent in the host Member State for three years, as in the present case, it would seem disproportionate, even though five years may not have yet elapsed, to refuse study finance if the student can adduce reasonable evidence that he or she is already substan- tially integrated into the society of the host Member State. 134. Finally, I do not think that the above reasoning should be affected by the fact that a residence requirement is imposed only on nationals of other Member States. As the Commission has noted, it is legitimate to assume that the nationals of a Member State have a genuine link with the society of that State. 135. The answer to Questions 3(b), (c) and (d) and 4 should therefore be that a Member State is precluded by Article 12 EC, read in conjunction with the principle of proportion- ality, from denying study finance such as that at issue to an economically inactive student from another Member State who has already been lawfully resident for three years in the host Member State solely on the ground that that student was not resident for five years in the host Member State prior to the study period concerned, if other factors, to be demonstrated by the student by appropriate means, indicate a substantial degree of inte- gration into the society of the host Member State. D \u2014 Question 5 concerning legal certainty 1. Main arguments of the parties 136. Ms F\u00f6rster submits that both the disputed repayment order and her appeal ",
        "I - 8543 F\u00d6RSTER against it predate the Beleidsregel of 9 May 2005. It is contrary to the principle of legal certainty and Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms to adopt rules restricting her rights after she has invoked Article 12 EC. 75 137. In the same vein, the Commission proposes to answer Question 5 in the nega- tive, arguing that the national court has to take account, when interpreting rules of its national law, of the general principles of law, particularly those of legal certainty and non-retroactivity. 138. The German, Austrian and Netherlands Governments maintain, on the other hand, that if the Court\u2019s judgment allows persons retroactively to derive more rights from Article 12 EC than was previously assumed, requirements in respect of periods in the past 75 \u2014 She refers to Eur. Court H. R., Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v. Greece , judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A No 301-B. may also be imposed when implementing that judgment. That, according to the Neth- erlands Government, is in accordance with Collins . 76 2. Appraisal 139. I shall address Question 5 for the sake of completeness notwithstanding the answers suggested to the previous questions. It appears from the order for reference that the referring Court essentially seeks to ascer- tain whether the principle of legal certainty, as applied in Collins , precludes the Dutch authorities from refusing study finance for the second half of 2003 on the basis of the residence duration requirement contained in the Beleidsregel of 9 May 2005, adopted following the Bidar judgment, if that Policy rule provides for more rights \u2014 in this case more generous access to study grants \u2014 than before. Study finance was previously granted only to students from other Member States entitled to it under Article 39 EC or Article 43 EC. 76 \u2014 Cited in footnote 16. ",
        "I - 8544 OPINION OF MR MAZ\u00c1K \u2014 CASE C-158/07 140. The principle of legal certainty is a fundamental principle of Community law which requires, in areas covered by Commu- nity law, that the Member States\u2019 rules should be clear and precise, so that individuals may be able to ascertain unequivocally what their rights and obligations are. It aims to ensure that situations and legal relationships governed by Community law remain fore- seeable. 77 Accordingly, in Collins , the Court stated that the application by the national authorities of a residence requirement must rest on clear criteria known in advance. 78 141. However, the case-law of the Court also indicates that it is of relevance whether the rule in question involves positive or negative consequences for individuals. In the case of rules imposing obligations on individuals, strict observance of the requirements flowing from the principle of legal certainty and the protection of the individual is naturally of particular importance. 79 77 \u2014 See, to that effect, Case 257/86 Commission v Italy [1988] ECR 3249, paragraph 12, and Case C-110/03 Belgium v Commission [2005] ECR I-2801, paragraph 30. 78 \u2014 Cited in footnote 16, paragraph 72. 79 \u2014 See, to that effect, Case 239/86 Ireland v Commission [1987] ECR 5271, paragraph 17; Case C-143/93 Van Es Douane Agenten [1996] ECR I-431, paragraph 27; and Case C-17/03 Vereniging voor Energie, Milieu en Water and Others [2005] ECR I-4983, paragraph 80. 142. Accordingly, the principle of legal certainty and the protection of the individual do not in my view preclude a rule from being applied retroactively in so far as such applica- tion puts the individual concerned in a more favourable legal position. 80 143. The reply to Question 5 should there- fore be that the principle of legal certainty does not preclude a Member State from applying a rule such as the Beleidsregel of 9 May 2005 in respect of periods in the past if such application puts the indi- vidual concerned in a more favourable legal position. 80 \u2014 The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights relied on by Ms F\u00f6rster, cited in footnote 75, in which that court held that there had been a breach of Article 6(1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Funda- mental Freedoms, is in my view not relevant, as it concerns a form of interference by the legislature with the administra- tion of justice designed to influence the judicial determin- ation of a dispute (see \u00a7\u00a7 49 and 50 of that judgment). ",
        "I - 8545 F\u00d6RSTER V \u2014 Conclusion 144. I therefore propose that the Court answer the questions referred as follows: \u2018(1) Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 1251/70 of the Commission of 29 June 1970 on the right of workers to remain in the territory of a Member State after having been employed in that State does not apply to a student in a situation such as that at issue in the present case in so far as that student does not fall within any of the categories of workers referred to in Article 2 of that regulation. (2) A student in a situation such as that at issue in the present proceedings can in principle invoke in the host Member State his right as a Community worker under Article 7(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of the Council of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community to the same social advantages as a national worker in order to obtain study finance such as that in issue. It is, however, ultimately for the national court to establish whether the various conditions as regards the retention of the status of a worker after termination of employment are actually fulfilled in the case at hand. (3) Article 3 of Council Directive 93/96/EEC of 29 October 1993 on the right of residence for students does not preclude a national of a Member State who has been lawfully resident for a certain time in the territory of another Member State from relying on the fundamental principle of equal treatment enshrined in Article 12(1) EC to claim study finance such as that at issue in the main proceed- ings in the host Member State, even if his right of residence is based on that directive.

That Policy rule entered into force on 23 March 2005 and concerns the moni- toring of periods for which maintenance grants have been awarded from the 2003 calendar year. It provides that any student who has worked for an average of 32 hours or more per month in the period subject to monitoring automatically enjoys the status of Community worker. If a student does not satisfy the 32-hour criterion, the IB-Groep undertakes a more detailed investigation into the specific circumstances of that student. Following the judgment in Case C-209/03 Bidar [2005] ECR I-2119, the IB-Groep adopted on 9 May 2005 the Policy rule on the adaptation of applications for study finance for students from the European Union, European Economic Area and Swit- zerland (Beleidsregel aanpassing aanvraag studiefinanciering voor studenten uit EU, EER en Zwitserland, \u2018the Policy rule of 9 May 2005\u2019), which was published on 18 May 2005.

During her studies, Ms F\u00f6rster had various kinds of paid employment. From October 2002 until June 2003, Ms F\u00f6rster completed a paid work placement in a Dutch special school providing secondary education to pupils with behavioural and/or psychiatric problems. After that placement, Ms F\u00f6rster did not undertake any further employment. 14 15 16 17 18 ",
        "I - 8556 JUDGMENT OF 18. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-158/07 Having passed the final examination for the bachelor\u2019s degree in educational theory in the middle of 2004, Ms F\u00f6rster accepted a post as a social worker in an institution for people with psychiatric problems on 15 June 2004. From September 2000, the IB-Groep granted Ms F\u00f6rster a maintenance grant. That grant was periodically renewed by the IB-Groep. It took the view that Ms F\u00f6rster was to be regarded as a \u2018worker\u2019 within the meaning of Article 39 EC and, consequently, should be treated in the same way as a student of Netherlands nationality as regards maintenance grants, under Article 7(2) of Regulation No 1612/68. Following a check, the IB-Groep ascertained that between July 2003 and December 2003 Ms F\u00f6rster had not been gainfully employed. It therefore held, by decision of 3 March 2005, that she could no longer be regarded as a worker. As a result, the decision concerning the maintenance grant paid in respect of the period from July to December 2003 was annulled and Ms F\u00f6rster was requested to repay the excess sums. By judgment of 12 September 2005, the action brought by Ms F\u00f6rster before the Rechtbank Alkmaar (Alkmaar District Court) was held to be unfounded on two grounds. First, that court held that, since Ms F\u00f6rster had not had any real and genuine employment in the second half of 2003, she could no longer be regarded as a Community worker during that period. Second, that court held that Ms F\u00f6rster could not claim entitlement to a maintenance grant pursuant to Bidar because, before her degree in educational theory, she had not been in any way integrated into Dutch society. 19 20 21 22 ",
        "I - 8557 F\u00d6RSTER Ms F\u00f6rster appealed against that judgment before the Centrale Raad van Beroep (Higher Social Security Court), claiming primarily that, during the period at issue, she was already sufficiently integrated into Dutch society to be able to claim a main- tenance grant for the second half of 2003 under Community law. In the alternative, Ms F\u00f6rster submitted that she should be regarded as a Community worker for the whole of 2003. Accordingly, the Centrale Raad van Beroep decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: \u2018(1) Does Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 1251/70 also apply to students who came to the Netherlands principally to study and initially worked as employed persons on a limited scale while continuing to study but have meanwhile ceased to work? (2) Does Directive 93/96/EEC preclude students as referred to in the first question from successfully relying on Article 12 EC to claim [a maintenance grant]? (3) (a) Does the rule that citizens of the Union who are not economically active can rely on Article 12 EC only if they have resided lawfully in the host Member State for a certain period or are in possession of a residence permit also apply to assistance to cover the maintenance costs of students? 23 24 ",
        "I - 8558 JUDGMENT OF 18. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-158/07 (b) If so, is it permissible to impose during that period a residence duration requirement only on nationals of Member States other than the host Member State? (c) If so, is the application of a five-year residence duration requirement consistent with Article 12 EC? (d) If not, what residence duration may be required? (4) Should a shorter period of lawful residence be required in individual cases if factors other than the duration of residence indicate a substantial degree of inte- gration into the society of the host Member State? (5) If, as is evident from a judgment of the Court of Justice with retroactive effect, persons are able to derive from Article 12 EC more rights than was previously assumed, may justified requirements connected therewith be imposed in respect of periods in the past if those requirements were published shortly after the publication of the judgment?\u2019 ",
        "I - 8559 F\u00d6RSTER On the questions referred for a preliminary ruling The first question By that question, the referring court is essentially enquiring whether a student in the situation of the applicant in the main proceedings may rely on Article 7 of Regulation No 1251/70 in order to obtain a maintenance grant. Regulation No 1251/70 entitles a worker who has ceased his or her employment activity to remain permanently in the territory of a Member State after having worked there as an employed person and to continue to be entitled to equality of treatment with nationals, as laid down in Regulation No 1612/68. Those rights are extended to the members of the worker\u2019s family who reside with him or her in the territory of that Member State. The conditions of entitlement to the worker\u2019s right to remain in the host Member State are set out exhaustively in Article 2 of Regulation No 1251/70 (see Case C-257/00 Givane and Others [2003] ECR I-345, paragraph 29). In addition to complying with the conditions linked to the duration of employment and residence, a worker who has been employed in a host Member State has the right to remain there in three cases. First, where that worker, when he or she ter - minates his or her activity, has reached the age laid down in that Member State to claim an old-age pension. Second, where the termination of the employment is due to a permanent incapacity to work. Third, where that worker is employed in another 25 26 27 28 ",

As the order for reference shows, the applicant\u2019s situation does not fall within any of the cases set out in Article 2 of Regulation No 1251/70. It must be added that Ms F\u00f6rster ceased all employment during the period at issue in order to pursue her studies, without however having abandoned her plan to continue her career in the Netherlands, where she maintained her residence. In those circumstances, Ms F\u00f6rster cannot be regarded as a \u2018[national] of a Member State who [has] worked as [an employed person] in the territory of another Member State\u2019 within the meaning of Article 1 of Regulation No 1251/70. Regulation No 1251/70 is thus not applicable in the present case. Therefore, the answer to the first question must be that a student in the situation of the applicant in the main proceedings cannot rely on Article 7 of Regulation No 1251/70 in order to obtain a maintenance grant. 29 30 31 32 33 ",
        "I - 8561 F\u00d6RSTER The second to fourth questions By these questions, which should be examined together, the referring court is essen- tially enquiring whether, and in what conditions, a student who is a national of a Member State and travels to another Member State in order to study there can rely on the first paragraph of Article 12 EC in order to obtain a maintenance grant. The referring court also asks whether the application to nationals of other Member States of a prior residence requirement of five years may be regarded as compatible with the first paragraph of Article 12 and, if so, if it is necessary, in individual cases, to take into account other criteria pointing to a substantial degree of integration into the society of the host Member State. The first paragraph of Article 12 EC prohibits, within the scope of application of the EC Treaty and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality. It is settled case-law that a citizen of the European Union lawfully resident in the territory of the host Member State can rely on Article 12 EC in all situations which fall within the scope ratione materiae of Community law (Case C-85/96 Mart\u00ednez Sala [1998] ECR I-2691, paragraph 63, and Bidar , paragraph 32). Those situations include those involving the exercise of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty and those involving the exercise of the right to move and reside within the territory of the Member States conferred by Article 18 EC (see Case C-148/02 Garcia Avello [2003] ECR I-11613, paragraph 24, and Case C-403/03 Schempp [2005] ECR I-6421, paragraph 18). 34 35 36 37 ",
        "I - 8562 JUDGMENT OF 18. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-158/07 In this connection, the Court has already held that a national of a Member State who goes to another Member State and pursues secondary education there exercises the freedom to move guaranteed by Article 18 EC (see Case C-224/98 D\u2019Hoop [2002] ECR I-6191, paragraphs 29 to 34, and Bidar , paragraph 35). With regard to social assistance benefits, the Court has held that a citizen of the Union who is not economically active may rely on the first paragraph of Article 12 EC where he or she has been lawfully resident in the host Member State for a certain time ( Bidar , paragraph 37). A student who travels to another Member State to start or pursue education can benefit from a right of residence on the basis of Article 18 EC and Directive 93/96 when he or she fulfils the conditions set out in Article 1 of that directive as regards having sufficient resources and sickness insurance and being enrolled in a recog- nised educational establishment for the principal purpose of following a vocational training course. The situation of a student who is lawfully resident in another Member State thereby falls within the scope of application of the Treaty within the meaning of the first paragraph of Article 12 EC for the purposes of obtaining a maintenance grant (see Bidar , paragraph 42). Admittedly, in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 93/96, that does not establish any entitlement to the payment of maintenance grants by the host Member State on the part of students benefiting from the right of residence. 38 39 40 41 42 ",
        "I - 8563 F\u00d6RSTER However, that provision does not preclude a national of a Member State who, by virtue of Article 18 EC and the provisions adopted to implement that article, is lawfully resident in the territory of another Member State where he or she intends to start or pursue education from relying during that residence on the fundamental principle of equal treatment enshrined in the first paragraph of Article 12 EC (see, to that effect, Bidar , paragraph 46). For that purpose, the fact that Ms F\u00f6rster came to the Netherlands principally in order to study there is irrelevant. Moreover, pursuant to the Policy rule of 9 May 2005, a student who is a national of a Member State of the European Union may be eligible for a maintenance grant if, prior to the application, he or she has been lawfully resident in the Netherlands for an uninterrupted period of at least five years. Since that requirement concerning the duration of residence is not applicable to students of Netherlands nationality, the issue is raised of what restrictions may be imposed on the right of students who are nationals of other Member States to a maintenance grant without the different treat- ment of those students in comparison to national students which may result being considered discriminatory and, consequently, prohibited under the first paragraph of Article 12 EC. That issue was examined by the Court in Bidar . Unlike the present case, the Bidar case concerned national legislation which, in add - ition to imposing a residence requirement, required students from other Member 43 44 45 46 47 ",
        "I - 8564 JUDGMENT OF 18. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-158/07 States claiming assistance to cover their maintenance expenses to be established in the host Member State. In so far as the legislation at issue in the main proceedings in that case made it impossible for a national of another Member State to acquire, as a student, the status of established person, that legislation placed such nationals, what- ever their actual degree of integration into the society of the host Member State, in a position in which they could not satisfy that condition, and consequently could not enjoy the right to assistance to cover their maintenance costs. In Bidar , the Court observed that, although the Member States must, in the organisa- tion and application of their social assistance systems, show a certain degree of finan- cial solidarity with nationals of other Member States, it is permissible for a Member State to ensure that the grant of assistance to cover the maintenance costs of students from other Member States does not become an unreasonable burden which could have consequences for the overall level of assistance which may be granted by that State (see Bidar , paragraph 56). The Court also pointed out that it is legitimate for a Member State to grant assist- ance covering maintenance costs only to students who have demonstrated a certain degree of integration into the society of that State ( Bidar , paragraph 57). On the basis of those considerations, the Court held that the existence of a certain degree of integration may be regarded as established by a finding that the student in question has resided in the host Member State for a certain length of time ( Bidar , paragraph 59). 48 49 50 ",
        "I - 8565 F\u00d6RSTER As regards, specifically, the compatibility with Community law of a condition of five years\u2019 uninterrupted residence, as required by the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, it is necessary to examine whether such a requirement can be justified by the objective, for the host Member State, of ensuring that students who are nationals of other Member States have to a certain degree integrated into its society. In the present case, such a condition of five years\u2019 uninterrupted residence is appro- priate for the purpose of guaranteeing that the applicant for the maintenance grant at issue is integrated into the society of the host Member State. That requirement must also be proportionate to the legitimate objective pursued by the national law in order to be justified in the light of Community law. It may not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain that objective. A condition of five years\u2019 continuous residence cannot be held to be excessive having regard, inter alia, to the requirements put forward with respect to the degree of inte- gration of non-nationals in the host Member State. In that connection, Directive 2004/38, although not applicable to the facts in the main proceedings, provides in Article 24(2) that, in the case of persons other than workers, self-employed persons, persons who retain such status and members of their families, the host Member State is not obliged to grant maintenance assistance for studies, including vocational training, consisting in student grants or student loans, to students who have not acquired the right of permanent residence, while 51 52 53 54 55 ",
        "I - 8566 JUDGMENT OF 18. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-158/07 also providing, in Article 16(1), that Union citizens will have a right of permanent residence in the territory of a host Member State where they have resided legally for a continuous period of five years. The Court has also stated that, in order to be proportionate, a residence requirement must be applied by the national authorities on the basis of clear criteria known in advance (see Case C-138/02 Collins [2004] ECR I-2703, paragraph 72). By enabling those concerned to know, without any ambiguity, what their rights and obligations are, the residence requirement laid down by the Policy rule of 9 May 2005 is, by its very existence, such as to guarantee a significant level of legal certainty and transparency in the context of the award of maintenance grants to students. It must therefore be stated that a residence requirement of five years, such as that laid down in the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, does not go beyond what is necessary to attain the objective of ensuring that students from other Member States are to a certain degree integrated into the society of the host Member State. That finding is without prejudice to the option for Member States to award main- tenance grants to students from other Member States who do not fulfil the five year residence requirement should they wish to do so. 56 57 58 59 ",
        "I - 8567 F\u00d6RSTER In the light of the foregoing, the response to the second to fourth questions must be that a student who is a national of a Member State and travels to another Member State to study there can rely on the first paragraph of Article 12 EC in order to obtain a maintenance grant where he or she has resided for a certain duration in the host Member State. The first paragraph of Article 12 EC does not preclude the application to nationals of other Member States of a requirement of five years\u2019 prior residence. The fifth question By this question, the Centrale Raad van Beroep is essentially enquiring whether Community law, in particular the principle of legal certainty, precludes the retro- active application of a residence requirement which, at the time of the facts in the main proceedings, could not have been known to the applicant. It must be pointed out in this connection that the Policy rule of 9 May 2005 entered into force on its publication, with retroactive effect from 15 March 2005, that is, after the facts in the main proceedings took place. The referring court, however, takes the view that the Policy rule of 9 May 2005 is relevant to the outcome of the dispute in the main proceedings, since it reflects the way in which the IB-Groep decided to implement the judgment in Bidar , and the effects of that judgment were not temporally limited. 60 61 62 63 ",
        "I - 8568 JUDGMENT OF 18. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-158/07 The referring court states that its doubt on that issue originates from the judgment in Collins , inasmuch as the Court held, in that judgment, that a residence require- ment could not be imposed on an applicant for social assistance unless that applicant could have already known of the existence of that requirement during the reference period. As is apparent from paragraph 56 above, the Court held in Collins that, in order to be proportionate, a residence requirement must be applied by the national authorities on the basis of clear criteria known in advance. With a view to answering the question, it should be recalled that, since the effects of Bidar were not temporally limited, the interpretation of Article 12 EC which follows from that judgment may, and must, be applied by the national courts to legal relationships arising and established before that judgment, provided that in other respects the conditions enabling an action relating to the application of that rule to be brought before the courts having jurisdiction are satisfied (see, to that effect, Case 61/79 Denkavit italiana [1980] ECR 1205, paragraph 16, and Bidar , paragraph 66). According to settled case-law, the principle of legal certainty \u2014 which is one of the general principles of Community law \u2014 requires, particularly, that rules of law be clear, precise and predictable in their effects, in particular where they may have nega- tive consequences on individuals and undertakings (see, to that effect, Case C-143/93 Van Es Douane Agenten [1996] ECR I-431, paragraph 27, and Case C-347/06 ASM Brescia [2008] ECR I-5641, paragraph 69). The file shows that the residence requirement laid down in the Policy rule of 9 May 2005 was introduced in order to cover the transitional period between the judgment 64 65 66 67 68 ",
        "I - 8569 F\u00d6RSTER in Bidar and the transposition of Directive 2004/38. That option is said to have been chosen in order to satisfy the requirements of Articles 24(2) and 16 of that directive. It therefore seems that, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, making the right of students from other Member States to a maintenance grant subject to a residence requirement, as an essential element of that right, does not have any negative consequences for the students concerned. Likewise, since the Policy rule of 9 May 2005 gives greater rights to the students concerned than those to which they were entitled under the former national rules, the requirement set out in Collins is not applicable to the present case. The answer to the question referred must therefore be that, in circumstances such as those of the main proceedings, Community law, in particular the principle of legal certainty, does not preclude the application of a residence requirement which makes the right of students from other Member States to a maintenance grant subject to the completion of periods of residence which occurred prior to the introduction of that requirement. Costs Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. 69 70 71 72 ",

In the present case the Court is invited to specify the scope of Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive 91/439/EEC 2 which permits a Member State to refuse to recognise the validity of any driving licence issued by another Member State if the holder is, in the first Member State\u2019s territory, subject to a measure which restricts, suspends, with- draws or cancels the right to drive. 2. The special feature of this case is that a licence was issued to a person even though he was the subject of a procedure to examine his fitness to drive following a road traffic offence committed before the issue of the licence. 3.

The laying down, in that Directive, of the minimum requirements for the issue of a driving licence also has the objective of improving road safety in the European Union. 4 7. Article 7(1)(a) of the Directive provides as follows: \u2018Driving licences shall, moreover, be issued only to those applicants: who have passed a test of skills and behaviour and a theoretical test and who meet medical standards, in accordance with the provisions of Annexes II and III.\u2019 3 \u2014 See Article 1. 4 \u2014 See recital 4. 8. In particular, Directive 91/439 provides that driving licences shall not be issued to, or renewed for, applicants or drivers who are dependent on alcohol or psychotropic substances. 9. In fact, point 14.1 of Annex III to that Directive provides: \u2018Driving licences shall not be issued to, or renewed for, applicants or drivers who are dependent on alcohol or unable to refrain from drinking and driving.\u2019 10. Point 15 of the same annex provides: \u2018Driving licences shall not be issued to or renewed for applicants or drivers who are dependent on psychotropic substances or who are not dependent on such substances but regularly abuse them, whatever category of licence is requested.\u2019 ",

Article 8(2) of Directive 91/439 provides that the Member State of normal residence may apply its national provisions on the restriction, suspension, withdrawal or cancel- lation of the right to drive to the holder of a driving licence issued by another Member State. 13. Article 8(4) of that Directive provides as follows: \u2018A Member State may refuse to recognise the validity of any driving licence issued by another Member State to a person who is, in the former State\u2019s territory, the subject of one of the measures referred to in paragraph 2. A Member State may likewise refuse to issue a driving licence to an applicant who is the subject of such a measure in another Member State.\u2019 B \u2014 National law 14. Paragraph 28(1) of the regulation on the authorisation of persons to drive on the highways (Verordnung \u00fcber die Zulassung von Personen zum Stra\u00dfenverkehr, the \u2018FeV\u2019) provides that holders of a driving licence issued by a Member State of the Union are authorised to drive on the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany. 15. However, according to Article 28(4)(3) of the FeV that authorisation does not apply to persons whose driving licence has been provisionally or definitively withdrawn, in Germany, by a court or been withdrawn by an immediately enforceable or final decision of an administrative authority. 16. By virtue of Article 46 of the FeV, the driving licence authority is to withdraw the right to drive if it is shown that the holder of a licence is unfit to drive motor vehicles, in particular in the case of serious or repeated contraventions of provisions of road traffic or criminal law.

Mr Weber, resident in Germany, was the subject of a road check on 18 September 2004. During this check, it was noted that he was under the influence of cannabis and amphetamine. Following that offence, the Kreis Siegen-Wittgenstein (local authority of Siegen-Witgenstein), by administrative deci- sion of 17 November 2004, which became final on 4 December 2004, imposed a fine and decided to suspend his driving licence for one month. 19. On 18 November 2004, the Czech authorities issued a driving licence to Mr Weber, who had passed his driving test on 16 November 2004. 20. Because of the offence committed on 18 September 2004, the Ordnungsamt of the Kreis Siegen-Wittgenstein initiated a pro - cedure to examine Mr Weber\u2019s fitness to drive. He was informed of this on 7 January 2005 and handed in his German driving licence to the competent administrative authorities in February 2005. 21. By decision of 17 March 2005, which became final on 6 April 2005, the Ordnung- samt of the Kreis Siegen-Wittgenstein decided to withdraw Mr Weber\u2019s German driving licence. 22. The referring court also points out that the latter did not comply, within the time-limit set, with the obligation imposed on him to obtain a medical-psychological report to prove his fitness to drive and that the German administrative authorities were unaware that he had a Czech driving licence. 23. On 6 January 2006, when driving on public roads in Germany, Mr Weber was stopped by the police, to whom he produced his Czech driving licence. ",
        "I - 8577 WEBER 24. Following that check, the Amtsgericht Siegen (Local Court, Siegen), by judgment of 22 August 2006, convicted Mr Weber of negligent driving without a licence. He appealed against that judgment to the Land- gericht Siegen (Regional Court, Siegen). III \u2014 The question referred 25. It is in this context that the Landgericht Siegen decided to stay proceedings and to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice on the following question: \u2018Is Article 1(2) in conjunction with Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive 91/439/EEC to be interpreted as meaning that a Member State is precluded, within its territory, from refusing to recognise the validity of a right to drive under a driving licence issued by another Member State, and therefore the validity of that licence, because the right to drive was withdrawn from its holder in the first Member State after the grant to him in another Member State of a so-called \u201csecond\u201d EU driving licence, if the withdrawal of the right to drive is based on an incident or on misconduct which occurred prior to the issue of the driving licence by the other Member State?\u2019 IV \u2014 Analysis 26. By its question, the referring court asks, essentially, whether Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive 91/439 must be interpreted as meaning that a Member State is en- titled to refuse to recognise the validity of a driving licence issued by another Member State when the licence has been issued even though, following a road traffic offence committed previously on the territory of the first Member State, a procedure to examine the holder\u2019s fitness to drive was ongoing. 27. It should be noted that, in the case in the main proceedings, the person holding a German driving licence committed a road traffic offence in Germany. Around one month after the offence, that person obtained a Czech driving licence although, following the offence, a procedure to examine his fitness to drive was pending and that pro - cedure ultimately led to withdrawal of the German licence. 28. The question is therefore whether the German authorities are obliged to recognise the validity of the second licence obtained while that procedure was underway. ",
        "I - 8578 OPINION OF MR BOT \u2014 CASE C-1/07 29. The present case allows the Court to clarify the case-law developed in Case C-476/01 Kapper 5 . and in its orders of 6 April 2006, in Halbritter 6 and 28 September 2006, in Kremer . 7 30. In Kapper , cited above, the Court, which had already held that the obligation of mutual recognition of driving licences applies without any formality and leaves no discretion to the Member States as to the measures to be adopted to comply with it, 8 applied the principle of mutual recognition in all its force. 31. In fact, the Court ruled that the host Member State is not entitled to verify the conditions of issue of a driving licence obtained in another Member State. Conse- quently, the host Member State is obliged to recognise the validity of the driving licence obtained in this way. 9 32. The Court has, however, observed that that there is an exception to the principle of mutual recognition of driving licences 5 \u2014 C-476/01, Kapper [2004] ECR I-5205. 6 \u2014 C-227/05. 7 \u2014 C-340/05. 8 \u2014 See, in particular, Case C-230/97, Awoyemi [1998] ECR I-6781, paragraphs 41 and 42. 9 \u2014 Kapper , cited above (paragraphs 47 and 49). resulting from the very wording of Dir - ective 91/439. Article 8(2) and (4) of that Directive provides that a Member State may refuse to recognise the validity of any driving licence obtained in another Member State if the holder is, in the first Member State\u2019s territory, subject to a measure which restricts, suspends, withdraws or cancels the right to drive. 33. The Court had the opportunity to clarify that provision in Kapper , Halbritter and Kremer , cited above. 34. It first stated that, as that provision dero- gates from the principle of mutual recogni- tion, it must be strictly interpreted. 10 It also clarified that the circumstances in which a driving licence may not be recognised as valid, in accordance with Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive 91/439, are not limited to cases where the holder of the licence asks to exchange it. That provision also has the aim of allowing a Member State to apply, within its territory, its national provisions concerning the withdrawal, suspension or cancellation of driving licences, when 10 \u2014 Ibidem (paragraph 72 and the case-law cited). See also Halbritter , cited above (paragraph 26). ",
        "I - 8579 WEBER the holder of a licence has, for example, committed an offence. 11 35. The Court then ruled that that provi- sion may not be used by a Member State as a basis for refusing indefinitely to recognise the validity of a licence issued in another Member State, when the holder of the licence has been subject, in the territory of the first Member State, to a restrictive measure. It clarified that, when the prohibition on requesting a new licence has expired in the territory of the host Member State, Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive 91/439 preclude that Member State from continuing to refuse to recognise the validity of any driving licence subsequently issued by another Member State. 12 36. Such an interpretation applies a fortiori when the measure withdrawing the driving licence does not include a period in which it is prohibited to apply for a new licence. 13 In such a case, the host Member State must recognise a driving licence issued by another Member State after the measure of with- drawal. The host Member State could then only apply Article 8(2) of Directive 91/439 11 \u2014 Kapper , cited above (paragraph 73). 12 \u2014 Ibidem (paragraph 76). 13 \u2014 See Kremer , cited above (paragraphs 33 and 34). in the case of wrongful conduct by the party concerned which took place after the new driving licence was obtained. 14 37. In Kapper , Halbritter and Kremer , cited above, the holders of driving licences, recog- nition of which was contested, had obtained their licence after the measure of withdrawal or after the expiry of the period in which it was prohibited to apply for a new licence. Controls had been carried out, the offence sanctioned, and the effects of the restrictive measure were therefore at an end. 38. The present case is different, as Mr Weber is a person who committed a road traffic offence in Germany and who obtained a new licence in the Czech Republic, although he was the subject of a procedure, following that offence and on German terri- tory, to examine his fitness to drive. Unlike in the cases on which the Court has already ruled, the time of issue of the new licence, in 14 \u2014 Ibidem (paragraph 35). ",
        "I - 8580 OPINION OF MR BOT \u2014 CASE C-1/07 the case in the main proceedings, is after the misconduct and before the measure of with- drawal taken following that conduct. 39. Therefore, the measures ensuring that a dangerous person could not drive on the road network had not yet been adopted and, in any case, these measures had not exhausted their effects. 40. I recall that, in that respect, it is apparent from paragraphs 14.1 and 15 of Annex III to Directive 91/439 that a driving licence may not be issued to or renewed for a person who is dependent on alcohol or drugs or who, without being dependent, regularly consumes or abuses them. 41. In my opinion, the procedure provided for by German law, in application of points 14.1 and 15 of Annex III of that Dir - ective and which follows the commission of an offence, has the aim of establishing precisely, for example by blood tests and monitoring of a person, whether the latter is still under the influence of alcohol or drugs. 42. Moreover, when an offence is committed on the territory of a Member State, only that State is competent to sanction that offence by taking, where appropriate, a measure which withdraws the licence from that person, with or without a period in which it is prohibited to apply for a new licence. 43. Therefore, in a case such as the present, I believe that Article 8(2) and (4) of Direct- ive 91/439 must allow a Member State on whose territory a procedure to examine a person\u2019s fitness to drive is pending not to recognise a driving licence issued by another Member State during that procedure. 44. Firstly, the procedure pending in the Member State on whose territory the offence was committed has the objective of assessing whether a person may be dangerous. However, the new licence was issued to him without the in-depth tests foreseen under German law having been carried out. ",
        "I - 8581 WEBER 45. To admit the validity of that new driving licence would therefore go against the objective of Directive 91/439, which is the improvement of road safety. 46. Secondly, the person concerned cannot, by obtaining a new driving licence, avoid the sanctions which may be imposed on him as a result of the offence committed on the terri- tory of a Member State. 47. Finally, the issue of a driving licence, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, goes against the requirements of Article 7(5) of Directive 91/439. At that stage of the proceedure, when the person concerned had obtained a new driving licence, he still held a driving licence issued by the Federal Republic of Germany. 48. The whole point of that article is to avoid behaviour such as that of Mr Weber. It is apparent from the facts in the main proceed- ings that he, although having committed a road traffic offence, tried to avoid the resulting sanctions by going to another Member State to obtain a new driving licence there. 15 Such behaviour is clearly fraudulent. 49. In other words, to oblige the Federal Republic of Germany to recognise a licence issued while a procedure, following the commission of an offence, is still pending would have the consequences of authorising a person in a potentially dangerous state to drive, of allowing that person to avoid the criminal sanction which they incurred, and of encouraging fraud. 50. Therefore, I believe that Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive 91/439 must be inter- preted as meaning that a Member State is entitled to refuse to recognise the validity of a driving licence issued by another Member State when the licence has been issued even though, following a road traffic offence committed previously on the territory of the first Member State, a procedure to examine the holder\u2019s fitness to drive was ongoing. 15 \u2014 Mr Weber\u2019s observations indicate, in this regard, that \u2018[h]e thought it very likely that the withdrawal of the authorisa- tion to drive granted by the German authorities was immi- nent\u2019 and that was why he went to the Czech Republic to obtain a new permit (p. 1).

As a result of that incident he was fined and his German driving licence was suspended for a month by administrative order of the Kreis Siegen-Wittgenstein on 17 November 2004, which became final on 4 December 2004. On 18 November 2004, Mr Weber obtained a driving licence, valid for 10 years, from the municipal authority of Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) for classes A1, A, B, and AM. The driving licence gave 16 November 2004 as the date of the driving test taken for the issue of that licence. On 7 January 2005, Mr Weber was informed by letter from the Ordnungsamt of the Kreis Siegen-Wittgenstein that, in view of the offence committed on 18 September 2004, his fitness to drive was to be examined. In February 2005, Mr Weber surren- dered his German driving licence to the administrative authority.

Mr Weber appealed against that judgment to the Landgericht Siegen seeking to have it set aside on the grounds that, since he held a Czech driving licence, he was entitled to continue to drive motor vehicles on the basis of the principle of mutual recognition of driving licences issued in Member States set out in Article 1(2) of Directive 91/439. In those circumstances, the Landgericht Siegen decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \u2018Is Article 1(2) in conjunction with Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive [91/439] to be interpreted as meaning that a Member State is precluded, within its territory, from refusing to recognise the validity of a right to drive under a driving licence issued by another Member State, and therefore the validity of that licence, because the right to drive was withdrawn from its holder in the first Member State after the grant to him in another Member State of a so-called \u201csecond\u201d EU driving licence, if the with- drawal of the right to drive is based on an incident or on misconduct which occurred prior to the issue of the driving licence by the other Member State?\u2019 19 20 21 ",
        "I - 8593 WEBER The question referred By its question, the referring court asks essentially whether Article 1(2) and Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive 91/439 are to be interpreted as meaning that a Member State is precluded from refusing, within its territory, to recognise a right to drive under a driving licence issued by another Member State, and therefore the validity of that licence, where the right to drive was withdrawn from its holder in the first Member State after the issue to him of that driving licence, but as a sanction for an offence which occurred prior to that date. Mr Weber submits principally, referring to the case-law of the Court (orders of 6 April 2006 in Case C-227/05 Halbritter and of 28 September 2006 in Case C-340/05 Kremer ), that a Member State can refuse to recognise a driving licence issued by another Member State only on the basis of conduct which occurred after that driving licence was issued. The Italian Government and the Commission of the European Communities take the view, however, that in a situation such as that in the main proceedings a Member State is entitled to refuse to recognise the validity of the driving licence issued by another Member State, even if that refusal is prompted by conduct prior to the date of issue of that licence. The Portuguese Government takes the view that Article 8(2) and (4) of Direct- ive 91/439 is intended precisely to prevent the risks which ensue from the conduct of persons who, while their driving licence is temporarily suspended in one Member State, travel to another Member State to obtain a second driving licence, when still undergoing checks as to their fitness to drive which are likely to result in withdrawal of their right to drive. 22 23 24 25 ",
        "I - 8594 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-1/07 First of all, it must be borne in mind that the general principle of mutual recognition of driving licences issued by the Member States, laid down in Article 1(2) of Dir - ective 91/439, was established in order, inter alia, to facilitate the movement of persons settling in a Member State other than that in which they have passed a driving test (see, inter alia, Case C-476/01 Kapper [2004] ECR I-5205, paragraph 71; Joined Cases C-329/06 and C-343/06 Wiedemann and Funk [2008] ECR I-4635, paragraph 49; and Joined Cases C-334/06 to C-336/06 Zerche and Others [2008] ECR I-4691, paragraph 46). The Court has consistently held that Article 1(2) of Directive 91/439 provides for mutual recognition, without any formality, of driving licences issued by Member States. That provision imposes on Member States a clear and precise obligation, which leaves no room for discretion as to the measures to be adopted in order to comply with it (see, to that effect, Case C-230/97 Awoyemi [1998] ECR I-6781, para- graphs 41 and 42; Kapper , paragraph 45; Wiedemann and Funk , paragraph 50; and Zerche and Others , paragraph 47). Nevertheless, Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive 91/439 permits Member States, in certain circumstances and in particular for reasons of road traffic safety, to apply their national provisions on the restriction, suspension, withdrawal or cancellation of the right to drive to any holder of a driving licence having normal residence in their territory and to refuse to recognise the validity on that territory of any driving licence issued by another Member State to a person who is the subject of one of those measures. The Court has held on a number of occasions in that regard that the first subpara- graph of Article 8(4) of Directive 91/439 constitutes a derogation from the general principle of mutual recognition of driving licences and is, therefore, to be interpreted strictly (see, inter alia, Wiedemann and Funk , paragraph 60, and Zerche and Others , paragraph 57). 26 27 28 29 ",
        "I - 8595 WEBER It is apparent from the information supplied by the referring court that, at the date on which Mr Weber obtained his Czech driving licence, that is to say, 18 November 2004, his German driving licence was the subject of a temporary suspension, which was ordered on 17 November 2004 for one month and became definitive on 4 December 2004. Subsequent to his acquisition of the Czech driving licence, his right to drive was withdrawn on 17 March 2005. Furthermore, it is common ground that the facts justifying both the temporary suspension and the withdrawal of Mr Weber\u2019s right to drive occurred on 18 September 2004, that is to say, before the date of issue of the Czech driving licence. The view cannot be taken that Directive 91/439 imposes an obligation to recognise the validity of a driving licence issued in such circumstances. The Court has, indeed, had occasion to rule that a Member State can exercise its right under Article 8(2) of Directive 91/439 to apply its own provisions on withdrawal of the right to drive to the holder of a driving licence issued by another Member State only by reason of some conduct of the person concerned after he has obtained that driving licence (see judgments in Wiedemann and Funk , paragraph 59; and orders in Zerche and Others , paragraph 56; Halbritter , paragraph 38; and Kremer , paragraph 35). Nevertheless, the withdrawal of the driving licence held by the person concerned in Kremer was not accompanied by a prohibition on obtaining a new licence. In the other cases listed in the previous paragraph, the temporary prohibition on obtaining a new licence which accompanied the withdrawals had all expired by the date when the new licence was issued. 30 31 32 33 ",
        "I - 8596 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-1/07 It was in the light of such considerations that the Court held that a Member State may exercise the right under Article 8(2) of Directive 91/439 only by reason of some conduct of the person concerned after he has obtained a driving licence issued by another Member State. That provision does not permit the Member State of normal residence to refuse to recognise a driving licence issued by another Member State just because the holder has earlier had a previous licence withdrawn in the first Member State ( Wiedemann and Funk , paragraph 66, and Zerche and Others , paragraph 63). The situation in the main proceedings is quite different. Firstly, when Mr Weber obtained his Czech driving licence, his German driving licence had been temporarily suspended by the competent German authorities. Secondly, following the issue of his Czech driving licence, his right to drive was withdrawn on the basis of the same facts as those which led to the temporary suspension. In such a situation, the right of the competent authorities and courts of a Member State to refuse to recognise the validity of a driving licence obtained in another Member State by a person whose driving licence has been temporarily suspended in the first Member State must be recognised absolutely and definitively on the basis of the provisions of Directive 91/439, in particular Article 8(4) thereof, where the temporary suspension is followed by the withdrawal of the right to drive on the basis of the same facts (see, to that effect, the order of 3 July 2008 in Case C-225/07 M\u00f6ginger , paragraph 41). The fact that withdrawal of the right to drive is ordered after the date of issue of the new driving licence is irrelevant in that regard, since the grounds for that measure existed at that date (see, a contrario, Kapper , paragraph 74). Any other interpretation would wholly negate the Member State\u2019s right under the first subparagraph of Article 8(4) of Directive 91/439 to refuse to recognise the 34 35 36 37 ",
        "I - 8597 WEBER validity of a driving licence obtained in another Member State by a person whose right to drive has been withdrawn in the first State. As the Advocate General observes in point 42 of his Opinion, the Member State in whose territory an offence is committed has sole competence to punish that offence by ordering, as necessary, withdrawal of the driving licence or of the right to drive, with or without an order that no application may be made for the issue of a new driving licence during a particular period. To require a Member State to recognise the validity of a driving licence issued by another Member State on the ground that the holder of that licence has not committed any offence on the territory of the first Member State after issue of that licence, despite the fact that he is subject to a valid measure withdrawing his right to drive on the basis of facts arising prior to that issue, would have the effect of encour- aging offenders likely to be subject to such withdrawal to travel without delay to another Member State in order to evade the administrative or criminal consequences of those offences and would ultimately destroy the confidence on which the system of mutual recognition of driving licences rests. Furthermore, as the Commission pointed out in its written observations, in a situ- ation such as that in the main proceedings, recognition of the validity of the driving licence issued to Mr Weber by the Czech authorities, despite the fact that, at the date of issue of that licence, he still held a German driving licence, would undermine both the spirit of Directive 91/439 and the letter of Article 7(5), which provides that a person may not hold a driving licence from more than one Member State. Consequently, the answer to the question referred must be that Articles 1(2) and 8(2) and (4) of Directive 91/439 must be interpreted as meaning that a Member State is not precluded from refusing to recognise, in its territory, a right to drive under a driving licence issued by another Member State to a person whose right to drive was with- drawn, in the territory of the first Member State, even though that withdrawal was 38 39 40 41 ",

Costs Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: Articles 1(2) and 8(2) and (4) of Council Directive 91/439/EEC of 29 July 1991 on driving licences must be interpreted as meaning that a Member State is not precluded from refusing to recognise, in its territory, a right to drive under a driving licence issued by another Member State to a person whose right to drive was withdrawn, in the territory of the first Member State, even though that withdrawal was ordered after the issue of that driving licence, provided that the licence was obtained during a period in which a licence issued in the first Member State was suspended and both the suspension and the withdrawal are based on grounds existing at the date of issue of the second driving licence.

        "I - 8600 SUMMARY \u2014 CASE C-38/07 P 1. It follows from Article 225 EC, the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice and Article 112(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice that an appeal must indicate precisely the contested elements of the judgment which the appellant seeks to have set aside and also the legal argu- ments specifically advanced in support of the appeal. An appeal which merely repeats or reproduces verbatim the pleas in law and arguments previously submitted to the Court of First Instance does not satisfy the requirements to state reasons under those provisions. However, provided that the appellant challenges the interpretation or applica- tion of Community law by the Court of First Instance, the points of law exam- ined at first instance may be discussed again in the course of an appeal. It follows that an appeal by which an appellant, although relying on argu- ments which it has already submitted in support of its action for annulment before the Court of First Instance, none the less challenges the latter\u2019s interpret- ation, is admissible. (see paras 33-36) 2. In order to assess whether there is obvious negligence within the meaning of Article 239 of the Community Customs Code, account must be taken in particular of the complexity of the provisions non-compliance with which resulted in the customs debt being incurred, and the professional experi- ence of, and care taken by, the trader. In that regard, first, there is no particular complexity where, as regards a trader who has applied for remission of duties in respect of import transactions which were subsequent to the entry into force of Regulation No 1196/97 concerning the classification of certain goods in the combined nomenclature, the publica- tion of that regulation had put an end to any possible legislative complexity relating to the classification of rice paper created by the absence of certain words in the wording of the Dutch version of subheading 1905 90 20 of the combined nomenclature. Although the wording of the Dutch version of that subheading may have appeared less precise than that of other language versions, the fact remains that that classification regula- tion, which is directly applicable and binding in its entirety, explicitly and unequivocally describes the goods that have to be classified under that subheading and the goods imported by the trader in question correspond thereto. Secondly, as regards professional experi- ence, an operator who uses the services of a customs agent cannot avoid post- clearance recovery of customs duties by relying on his inexperience with regard to customs formalities. Operators might in some cases be able to circumvent the ",
        "I - 8601 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING v COMMISSION condition relating to professional experi- ence by using the services of customs specialists as a matter of course and thus it would be operators carrying out their customs operations on their own who would be placed at a disadvantage with regard to the procedure set out in Article 239 of the Community Customs Code. It follows that, in so far as the agent acts in the name of and on behalf of the importer, information concerning possible negligence on the part of the agent, including the level of its profes- sional experience, has to be taken into account for the purposes of assessing the negligence of that importer. Thirdly, as regards the care taken by the trader, it must be pointed out that a careful operator, who has acquainted himself with a classification regulation published in the Official Journal of the European Communities , cannot simply continue to import his goods under a combined nomenclature heading on the sole ground that that classification has been accepted by those author- ities. To allow such negligence would be tantamount to encouraging oper- ators to benefit from the errors of their customs authorities. Furthermore, the error on the part of the customs author- ities, which had already been taken into account in the present case in the exam- ination as to whether a special situa- tion existed, cannot, as a rule, release an operator from the consequences of its own negligence.

Heuschen & Schrouff, an importer of foodstuffs and food ingredients, has imported rice paper 14 from Vietnam for many years. 13. In 1996 and the following years, the customs agent acting on behalf of Heuschen & Schrouff declared imported rice paper under CN subheading 1901 90 99 for the purpose of release into free circulation. By letter of 21 March 1996, the Netherlands customs authority notified Heuschen & Schrouff that the rice paper should indeed be classified under CN subheading 1901 90 99. 14. On 27 June 1997 the Commission adopted Regulation No 1196/97, 15 which was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 28 June 1997 and entered into force on 19 July 1997. 14 \u2014 Also known [in German] as \u2018Reisbl\u00e4tter\u2019 (\u2018rice sheets\u2019). 15 \u2014 See above, points 9 and 10 of this Opinion. 15. Heuschen & Schrouff continued to import rice paper from Vietnam under CN subheading 1901 90 99 after the adop- tion of that regulation, a practice which was accepted by the Netherlands customs authority in respect of 29 declarations in six months (with documentary inspection and, in one instance, physical inspection). On 16 March 1998, the Netherlands customs authority pointed out that the declar- ations should be made with reference to CN subheading 1905 90 20. Later on the same day, however, the correctness of a declar- ation using CN subheading 1901 90 99 was confirmed by the same customs authority. As from 17 March 1998, Heuschen & Schrouff used CN subheading 1905 90 20 for the importation of rice paper. 16. By letter of 22 November 2000, Heuschen & Schrouff was requested to pay customs duties amounting in total to NLG 645 399.50 (EUR 292 869.52) on all imports of rice paper effected over the period from 13 November 1997 to 31 December 1998. Referring to Regulation No 1196/97, the customs authority stated by way of explan- ation that the CN subheading 1901 90 99 specified on the declarations was incorrect and that a revision of the relevant assessment notices would therefore be necessary. 17. In response to the objection lodged by Heuschen & Schrouff, the requests for payment were confirmed by ruling of the Customs and Excise Inspector of 9 March 2001, with the exception of a request for payment in the amount of NLG 13 650.30 ",

After adjustment, the amount payable was assessed at NLG 636 518.40 (EUR 282 645.21) for the period from 25 November 1997 to 2 February 1998. 18. On 13 September 2002, Heuschen & Schrouff applied to the national customs authority for remission of the customs debt in question pursuant to Article 239(1) of the Customs Code. That application was submitted to the Commission on 19 September 2002. 19. By Decision REM 19/2002 of 17 June 2004, the Commission rejected the applica- tion on the ground that, although a special situation as referred to in Article 239 of the Customs Code did exist, Heuschen & Schrouff had nevertheless acted with obvious negligence. The Commission pointed out in that regard that, following publication of Regulation No 1196/97 on 28 June 1997, the tariff situation was no longer complex and confused. Heuschen & Schrouff, the Commission held, should at that time have at least ascertained the position by making enquiries. 20.

Heuschen & Schrouff based its action on three pleas in law: \u2014 infringement of Article 239 of the Customs Code, incorrect assessment of the facts and failure to state reasons; \u2014 breach of the principles of sound admin- istration and equal treatment; \u2014 breach of the principle of proportionality. 22. By the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action and ordered the present appellant to pay the costs. 23. In the passages of that judgment which are relevant to the present proceedings, the Court of First Instance held that, because of ",
        "I - 8607 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING v COMMISSION the error made by the Netherlands customs authority, a special situation as referred to in Article 239 of the Customs Code did indeed exist, but that Heuschen & Schrouff had nevertheless acted with obvious negligence. The publication of Regulation No 1196/97 brought an end to the situ- ation obtaining hitherto, which may have been complex so far as the Dutch-language version was concerned. In any case, from that time onwards, any discrepancies between the previous declaration and Regu- lation No 1196/97 were obvious. An enquiry addressed to the customs authority regarding those discrepancies would have been neces- sary in any event. The customs agent\u2019s mistakes were attributable to Heuschen & Schrouff. Accordingly, the Commission was correct in its decision and there was, the Court of First Instance ruled, no infringe- ment of Article 239 of the Customs Code. IV \u2014 Forms of order sought in the proceedings before the Court of Justice 24. Heuschen & Schrouff claims that the Court should: \u2014 set aside the judgment delivered on 30 November 2006 by the Court of First Instance in Case T-382/04; \u2014 annul the decision of the European Commission of 17 June 2004 (REM 19/2002), in which the Commission found that remission of import duties was not justified in the present case; \u2014 order the Commission to pay the costs. 25. The Commission contends that the Court should: \u2014 dismiss the appeal as unfounded; \u2014 order Heuschen & Schrouff to pay the costs. 26.

In the appeal proceedings, Heuschen & Schrouff alleges, in a single ground of appeal, that the Court of First Instance infringed Article 239 of the Customs Code. 16 The Court of First Instance, it continues, also provided an inadequate statement of grounds for its conclusions; in any event, the grounds of the judgment are incapable of supporting the conclusions. 28. It is still not at all clear how unbaked rice paper is to be correctly classified. The Court of First Instance, Heuschen & Schrouff argues, wrongly assumed that classification in CN heading 1905 90 20 is beyond doubt. Heuschen & Schrouff challenges that classifi- cation as incorrect and points out that, at the same time, there is an action pending before the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden on the ques- tion of the correct classification. 17 16 \u2014 At the beginning of the appeal, Heuschen & Schrouff mentions in the same breath an infringement of Articles 899 to 909 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementa- tion of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 (OJ 1993 L 253, p. 1). However, since no specific reference is made in the course of the appeal to those provisions as regards the adminis- trative procedure for decisions concerning Article 239 of the Customs Code, I presume that this is a single ground of appeal which relates essentially to Article 239 of the Customs Code. 17 \u2014 In that regard, see above, point 2 of this Opinion. 29. The assessment under Article 239 of the Customs Code, that is, applying the criteria of the nature of the error (or the complexity of the legislation), the professional experi- ence of the party concerned and the degree of care exercised by that party, ought, when viewed as a whole, to lead to remission of the import duties. 30. With regard to the criterion of the complexity of the legislation, errors were made both by the Commission and by the Netherlands customs authority. In Regula- tion No 1196/97, the Commission adopted what was patently an incorrect, or at least ambiguous, measure which is at variance with the case-law of the Court of Justice. 18 At most, baked rice paper may come within its scope, but not the unbaked rice paper imported by Heuschen & Schrouff. In add - ition, the wording of CN heading 1905 in the Dutch-language version contains no refer- ence to rice paper. That, it is argued, gives rise to confusion. The Netherlands customs authority also made an error, since, over the course of the six months following publica- tion of Regulation No 1196/97, it accepted and confirmed 29 further declarations indi- cating classification under CN heading 1901. In the light of the above, the legisla- tion in question is a complex set of classifi- cation rules which, contrary to the view of the Court of First Instance, was not brought to an end by the publication of Regulation No 1196/97. In the light of the judgment in Biegi Nahrungsmittel , 19 account must also be taken of the period of time over which the authorities persisted in their error. Contrary 18 \u2014 Heuschen & Schrouff refers in this regard to Case C-12/94 Uelzena Milchwerke [1995] ECR I-2397. 19 \u2014 Case C-499/03 P Biegi Nahrungsmittel and Commonfood v Commission [2005] ECR I-1751, paragraph 48. ",
        "I - 8609 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING v COMMISSION to the view of the Court of First Instance, account must therefore also be taken of the fact that, for a further six months, the Neth- erlands authorities expressed, not doubt, but consent with regard to the classification made. 31. As regards the criterion of professional experience, the Court of First Instance, Heuschen & Schrouff contends, erred in assuming that the latter had extensive profession experience in relation to imports and exports. It thus incorrectly viewed it as an experienced trader and therefore as being an expert in the field of import and export formalities. However, Heuschen & Schrouff does not deal with the customs declar- ations itself, but employs for that purpose the appropriate services of third parties which act in its name, in accordance with Article 5 of the Customs Code. Their actions cannot be attributed to Heuschen & Schrouff under Article 239 of the Customs Code. Moreover, in the present case, in view of the particular complexity of the rules, it was not possible to avoid the allegedly erroneous classification, even with extensive professional experience. 32. As regards the criterion of the duty of care, the Court of First Instance applied unduly stringent requirements in the judg- ment under appeal, even if Heuschen & Schrouff were an experienced trader. The Court of First Instance also wrongly equated Heuschen & Schrouff with the direct repre- sentative whom it had appointed. It is not comprehensible why Heuschen & Schrouff should have had any doubts as to the previous classification under the CN. It had sufficient indications that CN heading 1901 was correct, as already observed in regard to the criterion of the complexity of the rules, in particular the point that Regula- tion No 1196/97 does not refer at all to the unbaked rice paper which it imports. The fact that it did not apply that regulation is therefore not connected with the fact that it had not read that regulation, but with the fact that that regulation did not apply to the goods imported by it and that the Nether- lands customs authority had confirmed this. It should also be borne in mind that, from 1996 to 1998, the CN was not amended in accordance with the wording of Regulation No 1196/97. For those reasons, the situ - ation in the judgment in Covita 20 referred to by the Court of First Instance is not comparable. By contrast, the Netherlands customs authority, which over a period of six months accepted 29 declarations which are now regarded as being incorrect, should be held responsible for a breach of the duty of care. After that, two years and eight months elapsed before the application for remission of the duties was processed. Those circumstances should be taken into account when assessing whether there was negligence on the part of Heuschen & Schrouff, possibly limited in nature and con fined to the distant past, which is of no conse- quence in the light of the serious negligence demonstrated by the Netherlands customs authority. This is also confirmed by the Netherlands customs authority\u2019s so-called working document of September 2002, annexed to the appeal, which preceded the submission to the Commission of Heuschen & Schrouff\u2019s application for remission of the import duties.

        "I - 8610 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-38/07 P judgment in Sommer , 21 the Netherlands customs authority assumed in that docu- ment that Heuschen & Schrouff was entitled, in the given circumstances, to trust that the customs authority had acted correctly. 33. The Commission first points out that the appeal repeats a great deal of what has already been submitted before the Court of First Instance. However, it does not seek by that observation to argue that the appeal is inadmissible. 34. The Commission further contends that Heuschen & Schrouff\u2019s arguments are not capable of calling into question the judgment of the Court of First Instance. It is true that a special situation as referred to in Article 239 of the Customs Code exists, inasmuch as the Netherlands customs authority errone- ously failed to take issue with Heuschen & Schrouff\u2019s incorrect declarations following the publication of Regulation No 1196/97. There was also no deception involved. However, the further requirement contained in Article 239 of the Customs Code, namely, that there must be no obvious negligence attributable to the person concerned, was not satisfied. In the assessment of the three criteria developed by the case-law (complexity of the provisions non-compliance with which has resulted in the customs debt being 21 \u2014 Case C-15/99 Sommer [2000] I-8989. incurred, as well as the experience of, and care exercised by, the trader) which is to be carried out in this regard, only the conduct of the trader in question is relevant. Contrary to the arguments of Heuschen & Schrouff, the conduct of the national customs authorities is irrelevant at this point in the assessment. B \u2014 Legal appraisal 35. It must first be observed that, in my view, there are no objections in regard to the repe- tition of submissions alleged by the Commis- sion. It is true that an appeal which merely repeats or reproduces verbatim the pleas in law or arguments previously submitted to the Court of First Instance, including those based on facts expressly rejected by that Court, fails to satisfy the requirements to state reasons arising from Article 225 EC, the first para- graph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice and Article 112(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice. 22 However, provided that, as in this case, the appellant challenges the interpretation or application of Community law by the Court of First Instance, the points of law examined at first instance may be discussed again in the course of the appeal. 23 22 \u2014 Case C-41/00 P Interporc v Commission [2003] ECR I-2125, paragraph 16. 23 \u2014 See, inter alia, Case C-210/98 P Salzgitter v Commission [2000] ECR I-5843, paragraph 43, and Interporc v Commis\u00ad sion , already cited in footnote 22, paragraph 17.

        "I - 8611 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING v COMMISSION 36. It must be pointed out in this connec- tion that, in principle, findings of fact and appraisals of fact made by the Court of First Instance cannot be the subject-matter of the present proceedings. An assessment of such findings is permissible only in so far as it involves a review of their legal classification and the legal inferences which the Court of First Instance has drawn from them in order to conclude that the conditions for the appli- cation of the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code, which are relevant here, have not been met. 24 37. Next, the question raised by Heuschen & Schrouff concerning the correct customs classification 25 of rice paper must be exam- ined. Heuschen & Schrouff appears to assume that, if the classification under CN subheading 1905 90 20 challenged by it is incorrect, the question of remission of duties will no longer be relevant. On the one hand, it should be pointed out in that regard that that question, as the Commission has also observed, is not the subject-matter of the present proceedings, but of the parallel proceedings before the national court. 26 On 24 \u2014 Where the Court of First Instance has found or appraised the facts, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction, pursuant to Article 225 EC, to carry out a review of the legal classi- fication of those facts and the legal inferences drawn from them by the Court of First Instance ( Biegi Nahrungsmittel and Commonfood v Commission , already cited in foot- note 19, paragraph 41; to that effect, see Lenaerts, K./Arts, D./Maselis, I., Procedural Law of the European Union , 2nd edition, London 2006, p. 457, paragraph 16-007). As the Court of Justice has held on several occasions, such a clas- sification is a question of law which, as such, may be subject to review by the Court of Justice in an appeal (see Biegi Nahrungsmittel and Commonfood v Commission , already cited in footnote 19, paragraph 41; Case C-19/93 P Rendo and Others v Commission [1995] ECR I-3319, paragraph 26; and Case C-470/00 P Parliament v Ripa di Meana and Others [2004] ECR I-4167, paragraph 41). 25 \u2014 See above, point 28 of this Opinion. 26 \u2014 For the detailed answer to the question of the customs classification of rice paper, I refer to my Opinion in Case C-375/07 (see above, point 2 of this Opinion), from which it is apparent that it must be classified under CN subheading 1905 90 20. the other hand, it would certainly be more appropriate from a systematic point of view to determine the question of remission of the duties at issue here only once the ques- tion of entry in the accounts has actually been resolved. 27 However, such a systematic sequence of determinations has not so far been required by the case-law. 28 38. As regards the question of the remis- sion of the (in this case, subsequently entered) import duties on grounds of fair- ness, the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code provides that the import duties may be remitted in special situations 29 in which no deception or obvious negligence may be attributed to the person concerned. In answering the question whether there is \u2018obvious negligence\u2019 within the meaning of the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code, account must be taken in particular of the complexity of the provisions non-compliance with which has resulted 27 \u2014 That is because, from a systematic point of view, only an amount of duty that has already been entered can be remitted or repaid. Consequently, until the proceedings concerning the subsequent entry in the accounts have been definitively concluded, it is not clear whether there is in fact any amount of duty subsequently entered in accordance with Article 220 of the Customs Code and which could be remitted or repaid. 28 \u2014 However, in some cases, practice at national level appears to execute the sequence for the scrutiny of applications in such a way that, for reasons of procedural economy, the question of remission is determined only after entry in the accounts has been established (Alexander, \u2018Vorbemerkungen zu Art. 220, 221\u2019, in: Witte, Zollkodex, Kommentar , 4th edition, 2006, paragraph 2). For the future, the \u2018Modernised Customs Code\u2019, Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 of the Euro- pean Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 laying down the Community Customs Code (OJ 2008 L 145, p. 1), provides for a positive change in terms of retaining a systematic sequence of decisions inasmuch as it provides, in Article 84(2), that, where an appeal has been lodged against the notification of the customs debt, the period for making an application for repayment or remission is to be suspended, on grounds of fairness, for the duration of the appeal proceedings. 29 \u2014 This general fairness clause allows the particular circum- stances of an individual case to be assessed; see, in that regard, Berr/Tr\u00e9meau, Le droit douanier, Communau\u00ad taire et national , 7th edition, 2006, p. 241, and Huchatz, \u2018Art. 239 \u2014 Erstattung oder Erlass in Sonderf\u00e4llen\u2019, in: Witte, Zollkodex, Kommentar , 4th edition, 2006, para- graphs 1 and 28.

        "I - 8612 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-38/07 P in the customs debt being incurred and the professional experience of, and care taken by, the trader. 30 The Court of First Instance also correctly took those criteria as its starting point in the judgment under appeal. 31 39. The Court of First Instance was equally correct in holding that these proceedings hinge solely on the question of obvious negli- gence, and accordingly on the appraisal of the three abovementioned criteria. That is because all the parties are in agreement \u2014 as is also reflected in the Commission\u2019s deci- sion \u2014 that a special situation as referred to in Article 239 of the Customs Code exists, inasmuch as the Netherlands customs authority wrongly failed to take issue with incorrect declarations made by Heuschen & Schrouff after Regulation No 1196/97 had been published. There is also agreement that no deception was involved. 40. With regard to the question of the complexity of the rules, the Court of First Instance\u2019s interpretation and application of Community law is, in my view, correct. In this respect, that Court, which proceeded throughout on the basis that the situation 30 \u2014 Case C-48/98 S\u00f6hl & S\u00f6hlke [1999] ECR I-7877, para- graphs 56 and 60. See also Lyons, EC Customs Law , 2nd edition, 2008, p. 489. See my Opinion of 4 September 2008 in Case C-375/07 Heuschen & Schrouff Ori\u00ebntal Foods Trading as regards the identity of those criteria with certain criteria of Article 220(2) and the case-law on that provision. 31 \u2014 Paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal. existing prior to the adoption of Regulation No 1196/97 was characterised by complexity, correctly assumed, with reference to the judg- ment in Hewlett Packard France , 32 that the situation after the adoption of that regulation was to be regarded as having been clarified. Contrary to the submissions of Heuschen & Schrouff, I do not see in the reference in the judgment in Biegi Nahrungsmittel 33 to the \u2018period of time during which the author- ities persisted in their error\u2019 any factor which could lead to any other assessment. The situation to which the Biegi Nahrungsmittel judgment related, and in which that period of time may possibly have been a factor, 34 is not comparable to the situation in the present case. That is because, unlike in that case, the present case is characterised by the fact that the publication of Regulation No 1196/97 has created a clear situation. The fact that not only Heuschen & Schrouff but also the customs authorities did not keep themselves informed by consulting the Official Journal cannot be relevant in such circumstances, since the conduct of the customs author- ities in failing to keep themselves informed still cannot relieve the person concerned of the duty to take steps on his own account. That is because the assessment of negligence on the part of the person concerned gener- ally and regularly hinges on the subjective sphere, in which the focus must be on the person concerned himself. In my view, only in exceptional circumstances can there be grounds for taking into account the conduct of the customs authorities in that regard. 32 \u2014 Case C-250/91 Hewlett Packard France [1993] ECR I-1819, paragraph 28. 33 \u2014 Already cited above in footnote 19, paragraph 48. 34 \u2014 See, in that regard, paragraph 55 of the judgment in Biegi Nahrungsmittel . On the background to that judgment, Harings, \u2018Nacherhebung von Einfuhrabgaben, Nichterken- nbarkeit eines Irrtums der Zollbeh\u00f6rden\u2019, in Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Z\u00f6lle und Verbrauchsteuern 2005, p. 230 et seq., p. 321, explains that, previously, the customs authorities frequently assumed that an error was not detectable only if it was based on a long-standing administrative practice. The Biegi Nahrungsmittel judgment rejected that practice. Harings also points out that an erroneous administrative practice can only be an indication of the undetectable nature of an error. ",
        "I - 8613 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING v COMMISSION 41. Similarly, with regard to the criterion of professional experience, I see no problems in the Court of First Instance\u2019s interpret- ation and application of Community law. That Court correctly applied the criteria devel- oped in S\u00f6hl & S\u00f6hlke . 35 36 The Court of First Instance also explained in a comprehensible manner that the person concerned was not itself inexperienced and that, in addition, the conduct of the customs agent was attribut- able to it. 37 As regards the aspect concerning the experience of the person concerned, the Court of First Instance carried out an appraisal of the facts, which can be chal- lenged on appeal only under strict conditions which do appear to be met here. 38 As regards the aspect concerning attribution of the customs agent\u2019s conduct, it should be noted that, according to the case-law, a limit should be placed on such attribution only if the agent acts fraudulently and the person liable for the customs debt is also affected by that fraud. 39 With regard to the argument that, in this case, in view of the particular complexity of the rules, the allegedly incorrect classifica- tion was not avoidable even with extensive professional experience, it must be stated that this can apply only to the situation prior to the adoption of Regulation No 1196/97 and has already been appraised elsewhere. 40 35 \u2014 Already cited above in footnote 30 to this Opinion. 36 \u2014 See paragraph 59 of the judgment under appeal. 37 \u2014 See paragraphs 65 and 66 of the judgment under appeal and the subsequent group of paragraphs on the same aspect, up to paragraph 70. 38 \u2014 In principle, under Article 225(1) EC and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, an appeal to the Court of Justice is limited to points of law. A fresh examination of the facts is therefore ruled out in principle. The Court of Justice can consider points of fact only to a strictly limited extent, in particular in regard to a distortion of the evidence. 39 \u2014 This is supported by the judgment in Case C-61/98 De Haan [1999] ECR I-5003, paragraph 53. 40 \u2014 See above, point 40 of this Opinion. 42. Finally, with regard to the criterion of the care taken by the trader, in this respect also the judgment under appeal stands up to scrutiny. The Court of First Instance was correct in referring to, in particular, the judg- ments in Deutsche Fernsprecher , 41 Covita 42 and Binder 43 and in holding that knowledge of publications in the Official Journal in cases such as this must be assumed and that an exception can be allowed only if the relevant language version is not available. 44 Contrary to Heuschen & Schrouff\u2019s arguments, those are not under any circumstances unduly onerous requirements. As from the date of publication of Regulation No 1196/97, a person liable for payment of duty in the situ- ation of Heuschen & Schrouff would, if acting with care, 45 have acquainted himself with that regulation and reported for appropriate clarification the doubts inevitably arising from it with regard to the previous classi- fication. The Court of First Instance then addressed Heuschen & Schrouff\u2019s argument that the conduct of the Netherlands customs authority should be taken into account here, and specifically its lack of care. The Court of First Instance rightly rejected that argu- ment. It should be reiterated in this regard that, as already observed by the Commis- sion, the conduct of the customs authorities is irrelevant at this point in the assessment. Heuschen & Schrouff is essentially claiming that the error made by the Netherlands customs authority, which has been estab- lished beyond dispute in this case and was acknowledged both by the Commission in its 41 \u2014 Case C-64/89 Deutsche Fernsprecher [1990] ECR I-2535. 42 \u2014 Already cited above in footnote 20. 43 \u2014 Case 161/88 Binder [1989] ECR 2415. 44 \u2014 See paragraph 75 et seq. of the judgment under appeal. 45 \u2014 Harings, already cited above (footnote 34 to this Opinion), p. 231, concludes from the case-law of the Court of Justice that the relevant yardstick here is the \u2018informed importer\u2019. This means a prudent trader carefully reading the Official Journal. By contrast, someone who has expert knowledge of customs law, and is therefore familiar with all the legislative provisions in that field of law and their combined effects, is unsuitable as a yardstick. For critical comments on this point, see Berr, \u2018Droit douanier\u2019, La semaine juridique \u2014 \u00e9dition entreprise 1990 II 15876, p. 589 et seq., p. 592. ",

It is also stated in that annex that \u2018[t]hese sheets are, after being soaked in water \u2026, generally used to make the \u201cwrappers\u201d for spring rolls and similar products\u2019. Legislation relating to the remission of import duties Article 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (OJ 1992 L 302, p. 1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 82/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 1996 (OJ 1997 L 17, p. 1), (\u2018the Customs Code\u2019) provides: \u20181. Under the conditions set out in Article 64(2) and subject to the provisions adopted within the framework of Article 243(2)(b), any person may appoint a representative in his dealings with the customs authorities to perform the acts and formalities laid down by customs rules. 6 7 8 ",

Duties shall be repaid or remitted for the reasons set out in paragraph 1 upon submission of an application to the appropriate customs office \u2026\u2019 Facts of the dispute as set out in the judgment under appeal H & S, established in the Netherlands, imports rice paper from Vietnam. For that purpose, it used the services of a customs agent, namely Switch Customs Brokers BV, which it designated as its direct representative within the terms of Article 5(2) of the Customs Code. H & S declared the rice paper which it imported under subheading 1901 90 99 of the CN. By letter of 21 March 1996, the Netherlands customs authorities (\u2018the customs authorities\u2019) informed the appellant that the rice paper in question actually had to be classified under that subheading. On 27 June 1997 the Commission adopted the Classification Regulation, which was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 28 June 1997 and entered into force on 19 July 1997. Notwithstanding the existence of that classification regulation, H & S continued to import rice paper under subheading 1901 90 99 of the CN and the customs author- ities accepted a further 29 declarations in six months (with documentary inspection and, in one case, physical inspection) under such a classification. On 16 March 1998, however, the customs authorities informed the appellant that the goods in ques- 10 11 12 13 ",
        "I - 8622 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-38/07 P tion should be classified, not under subheading 1901 90 99 of the CN, but under subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN. Later on the same day, the customs authorities nevertheless stated that a declaration classifying rice paper under subheading 1901 90 99 of the CN was correct. As from 17 March 1998, the appellant imported the rice paper by classifying it under subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN. By letter of 22 November 2000, the customs authorities informed H & S that, in respect of the period from 13 November 1997 to 31 December 1998, they would be effecting post-clearance recovery of import duties in the total amount of NLG 645 399.50 (EUR 292 869.52) on the ground that H & S had, during that period, classified the goods in question incorrectly inasmuch as subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN was that which was in accordance with the Classification Regulation. After adjustment, that amount was finally fixed at NLG 636 518.40, corresponding to the declarations lodged with the incorrect classification under subheading 1901 90 99 of the CN during the period from 25 November 1997 to 2 February 1998. Acceding to a request made by H & S to that end, the Kingdom of the Netherlands asked the Commission, on 13 September 2002, to decide, under Article 239 of the Customs Code, whether the remission of import duties for that company was justified. On 17 June 2004, the Commission adopted the contested decision. In that decision, it stated that there was a special situation within the meaning of Article 239 of the Customs Code. However, it took the view that H & S had displayed obvious negli- gence because, although it was an experienced trader and the Classification Regula- tion had dispelled the legislative complexity which may have existed previously, it had taken no steps to inform itself as to the correctness of the customs authorities\u2019 practice, which was manifestly contrary to that regulation. 14 15 16 ",
        "I - 8623 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING v COMMISSION Procedure before the Court of First Instance and the judgment under appeal By application lodged at the Registry of the Court of First Instance on 23 September 2004, H & S brought an action against the contested decision claiming, first, that that decision should be annulled in so far as it stated that the application for remission of duties was not justified and, secondly, that the Commission should be ordered to pay the costs. The Commission contended that the action should be dismissed and that the appellant should be ordered to pay the costs. In support of its action, H & S relied on three pleas alleging, first, infringement of Article 239 of the Customs Code, an incorrect assessment of the facts and failure to state reasons for the decision, secondly, infringement of the principles of sound administration and equal treatment and, thirdly, infringement of the principle of proportionality. By the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance dismissed H & S\u2019s action. By its first plea, H & S maintained, inter alia, that the legislation was complex on account of the fact that, unlike other language versions, the Dutch version of the CN did not contain an express reference to \u2018dried sheets of flour paste\u2019, with the result that, like the customs authorities which had, in the past, stated that those goods had to be classified under subheading 1901 90 99 of the CN, it could in good faith take the view that the rice sheets were covered by that subheading. Furthermore, H & S submitted that the Classification Regulation was contrary to the Dutch version of the CN and could not therefore be relied on against H & S. 17 18 19 20 ",
        "I - 8624 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-38/07 P H & S also claimed that it was not an experienced importer and that the professional experience of its customs agent could not be attributed to it. In that regard, it main- tained that possible negligence on the part of that customs agent, which had not acquainted itself with the Classification Regulation published in the Official Journal of the European Communities , could not be taken into account for the purpose of finding that there had been obvious negligence on the part of H & S. In that regard, after having first pointed out, in paragraph 43 of the judgment under appeal, that the case related exclusively to the question whether the Commission could reasonably have concluded that there had been obvious negligence on the part of H & S, the Court of First Instance ruled, in paragraph 44 of that judgment that, according to the case-law stemming from Case C-48/98 S\u00f6hl & S\u00f6hlke [1999] ECR I-7877, paragraph 56, for the purposes of determining whether or not there was obvious negligence, account had to be taken in particular of the complexity of the provisions non-compliance with which had resulted in the customs debt being incurred, and the professional experience of, and care taken by, the trader. Secondly, the Court of First Instance found, in paragraph 58 of the judgment under appeal, that the publication of the Classification Regulation had put an end to any possible legislative complexity created by the absence of certain words in the Dutch version of the wording of subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN. In paragraph 70 of that judgment, it held that the matters relating to the possible negligence of the customs agent, including its professional experience, had to be attributed to H & S. Lastly, in paragraph 75 of that judgment, the Court of First Instance pointed out that, where doubts exist as to the correct application of the provisions non-compliance with which may result in a customs debt being incurred, the onus is on the trader to make inquiries and to seek all possible clarification in order to ensure that he does not infringe those provisions. The Court of First Instance then concluded, in paragraph 87 of the judgment under appeal, that, by not asking the customs authorities for information about the reasons 21 22 23 24 ",
        "I - 8625 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING v COMMISSION for the discrepancy between its classification practice and the provisions of the Clas- sification Regulation, H & S and its customs agent had failed to display the care required by Article 239 of the Customs Code. In those circumstances, the Court of First Instance found, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, that H & S had not established that the Commission had infringed Article 239 of the Customs Code, incorrectly assessed the facts or failed to state reasons for the contested decision. The Court of First Instance accordingly rejected the first plea. By its second plea, H & S complained inter alia that the Commission had been overly strict, contrary to the principle of sound administration, in leaving out of account the errors of the customs authorities in its assessment of the care taken by the importer. In that regard, the Court of First Instance took the view, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the negligence on the part of the customs authorities had already been taken into account when it assessed whether a special situation existed, but that it could not, however, release H & S from the consequences of its own negligence. As regards the third plea, the Court of First Instance found, in paragraph 111 of the judgment under appeal, that where the conditions for applying Article 239 of the Customs Code are not satisfied, a refusal to remit duties does not constitute infringe- ment of the principle of proportionality. 25 26 27 28 ",
        "I - 8626 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-38/07 P The appeal By its appeal, H & S claims that the Court should set aside the judgment under appeal, annul the contested decision and order the Commission to pay the costs. The Commission contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal as unfounded and order H & S to pay the costs. H & S relies, in essence, on a single ground of appeal alleging that the Court of First Instance infringed Article 239 of the Customs Code in its assessment of the condi- tion relating to lack of obvious negligence on the part of the trader. That ground of appeal is divided into three parts corresponding to the three criteria derived from case-law in connection with such an assessment, namely the complexity of the legis- lation, the professional experience of the importer and the care taken by him. The Commission submits that the Court of First Instance was correct in its applica- tion of Article 239 of the Customs Code. Furthermore, although it maintains that it does not intend to raise an objection of inadmissibility, it states that H & S repeats, at times literally, the arguments which it submitted before the Court of First Instance. Admissibility According to settled case-law, it follows from Article 225 EC, the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice and Article 112(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice that an appeal must indicate precisely the contested 29 30 31 32 33 ",
        "I - 8627 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING v COMMISSION elements of the judgment which the appellant seeks to have set aside and also the legal arguments specifically advanced in support of the appeal (Case C-499/03 P Biegi Nahrungsmittel and Commonfood v Commission [2005] ECR I-1751, paragraph 37 and the case-law cited). An appeal which merely repeats or reproduces verbatim the pleas in law and argu- ments previously submitted to the Court of First Instance does not satisfy the require- ments to state reasons under those provisions (see, to that effect, Biegi Nahrungs\u00ad mittel and Commonfood v Commission , paragraph 38 and the case-law cited). However, provided that the appellant challenges the interpretation or application of Community law by the Court of First Instance, the points of law examined at first instance may be discussed again in the course of an appeal. Indeed, if an appellant could not thus base his appeal on pleas in law and arguments already relied on before the Court of First Instance, an appeal would be deprived of part of its purpose ( Biegi Nahrungsmittel and Commonfood v Commission , paragraph 39 and the case-law cited). In the present case, it must be stated that, although the appellant relies on argu- ments which it has already submitted in support of its action for annulment before the Court of First Instance, it none the less challenges the latter\u2019s interpretation of the criteria which must be met in order to satisfy the condition relating to absence of obvious negligence on the part of the importer, as provided for in Article 239 of the Customs Code. In those circumstances it is necessary to examine the present appeal. 34 35 36 37 ",
        "I - 8628 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-38/07 P The first part: the complexity of the legislation Arguments of the parties According to H & S, it has still not been established that rice paper must be classi- fied under subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN, as is borne out by the fact that the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden (Supreme Court of the Netherlands) has made a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling, which has been registered as Case C-375/07. That tends to reinforce the appellant\u2019s view that the legislation is complex, in particular on account of the drafting inadequacies of the Dutch version of the CN and the customs authorities\u2019 persistence in accepting an allegedly incorrect classification. Further- more, the appellant takes the view that, contrary to what was held by the Court of First Instance, the Classification Regulation could not dispel the ambiguity relating to the classification of the goods at issue because the classification effected by that regulation is contrary to the CN and to the case-law of the Court in Case C-12/94 Uelzena Milchwerke [1995] ECR I-2397. According to the Commission, the applicable legislation is not complex and, in any event, the Classification Regulation, the application of which is at issue in the present case, clarified the rules in force. In actual fact, H & S\u2019s arguments are focused on the issue of the complexity of the classification of rice paper. Such a line of argument, however, relates not to the procedure for the remission of duties, but to whether there is a customs debt or not, that is to say, to the action brought by H & S before the national courts challenging the classification by the customs authorities of those goods under subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN. Findings of the Court In order to assess whether there is obvious negligence within the meaning of Article 239 of the Customs Code, account must be taken in particular of the 38 39 40 ",
        "I - 8629 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING v COMMISSION complexity of the provisions non-compliance with which resulted in the customs debt being incurred, and the professional experience of, and care taken by, the trader (Case C-443/05 P Common Market Fertilizers v Commission [2007] ECR I-7209, paragraph 174 and the case-law cited). In that regard, there is strong evidence that the problem to be resolved is a complex one where, in view of the differences of opinion between the various Member States as regards the tariff classification of a product, it has been necessary to adopt a regulation which clarifies conclusively the tariff heading under which the product should be classified (see Case C-250/91 Hewlett Packard France [1993] ECR I-1819, paragraph 23). However, in the present case, it must be held that the remission of duties applied for by H & S related to import transactions which were specifically subsequent to the entry into force of the Classification Regulation. Although it is true that, as regards the classification of the goods in question, the wording of the Dutch version of subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN may have appeared less precise than that of other language versions, the fact remains that that classification regulation, which is directly applicable and binding in its entirety, explicitly and unequivocally describes the goods that have to be classified under that subheading and the goods imported by the appellant correspond thereto (see, to that effect, Case C-375/07 Heuschen & Schrouff Ori\u00ebntal Foods Trading [2008] ECR I-8689, paragraph 52). It follows that the Court of First Instance did not err in law when it found, in para- graph 58 of the judgment under appeal, that the publication of the Classification Regulation had put an end to any possible legislative complexity created by the absence of certain words in the wording of the Dutch version of heading 1905 of the CN and, more specifically, of subheading 1905 90 20. 41 42 43 ",
        "I - 8630 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-38/07 P Furthermore, that finding cannot be called into question by the fact that the Court took the view, in paragraph 20 of the judgment in Case C-64/89 Deutsche Fern\u00ad sprecher [1990] ECR I-2535, that in a case such as that there in issue, in which the trader had twice received confirmation that the erroneous view upon which the customs treatment was based was correct, the repetition of the error by the customs authority was evidence that the problem to be resolved was a complex one. In the case which gave rise to the judgment in Deutsche Fernsprecher , as is stated in paragraph 5 thereof, the applicant, doubting whether an exemption from customs duty which it had received was valid, asked the customs office to re-examine its case and then received confirmation from the director of that customs office of the exemption from customs duty. In the present case, it is common ground that H & S, after questioning the customs authorities on their practice, did not obtain any such confirmation at variance with the content of the Classification Regulation. H & S merely continued to make customs declarations, which were accepted until those authorities became aware that the classification was incorrect. It follows from the foregoing, as the Court of First Instance found in paragraph 58 of the judgment under appeal, that the tariff legislation at issue, in the Dutch version applicable to the facts of the case, was not particularly complex. Consequently, the first part of the ground of appeal must be rejected. The second part: the professional experience of the importer Arguments of the parties H & S submits that the Court of First Instance erred when it found that the profes- sional experience of its customs agent should be attributed to it. It states, first, that it 44 45 46 47 48 ",
        "I - 8631 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING v COMMISSION deals only with production and trade and thus in no way specialises in import transac- tions. Secondly, it argues, the interpretation of the Court of First Instance is contrary to the intention of the legislature inasmuch as an undertaking directly represented by an agent is thus less likely to receive remission of duties than a company which makes its own customs declarations. According to the Commission, the Court of First Instance was right to find that the professional experience of the customs agent should be attributed to the importing undertaking because, where there is direct representation, the declaration is made by the agent in the name of and on behalf of the importer. Furthermore, the Court of First Instance in any event found that the appellant was an experienced importer. Findings of the Court In order to assess the professional experience of an importer, which is taken into account with regard to the condition relating to the absence of obvious negligence within the meaning of Article 239 of the Customs Code, it is necessary to examine whether or not the operator is a trader whose business activities consist mainly in import and export transactions and whether he had already gained some experi- ence in the conduct of such transactions ( S\u00f6hl & S\u00f6hlke , paragraph 57, and Common Market Fertilizers v Commission , paragraph 188). However, Article 5(2) of the Customs Code makes provision for representation of an operator. Thus, representation of an operator for the performance of the acts and formalities laid down in the customs rules may be either direct, where the repre- sentative acts in the operator\u2019s name and on his behalf, or indirect, where the repre- sentative acts in his own name but on behalf of another person ( Common Market Fertilizers v Commission , paragraph 184). 49 50 51 ",
        "I - 8632 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-38/07 P In that regard, the Court has stated that an operator who uses a customs agent, whether for direct or indirect representation, is in any event the debtor in respect of the customs debt as far as the customs authorities are concerned and that he cannot avoid liability by relying on mistakes made by that agent (see Common Market Fer \u00ad tilizers v Commission , paragraphs 186 and 187). In the same way, an operator who uses the services of a customs agent cannot avoid post-clearance recovery of customs duties by relying on his inexperience with regard to customs formalities. Operators might in some cases be able to circumvent the condition relating to professional experience by using the services of customs special- ists as a matter of course and thus, contrary to what H & S submits, it would be operators carrying out their customs operations on their own who would be placed at a disadvantage with regard to the procedure set out in Article 239 of the Customs Code. Furthermore, as the appellant itself admits in paragraph 71 of its appeal, an operator who is represented unquestionably benefits from the professional experi- ence of his customs agent. It follows that the Court of First Instance did not err in law in finding, in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal, that, in so far as the agent acted in the name of and on behalf of the importer, the information concerning possible negligence on the part of the agent, including the level of its professional experience, had to be taken into account for the purposes of assessing the negligence of that importer. With regard to the appellant\u2019s argument seeking to call into question the Court of First Instance\u2019s finding, in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, that the appellant itself had some experience in importing, it must be borne in mind that an appraisal of facts does not, save where the clear sense of the evidence before the Court of First Instance has been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (see Biegi Nahrungsmittel and Commonfood v Commission , paragraph 40). 52 53 54 55 ",
        "I - 8633 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING v COMMISSION That argument must accordingly be rejected as inadmissible. Having regard to the foregoing, the second part of the ground of appeal must also be rejected. The third part: the care taken by the importer Arguments of the parties H & S submits that the Court of First Instance infringed Article 239 of the Customs Code by requiring that the care taken by an importer should extend to disputing the tariff classification applied by its customs authorities. In the present case, that company saw no reason to proceed in this way since, first, the classification of \u2018unbaked\u2019 goods under subheading 1901 90 99 appeared to it to comply with the CN and, secondly, the Classification Regulation could relate only to \u2018baked\u2019 goods. Furthermore, the appellant takes the view that operators cannot be required to acquaint themselves with the applicable provisions in the different language versions published in the Official Journal of the European Communities . In continuing to make its customs declarations under subheading 1901 90 99 \u2014 declarations which were accepted by the customs authorities \u2014 it therefore acted with the necessary care. Furthermore, if there was any negligence, such negligence would have been committed by its customs agent and could not be attributed to H & S. Lastly, H & S submits that, even if it had been negligent, such negligence would have been minimal when compared with the negligence of the customs authorities. The Commission maintains that the Court of First Instance did not err in law in its application of the criterion relating to the care to be taken by the importer. It points out that, according to the case-law, where doubts exist as to the correct appli- cation of the provisions non-compliance with which may result in a customs debt 56 57 58 59 ",
        "I - 8634 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-38/07 P being incurred, the onus is on the trader to make inquiries and to seek all possible clarification in order to ensure that he does not infringe those provisions. It is common ground that neither H & S nor its customs agent acquainted itself with the Classification Regulation published in the Official Journal of the European Commu\u00ad nities , which in itself constitutes negligence. A fortiori, they were unable to question the customs authorities as to the tariff heading which should have been used in order to apply the CN correctly. Findings of the Court It must be borne in mind at the outset that repayment or remission of import and export duties, which may be made only under certain conditions and in cases specifi- cally provided for, constitutes an exception to the normal import and export pro - cedure and, consequently, the provisions which provide for such repayment or remis- sion must be interpreted strictly. Since a lack of \u2018obvious negligence\u2019 is an essential condition of being able to claim repayment or remission of import or export duties, it follows that that term must be interpreted in such a way that the number of cases of repayment or remission remains limited ( S\u00f6hl & S\u00f6hlke , paragraph 52). It is mandatory that the Community provisions applicable to customs tariffs be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities . As from their date of publication, they constitute the sole relevant positive law and everyone is deemed to be aware of that law (see Case 161/88 Binder [1989] ECR 2415, paragraph 19). As was stated in paragraph 42 of this judgment, the Classification Regulation, including the Dutch version thereof, which was duly published in the Official Journal of the European Communities , and which was consequently directly applicable and binding in its entirety, explicitly and unequivocally describes the goods that have to 60 61 62 ",
        "I - 8635 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING v COMMISSION be classified under subheading 1905 90 20 and the goods imported by H & S corres- pond thereto. It follows that the appellant cannot claim that it could, in good faith, take the view that that regulation did not concern the goods that it imported, in this case unbaked goods. As regards the errors on the part of the customs authorities, which reinforced the appellant in its choice of subheading 1901 90 99 of the CN for its import transac- tions, it must be pointed out that a careful operator, who has acquainted himself with a classification regulation published in the Official Journal of the European Communities such as that at issue in the present case, cannot simply continue to import his goods under a CN heading on the sole ground that that classification has been accepted by those authorities. To allow such negligence would be tantamount to encouraging operators to benefit from the errors of their customs authorities. Furthermore, as the Court of First Instance correctly stated in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the error on the part of the customs authorities, which had already been taken into account in the present case in the examination as to whether a special situation existed, cannot, as a rule, release an operator from the conse- quences of its own negligence. In any event, it must be pointed out that, in circumstances such as those of the appel- lant, an operator retains the possibility of challenging the existence of the customs debt, if necessary by claiming that the classification regulation is unlawful, as indeed H & S proceeded to do before the national court, which made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling, that case giving rise to the judgment in Case C-375/07 Heuschen & Schrouff Ori\u00ebntal Foods Trading . 63 64 65 66 ",
        "I - 8636 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-38/07 P Having regard to what was stated in paragraph 52 of this judgment, H & S\u2019s line of argument seeking to dispute the possibility of having the negligence of its customs agent attributed to it cannot succeed. It follows that the third part of the ground of appeal must also be rejected. As all three parts of the single ground of appeal relied on by H & S have been rejected, the appeal must be dismissed. Costs Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, which applies to appeal proceed- ings pursuant to Article 118 of those rules, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party\u2019s pleadings.

To come within the prohibition laid down in Article 81(1) EC, an agreement must have \u2018as [its] object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market\u2019. The alternative nature of that require- ment, indicated by the conjunction \u2018or\u2019, leads, first, to the need to consider the precise purpose of the agreement, in the economic context in which it is to be applied. In deciding whether an agreement is prohibited by Article 81(1) EC, there is therefore no need to take account of its actual effects once it appears that its object is to prevent, restrict or distort competition within the common market. Where, however, an analysis of the clauses of that agreement does not reveal the effect on competition to be sufficiently deleterious, its conse- quences should then be considered and for it to be caught by the prohibition it is necessary to find that those factors are present which show that competition has in fact been prevented or restricted or distorted to an appreciable extent. The distinction between \u2018infringements by object\u2019 and \u2018infringements by effect\u2019 arises from the fact that certain forms of collusion between undertakings can be regarded, by their very nature, as being injurious to the proper functioning of normal competition. (see paras 15-17) 2. To determine whether an agreement comes within the prohibition laid down in Article 81(1) EC, close regard must be paid to the wording of its provisions and to the objectives which it is intended to ",
        "I - 8639 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS attain. In that regard, even supposing it to be established that the parties to an agreement acted without any subjective intention of restricting competition, but with the object of remedying the effects of a crisis in their sector, such consid- erations are irrelevant for the purposes of applying that provision. Indeed, an agreement may be regarded as having a restrictive object even if it does not have the restriction of competition as its sole aim but also pursues other legitimate objectives. The argument that the purpose of an agreement between competing under- takings is not adversely to affect compe- tition or the welfare of consumers, but to rationalise an industrial sector in order to make it more competitive by reducing, but not eliminating production overcapacity cannot be accepted. It is only in connection with Article 81(3) EC that such considerations may, if appro- priate, be examined for the purposes of obtaining an exemption from the pro - hibition laid down in Article 81(1) EC. (see paras 19-21) 3. The types of agreements covered by Article 81(1)(a) to (e) EC do not consti- tute an exhaustive list of prohibited collusion. (see para. 23) 4. Arrangements intended, essentially, to enable several competing undertakings to implement a common policy which has as its object the changing, appreciably, of the structure of the market through a mechanism intended to encourage some of them to withdraw from the market and the reduction, as a consequence, of the overcapacity which affects their profitability by preventing them from achieving economies of scale, conflict patently with the concept inherent in the Treaty provisions relating to competi- tion, according to which each economic operator must determine independently the policy which it intends to adopt on the common market. Article 81(1) EC is intended to prohibit any form of co- ordination which deliberately substitutes practical cooperation between undertak- ings for the risks of competition. In the context of competition, the undertakings which signed such arrangements would have, without such arrangements, no means of improving their profitability ",
        "I - 8640 SUMMARY \u2014 CASE C-209/07 other than by intensifying their commer- cial rivalry or resorting to concentra- tions. With those arrangements it would be possible for them to avoid such a process and to share a large part of the costs involved in increasing the degree of market concentration. As regards the implementation of such arrangements, the imposition of a levy paid to the goers by the undertakings staying on the market constitutes an obstacle to the natural development of market shares as regards some of the stayers deterred from exceeding their usual volume of production, or even encouraged to freeze their produc- tion, and a restriction whose object is anti-competitive. That is also the case of restrictions imposed on the goers as regards the disposal and use of their processing plants, since such restric- tions seek to avoid the possible use of those plants by new operators entering the market in order to compete with the stayers. The fact that those restrictions, as well as the non-competition clause imposed on the goers, are limited in time is not such as to put in doubt the finding as to the anti-competitive nature of their object. In the beef and veal processing sector, an agreement with such features concluded between a Member State\u2019s 10 principal competing undertakings and requiring, among other things, a reduction of the order of 25% in processing capacity, has as its object the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the meaning of Article 81(1) EC.

        "I - 8643 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS I \u2014 Introduction 1. This reference for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of the notion of restriction of competition by object contained in Article 81(1) EC. The economic background is the overcapacity noted by the referring court in the Irish beef processing industry (\u2018the processing industry\u2019). The processing industry purchases cattle from breeders, slaughters and de-bones them, and then sells the beef in Ireland and abroad. The processors wish to reduce the overcapacity through agreed arrangements. 2. With the question it has referred for a preliminary ruling, the national court is seeking to ascertain whether the notion of restriction of competition by object contained in Article 81(1) EC is to be inter- preted as covering the processors\u2019 arrange- ments. The question is thus limited in two respects. First of all, it relates only to arrange- ments which have as their object the restric- tion of competition, but not those which have as their effect the restriction of compe- tition. Secondly, it merely asks whether the arrangements come under the fundamental prohibition of agreements restricting compe- tition contained in Article 81(1) EC; it is not to be examined whether the arrangements may nevertheless be compatible with the common market under Article 81(3) EC on account of their positive effects. II \u2014 Legal framework 3. Article 81(1) EC provides that all agree- ments between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market, and in particular those which: (a) directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions; (b) limit or control production, markets, technical development, or investment; (c) share markets or sources of supply; (d) apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, ",
        "I - 8644 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-209/07 thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage; (e) make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commer- cial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts; are prohibited as incompatible with the common market. 4. Under Article 81(3) EC, the provisions of Article 81(1) EC may, however, be declared inapplicable in the case of \u2014 any agreement or category of agree- ments between undertakings, \u2014 any decision or category of decisions by associations of undertakings, \u2014 any concerted practice or category of concerted practices, which contributes to improving the produc- tion or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit, and which does not: (a) impose on the undertakings concerned restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment of these objectives; (b) afford such undertakings the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the products in question. 5. Article 1(1) and (2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competi- tion laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty 2 provides: 2 \u2014 OJ 2003 L 1, p. 1.

        "I - 8645 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS \u20181. Agreements, decisions and concerted practices caught by Article 81(1) of the Treaty which do not satisfy the conditions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty shall be prohib- ited, no prior decision to that effect being required. 2. Agreements, decisions and concerted practices caught by Article 81(1) of the Treaty which satisfy the conditions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty shall not be prohibited, no prior decision to that effect being required.\u2019 III \u2014 Facts, main proceedings and ques- tion referred for a preliminary ruling A \u2014 Facts of the case 6. The overcapacity which exists in the Irish processing industry according to the order for reference can be explained in particular by the following reasons. In the past the construction and upgrading of processing plants were heavily supported irrespective of actual demand for beef. Furthermore, the quantity of beef to be processed was formerly subject to extreme seasonal variation. This meant that a high processing volume had to be handled at seasonal peaks. Cattle breeding has now been deseasonalised. Seasonal fluc- tuations do still occur to a certain extent. However, the total capacity of processing plants now exceeds the processing volume by around 32% even at seasonal peaks. 7. Because the beef sector plays an import- ant role in the Irish national economy, the Irish Government and representatives of the processing industry commissioned a firm of economic consultants to conduct a market study. The objective of the market study was to identify initiatives that would maximise the long-term profitability of all players in the Irish beef sector. 8. The market study, which was published in 1998, found that there was high overcapacity in the processing industry and forecasted that the overcapacity would lead to a decline in the profitability of the processing industry as a whole. That forecast was essentially based on the following consideration: a pro - cessor\u2019s profit is determined by the margin between the purchase price for the cattle and the processing costs, on the one hand, and ",
        "I - 8646 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-209/07 the selling price for the beef, on the other. A processor\u2019s profit level depends in particular on capacity utilisation in the processing plant and on overcapacity. Where there is higher utilisation of capacity, economies of scale are achieved, reducing processing costs. Over- capacity stimulates competition between processors in the sale of beef, resulting in falling prices. The study also forecasts that over time the falling profitability of processors will lead to players in the processing sector leaving the market. 9. The market study proposes the solution of reducing the number of processors in the processing industry. A compensation system would offer incentives to exit the market. The market study emphasised the cost bene- fits for the processing industry as a whole, which it estimated at IEP 18 million; accom- panying efficiency measures could result in cost benefits of a further IEP 14 million. 10. A Beef Task Force, established by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, delivered a report in 1999. That report acknowledged the findings of the market study and called on the processing industry to implement the study. 11. In 2002 processors formed the Beef Industry Development Society Ltd (BIDS). The present members of BIDS produce about 93% of the beef sold in Ireland. The object of BIDS is to implement the market study produced by the firm of economic consult- ants and the report delivered by the Beef Task Force. To that end BIDS formulated an arrangement (\u2018the BIDS arrangement\u2019). The aim of the BIDS arrangement is to reduce the total capacity of the processing industry by 25% within one year. For that purpose the BIDS arrangement provides as follows. 12. Some of the processors which are members of BIDS (\u2018goers\u2019) are to enter into agreements with BIDS in which they under- take to leave the processing industry, to decommission their processing plants and to respect a two-year non-compete clause (\u2018exit agreements\u2019). The exit agreements are also to include the obligations not to use land associated with the decommissioned plants for the purposes of beef processing for a period of five years (\u2018restriction on use\u2019) and to sell the equipment used for primary beef processing to processors in Ireland only for use as back-up equipment or spare parts, or otherwise only outside Ireland (\u2018restriction on disposal\u2019). It is not possible to decommis- sion individual processing plants of a pro - cessor. BIDS has already concluded an exit ",
        "I - 8647 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS agreement with the processor Barry Brothers (Carrigmore) Meats Ltd (\u2018Barry Brothers\u2019). 13. In return, goers are to be compen- sated by BIDS. Internally, the compensation payments are to be financed by the members of BIDS which stay in the processing industry (\u2018stayers\u2019). 14. Payments of the levies are staged. If the stayers do not exceed their trad- itional percentage kill, a levy of EUR 2 per head is incurred; if they exceed their trad- itional percentage kill, the levy rises to EUR 11 per head for each animal above the traditional percentage kill. The traditional percentage kill is based on a processor\u2019s average percentage kill in the last three years prior to the implementation of the BIDS arrangement. B \u2014 The procedure before the Irish Compe\u00ad tition Authority and the main proceedings before the courts 15. While the BIDS arrangement was being drafted, BIDS sought to reach agree- ment with the Irish Competition Authority (\u2018the Competition Authority\u2019). On 5 and 26 June 2003 the Competition Authority informed BIDS that it did not consider the BIDS arrangement and the exit agreement with Barry Brothers (hereinafter the BIDS arrangement and the exit agreement with Barry Brothers will be jointly referred to as \u2018the BIDS agreements\u2019) to be compatible with Irish competition law. On 30 June 2003 the Competition Authority made an application to the Irish High Court (\u2018the High Court\u2019) for a declaration that the BIDS agreements infringed Article 81 EC. 16. By judgment of 27 July 2006, the High Court dismissed the Competition Author- ity\u2019s application. It held that the BIDS agree- ments did not fall under the prohibition contained in Article 81(1) EC. The BIDS agreements did not have as their object the restriction of competition since they were not aimed at fixing prices, sharing customers, or limiting production for the purposes of Article 81(1)(a) to (c) EC. The reduction of the total capacity was not to be regarded as a limitation of production. Furthermore, the BIDS arrangements did not have as their effect the restriction of competition. A 25% reduction of total capacity might restrict competition only if it led to a capacity shortage which caused rising prices. Because overall beef production in Ireland will not increase in future, but will tend to decline, even if total capacity were reduced by 25% it would be ensured that all beef would be pro - cessed. In addition, prices were not expected to increase. The levies would increase the processing costs incurred by processors. ",
        "I - 8648 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-209/07 However, a price increase could be ruled out, in particular because the reduction of total capacity would result in economies of scale among stayers and the processors\u2019 customers would have a strong negotiating power. 17. The restrictions on use and disposal were not a restriction of competition either. Under the present market conditions, it is not economically feasible to construct new processing plants. However, poten- tial competitors could enter the market by purchasing other processing plants (from stayers or non-members of BIDS). 18. Consequently, the BIDS agreements were not objectionable in such a way that they could be regarded as a restriction of competition by object. 19. The High Court also took the view that the conditions laid down in Article 81(3) were not satisfied. BIDS had not shown that consumers would receive a fair share of the benefit. However, Article 81(3) EC is not relevant because the fundamental prohib- ition contained in Article 81(1) EC is not satisfied. 20. The Competition Authority has chal- lenged the High Court\u2019s decision before the Irish Supreme Court (\u2018the Supreme Court\u2019). C \u2014 The question referred for a preliminary ruling 21. The Supreme Court takes the view that the case raises a question of interpretation regarding Article 81(1) EC which is relevant to its decision in the main proceedings. It has therefore referred the following question to the Court of Justice pursuant to Article 234 EC: \u2018Where it is established to the satisfaction of the court that (a) there is overcapacity in the industry for the processing of beef which, calculated at peak throughput, would be approxi- mately 32%, ",
        "I - 8649 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS (b) the effect of this excess capacity will have very serious consequences for the profit- ability of the industry as a whole over the medium term, (c) while \u2026 the effects of surplus require- ments have not been felt to any signifi- cant degree as yet, independent consult- ants have advised that, in the near term, the overcapacity is unlikely to be elim- inated by normal market measures, but over time the overcapacity will lead to very significant losses and ultimately to processors and plants leaving the industry, (d) processors of beef representing approxi- mately 93% of the market for the supply of beef of that industry have agreed to take steps to eliminate the overcapacity and are willing to pay a levy in order to fund payments to processors willing to cease production, and the said processors, comprising 10 companies, form a corporate body, (\u201cthe society\u201d) 3 for the purpose of 3 \u2014 BIDS. implementing an arrangement with the following features: 1. plants \u2026 4 killing and processing 420 000 animals per annum, repre- senting approximately 25% of active capacity would enter into an agreement with the remaining companies \u2026 5 to leave the industry and to abide by the following terms; 2. goers would sign a two year non- compete clause in relation to the processing of cattle on the entire island of Ireland; 3. the plants of goers would be decommissioned; 4. land associated with the decom- missioned plants would not be used for the purposes of beef processing for a period of five years; 4 \u2014 The addition \u2018(called \u201cgoers\u201d)\u2019 has been omitted. 5 \u2014 The addition \u2018(called \u201cstayers\u201d)\u2019 has been omitted.

The order for reference was lodged at the Court of Justice on 20 April 2007. In the written procedure, BIDS, the Competition Authority, the Belgian Government and the Commission submitted observations. At the hearing of 4 June 2008, the Competi- tion Authority, BIDS and the Commission supplemented their submissions. V \u2014 Arguments of the parties 23. BIDS, the Competition Authority, the Kingdom of Belgium and the Commission agree on the following points: Article 81(1) EC draws a distinction between restrictions ",
        "I - 8651 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS of competition by object and by effect. In the case of restrictions of competition by object, there is no need to prove any effect. In exam- ining whether there is a restriction of compe- tition by object, regard must be had not only to the content of the agreement, but also to the legal and economic context. 24. The parties do not agree on the ques- tion of when a restriction of competition by object can be taken to exist and whether the BIDS agreements come under that definition, BIDS taking the view that the BIDS agree- ments are not a restriction of competition by object, whilst the Competition Authority, the Kingdom of Belgium and the Commission take the opposite view. 25. BIDS equates restrictions of competi- tion by object with hard-core restrictions and agreements which restrict competition per se. This category of agreements is to be construed narrowly, in the view of BIDS, and encompasses only a limited number of serious restrictions of competition such as price-fixing agreements and agree- ments to limit output or to share markets or customers. A restriction of competition by object exists only in the case of such obvious and damaging agreements. 26. BIDS takes the view that the BIDS agree- ments do not constitute a restriction of competition by object. In view of the legal and economic context of the BIDS agreements it is clear that they do not fall in the category of restrictions of competition by object. In this connection BIDS relies in particular on the findings of the High Court that total market output will not be reduced and prices will not be increased. According to the judgment in GlaxoSmithKline Services v Commission , 6 such circumstances should be taken into account. Furthermore, the stayers\u2019 freedom regarding their production quotas, market shares and prices is not restricted. It must also be taken into consideration that the BIDS agreements have the legitimate ob- jective of eliminating overcapacity. The levies, the non-compete clause and the restrictions on use and disposal are necessary measures for achieving that aim. Furthermore, BIDS had not negotiated in secret. 27. In the view of BIDS, bearing these circumstances in mind, the BIDS agreements are not so obvious or so anti-competitive that they may be classified in the category of restrictions of competition by object. 28. In the view of the Competition Authority , a restriction of competition by object 6 \u2014 Case T-168/01 [2006] ECR II-2969. ",
        "I - 8652 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-209/07 exists where there are obvious restrictions of competition or hard-core restrictions. However, there is no definitive list of obvious restrictions of competition or hard-core restrictions. It is not necessary to establish the aims of the parties. No inferences can be drawn from the judgment in GlaxoSmith\u00ad Kline Services v Commission 7 for the present case. 29. It is clear from the content of the BIDS agreements that they have as their object the restriction of competition. The Compe- tition Authority refers in this connection to the planned withdrawal of processors, representing around 25% of total capacity, from the processing industry. In its view, this constitutes a limitation of output, or at least a limitation of capacity which also restricts competition. The Competition Authority also refers to the higher prices as a result of the levies, the restrictions on use and disposal for goers, and the fact that the stayers are not necessarily the most efficient processors. These elements of the BIDS agreements are in its view also to be regarded as restrictions of competition by object. 30. The positive effects of the BIDS agree- ments are to be taken into account in the context of Article 81(3) EC. 7 \u2014 Cited in footnote 6. 31. In connection with the interpretation of the notion of restriction of competition by object, the Kingdom of Belgium relies on the scheme of Article 81 EC. Against the back- ground of the fact that since the entry into force of Regulation No 1/2003 it has been the responsibility of undertakings to assess agreements themselves, it is appropriate to stress the distinction between Article 81(1) EC and Article 81(3) EC. In an examination under Article 81(1) EC it is only examined whether a restriction of competition exists. This must be distinguished from the ques- tion whether an agreement which comes under the fundamental prohibition laid down in Article 81(1) EC may be compatible with the common market under Article 81(3) EC. 32. In the view of the Kingdom of Belgium, an agreement which is intended to ration- alise the processing industry and seeks to achieve this through the withdrawal of pro - cessors representing 25% of total capacity aims to influence the market conditions. The BIDS agreements are therefore a restriction of competition by object. 33. The Commission observes that in the earlier cases concerning the concept of restriction of competition by object the Community judicature examined cases which related to hard-core restrictions. However, since then the Community judi- cature has also regarded agreements which have a legitimate objective as restrictions of competition by object. Pursuit of a legitimate ",
        "I - 8653 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS objective does not therefore preclude the existence of a restriction of competition by object. Article 81(1) EC thus also applies to agreements which are aimed at addressing a crisis. Any different view is not compatible with the scheme of Article 81. Furthermore, the restriction of competition does not have to be obvious. Nor is it relevant whether the BIDS agreements were negotiated and concluded in secret or publicly. 34. With regard to the assessment of the BIDS agreements the Commission essentially shares the view taken by the Competition Authority. VI \u2014 Legal assessment 35. Since the parties have a different under- standing of the notion of restriction of competition by object, I will examine this first (A) before I consider whether agree- ments like the BIDS agreements have as their object the restriction of competi- tion (B). I will then examine how the indi- vidual elements of those agreements are to be assessed with regard to the category in Article 81(1)(b) EC and the general clause in Article 81(1) EC (C). A \u2014 Notion of restriction of competition by object 36. As I mentioned in the introduction, the question referred concerns only the inter- pretation of the notion of restriction of compe- tition by object contained in Article 81(1) EC. However, that notion cannot be inter- preted without taking account of its legal context. I will therefore begin by examining the content, the scheme and the applica- tion of Article 81 EC (1) and then consider the meaning of restriction of competition by object (2). 1. Content, scheme and application of Article 81 EC (a) Scheme of Article 81 EC 37. Under Article 81(1) EC, all agreements between undertakings which have as their object or effect an appreciable restriction ",
        "I - 8654 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-209/07 of competition are prohibited in principle. 8 Having the restriction of competition as an object or as an effect are two alternative criteria. 9 If it is clear that an agreement has as its object the restriction of competition, it does not matter whether it actually has as its effect the restriction of competition. 10 It is thus sufficient for the purposes of the fundamental prohibition under Article 81(1) EC that an agreement has as its object the restriction of competition. 38. The fundamental prohibition in Article 81(1) EC may be declared inapplic- able, however, under Article 81(3) EC. To that end it is necessary to satisfy four cumula- tive conditions which include, first of all, that the agreement helps to produce a benefit by contributing to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting tech- nical or economic progress and, secondly, that consumers are allowed a fair share of that benefit. Other conditions are, thirdly, that no restrictions may be imposed on the undertakings concerned which are not indis- pensable to the attainment of these object- ives and, fourthly, that such undertakings may not be afforded the possibility of elim- inating competition in respect of a substantial part of the products in question. 8 \u2014 See the full wording of Article 81(1) EC in point 3 of this Opinion. 9 \u2014 Case 56/65 LTM [1966] ECR 235, 249. 10 \u2014 LTM (cited in footnote 9, p. 249), and Joined Cases 56/64 and 58/64 Consten and Grundig v Commission [1966] ECR 299, 342. 39. Article 81 EC thus provides for a two\u00ad stage examination . An agreement is compat- ible with the common market if either it does not come under the fundamental prohib- ition laid down in Article 81(1) EC or it does come under that prohibition, but satisfies the conditions in Article 81(3) EC. The finding that an agreement has as its object the restric- tion of competition and thus comes under the fundamental prohibition under Article 81(1) EC is not therefore the last word on whether that agreement is compatible with the common market. Account must be taken of this distinction between Article 81(1) EC and Article 81(3) EC in examining when a restric- tion of competition by object exists for the purposes of Article 81(1) EC. (b) Application of Article 81 EC 40. Before 1 May 2004 the distinction between Article 81(1) EC and Article 81(3) EC played an important procedural role. Under Article 4(1) of Council Regulation No 17 of 6 February 1962 implementing Articles 85 (now Article 81 EC) and 86 (now Article 82 EC) of the Treaty, 11 a system of prohibition with exemptions applied. An agreement which came under the funda- mental prohibition laid down in Article 81(1) EC and was not covered by a block-exemp- tion regulation had to be notified to the Commission. The Commission alone could 11 \u2014 OJ, English Special Edition: Series I, 1959-1962, p. 87. ",
        "I - 8655 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS exempt such an agreement from the funda- mental prohibition under Article 81(1) EC. 41. With the entry into force of Regulation No 1/2003, 12 that system was replaced by a system of self-assessment. Agreements which come under the fundamental prohibition under Article 81(1) EC but satisfy the condi- tions of Article 81(3) EC are not prohibited, no prior decision by the Commission to that effect being required. 13 In principle it is now for the undertakings concerned \u2014 if neces- sary with the assistance of a legal advisor \u2014 to examine whether the conditions under Article 81(1) EC and Article 81(3) EC are satisfied. 14 2. Restriction of competition by object 42. The object of the agreement must be a restriction of competition . That criterion is 12 \u2014 Regulation No 1/2003 entered into force on 1 May 2004. 13 \u2014 Article 1(1) and (2) of Regulation No 1/2003. 14 \u2014 The two-stage structure of the examination under Article 81 EC plays a role, however, in the allocation of the burden of proof. Under Article 2 of Regulation No 1/2003 the party or the authority relying on the fundamental prohibition under Article 81(1) EC bears the burden of proving that its condi- tions are fulfilled, whilst the party claiming the inapplic- ability of that fundamental prohibition must prove that the conditions of Article 81(3) EC are fulfilled. difficult to grasp. 15 Article 81 EC protects competition in particular in regard to its function of forming a single market with conditions akin to an internal market and its function of supplying consumers as well as possible. 16 In examining whether an agreement encroaches upon that projected interest, the Community judicature considers whether the agreement limits the freedom of one or more undertakings to determine their policy on the market independently (requirement of independence) and whether that limitation of freedom has an appreciable effect on market conditions. 17 43. The Community judicature has consist- ently held that, in order to assess whether an agreement has as its object the restriction of competition, regard must be had to the content of the agreement in the light of its legal and economic context. 18 I will consider, first of all, the criterion on the basis of which it is to be assessed whether an agreement has as its object the restriction of competition 15 \u2014 With regard to the notion of restriction of competition, see Bellamy & Child, European Community Law of Competi\u00ad tion , Oxford, 6th edition, 2008, No 2.062 to 2.120; Wish, R., Competition Law , London, 5th edition, 2003, pp. 106 to 128; Faull, J., and Nikpay, A., The EC Law of Competition , Oxford, 1999, paragraphs 2.56 to 2.99. 16 \u2014 Case 26/76 Metro SB\u00adGro\u00dfm\u00e4rkte v Commission [1977] ECR 1875, paragraph 20; Case C-49/92 P Commission v Anic Partecipazioni [1999] ECR I-4125, paragraph 117; and Case C-238/05 Asnef\u00adEquifax and Administraci\u00f3n del Estado [2006] ECR I-11125, paragraph 52; with regard to the aspect of consumer welfare in particular, see Leupold, H., and Weidenbach, G., \u2018Neues zum Verh\u00e4ltnis zwischen Art. 81 Abs. 1 und Art. 81 Abs. 3 EG-Vertrag?\u2019, Wirtschaft und Wettbewerb , 2006, pp. 1003 and 1008, footnote 28 with further references. 17 \u2014 Commission v Anic Partecipazioni (cited in footnote 16, paragraph 117), and Asnef\u00adEquifax and Administraci\u00f3n del Estado (cited in footnote 16, paragraph 52).

        "I - 8656 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-209/07 (a). I will then examine whether the notion is limited to obvious restrictions of compe- tition (b) and whether there is a definite list of restrictions of competition by object (c). Lastly, I will explain which elements of the legal and economic context may be relevant to the existence of a restriction of competi- tion and which are not (d). (a) Relevant criterion 44. From its wording it is clear that the notion of restriction of competition by object refers primarily to the object of the agree- ment. The Community judicature has found an anti-competitive aim or tendency of an agreement to exist in particular where the necessary consequence of the agreement was the restriction of competition. 19 In such a case in principle the parties may not argue that they did not intend any restriction of competition or that their agreement also pursued a different aim. 20 19 \u2014 Case 19/77 Miller International Schallplatten v Commission [1978] ECR 131, paragraph 7, and CRAM and Rheinzink v Commission (cited in footnote 18, paragraphs 25 to 28). 20 \u2014 Joined Cases 96/82 to 102/82, 104/82, 105/82, 108/82 and 110/82 IAZ International Belgium and Others v Commission [1983] ECR 3369, paragraph 24; Miller International Schall\u00ad platten v Commission (cited in footnote 19, paragraph 7); and CRAM and Rheinzink v Commission (cited in foot- note 18, paragraphs 25 to 28). 45. However, it is not to be inferred from that case-law that the intentions of the parties cannot be taken into account. It merely expresses the idea that when acting rationally undertakings will expect the agree- ment to have the effects which can reason- ably be assumed according to the circum- stances, with the result that they intended those effects at least to some extent. 21 46. It follows from the alternative relation- ship between the object and the effect of restrictions of competition in Article 81(1) EC 22 and from the fact that Article 81(1) EC, as regards the alternative of restriction of competition by object, is designed as a form of inchoate offence 23 that regard is to be had not solely to the necessary consequences of an agreement. The intentions of the parties to an agreement may also be taken into account. 24 Inferences as to the intentions of 21 \u2014 As Advocate General Tizzano rightly states in point 77 of his Opinion in Case C-551/03 P General Motors v Commis\u00ad sion [2006] ECR I-3173, parties also cannot rely on the fact that they were not aware of the prohibition in Article 81(1) EC (ignorantia legis non excusat) .

",
        "I - 8657 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS the parties can be drawn in particular from the \u2018genesis\u2019 of the agreement. 25 (b) Obvious restrictions of competition? 47. In the light of the foregoing, it is clear that the category of restrictions of competi- tion by object cannot be reduced to agree- ments which obviously restrict competition. If not only the content of an agreement but also its legal and economic context must be taken into account, classification as a restric- tion of competition by object cannot depend on whether that object is clear at first sight or becomes evident only on closer examin - ation of the circumstances and the intentions of the parties. 26 25 \u2014 Point 78 of the Opinion of Advocate General Tizzano (cited in footnote 24). 26 \u2014 See paragraph 24 of the judgment in IAZ International Belgium and Others v Commission (cited in footnote 20), in which the Court looked at the system of checks involving the use of conformity labels. It can also be seen from para- graphs 60, 64 and 65 of the judgment in General Motors v Commission (cited in footnote 21) that the restriction does not have to be obvious. The same conclusion follows from paragraph 136 of the judgment in Joined Cases T-374/94, T-375/94, T-384/94 and T-388/94 European Night Ser \u00ad vices and Others v Commission [1998] ECR II-3141. In so far as the Court of First Instance held in that judgment that in the case of obvious restrictions such as price-fixing, market-sharing or the control of outlets there is no need to examine the legal and economic context, this merely shows that consideration of the legal and economic context may be summary. However, it cannot be inferred from this that the notion of restriction of competition by object is limited to such obvious cases. (c) Exhaustive list? 48. In my view, the notion of restriction of competition by object cannot be reduced to an exhaustive list either. The words \u2018in particular\u2019 in Article 81(1) EC make clear that the restrictions of competition covered by Article 81(1) EC are not limited to the restrictions of competition mentioned in Article 81(1)(a) to (e) EC. Therefore, the notion of restriction of competition by object cannot be limited to the examples cited in Article 81(1)(a) to (c) EC either. 27 49. Nor can the notion of restriction of competition by object be reduced to price- fixing, market-sharing or the control of outlets. The fact that the Community judica- ture has dealt with these types of restrictions of competition in many decisions does not mean that agreements with another purpose 27 \u2014 See also Aicher, J., and Schuhmacher, F., in: Grabitz/ Hilf, Das Recht der Europ\u00e4ischen Union , Vol. 2, Munich, Supplement 34, January 2008, Article 81, paragraph 1; Bellamy & Child, loc. cit. (footnote 15), footnote 402 at paragraph 2.097, where it is rightly pointed out that other agreements can also have as their object the restriction of competition. Also in Wish, R., loc. cit. (footnote 15), p. 106, it is pointed out that the list is illustrative. ",
        "I - 8658 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-209/07 cannot have as their object the restriction of competition. 28 (d) Legal and economic context 50. As has already been mentioned, in order to assess whether an agreement has as its object the restriction of competi- tion, account must be taken of not only its content, but also its legal and economic context. 29 This requirement must be taken seriously. However, it is not to be seen as a gateway for any factor which suggests that an agreement is compatible with the common market. Rather, it follows from the scheme 28 \u2014 See Wish, R., loc. cit. (footnote 15), pp. 112 to 114. Although a very restrictive interpretation of the notion of restriction of competition by object is adopted there (it is doubtful whether there is a category of restrictions of competition per se under Article 81(1) EC (ibid., pp. 116 and 117)), it is made clear that the list of such agreements is not definitive. The relationship between Article 81(1) EC and Article 81(3) EC also suggests that the notion is not limited to these kinds of restrictions of competition. In Article 81(1) EC it is merely examined whether the object or effect is the restric- tion of competition. The finding that an agreement has as its object or its effect the restriction of competition is not therefore the last word on the agreement\u2019s compatibility with the common market. Rather, an agreement may be compatible with the common market under Article 81(3) EC. Agreements which are aimed at price-fixing, market- sharing or the control of outlets are particularly harmful, however. As a general rule they are not therefore compat- ible with the common market. However, anyone who limits the notion of restriction of competition by object to these particularly harmful kinds fails to recognise that restric- tions of competition by object may also be compatible with the common market under Article 81(3) EC. In my view, such an approach is not compatible with the structure of Article 81 EC. See also Bellamy & Child, loc. cit. (foot- note 15), footnote 291 at paragraph 2.069. 29 \u2014 See point 43 of this Opinion. of Article 81 EC that account is to be taken under Article 81(1) EC only of the elements of the legal and economic context which could cast doubt on the existence of a restric- tion of competition. 30 51. I now wish to set out three categories in which the assumption of a restriction of competition may be rejected or at least doubtful on the basis of the factual or legal context. 31 52. The first category concerns cases in which a limitation of the freedom of under- takings to determine their policy on the market independently has no effects in rela- tion to competition. This may be the case where it is doubtful whether the undertak- ings party to the agreement are competing among themselves. 32 A further example is cases in which it is doubtful whether there is 30 \u2014 See in particular Case C-235/92 P Montecatini v Commis\u00ad sion [1999] ECR I-4539, paragraphs 114 to 128. 31 \u2014 These categories are not so clearly defined that each indi- vidual case can be assigned precisely to just one of the three categories. However, for the purposes of the present proceedings, it is sufficient to examine whether an agree- ment can be classified in at least one of the three categories. 32 \u2014 European Night Services and Others v Commission (cited in footnote 26): potential competition not proven. ",
        "I - 8659 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS actually sufficient competition which can be restricted by the agreement. 33 53. The second category concerns cases in which an agreement is ambivalent in terms of its effects on competition. If the object of an agreement is to promote competition, for example by strengthening competition on a market, opening up a market or allowing a new competitor access to a market, the necessary restriction of the requirement of independence can, when matters are viewed as a whole, give way to the aim of promoting competition. 34 54. The third category concerns ancil- lary arrangements which are necessary in 33 \u2014 GlaxoSmithKline Services v Commission (cited in foot- note 6, paragraphs 114 to 147): doubts regarding the effects on price competition, because prices charged to final consumers are largely removed from the play of supply and demand by virtue of statutory provisions. I will be consid- ering that judgment more closely in points 74 and 75 of this Opinion. 34 \u2014 LTM (cited in footnote 9, p. 250): exclusive right of sale for market penetration, Case 258/78 Nungesser and Eisele v Commission [1982] ECR 2015, paragraphs 44 to 58: grant of an open licence for the distribution of a new technology, Metro SB\u00adGro\u00dfm\u00e4rkte v Commission (cited in footnote 16 paragraphs 20 to 22): channels of distribution which are adapted to high-quality and technically advanced products. order to pursue a primary objective. 35 For the purposes of the present reference for a preliminary ruling, the following distinction should be made within this category: if the primary objective pursued does not come under the fundamental prohibition contained in Article 81(1) EC because it is neutral as regards competition or it promotes compe- tition, the ancillary arrangements which are necessary to achieve that objective do not come under the fundamental prohibition in Article 81(1) EC either. 36 A restriction of competition cannot be taken to exist in such cases. If, on the other hand, the primary objective pursued comes under the funda- mental prohibition laid down in Article 81(1) EC, there is a restriction of competition. 37 55. Factors which are not capable of casting doubt on the existence of a restriction of competition, such as improvements in the production of goods as a result of economies of scale, may not be taken into account in the context of Article 81(1) EC, but only in the context of Article 81(3) EC, even where they are ultimately to be assessed positively 35 \u2014 Example of ancillary arrangements are no-competition clauses without which a transfer of a business would not be possible (Case 42/84 Remia and Others v Commission [1985] ECR 2545, paragraphs 19 and 20), prohibitions on participation or restrictions on activities, in so far as these are necessary to ensure the functioning of a company with a purpose which is unobjectionable in terms of competition (Case C-250/92 DLG [1994] ECR I-5641, paragraphs 30 to 45), and restrictions on activities which are necessary for determining professional ethics (Case C-309/99 Wouters and Others [2002] ECR I-1577, paragraph 97), or elim- inating doping in sport (Case C-519/04 P Meca\u00adMedina and Majcen v Commission [2006] ECR I-6991, paragraphs 42 to 44). 36 \u2014 Relevant comments in Bellamy & Child, loc. cit.

This distinction is apparent already from the wording of Article 81(3) EC, which makes clear that these kinds of effects of an agree- ment are to be taken into account under Article 81(3) EC. The distinction is based on the following idea: the general concep- tion of Article 81 EC is to ensure the optimal supply of consumers. 39 However, different aspects of consumer welfare are taken into account under Article 81(1) EC and under Article 81(3) EC. Under Article 81(1) EC, agreements which restrict competition between market participants and thus its function of supplying consumers optimally with a product at the lowest possible price 40 or with innovative products 41 are prohib- ited in principle. 42 Such agreements directly affect consumer welfare and as such are prohibited in principle. 38 \u2014 Case T-14/89 Montedipe v Commission [1992] ECR II-1155, paragraph 265; Case T-148/89 Tr\u00e9filunion v Commission [1995] ECR II-1063, paragraph 109; and Case T-112/99 M6 and Others v Commission [2001] ECR II-2459, para- graphs 72 to 74. 39 \u2014 Leupold, H., and Weidenbach, G., loc. cit. (footnote 16), p. 1008, footnote 28 with further references. 40 \u2014 This function of competition can be affected in particular by agreements on pricing, on limitation of output or production (Article 81(1)(a) EC) and on market-sharing (Article 81(1)(c) EC). 41 \u2014 This function of competition can be affected in particular by agreements by which investment is restricted (Article 81(1)(a) EC). 42 \u2014 Leupold, H., and Weidenbach, G., loc. cit. (footnote 16), p. 1008 and 1009, who describe these functions as allocative and dynamic efficiencies; Odudu, O., \u2018Article 81(3), Discre- tion and Direct Effect\u2019 , European Competition Law Review 2002 , p. 20. 57. Nevertheless, Article 81(3) EC recog- nises that agreements which restrict compe- tition between market participants result in particular in a reduction in production costs, and the reduction in production costs can contribute indirectly to consumer welfare. 43 However, because first and foremost the reduction in production costs directly bene- fits producers, 44 the compatibility of such an agreement with the common market under Article 81(3) EC is subject in particular to the condition that consumers are allowed a share of the resulting benefit. The Community legislature implemented this idea in the rules on evidence by providing that it is for the parties to an anti-competitive agreement to prove that the conditions under Article 81(3) EC are satisfied, in particular that consumers share in the benefit. 45 58. For these reasons, factors which are not capable of casting doubt on the existence of a restriction of competition, in particular efficiencies in production as a result of econ- omies of scale, may not be taken into account in the context of Article 81(1) EC, but only in the context of Article 81(3) EC, even where they ultimately have to be assessed positively 43 \u2014 Leupold, H., and Weidenbach, G., loc. cit.

Consequently, it is not possible to concur with the restrictive interpretation proposed by BIDS. No obvious restriction of competi- tion is required for the existence of a restric- tion of competition by object. Nor is there an exhaustive list of restrictions of competition by object. The legal and economic context is to be taken into account only in so far as it can cast doubt on the existence of a restric- tion of competition. Other factors are to be taken into account only in the context of Article 81(3) EC, even where they have to be assessed positively in terms of the common market. B \u2014 Do agreements like the BIDS agree\u00ad ments have as their object the restriction of competition? 60.

First of all, it must be consid- ered whether such agreements have restric- tions of competition as their necessary consequence or are aimed at limiting the freedom of the parties to determine their policy on the market independently (1) and thereby at affecting market conditions (2). Subsequently it must be examined as part of an overall assessment whether the restrictive elements are necessary in order to achieve a pro-competitive object or a primary objective which does not come under the fundamental prohibition contained in Article 81(1) EC (3). 1. Restriction of the freedom to determine policy on the market independently 61. Agreements like the BIDS agreements are intended to limit the freedom of goers 47 \u2014 The question referred seeks an interpretation of the notion of restriction of competition by object in Article 81(1) EC. However, agreements like the BIDS agreements can constitute a restriction of competition by object under Article 81(1) EC only where Article 81 EC is applicable to such agreements. The applicability of Article 81 EC in the present case follows from Article 1 of Council Regulation No 26 of 4 April 1962 applying certain rules of competi- tion to production of and trade in agricultural products (OJ, English Special Edition, Series I, 1959\u20131962 p. 129) as amended by Regulation No 49 of the Council of 29 June 1962 amending the date on which certain instruments relating to the common agricultural policy are to enter into force (OJ, English Special Edition, Series I, 1959-1962 p. 201) and Article 2 of Regulation No 26 as amended by Regulation No 49.

Goers are to under- take in the exit agreement in particular to withdraw from the market, to comply with a non-compete clause and to observe the restrictions on use and disposal in relation to the decommissioned plants. 49 Under the BIDS arrangement stayers are to undertake to pay levies. 2. Effect on market conditions 62. The restrictions on the requirement of independence must affect market conditions. It should be pointed out in this connection that in principle it is not the task of the Court of Justice in preliminary ruling proceedings to review the factual findings of the national courts. Nor is it the task of the Court of Justice to examine whether the Supreme Court is bound by the findings of the High Court. However, it is the task of the Court of Justice to interpret Community law in such a way that the referring national court is able to apply Community law correctly. This includes assessing which factual circum- 49 \u2014 In this respect the BIDS agreements are to be distinguished from a scenario where undertakings decide unilaterally to leave the market. stances are relevant to the application of Community law and which are irrelevant. 63. The question whether an agreement affects market conditions should be deter- mined through a comparison of two hypo- thetical situations. 50 64. The first hypothetical situation is the situation as it would appear without the BIDS agreements. This can be inferred in particular from letters (a) to (d) of the ques- tion referred for a preliminary ruling. I infer from letter (c) of the question referred and from the documents before the Court that there have been no withdrawals on a notable scale from the market previously and that without the BIDS arrangement withdrawals from the market would not amount to 25% of the production capacity of the processing industry as a whole, at least in the short term. 65. The second hypothetical situation is the situation as it would appear if the BIDS agree- ments were applied. In this case, it is neces- sary to examine whether the BIDS agree- ments have as their object the restriction of 50 \u2014 LTM (cited in footnote 9, p. 249). ",
        "I - 8663 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS competition. As has been explained above, 51 in this second hypothetical situation account must be taken of the effects which are the necessary consequence of the provisions described in points 1 to 9 of the question, and the effects which the parties intend to achieve through those provisions. 66. It must be noted, first of all, that the BIDS arrangement is a horizontal agree- ment, an agreement between competitors at the same level on the market. The exit agree- ment also constitutes a horizontal agreement between a processor and an association of processors, BIDS. (a) 25% reduction of the production capacity of the processing industry as a whole 67. Under the BIDS agreements the produc- tion capacity of the processing industry as a whole is to be reduced by 25% as a result of 51 \u2014 See points 42 and 59 of this Opinion. processors leaving the market. I consider that the withdrawal of the processors from the market and the agreement not to use their processing plants are capable in principle of restricting competition between the stayers on the market. 52 68. Competition takes place not only where producers are able fully to utilise their capacities, but also where producers have overcapacity. A producer incurs fixed costs for keeping and maintaining production plants. In the case of lower utilisation of the production plant capacity, these fixed costs have a greater effect on the per-unit produc- tion costs than where there is high capacity utilisation, as the proportion represented by fixed costs in the per-unit production costs is proportionally lower in the case of high capacity utilisation (economies of scale). There is generally therefore an incentive for a producer to achieve economies of scale by utilising its production plants. 53 69. BIDS challenges this. In that connec- tion it relies on the following arguments: a 52 \u2014 See Case T-395/94 Atlantic Container Line and Others v Commission [2002] ECR II-875, paragraph 56; see also J\u00fcrgens, R., Strukturkrisenkartelle im deutschen und europ\u00e4ischen Kartellrecht , Peter Lang, Frankfurt am Main, 2007, p. 95. 53 \u2014 With regard to the relationship between overcapacity, econ- omies of scale and increased competition, see Schulz, N., Wettbewerbspolitik , T\u00fcbingen, 2003, pp. 84 to 86. ",
        "I - 8664 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-209/07 reduction in total capacity does not lead to a fall in overall production; the price of the processors\u2019 products does not increase; it is a one-off reduction of the production capacity of the market as a whole. Before examining these points, I would like to reiterate that at this stage only factors which can cast doubt on the existence of a restriction of competi- tion may be taken into account. 54 70. First , it seems to me that, logically, with overall production remaining constant, 55 greater competition would exist between participants in a market with high overcap- acity than in a market with lower (or with no) overcapacity. In a market with high over- capacity, it is more difficult for the average producer to achieve the same capacity util- isation for its production plants than in a market with low overcapacity. Because economies of scale fall in line with the util- isation rate, the average producer is subject to greater competitive pressure in a market with high overcapacity than in a market with only low overcapacity. In economic science, there is a recognised interdependence between overcapacity, economies of scale and competitive pressure. 56 54 \u2014 See points 50 to 58 of this Opinion. 55 \u2014 The High Court took the view that overall production would not change substantially. 56 \u2014 With regard to the relationship between overcapacity, econ- omies of scale and increased competition, see Schulz, N., loc. cit. (footnote 53), pp. 84 to 86. 71. I do not see anything in the present case to suggest that there is no such inter- dependence. In particular, it does not seem to me that the existence of this interdepend- ence depends on whether the overcapacity arose because of a fall in demand or, as in the present case, through support for the construction and expansion of processing plants and through the more even distribu- tion of the primary product to be processed. This is also suggested by the fact that the interdependence was also observed in the market study. The fact that overall produc- tion is not falling is not therefore capable in itself of ruling out the existence of a restric- tion of competition. 57 72. Secondly, the fact that prices will not increase is not capable either, in my view, of ruling out a restriction of competition. The present case concerns only the question whether agreements like the BIDS agree- ments have as their object the restriction of competition. The existence of a restriction of competition and the possible effects of a restriction of competition on prices are two separate questions. This is shown by the fact that prices can be influenced by a number of factors. Not all those factors are capable of ruling out the existence of a restriction of competition. 57 \u2014 BIDS\u2019 view can be reduced ad absurdum with an example: if, on a market with a duopoly, there is high overcapacity on the supply side and if one of the two suppliers ceases production, by agreement with the other supplier, without there being any limitation of overall production, such an agreement would not, in the view of BIDS, have as its object the restriction of competition. However, such a modifica- tion of the market structure would in fact largely rule out competition, as the remaining supplier, having a monopoly, would only be exposed to potential competition. ",
        "I - 8665 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS 73. In the present case, price increases are said to be ruled out on account of the economies of scale achieved through higher capacity utilisation and on account of the power of the other side of the market. Econ- omies of scale may possibly be the conse- quence of reducing the production capacity of the processing industry as a whole. However, they are not capable of ruling out the existence of the restriction of competi- tion under Article 81(1) EC. In fact, econ- omies of scale are to be taken into account as direct benefits primarily for processors in the context of Article 81(3) EC. 58 Nor can the negotiating power of the other side of the market cast doubt in principle on the exist- ence of a restriction of competition, even if it were to rule out an increase in prices; it must therefore be taken into account under Article 81(3) EC. 59 74. The present situation is also not com - parable with the circumstances underlying the judgment in GlaxoSmithKline Services v Commission . 60 In that case \u2014 which by the way concerns vertical price regulation \u2014 prices were determined largely by statutory rules at the stage of sale to the end consumer and were thus largely removed from the 58 \u2014 See points 53 to 56 of this Opinion; Bellamy & Child, loc. cit.

According to paragraph 116 of that judgment, the appellant had claimed in particular that the Court of Justice had failed to take into consideration the superior contractual power of the party on the other side of the market. In paragraph 127 of the judgment, the Court held that such circumstances may be relevant only where the economic context excluded any possibility of effective competition. 60 \u2014 Cited in footnote 6. effects of supply and demand. 61 In such a case, there may be doubts as to whether vertical price regulation can restrict compe- tition within the meaning of Article 81(1) EC. 62 However, the present case is not comparable because there are no statutory provisions which might prevent benefits stemming from competition between stayers being passed on to consumers. 75. Furthermore, the fact that prices will not increase does not exclude any possibility of effective competition. Rather, on a market with high overcapacity and constant overall production the reduction of prices is a typical competition measure. Thus, a producer can attempt to concentrate a larger proportion of demand on itself and thereby increase its utilisation rate and achieve economies of scale. 63 The fact that prices will not increase is not therefore capable in itself of ruling out the existence of a restriction of competition. 61 \u2014 Ibid., paragraphs 114 to 134. 62 \u2014 In such a case it must be examined precisely whether the function of competition of supplying consumers optimally with a product at the lowest possible price (see point 52 of this Opinion) is affected. 63 \u2014 Schulz, N., loc. cit. (footnote 53), pp. 84 to 86. ",
        "I - 8666 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-209/07 76. Thirdly , I cannot see how the fact that the reduction in total capacity is \u2018one-off\u2019 can rule out a restriction of competition through the reduction of total capacity. It should also be pointed out that the effects of the exit agreements and the BIDS arrangement are not limited to a single moment. For example, the non-compete clause for goers applies for two years and the restrictions on use and disposal for five years. 77. In conclusion , I cannot see any reason, either in the factors put forward by BIDS or in other circumstances in the main proceed- ings, for doubting the connection between a 25% reduction in the production capacity of the processing industry as a whole through individual processors leaving the market and a restriction of competition. Instead, the arrangement represents the \u2018buying off\u2019 of competition. In the case of a 25% reduction in total capacity, I have no serious doubts that such a measure is appreciable with regard to competition. Subject to the overall assessment still to be conducted in section 3, the 25% reduction of the production capacity of the processing industry as a whole appears to be aimed at an appreciable restriction of competition. 64 64 \u2014 See also J\u00fcrgens, R., loc. cit. (footnote 52), p. 95. (b) Withdrawal of goers from the market 78. As mentioned above, 65 I infer from letter (c) of the question referred and from the documents before the Court that there have not yet been any withdrawals on a notable scale from the market and that without the BIDS arrangement withdrawals from the market would not amount to 25% of the production capacity of the processing industry as a whole, at least in the short term. 79. For the sake of completeness, I will now also examine whether a restriction of compe- tition could also be taken to exist if in the first hypothetical situation (without agree- ments like the BIDS agreements), there was a withdrawal from the market on a comparable scale as a result of market mechanisms. 80. Under Article 81(1) EC, any restriction of the requirement of independence is prohib- ited if it gives rise to conditions of competi- tion which do not correspond to the normal 65 \u2014 See point 64 of this Opinion. ",
        "I - 8667 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS conditions of the market in question, taking into account the nature of the products or the services provided, the size and number of the undertakings and also the volume of the market in question. 66 81. In the first hypothetical situation (without the BIDS agreements), the selec- tion function of competition would gener- ally mean that the most efficient processors on the market stay, or the processors who best meet the demands of their customers and ultimately of consumers. If the stayers are selected in the second hypothetical situ - ation (with BIDS agreements) not through the market mechanisms, but through an arrange- ment between the processors, this affects the selection function of competition. In the present case this is suggested in particular by the fact that the BIDS arrangement makes no provision for the possibility of decommis- sioning individual processing plants. Under the BIDS arrangement, a processor cannot therefore decommission its inefficient processing plants and remain on the market with the efficient processing plants. 82. Subject to the overall assessment still to be conducted in section 3, this interfer- ence with the selection function of compe- tition appears to be aimed at a restriction of competition. 67 66 \u2014 Commission v Anic Partecipazioni (cited in footnote 16, paragraphs 116 and 117). 67 \u2014 See also J\u00fcrgens, R., loc. cit. (footnote 52), p. 95. (c) Levies 83. It should be stated, first of all, that the payment of levies means that the stayers cannot freely dispose of the amount levied and that they increase their processing costs. With the increased processing costs, the stayers reach a loss-making situation earlier. This can result in a restriction of competi- tion if the levies were to have an appreciable effect on the market behaviour of stayers. 68 A national court must thus examine whether the levies can have an appreciable effect on the market behaviour of stayers irrespective of their level. 84. Furthermore, the staging of the levies according to traditional percentage kill is capable of resulting in the restriction of competition between stayers. BIDS has argued that the levy is merely intended to represent a \u2018price\u2019 for the acquisition by the stayers of the market shares of goers. The stayers would have to fight to capture those market shares. Each processor bears the cost of EUR 11. The competition between stayers is not therefore restricted. 68 \u2014 Case C-180/98 Pavlov and Others [2000] ECR I-6451, para- graphs 90 to 97. ",
        "I - 8668 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-209/07 85. At this point it is sufficient to state that the necessary consequence of such a provision is that stayers are protected with respect to their traditional market share. If a stayer who has already achieved its trad- itional percentage kill (out-performer) is in competition with a stayer which has not yet achieved its traditional percentage kill (low-performer), the out-performer has a cost disadvantage of EUR 9 until the low-performer has achieved its traditional percentage kill. The staging therefore tends to protect any stayer within the scope of its traditional percentage kill. However, stayers are competing not only with regard to the market share released by the goers, but also within the scope of their traditional percentage kill. The staging of levies thus also restricts competition with regard to the traditional percentage kill. If a processor can assume, on the basis of the market condi- tions, that overall production will stagnate or fall in future, 69 it can predict very precisely from what point it will exceed its traditional percentage kill. 86. For the abovementioned reasons, 70 it is irrelevant that overall production is not reduced as a result of the levies and prices are not increased. In addition, the fact that the levies are to be limited to one year cannot in general rule out the existence of 69 \u2014 The High Court had made this finding. 70 \u2014 See points 70 to 75 of this Opinion. a restriction of competition. Such circum- stances may possibly be taken into account under Article 81(3) EC. (d) Restrictions on use and disposal 87. In so far as the restrictions on use and disposal are intended to prevent goers re-entering the market, they are a measure which secures withdrawal from the market and thus reinforces the effects of the goers\u2019 withdrawal from the market. In this respect I refer to my arguments above. 71 88. Furthermore, the restrictions on use and disposal may also be aimed at deterring potential third-party competitors which are not members of BIDS. If it is clear that the construction of new processing plants is not economically feasible under present market 71 \u2014 See points 67 to 77 of this Opinion. ",
        "I - 8669 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS conditions, 72 I consider that restrictions on use and disposal, as are laid down in the BIDS agreements, are capable in principle of restricting competition by potential third- party competitors. 89. Potential competition is also protected by Article 81(1) EC. 73 If it is clear that new competitors have successfully entered the market in the past, 74 this would not appear to be merely a purely theoretical possibility in the future. There is therefore much to suggest that access to the market by potential competitors is restricted by the provisions on use and disposal. 90. The question whether third-party competitors also have other possibilities for access to the market can, in my view, be relevant only in relation to the appreciable nature of the restriction of competition. Since around 25% of the total production capacity is to be subject to a prohibition on use and disposal, there is much to suggest that the restriction of competition is appreciable. 72 \u2014 The High Court had made this finding. 73 \u2014 Case C-234/89 Delimitis [1991] ECR I-935, paragraph 21. 74 \u2014 The High Court had pointed out that Exel Meats Limited had entered the market. 91. A national court must therefore examine whether there are potential competitors for entry to the market and whether they might be interested in entering the market using the processing plants of goers. 92. Furthermore, stayers may not use the decommissioned plants in order to expand their capacity. This too is a restric- tion of competition, in particular when the construction of new processing plants is not economically feasible under present market conditions. 75 93. For the abovementioned reasons, 76 it is irrelevant that overall production is not reduced as a result of the restrictions on use and disposal and prices are not increased. 75 \u2014 The High Court had made this finding. 76 \u2014 See points 70 to 75 of this Opinion. ",
        "I - 8670 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-209/07 (e) Conclusion 94. Subject to consideration of a pro- competitive object or a primary objective of the BIDS agreements which is unobjec- tionable from a competition point of view, I therefore reach the following interim conclu- sion: at least the planned 25% reduction in the production capacity of the processing industry as a whole as a result of proces- sors leaving the market, the staging of levies and the restrictions on use and disposal are elements of the agreement which have, as a necessary consequence, the restriction of competition. 95. In this connection, I would like to point out, for the sake of completeness, that BIDS has not acted under State compul- sion. 77 The fact that the market study was financed by the Irish Government and the Beef Task Force called on the processing industry to implement the market study does not constitute State compulsion. 77 \u2014 In principle, such a circumstance is to be examined only if the undertaking in question relies on it; see Montecatini v Commission (cited in footnote 30, paragraph 128). 3. Consideration of the aims pursued through the BIDS agreements 96. BIDS claims that the aim of the BIDS agreements is to limit overcapacity and to achieve economies of scale. In particular, it claims, the collection of levies and the restrictions on use and disposal are justified having regard to this legitimate objective. 97. First , I would like to reiterate at this point that the present examination concerns only whether an agreement has as its object the restriction of competition. Article 81(1) EC does not involve an examination of whether the restriction of competition is so obvious or objectionable that it may be compared with a typical cartel. 98. Secondly , it must be borne in mind that the fact that a sector is experiencing a cyclical or structural crisis does not mean, according to settled case-law, that Article 81(1) EC does not apply. 78 78 \u2014 Joined Cases T-217/03 and T-245/03 FNCBV v Commis\u00ad sion [2006] ECR II-4987, paragraph 90, and Joined Cases T-305/94 to T-307/94, T-313/94 to T-316/94, T-318/94, T-325/94, T-328/94, T-329/94 and T-335/94 Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij and Others v Commission [1999] ECR II-931, paragraph 740. ",
        "I - 8671 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS 99. Thirdly , the Court has consistently held that the fact that the parties pursue a legitim- ate objective with an agreement does not rule out the existence of a restriction of competition by object. 79 100. According to the case-law of the Court of Justice described above, 80 the situation is different only where an agreement pursues either a pro-competitive object or an object which is neutral from a competition point of view. That cannot be assumed to be the case here. Instead, the aim of increasing the prof- itability of the processing industry as a whole by reducing the overcapacity by 25% inevit- ably results in a restriction of competition. 81 101. Fourthly , the aim of BIDS is to create production benefits through economies of scale. However, it is clear from the connection between Article 81(1) EC and Article 81(3) EC that such an aim can only be taken into account under Article 81(3) EC. 82 79 \u2014 IAZ International Belgium and Others v Commission (cited in footnote 20, paragraphs 22 to 25). 80 \u2014 See points 52 to 55 of this Opinion. 81 \u2014 See points 67 to 77 of this Opinion. 82 \u2014 See points 55 to 57 of this Opinion. 4. Conclusion 102. Consequently, an agreement like the BIDS agreements has as its object the restric- tion of competition. C \u2014 Final assessment of the elements of an agreement like the BIDS agreements 103. I will now explain how the individual elements of agreements like the BIDS agree- ments are to be assessed with respect to Article 81(1)(b) EC and the general clause in Article 81(1) EC. 104. I have reservations regarding the excessive categorisation of restrictions of competition. The content of an agreement must always be examined against the back- ground of its legal and economic context. In my view, the present case shows that an approach whereby an agreement is compared with typical serious restrictions of competi- tion is not always pertinent and may fail to address the question of when a restriction ",
        "I - 8672 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-209/07 of competition by object exists. Moreover, because the examples set out in Article 81(1)(a) to (e) EC are in a non-exhaustive list of examples, such categorisation is not absolutely necessary either. Rather, from a legal point of view it is sufficient that they are subsumed under the general wording of Article 81(1). 105. However, it may be helpful for under- takings and their legal advisors to form cat - egories, in particular against the background of the self-assessment system which now applies. I therefore propose that the Court categorise the restrictions of competition by object identified above as follows. 106. The reduction of total capacity is in itself a restriction of competition which comes under the general clause in Article 81(1) EC. There is no need to decide here whether it is also a limitation of produc- tion for the purposes of Article 81(1)(b) EC. 83 In so far as the restriction of total capacity is achieved \u2014 as in the present case \u2014 by indi- vidual processors leaving the market and thus ceasing production, there is also a limitation of production under Article 81(1)(b) EC. First of all, it can not be inferred from the wording 83 \u2014 See paragraph 56 in Atlantic Container Line and Others v Commission (cited in footnote 52). of Article 81(1)(b) EC that overall produc- tion is the crucial point. Secondly, a compari- son with the other examples suggests that simply the limitation of the production of one market participant is sufficient. Thirdly, on the basis of the purpose of the provi- sion, I also do not think that it is justified to take production on the market as a whole as the basis. Rather, the protective purpose of Article 81(1) EC applies to competition, in its function of supplying consumers optimally with a product at the lowest possible price, already in a situation where a market partici- pant limits or entirely ceases its production. 107. The staging of levies is likely to deter a stayer from expanding its market share at the expense of the traditional market share of another stayer. It also therefore constitutes a limitation of production. 108. The restrictions on use and disposal are also likely to restrict a producer from expanding production through increases in its capacity, and are thus also to be regarded as a limitation of production.

The main proceedings and the question referred for a preliminary ruling It is apparent from the decision making the reference that the dispute before the Supreme Court arises in the context of overcapacity in the beef industry in Ireland and, more particularly, in the processing sector (slaughter and de-boning of meat). 1 2 3 ",
        "I - 8677 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS A study carried out in 1998 at the joint request of the Irish Government and repre- sentatives of the beef industry concluded that it was necessary to reduce the number of processors from 20 to a figure between 4 and 6. The report also recommended that the undertakings which were to remain in the sector (\u2018the stayers\u2019) should compen- sate those forced to withdraw (\u2018the goers\u2019). In 1999, a task force set up by the Minister for Agriculture and Food came to similar conclusions and recommended that the processors should create a compensation fund. In accordance with those conclusions, the 10 principal processors formed BIDS on 2 May 2002. BIDS prepared a draft rationalisation plan which provided, inter alia, for a reduction in processing capacity of about 25%, the equivalent of an annual volume of about 420 000 head of cattle. BIDS planned to implement that objective by means of agreements between the stayers and the goers, in the terms of a standard form of contract, the principal features of which are summarised in the following paragraph. That standard form of contract provides that the stayers are to compensate the goers, the amount of that compensation to be determined by the parties. BIDS is to pay the compensation to the goers. The stayers are to repay BIDS by means of a levy of 4 5 6 7 8 ",
        "I - 8678 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-209/07 EUR 2 per head of cattle up to their traditional cattle kill volume and EUR 11 above that volume. In return, the goers undertake: \u2014 to decommission or put beyond use their processing plants or sell them only to persons established outside the island of Ireland, or, if necessary, to the stayers on condition that they be used as back-up equipment or spare parts; \u2014 not to use the land on which those plants were situated for the purposes of beef or veal processing for a period of five years; \u2014 not to compete with the stayers in the beef and veal processing market in Ireland for two years. Barry Brothers is a beef and veal processing company. It made an agreement with BIDS complying with the features described in the previous paragraph. BIDS notified the Competition Authority of that agreement and the standard form of contract (\u2018the BIDS arrangements\u2019). Having informed BIDS, on 5 and 26 June 2003, that it considered the BIDS arrange- ments contrary to Article 81(1) EC, the Competition Authority applied to the High Court, on 30 June 2003, for an order restraining BIDS and Barry Brothers from giving effect to them. 9 10 11 ",
        "I - 8679 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS By judgment of 27 July 2006, the High Court dismissed that application. It held that the agreement between BIDS and Barry Brothers did not fall under the prohibition laid down in Article 81(1) EC but nor did it satisfy the requirements for exemption laid down in Article 81(3) EC. The Competition Authority appealed against that decision to the Supreme Court, which decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: \u2018Where it is established to the satisfaction of the court that: (a) there is overcapacity in the industry for the processing of beef which, calculated at peak throughput, would be approximately 32%; (b) the effect of this excess capacity will have very serious consequences for the prof- itability of the industry as a whole over the medium term; (c) while \u2026 the effects of surplus requirements have not been felt to any significant degree as yet, independent consultants have advised that, in the near term, the overcapacity is unlikely to be eliminated by normal market measures, but over time the overcapacity will lead to very significant losses and ultimately to proces- sors and plants leaving the industry; 12 13 ",

        "I - 8682 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-209/07 The question referred for a preliminary ruling By its question, the national court asks, in essence, whether agreements with features such as those of the BIDS arrangements are to be regarded, by reason of their object alone, as being anti-competitive and prohibited by Article 81(1) EC or whether, on the other hand, it is necessary, in order to reach such a conclusion, first to demon- strate that such agreements have had anti-competitive effects. It must be recalled that, to come within the prohibition laid down in Article 81(1) EC, an agreement must have \u2018as [its] object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market\u2019. It has, since the judgment in Case 56/65 LTM [1966] ECR 235, 249, been settled case-law that the alternative nature of that requirement, indicated by the conjunction \u2018or\u2019, leads, first, to the need to consider the precise purpose of the agreement, in the economic context in which it is to be applied. Where, however, an analysis of the clauses of that agreement does not reveal the effect on competition to be sufficiently deleterious, its consequences should then be considered and for it to be caught by the prohibition it is necessary to find that those factors are present which show that competition has in fact been prevented or restricted or distorted to an appreciable extent. In deciding whether an agreement is prohibited by Article 81(1) EC, there is there- fore no need to take account of its actual effects once it appears that its object is to prevent, restrict or distort competition within the common market (Joined Cases 56/64 and 58/64 Consten and Grundig v Commission [1966] ECR 299, 342, and Case C-105/04 P Nederlandse Federatieve Vereniging voor de Groothandel op Elektrotech\u00ad nisch Gebied v Commission [2006] ECR I-8725, paragraph 125). That examination must be made in the light of the agreement\u2019s content and economic context (Joined Cases 29/83 and 30/83 Compagnie royale asturienne des mines and Rheinzink v Commission [1984] ECR 1679, paragraph 26, and Case C-551/03 P General Motors v Commission [2006] ECR I-3173, paragraph 66). 14 15 16 ",
        "I - 8683 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS The distinction between \u2018infringements by object\u2019 and \u2018infringements by effect\u2019 arises from the fact that certain forms of collusion between undertakings can be regarded, by their very nature, as being injurious to the proper functioning of normal competition. In their written observations submitted to the Court, the Competition Authority, the Belgian Government and the Commission of the European Communities all submit that the object of the BIDS arrangements is obviously anti-competitive so that there is no need to analyse their actual effects and that those arrangements were concluded in breach of the prohibition laid down in Article 81(1) EC. On the other hand, BIDS submits that those arrangements do not come within the category of infringements by object, but should, on the contrary, be analysed in the light of their actual effects on the market. It argues that the BIDS arrangements, first, are not anti-competitive in purpose and, second, do not entail injurious consequences for consumers or, more generally, for competition. It states that the purpose of those arrangements is not adversely to affect competition or the welfare of consumers, but to rationalise the beef industry in order to make it more competitive by reducing, but not eliminating, production overcapacity. That argument cannot be accepted. In fact, to determine whether an agreement comes within the prohibition laid down in Article 81(1) EC, close regard must be paid to the wording of its provisions and to the objectives which it is intended to attain. In that regard, even supposing it to be 17 18 19 20 21 ",
        "I - 8684 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-209/07 established that the parties to an agreement acted without any subjective intention of restricting competition, but with the object of remedying the effects of a crisis in their sector, such considerations are irrelevant for the purposes of applying that provision. Indeed, an agreement may be regarded as having a restrictive object even if it does not have the restriction of competition as its sole aim but also pursues other legitimate objectives ( General Motors v Commission , paragraph 64 and the case-law cited). It is only in connection with Article 81(3) EC that matters such as those relied upon by BIDS may, if appropriate, be taken into consideration for the purposes of obtaining an exemption from the prohibition laid down in Article 81(1) EC. BIDS argues, in addition, that the concept of infringement by object should be inter- preted narrowly. Only agreements as to horizontal price-fixing, or to limit output or share markets, agreements whose anti-competitive effects are so obvious as not to require an economic analysis come within that category. The BIDS arrangements cannot be assimilated to that type of agreement or to other forms of complex cartels. BIDS maintains that an agreement on the reduction of excess capacity in a sector cannot be assimilated to an agreement to \u2018limit production\u2019 within the meaning of Article 81(1)(b) EC. That concept must be understood as referring to a limitation of total market output rather than a limitation of the output of certain operators who voluntarily withdraw from the market, without causing a lowering of output. However, as the Advocate General pointed out in point 48 of her Opinion, the types of agreements covered by Article 81(1)(a) to (e) EC do not constitute an exhaustive list of prohibited collusion. Therefore, it must be examined whether agreements with features such as those described by the national court have as their object the restriction of competition. 22 23 24 ",
        "I - 8685 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS In BIDS\u2019 submission, if an agreement does not affect the total output on a market or obstruct operators\u2019 freedom to act independently, any anti-competitive effect can be excluded. In the main proceedings, the withdrawal of certain operators from the market is irrelevant, because the stayers are in a position to satisfy demand. BIDS adds that the structure of the market does not allow the processors to influ- ence it, since up to 90% of demand is from outside Ireland. On the Irish market, the power of the processors is largely counteracted by the purchasing power of the four major retailers. Account must also be taken of the competition which new operators entering the market concerned could bring about. BIDS observes that the cases in which a limitation on output has been held to be infringement by object concerned agreements supplemental to horizontal price or production-fixing agreements (Commission Decision 80/1334/EEC of 17 December 1980 relating to a proceeding under Article [81] of the EEC Treaty (IV/29.869 \u2014 Italian cast glass) (OJ 1980 L 383, p. 19) and Commission Decision 94/601/EC of 13 July 1994 relating to a proceeding under Article [81] of the EC Treaty (IV/C/33.833 \u2014 Cartonboard) (OJ 1994 L 243, p. 1)), to which the BIDS arrangements are not comparable. BIDS submits that the Commission\u2019s decision-making practice and the case-law do not permit the conclusion that there is a restriction by object (see, in particular, Commission Decision 84/380/EEC of 4 July 1984 relating to a proceeding under Article [81] of the EEC Treaty (IV/30.810 \u2014 Synthetic fibres) (OJ 1984 L 207, p. 17) 25 26 27 28 ",
        "I - 8686 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-209/07 and Commission Decision 94/296/EC of 29 April 1994 relating to a proceeding under Article [81] of the EC Treaty (IV/34.456 \u2014 Stichting Baksteen) (OJ 1994 L 131, p. 15) and Joined Cases T-197/97 and T-198/97 Weyl Beef Products and Others v Commis\u00ad sion [2001] ECR II-303). The BIDS arrangements cannot be compared to the freezing of capacities proposed by the liner conferences in Commission Decision 94/980/EC of 19 October 1994 relating to a proceeding pursuant to Article [81] of the EC Treaty (IV/34.446 \u2014 Trans-Atlantic Agreement) (OJ 1994 L 376, p. 1), since the freezing was not suffi- cient to eliminate over-capacities in the sector. Finally, the BIDS arrangements provide for neither the freezing nor the non-use of capacity, nor exchange of information, nor quotas or other measures intended to preserve the stayers\u2019 market shares. In that regard, it is apparent from the documents before the Court and from the information provided by the national court that the object of the BIDS arrangements is to change, appreciably, the structure of the market through a mechanism intended to encourage the withdrawal of competitors. The matters brought to the Court\u2019s attention show that the BIDS arrangements are intended to improve the overall profitability of undertakings supplying more than 90% of the beef and veal processing services on the Irish market by enabling them 29 30 31 32 ",
        "I - 8687 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS to approach, or even attain, their minimum efficient scale. In order to do so, those arrangements pursue two main objectives: first, to increase the degree of concentra- tion in the sector concerned by reducing significantly the number of undertakings supplying processing services and, second, to eliminate almost 75% of excess produc- tion capacity. The BIDS arrangements are intended therefore, essentially, to enable several under- takings to implement a common policy which has as its object the encouragement of some of them to withdraw from the market and the reduction, as a consequence, of the overcapacity which affects their profitability by preventing them from achieving economies of scale. That type of arrangement conflicts patently with the concept inherent in the EC Treaty provisions relating to competition, according to which each economic oper- ator must determine independently the policy which it intends to adopt on the common market. Article 81(1) EC is intended to prohibit any form of coordination which deliberately substitutes practical cooperation between undertakings for the risks of competition. In the context of competition, the undertakings which signed the BIDS arrangements would have, without such arrangements, no means of improving their profitability other than by intensifying their commercial rivalry or resorting to concentrations. With the BIDS arrangements it would be possible for them to avoid such a process and to share a large part of the costs involved in increasing the degree of market 33 34 35 ",
        "I - 8688 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-209/07 concentration as a result, in particular, of the levy of EUR 2 per head processed by each of the stayers. In addition, the means put in place to attain the objective of the BIDS arrangements include restrictions whose object is anti-competitive. As regards, in the first place, the levy of EUR 11 per head of cattle slaughtered beyond the usual volume of production of each of the stayers, it is, as BIDS submits, the price to be paid by the stayers to acquire the goers\u2019 clientele. However, it must be observed, as did the Advocate General in point 85 of her Opinion, that such a measure also constitutes an obstacle to the natural development of market shares as regards some of the stayers who, because of the dissuasive nature of that levy, are deterred from exceeding their usual volume of production. That measure is likely therefore to lead to certain operators freezing their production. As regards, secondly, restrictions imposed on the goers as regards the disposal and use of their processing plants, the BIDS arrangements also contain, by their very object, restrictions on competition since they seek to avoid the possible use of those plants by new operators entering the market in order to compete with the stayers. As the Competition Authority pointed out in its written observations, since the invest- ment necessary for the construction of a new processing plant is much greater than the costs of taking over an existing plant, those restrictions are obviously intended to dissuade any new entry of competitors throughout the island of Ireland. 36 37 38 ",
        "I - 8689 BEEF INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY AND BARRY BROTHERS Finally, the fact that those restrictions, as well as the non-competition clause imposed on the goers, are limited in time is not such as to put in doubt the finding as to the anti-competitive nature of the object of the BIDS arrangements. As the Advo- cate General observed in point 86 of her Opinion, such matters may, at the most, be relevant for the purposes of the examination of the four requirements which have to be met under Article 81(3) EC in order to escape the prohibition laid down in Article 81(1) EC. In the light of the foregoing considerations, the reply to the question referred must be that an agreement with features such as those of the standard form of contract concluded between the 10 principal beef and veal processors in Ireland, who are members of BIDS, and requiring, among other things, a reduction of the order of 25% in processing capacity, has as its object the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the meaning of Article 81(1) EC. Costs Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. 39 40 41 ",

Secondly, as is apparent from reading various language versions of the Combined Nomencla- ture and in the light of the Explanatory Notes of the Commission, which refer to the Explanatory Notes of the Inter- national Convention on the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System, the fact of being baked is not a characteristic which is necessary in order for a product to be classified under subheading 1905 90 20.

The requirements connected with the uniform application of Community law to ensure which a power of decision was conferred on the Commission in regard to the post-clearance recovery of customs duties demand that, in respect of the same import transactions carried out by a trader, a Commission decision on the existence of \u2018obvious negligence\u2019 on the part of that trader cannot be deprived of effect by a subsequent deci- sion of a national court ruling on whether or not the error committed by the national customs authorities was \u2018detect- able\u2019 by that same trader. A national court, ruling on an appeal against a notice for recovery of import duties, must therefore, when it becomes aware in the course of the proceedings before it that the matter has been referred to the Commission pursuant to Article 220 or Article 239 of the Customs Code, avoid giving decisions which would conflict with a decision contemplated by the Commission in the implementation of those articles. If the importer has, within the period prescribed in the fifth para- graph of Article 230 EC, brought an action for annulment of a decision of the Commission of the European Commu- nities in respect of an application for remission of import duties pursuant to Article 239 of that regulation, it is for the national court to decide whether to stay the proceedings until a definitive decision has been given in the action for annulment or to refer itself a question to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for a preliminary ruling as to validity.

A major redrafting of the provisions on the division of competence between the national customs authorities and the Commission took place later, with effect from 1 August 2003, with the amendment of Regulation No 2454/93 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1335/2003 of 25 July 2003. 14 Since both the version before and the version after the 2003 legislative amendment may be of relevance in this case, both will be examined here, depending on whose decision is involved and at what point in time. 17. In relation to decisions applying Article 220(2)(b) of the Customs Code, the administrative procedure is laid down in Articles 869 to 876(a) of Regulation No 2454/93 and, in relation to decisions applying the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code, in Articles 899 and 905 et seq. of Regulation No 2454/93. 18.

In so far as the national customs author- ities wish to take a decision favourable to the debtor, certain rules on the division of competence between the national customs authorities and the Commission apply both to the administrative procedure in relation to decisions applying Article 220(2)(b) of the Customs Code and to the administrative procedure in relation to decisions applying the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code.

On the other hand, that is not the case where the national authorities proceed to effect recovery, whatever the amount in issue. It is then open to the person concerned to challenge such a decision before the national courts. As a result, it will then be possible for the uniformity of Community law to be ensured by the Court of Justice through the preliminary ruling procedure. characterised by a threshold amount of EUR 50 000, above which the case had to be transmitted to the Commission for a decision if a favourable decision was to be expected. Below that threshold value, there were possi- bilities of transmission, for example, in cases of doubt. By contrast, in respect of the legal situation as from 1 August 2003, a threshold value of EUR 500 000 applies and there is also, in other respects, a significant transfer of the decision-making practice to the national customs authorities. 17 Transmission to the Commission is now possible for only a few categories of cases. 17 \u2014 See, in that regard, recitals 1 to 4 in the preamble to Regula- tion No 2454/93, as amended by Regulation No 1335/2003: \u2018(1) Articles 220(2)(b) and 239 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code lay down that in certain cases import or export duties shall not be subsequently entered in the accounts or may be repaid or remitted for reasons of equity.

(3) However, in order to ensure uniform treatment of traders and protect the financial interests of the Communities, the obligation to transmit dossiers to the Commission for a decision should remain where Member States consider that the decision should be favourable and either (a) an active error or failing on the part of the Commission is cited, or (b) the circum- stances of the case are connected to Community inves- tigations carried out under Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters \u2026, or (c) the amount of duties involved is EUR 500 000 or more.

Heuschen & Schrouff, an importer of foodstuffs and food ingredients, has imported rice paper from Vietnam for many years. 24. In 1996 and the following years, the customs agent acting on behalf of Heuschen & Schrouff declared imported rice paper under CN subheading 1901 90 99 for purposes of release into free circulation. The competent national customs author- ities accepted the declarations each time, even after a random sample taken on the occasion of one declaration, with a view to its customs classification, had been analysed. 18 25. On 16 March 1998, in connection with a declaration for release into free circulation of 14 January 1998, the competent customs authority in Rotterdam classified the rice 18 \u2014 Judgment of 7 December 2004 of the Gerechtshof te Amsterdam, Douanekamer, Case No 01/900096 DK, p. 2. paper, after inspection, under CN subheading 1905 90 20. 19 26. By assessment notices of 22 November 2000, Heuschen & Schrouff was requested to pay customs duties amounting in total to NLG 645 399.50 (EUR 292 869.52 20 ) on all imports of rice paper effected over the period from 13 November 1997 to 31 December 1998. Referring to Regulation No 1196/97, the customs authority stated by way of explan- ation that the CN subheading 1901 90 99 indicated on the declarations was incor- rect and that a revision of the assessment notices concerned would for that reason be necessary. 27. In response to the objection lodged by Heuschen & Schrouff, the demands for payment were confirmed by ruling of the Customs and Excise Inspector of 9 March 2001, with the exception of a demand for 19 \u2014 The following is apparent from the judgment of the Court of First Instance in Heuschen & Schrouff Ori\u00ebntal Foods Trading v Commission , cited above in footnote 2, deliv- ered in the parallel proceedings on an action for annul- ment of Commission Decision REM 19/2002 of 17 June 2004: after the adoption of Regulation No 1196/97, which was published on 28 June 1997 and entered into force on 19 July 1997, Heuschen & Schrouff continued to import rice paper from Vietnam under CN subheading 1901 90 99, a practice which was accepted by the Netherlands customs authorities in respect of 29 declarations over a period of six months (with documentary inspection and, in one instance, physical inspection). On 16 March 1998, the Netherlands customs authorities pointed out that the declaration should be made with reference to CN subheading 1905 90 20. Later on the same day, however, the correctness of a declaration using CN subheading 1901 90 99 was confirmed by the same customs authorities. As from 17 March 1998, Heuschen & Schrouff used CN subheading 1905 90 20 for the import- ation of rice paper. 20 \u2014 See the judgment of the Gerechtshof te Amsterdam, Douanekamer, cited above in footnote 18, pp. 1 and 3, and the judgment of the Court of First Instance in Heuschen & Schrouff Ori\u00ebntal Foods Trading v Commission , cited above in footnote 2, paragraph 12.

The Gerechtshof te Amsterdam held that, for purposes of customs tariff classi- fication, the product in question had to be classified under CN subheading 1905 90 20. Pursuant to Article 220(2)(b) of the Customs Code, subsequent entry of the import duties in the accounts should be waived, because Heuschen & Schrouff had acted in good faith and complied with all the provisions applicable to the customs declaration. The Gerechtshof te Amsterdam ruled that the appeal was well founded and set aside both the Inspector\u2019s ruling and the demands for payment. 32. In parallel with the proceedings brought before the Gerechtshof te Amsterdam, Heuschen & Schrouff applied to the national customs authority, on 13 September 2002, 23 for remission of the customs debt in question pursuant to Article 239(1) of the Customs Code. That application was transmitted on 19 September 2002 to the Commission of the European Communities, which rejected it by decision of 17 June 2004 on the ground that, although a special situation as referred to in Article 239 of the Customs Code existed, Heuschen & Schrouff had nevertheless acted with obvious negligence. 23 \u2014 See, for the date, paragraph 13 of the judgment of the Court of First Instance in Heuschen & Schrouff Ori\u00ebntal Foods Trading v Commission , cited above in footnote 2.

At the time when the judgment of the Gerechtshof te Amsterdam was delivered on 7 December 2004, an action brought on 23 September 2004 against that Commis- sion decision was pending before the Court of First Instance. That action was dismissed by judgment of 30 November 2006, against which an appeal was lodged before the Court of Justice. 24 34. In the course of the proceedings in cassa- tion against the judgment of the Gerechtshof te Amsterdam, the Hoge Raad der Neder- landen, by order of 13 July 2007, referred to the Court of Justice the questions to be examined here: \u2018(1) Do sheets as described in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1196/97 come under heading 1905 of the Combined Nomenclature if they are prepared from rice flour, salt and water and then dried, but do not undergo any heat treatment? (2) In the light of the answer to Question 1, is Regulation No 1196/97 valid? 24 \u2014 See above, point 3 of this Opinion. (3) Must Article 871 of Regulation No 2454/93, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1677/98 of 29 July 1998 \u2026, be construed as meaning that if, under the first paragraph of Article 871 thereof, there is an obligation on the customs authority to transmit a case to the Commission before it can decide to dispense with post-clearance recovery in that case, a national court ruling on an appeal by a tax debtor against the decision of the customs authority to proceed (in fact) with post-clearance recovery does not have the power to set aside that post-clearance recovery on the ground of its finding that the conditions laid down in Article 220(2)(b) [of the Customs Code] for (mandatorily) setting aside post-clearance recovery are satis- fied, where that finding is not supported by the Commission? (4) If the answer to Question 3 should be that the fact that the Commission has the power to take a decision in regard to demands for post-clearance recovery of customs duties does not involve any limitation on the jurisdiction of national courts which are called on to rule in an appeal concerning a demand for post- clearance recovery of customs duties, does Community law contain any sep - arate provision which guarantees uniform application of Community law in the specific case where there is a discrep- ancy between the views of the Commis- sion and those of the national court concerning the criteria to be applied in the context of Article 220 of the Customs Code for the purpose of deter- mining whether a mistake on the part of the customs authority could have been detected by a tax debtor?\u2019 ",
        "I - 8704 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-375/07 35. Referring to the findings of the Gerecht- shof te Amsterdam concerning the char- acteristics of rice paper, the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden points out, with regard to both its first and second questions, that there are two very different interpretations as to which characteristic of a product such as rice paper is determinant for the purpose of classifica- tion under CN codes 1901 and 1905. Doubts as regards classification under CN heading 1905 have arisen, in particular, by reason of the judgment in Uelzena Milchwerke . 25 If CN heading 1905 is incorrect, the question arises as to whether Regulation No 1196/97 is valid. 36. The Hoge Raad der Nederlanden asks the third and fourth questions with a view to uniform application of Community law, in this instance Article 220(2) and the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code, and in view of the danger posed by divergent decisions in parallel proceedings before the Commission and the Community Courts, on the one hand, and the national customs authorities and the national courts, on the other. 37. That is because, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, 26 in 25 \u2014 Case C-12/94 [1995] ECR I-2397. 26 \u2014 Case C-156/00 Netherlands v Commission [2003] ECR I-2527. assessing whether the person liable for payment has shown obvious negligence within the meaning of the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code, the same criteria apply as are applicable in the context of Article 220 of the Customs Code in determining whether there has been an error on the part of the customs authorities which could not have been detected by the person liable for payment. 38. In this connection, the third question specifically seeks to ascertain whether a court whose judgment is open to challenge by appeal or appeal in cassation and which makes no reference for a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice is entitled to deliver a judgment which, bypassing the Commis- sion, overrules the demand for post-clear- ance recovery, or whether it is at best entitled to deliver a judgment which sets aside the national customs authority\u2019s decision, which is inherent in the decision to demand post- clearance recovery, not to transmit the case to the Commission. 39. On 22 May 2008, after the conclusion of the written procedure, a hearing was held, in which Heuschen & Schrouff, the Commis- sion, the Netherlands Government, the Greek Government and the Italian Govern- ment took part. No new aspects arose at the hearing. ",

The national court\u2019s first question concerns the criteria 27 for the correct classi- fication of rice paper in the CN. With regard to CN codes 1901 and 1905, the question arises as to the relevant product character- istic for purposes of classification. In formu- lating its question, the national court particu- larly emphasises the aspect of the lack of heat treatment with regard to CN heading 1905. The second question, regarding the validity of Regulation No 1196/97, follows on from the answer to the first question. 41. Before dealing with the classification principles relating to the CN, the product to be classified must first be considered in more 27 \u2014 When the Court is requested to give a preliminary ruling on a matter of tariff classification, its task is to provide the national court with guidance on the criteria which will enable the latter to classify the products at issue correctly in the CN, rather than to effect that classification itself, a fortiori since the Court does not necessarily have available to it all the information which is essential in that regard. In any event, the national court is in a better position to do so (Joined Cases C-260/00 to C-263/00 Lohmann and Medi Bayreuth [2002] ECR I-10045, paragraph 26). detail: Asian rice paper in edible form 28 is used as (edible) packaging for foodstuffs. As the Gerechtshof te Amsterdam established, the product in question is prepared from the ingredients rice flour, water and salt. After those ingredients have been blended and kneaded, small pats are made, which are rolled out into circular, translucent sheets which are then dried. The Gerechtshof te Amsterdam further pointed out that, as such, the product is not suitable for direct consumption, but must first be subjected to heat treatment. It should be added that, before any further use, including heat treat- ment, the wafer-thin sheets of rice paper must be soaked in water. Together with their filling they are baked, fried or deep- fried (as spring rolls, for example), although, depending on the recipe, they can obviously also be consumed unbaked as small filled rolls with their contents. 42. On the basis of point 1 of the general rules for the interpretation of the CN, 29 clas- sification is governed in particular by the wording of the headings and subheadings of the CN. 30 It is settled case-law of the Court that, in the interests of legal certainty and ease of verification, the decisive criterion 28 \u2014 Asian rice paper can be produced from, among other things, a variety of plant fibres, and in Japan and China, for example, is put to very varied uses, including in living rooms (for partition walls and lampshades, for example). 29 \u2014 See above, point 7 of this Opinion. 30 \u2014 Lyons, EC Customs Law , 2nd edition, 2008, p. 142, also draws attention to their particular significance. ",
        "I - 8706 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-375/07 for the classification of goods for customs purposes is in general to be found in their objective characteristics and properties as defined in the wording of the relevant heading of the CN and of the notes to the sections or chapters. 31 43. The national court is correct in observing that it cannot be expressly inferred as a char- acteristic from the wording of CN heading 1905 that the products listed there are baked. It is true that, as the first group of products, \u2018Bread, pastry, cakes, biscuits and other bakers\u2019 wares, whether or not containing cocoa\u2019 come under that heading. However, they are followed, separated clearly by a semicolon, by a further group of products, the list of which contains no verbatim refer- ence to the characteristic of \u2018having been baked\u2019: \u2018communion wafers, empty cachets of a kind suitable for pharmaceutical use, sealing wafers, rice paper and similar prod- ucts\u2019. This group of products is expressly assigned to CN subheading 1905 90 20 with precisely that wording. There is no literal mention whatsoever of \u2018having been baked\u2019. Common features which frequently occur in that subheading are, rather, the fact that the products are in the form of sheets and their dry state, which results from a variety of methods (drying with or without heat treatment). 31 \u2014 See, inter alia, Case C-42/99 Eru Portuguesa [2000] ECR I-7691, paragraph 13; Case C-495/03 Intermodal Transports [2005] ECR I-8151, paragraph 47; and Medion and Canon Deutschland , cited above in footnote 6, paragraph 34. 44. That is, moreover, confirmed by various language versions of the provision. 32 Some versions, although not the Dutch, 33 expressly mention \u2018dried\u2019 products and in fact even \u2018dried sheets of dough prepared from flour\u2019. 34 That applies to the product to be classified in the present case.

However, that view can be countered by pointing out that the judgment in Uelzena Milchwerke concerns only the first group of products of CN heading 1905, the charac- teristics and properties of which are given as \u2018Bread, pastry, cakes, biscuits and other bakers\u2019 wares, whether or not containing cocoa\u2019. Uelzena Milchwerke specifically concerns CN subheading 1905 30, \u2018\u2026 biscuits \u2026\u2019. Since, therefore, that judgment does not concern the group of products \u2018communion wafers, empty cachets of a kind suitable for pharmaceutical use, sealing wafers, rice paper and similar products\u2019, it cannot contribute to the interpretation sought in the present context. 46. A comparative glance at the descrip- tions of goods coming under CN heading 1901 shows, moreover, that their wording and, in particular, that of CN subheading 1901 90 99 (\u2018Other\u2019), regarded by Heuschen & Schrouff as being correct, contain no indi- cations whatsoever which could constitute a more specific description for the purposes of point 3(a) of the general rules for the inter- pretation of the CN. 37 37 \u2014 See above, point 7 of this Opinion. 47. In my view, in this clear-cut situation of classification according to the wording of the CN code, it is no longer of decisive impor- tance to refer to the World Customs Organ- isation\u2019s Explanatory Notes 38 mentioned by Heuschen & Schrouff. 39 48. Consequently, the national court\u2019s first question must be answered in the affirma- tive, as is also proposed, moreover, by the Governments of the Netherlands, Greece and Italy as well as the Commission. Accordingly, sheets of the type described in the Annex to Regulation No 1196/97 should be classified under CN heading 1905, and specifically under CN subheading 1905 90 20, if they are sheets prepared from rice flour, salt and water, which have been dried but have not undergone any heat treatment. 49.

B \u2014 Waiver of entry in the accounts and/ or remission/repayment on grounds of fair\u00ad ness and the relevant procedural powers of national authorities and Community authorities 50. By the third and fourth questions, the national court seeks to ascertain what arrangements can be made to ensure that Article 220(2) and the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code are applied uniformly where, in a situation such as the present, the decision is taken by a court whose judgment is open to challenge by an appeal or an appeal in cassation. 51. In order to be able to answer those ques- tions, it is first necessary to clarify whether, in regard to Article 220(2) and the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code, both of which contain provisions applicable on grounds of fairness, there is a need for uniform interpretation and application. The answer to that should be in the affirmative if the criteria to be applied in each case are fully or at least partly identical. 52. To that end, it must first be observed, with regard to the positioning of the two provisions concerned here, that they apply at different points in time. Both form part of Title VII of the Customs Code, \u2018Customs debt\u2019, but are in different chapters within it. Article 220(2) forms part of Chapter 3, \u2018Recovery of the amount of the customs debt\u2019. That chapter covers the principle of entry in the accounts, that is, the calcula- tion and entry \u2018in the accounting records\u2019 of amounts of duty, 40 and questions of detail touching on that process, such as, for example, with Article 220, subsequent entry in the accounts, that is, cases in which no entry has been made initially. At that point in time, there is a question, in the context of Article 220(2) of the Customs Code, of possible waiver, on grounds of fair- ness, of subsequent entry in the accounts. The second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code, on the other hand, forms part of Chapter 5, \u2018Repayment and remis- sion of duty\u2019. The point in time for this lies after entry or subsequent entry. The second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code contains one of several options for the adjustment, by way of repayment or remis- sion, of amounts of duty already entered in the accounts. The provision contains a 40 \u2014 See in detail, regarding the principle of entry in the accounts, Article 217 of the Customs Code. ",

Like Article 220(2) of the Customs Code, Article 239(1) of the same Code thus makes provision for grounds of equity. Both provi- sions pursue the same aim, 44 namely to limit the post-clearance payment of import and export duties to cases where such payment is justified and is compatible with a funda- mental principle such as that of the protec- tion of legitimate expectations. 45 They are thus bound up with considerations of fair- ness and, in particular, with the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations. They overlap in part (as will be explained 41 \u2014 See, inter alia, Case C-230/06 Militzer & M\u00fcnch [2008] ECR I-1895, paragraph 50. 42 \u2014 See, inter alia, Case C-61/98 De Haan [1999] ECR I-5003, paragraph 52, and Case C-62/05 P Nordspedizionieri di Danielis Livio and Others v Commission [2007] ECR I-8647, paragraph 41, regarding earlier versions of the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code and Article 905 of Regulation No 2454/93. 43 \u2014 See my Opinion of 13 March 2008 in Case C-204/07 P CAS v Commission [2008] ECR I-6135, points 68 and 69 with further references. 44 \u2014 Case C-250/91 Hewlett Packard France [1993] ECR I-1819, paragraph 46; Alexander, \u2018Vorbemerkungen zu Art. 220, 221\u2019, in Witte, Zollkodex, Kommentar , 4th edition, 2006, paragraph 5; Huchatz, \u2018Art. 239 \u2014 Erstattung oder Erlass in Sonderf\u00e4llen\u2019, ibid., paragraph 32. 45 \u2014 Hewlett Packard France , cited above in footnote 44, paragraph 46. below) but are not entirely coextensive, 46 resulting in a wider scope for Article 239(1) of the Customs Code as compared with Article 220(2) of the Customs Code. 54. The case-law has already ruled on the question of the identity of certain criteria of Article 220(2) and the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code. 47 In Hewlett Packard France , 48 S\u00f6hl & S\u00f6hlke 49 and Netherlands v Commission , 50 the Court expressly stated that the criteria used in the 46 \u2014 See De Haan , cited above in footnote 42, paragraph 42 in conjunction with paragraph 41, regarding earlier versions of Article 220(2) and the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code. Alexander, \u2018Vorbemerkungen zu Art. 220, 221\u2019, cited above in footnote 44, paragraph 2, points out that Article 220(2) of the Customs Code only partially regulates the protection of legitimate expectations. On the one hand, it does not provide exhaustively for the protection of legit- imate expectations. On the other hand, the provision does not enable mutual fault on the part of the customs authority and the customs debtor to be taken into account in a differ- entiated manner. In order to avoid these shortcomings, declarants increasingly submit parallel applications for repayment or bring actions for damages on the basis of offi- cial liability. Alexander then draws attention to the danger of significant sources of error resulting from the institution of several legally separate sets of proceedings based on the same facts but with widely differing procedural and substan- tive requirements. This generally gives rise to the need for expert professional, extensive and thus expensive advice for debtors and disproportionately high administrative expend- iture on the part of the customs authorities concerned, including the Commission. For reasons of procedural economy, the proceedings are then frequently not dealt with in parallel, but partly suspended. To remedy this situation, a comprehensive reform of subsequent entry in the accounts and of the legislation on remission and repayment is urgently needed. See also Lyons, cited above in footnote 30, p. 496, regarding the fact that the two provisions are not coextensive; he also refers in this regard to the case-law of the Court of First Instance in Case T-42/96 Eyckeler & Malt v C ommission [1998] ECR II-401, paragraph 135 et seq., on the corresponding earlier versions of Article 220(2) and the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code. 47 \u2014 See footnote 46 to this Opinion regarding the fact that the provisions concerned are nevertheless not entirely coextensive. 48 \u2014 Cited above in footnote 44, paragraph 46. 49 \u2014 Cited above in footnote 32, paragraphs 55 and 56. 50 \u2014 Cited above in footnote 26, paragraph 92.

Since, therefore, the criteria concerned here display a high degree of identity, but the relevant decisions are not in any case in the same hands, the uniform application of Community law may be jeopardised in cases of parallel proceedings such as those at issue here. 56. To ensure the uniform application of the common elements of the two provi- sions concerned here and avoid the danger of divergent decisions which lies in parallel proceedings before the Commission and the Community Courts, on the one hand, and the national customs authorities and courts, on the other, the existing case-law of the Court of Justice already provides substan- tial guidelines. Like the Greek Govern- ment, I would cite in that regard the judg- ments concerning customs law in Deutsche Fernsprecher , 51 Mecanarte , 52 Faroe Seafood 51 \u2014 Case C-64/89 [1990] ECR I-2535, paragraph 13. 52 \u2014 Cited above in footnote 16, paragraph 33. and Others 53 and Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Vienne , 54 which, although not delivered in regard to situations involving parallel proceedings, nevertheless concern the divi- sion of competence between the national authorities and the Commission in relation to the post-clearance recovery of duties. Based on the guidelines laid down by those judgments, some transferable principles can be derived from the competition law judgment in Masterfoods and HB , 55 which concerned parallel proceedings before national courts and the Community Courts; indeed, the Netherlands Government has also drawn attention to this. In my view, the abovementioned strands of case-law point in the same direction. 57. In paragraph 33 of the Mecanarte judg- ment, as it had already done previously in Deutsche Fernsprecher , the Court empha- sised in clear terms, in regard to the division of competence between the national author- ities and the Commission in relation to the post-clearance recovery of import duties and export duties, that, in a situation such as this, it is possible for \u2018the uniformity of Commu- nity law to be ensured by the Court of Justice through the preliminary ruling procedure\u2019. If, therefore, the person concerned challenges the post-clearance recovery decision before the national courts, regard must then be had to the need to ensure the uniform application of Community law, at least by way of a refer- ence for a preliminary ruling. 53 \u2014 Joined Cases C-153/94 and C-204/94 [1996] ECR I-2465, paragraph 80. 54 \u2014 Case C-419/04 [2006] ECR I-5645, paragraph 42. 55 \u2014 Case C-344/98 [2000] ECR I-11369.

In the situation which formed the basis of the Mecanarte judgment, there was no need, in the light of the questions referred in that case, to consider in more detail the aspects of those issues which arise here. 59. With regard to the situation to be exam- ined in the present proceedings, in which it is also relevant, for example, whether a court which is not obliged to make a reference under the third paragraph of Article 234 EC and which does not wish to stay its corres- ponding proceedings and await a ruling may nevertheless, by way of exception, be under a duty to make a reference, 56 the Masterfoods and HB judgment offers a continuation of the approach evident from the abovemen- tioned judgments in Deutsche Fernsprecher , Mecanarte , Faroe Seafood and Others and Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Vienne . 60. The situation underlying the Masterfoods and HB judgment 57 also concerned parallel proceedings before national courts and the Community Courts, albeit with regard to Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (now Articles 81 EC and 82 EC). A further contrast with the present situation, moreover, lies 56 \u2014 Recognised, for example, in regard to a declaration that a Community act is invalid, see, inter alia, Case 314/85 Foto\u00ad Frost [1987] ECR 4199, paragraph 20, and Case C-6/99 Greenpeace France and Others [2000] ECR I-1651, para- graph 54.

In paragraph 51 of the Masterfoods and HB judgment, the Court held, with refer- ence to paragraph 47 of the judgment in Delimitis , 58 regarding the application of Articles 85(1) and 86 and Article 85(3) of the EC Treaty, that national courts must, when ruling on agreements or practices which may subsequently be the subject of a deci- sion by the Commission, avoid giving deci- sions which would conflict with a decision contemplated by the Commission. 62. The Court further held, in paragraph 52 of the Masterfoods and HB judgment, that, when national courts rule on agreements or practices which are already the subject of a Commission decision, they cannot take deci- sions running counter to that of the Commis- sion, even if the latter\u2019s decision conflicts with a decision given by a national court of first instance. 58 \u2014 Case C-234/89 [1991] ECR I-935, paragraphs 43 to 54. ",
        "I - 8712 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-375/07 63. In Masterfoods and HB , those findings of the Court were formulated in very general terms and not tailored specifically to situ- ations governed by competition law. I can see no obstacles whatsoever to the transferability of those principles to the sphere of customs law, in which, as is the case here, there is a danger of non-uniform application and divergent decisions on identical points of law in parallel proceedings. 64. The answer given in Masterfoods and HB to the question of what a national court is to do in the event of a situation such as the present, which is characterised by paral- lelism, runs along two different lines: in order to avoid reaching a decision that runs counter to that of the Commission, it should stay its proceedings pending final judgment in the action for annulment by the Commu- nity Courts, unless it takes the view that, in the circumstances of the case, a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling on the validity of the Commission decision is warranted. 59 65. That answer contains a clear prefer- ence for staying the proceedings pending final judgment in the action for annulment, but without precluding the preliminary ruling procedure. That preference for the 59 \u2014 Cited above in footnote 55, paragraphs 57 and 59. overriding judgment in the action for annul- ment is very understandable with respect to situations such as this one, if the extremely different approaches which characterise the procedure in an action for annulment and the preliminary ruling procedure are borne in mind. 60 66. On the other hand, it may also be very useful, where there are special reasons, as, for example, in a situation such as the present, not to wait, but to make a reference to the Court. That is because, in a situation such as here, the Commission decision concerns what is really the secondary question of the remission of import duties, which really ought to take second place to clarification of the fundamental question (post-clearance recovery of the import duties). To clarify that fundamental question, it was neces- sary, in the dispute concerned in this case, to analyse the correct customs classifica- 60 \u2014 In his Opinion in Masterfoods and HB , cited above in foot- note 55, points 40 to 55, Advocate General Cosmas dealt at length with these issues, which also featured prominently in the observations of the parties to those proceedings. Advo- cate General Cosmas mentioned, inter alia, the possibility that parties or a party could attempt to choose the type of procedure and thus decide on the Community judicial procedure. Moreover, the preliminary ruling procedure, which is not geared to the assessment of facts, is unsuitable for reviewing the validity of a Commission decision in the context of answering a question referred for a preliminary ruling, since the exercise of an unrestricted right to review the substance is essential for the effective provision of judi- cial protection with regard to such administrative measures. In my view, it should be added that there are also serious problems at the level of the burden of presentation and proof: this plays a decisive role in an action for annulment but is of no importance in the preliminary ruling procedure. In addition, there is the relatively close structure of the \u2018pleas in law\u2019 in the direct action procedure, which means that much is already decided at the level of admissibility, without reaching the stage of discussion on the substance, and on the other hand the relatively open structure in the preliminary ruling procedure, in which the arguments of all parties to the proceedings (including various Member States which may be taking part) are assessed in substance. As a result, those differences may lead to considerable diffi- culties, depending on the type of procedure by which the matter is first brought before the Court of Justice. ",

The finding that the Masterfoods and HB case-law is transferable is not precluded by judgments such as Sportgoods 62 and Sommer , 63 since they concern a different situation from that in the present case. In both those cases, the Court\u2019s ruling, unlike in this case, concerned a situation in which the Commission decision did not contain any factual or legal indications relating to the legal basis for effecting post-clearance recovery of the import duties concerned under the regulation in issue; in that respect, the Commission decision was not such as to bind all the authorities, including the courts, of the State to which it was addressed. 64 68. In the light of the above, there is, in my view, a need in situations, such as the present, which are characterised by parallel proceed- ings, for the national courts to have regard to the Commission\u2019s decision-making compe- tence, which finds its particular expression in the procedures laid down by Regulation No 2454/93. 61 \u2014 See, in this regard, point 36 of my Opinion in Heuschen & Schrouff Ori\u00ebntal Foods Trading v Commission , cited above in footnote 3. 62 \u2014 Case C-413/96 [1998] ECR I-5285, paragraphs 41 to 43. 63 \u2014 Case C-15/99 [2000] ECR I-8989, paragraph 31. 64 \u2014 Sportgoods , cited above in footnote 62, paragraph 41. 69. In the case of a Commission decision which already exists, annulment of which has been sought in other proceedings, that respect can be ensured primarily by staying the proceedings before the national court pending final judgment in the action for annulment, which should be done right at the outset of the prescribed judicial sequence. As a further option in this situation, although more as a second resort, where special reasons preclude the primary option, there remains that of the reference for a prelim- inary ruling under Article 234 EC. 65 70. In so far as the Commission\u2019s decision is still pending, a special situation exists, as the Commission also emphasised in its observa- tions. That aspect is now of a hypothetical nature, since it goes beyond the scope of the questions referred by the national court. However, since it is of advantage in reaching a decision also to bear in mind potential situations and to review the contemplated solution in the light of them, I propose to examine it briefly. I share the Commission\u2019s view that respect for the Commission\u2019s deci- sion-making competence in such a situation would probably dictate that the national court should stay the proceedings pending adoption of that decision. 66 Otherwise there 65 \u2014 In that regard, however, it should be noted that, where the period for bringing an action for annulment under the fifth paragraph of Article 230 EC has already expired and the Commission decision in question has thus become definitive as against its addressee, that Community measure producing legal effects cannot be called into question again by means of an action before national courts and any associ- ated reference for a preliminary ruling (see Case C-188/92 TWD Textilwerke Deggendorf [1994] ECR I-833, para- graphs 13 to 26, and Case C-178/95 Wiljo [1997] ECR I-585, paragraphs 20 to 31. 66 \u2014 This is also supported by paragraph 48 of De Haan , cited above in footnote 42.

        "I - 8714 OPINION OF MS TRSTENJAK \u2014 CASE C-375/07 would be a danger that the judicial decision would anticipate the Commission\u2019s decision, thus taking its place. 71. In order to safeguard in practice the type of cooperation between national and Community courts described above, it is necessary, in my view, for any national court dealing with such concurrent points of Community law to ascertain, by seeking information of its own motion, whether an application to be regarded as parallel has been submitted or may still timeously be submitted, 67 on which the Commission must decide, and what stage (decision, legal finality), if any, it has reached. 68 72. One specific aspect of the third ques- tion referred by the Hoge Raad der Neder- landen still remains to be examined. That question specifically seeks the interpretation of Article 871(1) of Regulation No 2454/93, which contains procedural requirements 67 \u2014 For example, in the case of an application under Article 239(2) of the Customs Code, there is a prescribed period of 12 months from the date on which the amount of the duties was communicated, which may be extended only in exceptional cases. 68 \u2014 For such information, since it concerns the question of submitted applications, information provided by the parties to the proceedings in question will, in many cases, suffice. Otherwise, it should be noted that there is also the option, where appropriate, of seeking information from the Commission on the state of any procedure before it. Under Article 10 EC, the Commission is bound by a duty of sincere cooperation with the judicial authorities of the Member State; see, in this regard, Delimitis , cited above in footnote 58, paragraph 53 with further reference. applicable to the national customs author- ities. The background to that question, as may be gathered from the submissions of the Netherlands Government with reference to Article 8:72(4) of the Algemene Wet Bestu- ursrecht, is that, under that provision, the annulling judgment may give the Nether- lands customs authorities directions and set them conditions for proceeding further. Such a condition could, for example, consist in the national customs authorities now being required to transmit the debtor\u2019s application to the Commission, since a decision favour- able to the debtor is considered a possibility. 73. That raises a further possible way for the national court to ensure a uniform inter- pretation of Article 220(2) and the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code, namely, by annulling the national customs authority\u2019s decision without thereby taking a decision in the matter itself. It should be noted in that regard that, in so far as national procedural law contains such a possibility of annulling the national authority\u2019s decision and referring the matter back to it on certain conditions, that also may be a manner of proceeding which is consistent with Commu- nity law, 69 so long as the Commission\u2019s deci- sion-making competence is respected. 69 \u2014 However, in that regard, it should be borne in mind, in a case such as the present, that since the change in the legal situ- ation with effect from 1 August 2003 (see above, points 16 to 19 of this Opinion), to which the Italian Government has also drawn attention in this context, the possibility of trans- mission to the Commission has been significantly restricted.

On the basis of the foregoing considerations, I propose that the Court answer as follows the questions referred by the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden: \u2018(1) Sheets as described in the Annex to Regulation No 1196/97 come under heading 1905 of the Combined Nomenclature if they are prepared from rice flour, salt and water and then dried, but do not undergo any heat treatment. (2) In the light of the answer to the first question, Regulation No 1196/97 is valid. (3) With a view to a uniform interpretation of Community law, national courts, irrespective of their position in the judicial hierarchy, must respect the Commis- sion\u2019s decision-making competence where criteria in the Customs Code are identical in substance. In order to avoid giving a decision which runs counter to the Commission\u2019s decision in parallel proceedings concerning (partly) identical provisions, the national court should stay the proceedings pending final judg- ment by the Community Courts in the action for annulment, unless it forms the view that, in the circumstances of the case, a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling on the validity of the Commission decision is warranted. A further possibility would be to refer the matter back to the national customs authorities on condition that they transmit the case to the Commission by means of the procedure for administrative cooperation between the customs authorities and the Commission.\u2019 ",

It has been importing rice paper from Vietnam for that purpose for many years. H & S was already importing that product in 1996 under subheading 1901 90 99 of the CN. That tariff classification was accepted on numerous occasions by the Neth- erlands customs authorities (\u2018the customs authorities\u2019), even after inspections and analyses carried out on samples of the imported consignments. On 27 June 1997, the Commission adopted the Classification Regulation, which provides that the goods in question in fact come under subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN. That regulation was published in the Official Journal of the European Commu\u00ad nities on 28 June 1997 and entered into force on 19 July 1997. H & S, however, continued to classify the rice paper which it imported under subheading 1901 90 99. The customs authorities also continued to accept its declar- ations, on the last occasions on 14 July 1997 and 16 March 1998. Then, on 16 March 1998, the customs authorities became aware of the incorrect classification and 22 23 24 25 ",
        "I - 8730 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-375/07 informed H & S that the goods were covered by the heading laid down by the Clas- sification Regulation, namely subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN. Thereafter, H & S declared its foodstuffs under that heading. In the course of 2000, the customs authorities informed H & S that they intended to proceed with post-clearance recovery of the duties which ought to have been paid under subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN in respect of the period from 25 November 1997 to 2 February 1998. H & S thereupon applied for remission of those duties. The Commission, to which an application was submitted in accordance with Article 905 of the Implementing Regulation on 19 September 2002, adopted Decision REM 19/2002 on 17 June 2004 finding that remission of import duties was not justified in that particular case (\u2018the decision of 17 June 2004\u2019). That decision was disputed by H & S in an action for annulment brought on 23 September 2004 before the Court of First Instance of the European Communities. H & S appealed against the Court of First Instance\u2019s judg- ment of 30 November 2006 in Case T-382/04 Heuschen & Schrouff Ori\u00ebntal Foods v Commission , not published in the ECR, which dismissed that action, the appeal being registered at the Registry of the Court as Case C-38/07 P. On 22 November 2000, the customs authorities sent H & S a notice for recovery of NLG 645 399.50 (EUR 292 869.52). In response to an objection lodged by H & S, the Inspector confirmed the demands for payment, with the exception of a sum of NLG 13 650.30, following the annulment of a customs declaration. On 29 March 2001, H & S appealed to the Tariefcommissie (Customs and Excise Tribunal), which was replaced, in the course of the proceedings, by the Gerechtshof 26 27 28 29 ",
        "I - 8731 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING te Amsterdam (Amsterdam Regional Court of Appeal). On 7 December 2004, the Gerechtshof te Amsterdam ruled that the appeal was well founded and set aside the Inspector\u2019s decision and the demands for payment. Although the Gerechtshof confirmed that the rice sheets were covered by subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN, it found that the erroneous application of subheading 1901 90 99 of the CN stemmed from an error on the part of the customs authorities which could not reasonably have been detected by H & S and which made possible, pursuant to Article 220 of the Customs Code, waiver of the post-clearance recovery of the duties thereby avoided. The Staatssecretaris van Financi\u00ebn appealed in cassation to the Hoge Raad against the application by the Gerechtshof te Amsterdam of Article 220 of the Customs Code, whilst H & S lodged a cross-appeal for a declaration that its goods were in fact covered by subheading 1901 90 99 of the CN. According to the order for reference, it is common ground that the imported goods consist of rice flour, water and salt, which are blended and kneaded and then pressed and dried. Those goods are not intended for consumption without first being heat-treated. As regards the cross-appeal, the referring court states that, according to the Explana- tory Notes to the HS, heading 1905 of the CN is characterised less by the fact that it relates to baked goods than by the fact that it concerns goods which are thin in form. However, it states, it is also possible to maintain, on the basis of the Court\u2019s case-law, that headings 1901 and 1905 of the CN are distinguishable on the ground that the former heading relates to unbaked goods whereas the latter concerns baked goods. 30 31 32 33 ",
        "I - 8732 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-375/07 As the Classification Regulation places rice sheets unreservedly under heading 1905 of the CN, the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden takes the view that the Court of Justice must be asked to rule on the validity of that regulation. As regards the main appeal, the Hoge Raad states that the Gerechtshof te Amsterdam accepted, in its decision of 7 December 2004, that the three criteria relating to the detectability of the error on the part of the customs authorities and necessary for the application of Article 220 of the Customs Code had been met, even though the Commission had decided, on 17 June 2004, that those same criteria had not been met as regards the assessment of the trader\u2019s diligence for the purposes of the application of Article 239 of the Customs Code and that decision was upheld by the Court of First Instance in its judgment in Heuschen & Schrouff Ori\u00ebntal Foods v Commission , which rejected H & S\u2019s action brought against the decision of 17 June 2004. According to the Hoge Raad, the question is that of which decision a national customs authority must follow when the Commission and the national court adopt two diver- gent positions as regards the assessment of the abovementioned three criteria. More specifically, the matter in issue is that of defining the powers of the national court in relation to those of the Commission with respect to the application of those criteria. The Hoge Raad observes that, if the customs authorities take the view that the condi- tions laid down by the Customs Code may be satisfied, they are required to transmit the case to the Commission, which is then to decide whether or not it is necessary to proceed to post-clearance recovery of the import duties (Article 220 of the Customs Code) or whether remission of those duties is justified (Article 239 of the Customs Code). If that it is done, the uniform application of Community law is ensured. 34 35 36 37 ",
        "I - 8733 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING However, the position will be otherwise where the customs authorities decide that the conditions for the application of Article 220 of the Customs Code have not been satisfied. In those circumstances, they do not refer the matter to the Commis- sion and, if the party concerned appeals against the decision of those authorities, it will then be for the national court to decide whether the conditions for dispensing with post-clearance recovery have or have not been met. The uniform application of Community law may then be ensured by the preliminary reference procedure. However, when the decision given by the national court may be subject to appeal, there will be no obligation on that court to stay the proceedings in order to refer a question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. In those circumstances, the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden decided to stay the proceed- ings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \u2018(1) Do sheets as described in the Annex to [the Classification Regulation] come under heading 1905 of the [CN] if they are prepared from rice flour, salt and water and then dried, but do not undergo any heat treatment? (2) In the light of the answer to Question 1, is [the Classification Regulation] valid? (3) Must Article 871 of [the Implementing Regulation] be construed as meaning that if, under the first paragraph of Article 871(1) thereof, there is an obligation on the customs authority to transmit a case to the Commission before it can decide to 38 39 ",

(4) If the answer to Question 3 should be that the fact that the Commission has the power to take a decision in regard to demands for post-clearance recovery of customs duties does not involve any limitation on the jurisdiction of national courts which are called on to rule in an appeal concerning a demand for post- clearance recovery of customs duties, does Community law contain any sep - arate provision which guarantees uniform application of Community law in the specific case where there is a discrepancy between the views of the Commis- sion and those of the national court concerning the criteria to be applied in the context of Article 220 of the Customs Code for the purpose of determining whether a mistake on the part of the customs authority could have been detected by a tax debtor?\u2019 The questions referred for a preliminary ruling The first and second questions By its first two questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the Hoge Raad seeks to ascertain, in essence, whether sheets prepared from rice flour, salt and water, which are then dried, but do not undergo any heat treatment, are covered by subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN and, if necessary, whether the Classification Regu- lation is valid. 40 ",
        "I - 8735 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING \u2014 Observations submitted to the Court H & S takes the view that heading 1905 of the CN relates only to baked goods which may be consumed straight away, as the Court suggested in paragraph 12 of the judg- ment in Case C-12/94 Uelzena Milchwerke [1995] ECR I-2397. Consequently, it argues, the Classification Regulation should be declared invalid. The Netherlands, Greek and Italian Governments and the Commission are of the opinion that heading 1905 of the CN does not relate specifically to goods which are baked or may be consumed immediately and that the classification of rice sheets under subheading 1905 90 20 is not contrary to the Combined Nomenclature. They therefore consider that the Classification Regulation is valid. \u2014 The Court\u2019s reply First of all, it must be borne in mind that the decisive criterion for the classification of goods for customs purposes is in general to be sought in their objective characteris- tics and properties as defined in, inter alia, the wording of the relevant tariff heading and in the section or chapter notes (Case C-142/06 Olicom [2007] ECR I-6675, para- graph 16 and the case-law cited). In that regard, both the notes which head the chapters of the Common Customs Tariff and the Explanatory Notes to the HS are important means of ensuring the uniform application of the Tariff and as such may be regarded as useful aids to its interpretation ( Olicom , paragraph 17, and the case-law cited). 41 42 43 44 ",
        "I - 8736 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-375/07 It is true, as submitted by the appellant in the main proceedings, that the Dutch version of the wording of heading 1905 of the CN, unlike a number of other language versions, does not expressly refer to sheets of flour or starch pastes and other similar products, which must be \u2018dried\u2019. The Dutch version refers only to goods in the form of sheets. However, according to settled case-law, the need for a uniform interpretation of Community regulations makes it impossible for the text of a provision to be consid- ered in isolation but requires, on the contrary, that it should be interpreted and applied in the light of the versions existing in the other official languages (Case C-48/98 S\u00f6hl & S\u00f6hlke [1999] ECR I-7877, paragraph 46). As regards heading 1901 of the CN on which H & S relies, that heading, as its wording expressly states, clearly relates only to food preparations of flour, meal, starch or malt extract not specified or included elsewhere in the CN. That heading is thus residual in nature and cannot cover goods the description of which corresponds to other headings of the relevant chapter of the CN. Furthermore, subheading 1901 90 99 of the CN, under which the goods at issue in the main proceedings were declared, corresponds to \u2018other\u2019 goods, that is to say, goods which cannot be classified under any other subheading of the residual heading 1901. As the Advocate General stated at points 43 and 44 of her Opinion, the reference to \u2018rice paper\u2019 or to \u2018dried\u2019 goods is included expressly in the wording of several language versions of subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN. 45 46 47 48 ",
        "I - 8737 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING Secondly, contrary to what H & S maintains in its written observations before the Court, none of the language versions refers to the requirement that the goods covered by that subheading must necessarily be baked. The only reference to the state of the goods covered by heading 1905 of the CN and, more particularly, by subheading 1905 90 20 thereof, concerns the fact that they must be in \u2018dried\u2019 form. The Commission\u2019s explanatory note relating to subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN refers to the \u2018HS Explanatory Notes to heading 1905, paragraph (B)\u2019. As the Nether- lands Government has pointed out, those notes refer to a number of products made from flour or starch which are generally baked in the form of discs or sheets and are used for various purposes. Thus, according to the Commission\u2019s and the HS Explana- tory Notes, the fact of being baked is not a characteristic which is necessary in order for a product to be classified under subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN. Lastly, it cannot be inferred from paragraph 12 of Uelzena Milchwerke that the Court intended to restrict the application of heading 1905 of the CN to \u2018baked\u2019 goods alone. It is true that in paragraph 12 of that judgment the Court held that the classification of \u2018[b]read, pastry, cakes, biscuits and other bakers\u2019 wares\u2026\u2019 under heading 1905 and of \u2018[s]weet biscuits; waffles and wafers\u2019 under subheading 1905 30 presupposed that the goods concerned had been cooked at least once. However, it is clear that that assessment related only to the first category of products in the wording of heading 1905, namely that of \u2018[b]read, pastry, cakes, biscuits and other bakers\u2019 wares, whether or not containing cocoa\u2019, which is covered by paragraph A of the HS explanatory note relating to heading 1905. Having regard to the foregoing, the classification under subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN of foodstuffs prepared from rice flour, salt and water in the form of dried, translucent sheets or discs of various sizes is in accordance with the wording of that subheading. 49 50 51 52 ",
        "I - 8738 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-375/07 The answer to the first two questions must therefore be that: \u2014 sheets prepared from rice flour, salt and water which are then dried, but do not undergo any heat treatment, are covered by subheading 1905 90 20 of the CN; \u2014 examination of the question referred has disclosed no factor of such a kind as to affect the validity of the Classification Regulation. The third and fourth questions By its third and fourth questions, which it is appropriate to deal with together, the Hoge Raad essentially asks whether, when the Commission has already decided in a particular case on the conditions for the application of the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code, a national court ruling on an appeal against a notice for recovery of import duties relating to the case is bound by that Commission decision when it assesses that case under Article 220 of the Customs Code. \u2014 Observations submitted to the Court H & S is of the opinion that a national court, ruling on the conditions for the applica- tion of Article 220 of the Customs Code to a particular case, cannot be bound by a Commission decision on that case under Article 239 of the Customs Code since the preliminary reference procedure ensures that Community law is applied uniformly. 53 54 55 ",
        "I - 8739 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING The Netherlands, Greek and Italian Governments and the Commission take the view that such a Commission decision is binding on the national court and that, if it wishes to deviate from it, it must either stay the proceedings until a final judgment has been given by the Community Courts before which an action for the annulment of that decision has been brought or seek a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice as to its validity. \u2014 The Court\u2019s reply It must be stated at the outset that the procedures provided for in Articles 220 and 239 of the Customs Code pursue the same aim, namely to limit the post-clearance payment of import and export duties to cases where such payment is justified and is compatible with a fundamental principle such as that of the protection of legitimate expectations (see Case C-250/91 Hewlett Packard France [1993] ECR I-1819, para- graph 46, and S\u00f6hl & S\u00f6hlke , paragraph 54). It follows that the conditions to which the application of those articles is made subject, that is to say, in particular, that no obvious negligence may be attributed to the person concerned in the case of the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code and that no error has been made by the customs authorities which could reasonably have been detected by the person liable in the case of Article 220 of the Customs Code, must be interpreted in the same manner (see, to that effect, S\u00f6hl & S\u00f6hlke , paragraph 54). Consequently, as the Court has previously held, in order to determine whether or not a trader has demonstrated \u2018obvious negligence\u2019, within the meaning of the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code, it is appropriate to apply by analogy the criteria used in the context of Article 220 of the Customs Code to ascertain 56 57 58 59 ",
        "I - 8740 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-375/07 whether or not an error committed by the customs authorities was detectable by a trader (see S\u00f6hl and S\u00f6hlke , paragraphs 55 and 56, and Case C-156/00 Netherlands v Commission [2003] ECR I-2527, paragraph 92). Under the procedures provided for in Articles 871 and 905 of the Implementing Regulation, in cases other than those referred to in Articles 869 and 899 of that regu- lation, where the customs authorities consider that the conditions laid down respect - ively in Article 220(2)(b) and the second indent of Article 239(1) of the Customs Code have been satisfied, those authorities or the Member State to which they belong must submit the case to the Commission in order for it to determine whether those conditions have in fact been satisfied. In that regard, it appears that, with the exception of the specific cases provided for by the legislation, the Community legislature intended to entrust to the assessment of the Commission those cases in which budgetary revenue payable as a matter of course ought to be waived, on the basis that customs duties levied on the importation of goods into Community territory constitute own resources of the budget of the European Communities. Such a finding is borne out by the powers conferred on the Commission by Articles 875 and 908(3) of the Implementing Regulation, pursuant to which the Commission may, under conditions which it is to determine, authorise one or more Member States to refrain from post-clearance entry of duties in the accounts and repay or remit duties in cases involving issues of fact and law com - parable to those which the Commission has already examined in previous decisions. As the Court has already stated, the objective of conferring on the Commission a power of decision in regard to the post-clearance recovery of customs duties is to ensure the uniform application of Community law. That is likely to be jeopardised in cases where an application to waive post-clearance recovery is allowed, since the assessment which a Member State may make in taking a favourable decision 60 61 62 ",
        "I - 8741 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING is likely, in actual fact, owing to the probable absence of any appeal, to escape any review by means of which the uniform application of the conditions laid down in the Community legislation may be ensured. On the other hand, that is not the case where the national authorities proceed to effect recovery, whatever the amount in issue, because, in those circumstances, it is still open to the person concerned to challenge such a decision before the national courts (Case C-419/04 Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Vienne [2006] ECR I-5645, paragraph 42 and the case-law cited). In such cases, it is thus for the national court to assess whether, having regard to the circumstances of the case, those conditions have been satisfied and, as a result, it will then be possible for the uniformity of Community law to be ensured by the Court of Justice through the preliminary ruling procedure (see, to that effect, Case C-64/89 Deutsche Fernsprecher [1990] ECR I-2535, paragraph 13, and Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Vienne , paragraph 42 and the case-law cited). However, where an application for remission of import duties has been submitted to the Commission by a Member State for the purposes of Article 239 of the Customs Code and the Commission has already adopted a decision containing assessments of fact and law in a particular case concerning import operations, such assessments bind all the authorities of the Member State to which it was addressed, in accord- ance with Article 249 EC, including the courts which have to assess the same case under Article 220 of the Customs Code (see, to that effect, Case C-413/96 Sportgoods [1998] ECR I-5285, paragraph 41). Therefore, the requirements connected with the uniform application of Commu- nity law demand that, in respect of the same import transactions carried out by a trader, a Commission decision on the existence of \u2018obvious negligence\u2019 on the part of that trader cannot be deprived of effect by a subsequent decision of a national court ruling on whether or not the error committed by the national customs authorities was \u2018detectable\u2019 by that same trader. 63 64 65 ",
        "I - 8742 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-375/07 A national court, such as the Gerechtshof te Amsterdam in the present case, ruling on an appeal against a notice for recovery of import duties, must therefore, when it becomes aware in the course of the proceedings before it that the matter has been referred to the Commission pursuant to Article 220 or Article 239 of the Customs Code, avoid giving decisions which would conflict with a decision contemplated by the Commission in the implementation of those articles (see, by analogy, Case C-234/89 Delimitis [1991] ECR I-935, paragraph 47, and Case C-344/98 Masterfoods and HB [2000] ECR I-11369, paragraph 51). That means that the referring court, which may not substitute its own determination for that of the Commission, can stay proceedings pending the Commission\u2019s decision (see, to that effect, Case C-61/98 De Haan [1999] ECR I-5003, paragraph 48). In any event, as the Court has pointed out in, inter alia, proceedings relating to Art - icles 81 EC and 82 EC, if a national court has doubts as to the validity or interpretation of an act of a Community institution it may, or must, in accordance with the second and third paragraphs of Article 234 EC, refer a question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling (see Masterfoods and HB , paragraph 54). If, as here in the main proceedings, the importer has, within the period prescribed in the fifth paragraph of Article 230 EC, brought an action for annulment of a Commission decision in respect of an application for remission of duties pursuant to Article 239 of the Customs Code, it is for the national court to decide whether to stay the proceedings until a definitive decision has been given in the action for annulment or to refer a question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling as to validity (see, by analogy, Masterfoods and HB , paragraph 55). By contrast, if the Commission takes a decision on a particular case under Article 239 of the Customs Code, it cannot be bound by a decision given previously by a national court ruling on the conditions for the application to that same case of Article 220 of the Customs Code (see, by analogy, Masterfoods and HB , paragraph 48). 66 67 68 69 ",
        "I - 8743 HEUSCHEN & SCHROUFF ORI\u00cbNTAL FOODS TRADING Having regard to the foregoing, the answer to the third and fourth questions must be that: \u2014 where an application for remission of import duties has been submitted to the Commission by a Member State under Article 239 of the Customs Code and the Commission has already adopted a decision containing assessments of fact and law in a particular case concerning import transactions, such assessments bind all the authorities of the Member State to which that decision was addressed, in accordance with Article 249 EC, including the courts which have to assess that case under Article 220 of the Customs Code; \u2014 if the importer has, within the period prescribed in the fifth paragraph of Article 230 EC, brought an action for annulment of a Commission decision in respect of an application for remission of import duties pursuant to Article 239 of the Customs Code, it is for the national court to decide whether to stay the proceedings until a definitive decision has been given in the action for annulment or to refer itself a question to the Court for a preliminary ruling as to validity. Costs Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: 1.

It is clear from Article 6(2)(b) of that dir - ective that in spite of the part played by the Commission, the Member States have a broad discretion both as regards their deci- sion to make use of the exemption provided for under that article and as regards the content of the measure envisaged, without the Commission\u2019s approval of that measure making it in any way obligatory to use that possibility. Thus, the aim and effect of Deci- sion 2005/449 is not to compel the French Republic to grant the exemption proposed in its request for authorisation, but to authorise it to make such an exemption if it so wishes. The fact that Decision 2005/449 does not specify the date from which it first applies, but merely sets the expiry date for the approved exemption as 31 December 2009, does not affect the scope and the effects of that decision. Indeed, under the terms of Article 254(3) EC, Decision 2005/449 takes effect upon its notification to the addressee, in this case the French Republic. The fact remains that one such effect is to make possible an exemption \u2014 which, in the present case, does not yet exist and which cannot be implemented without a national legislative act \u2014 but in no way to impose such an exemption.

        "I - 8747 FOSELEV SUD-OUEST OPINION OF ADVOCATE GENERAL KOKOTT delivered on 25 September 2008 1 I \u2014 Introduction 1. The French Republic intended to exempt certain heavy goods vehicles from vehicle tax ( taxe sp\u00e9ciale sur certains v\u00e9hicules routiers , also referred to as taxe \u00e0 l\u2019essieu (axle tax)). Directive 1999/62/EC of the European Parlia- ment and of the Council of 17 June 1999 on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures 2 harmonises that tax. According to that directive, appli- cation of the exemption required the agree- ment of the Commission, which the latter also gave in the form of a decision addressed to the French Republic. The French decree which introduced the exemption was not enacted until more than one year later. 2. It is now in dispute whether a taxable person, relying directly on the Commission\u2019s decision, is entitled to exemption from the tax in respect of the period prior to the enact- ment of the decree. That question has arisen 1 \u2014 Original language: German. 2 \u2014 OJ 1999 L 187, p. 42. not only before the Tribunal d\u2019instance de Bordeaux (Court of First Instance, Bordeaux) (France), which has submitted the present reference to the Court. Indeed, other courts of first instance, as well as the Cour d\u2019appel de Lyon (Court of Appeal, Lyon) (France), have already given divergent rulings on the matter. II \u2014 Legal framework 3. Article 6(2) of Directive 1999/62 provides: \u2018Member States may apply reduced rates or exemptions for: \u2026 (b) vehicles which travel only occasionally on the public roads of the Member State of registration and are used by natural or ",

After the French Republic had applied for the Commission\u2019s agreement to the exemption of certain vehicles, the Commis- sion adopted, on 20 June 2005, Decision 2005/449/EC, 3 which was published in the Official Journal of the European Commu\u00ad nities on 21 June 2005. The Decision states: \u2018Article 1 The Commission hereby gives its agreement to exempt until 31 December 2009 from vehicle tax in accordance with Article 6(2)(b) of Directive 1999/62/EC the following vehicles of 12 tonnes or more, which are used exclusively for the carriage of permanently installed equipment for public and industrial works in France: 3 \u2014 Commission Decision 2005/449/EC of 20 June 2005 concerning a request for exemption from the vehicle tax rules submitted by France pursuant to Article 6(2)(b) of Directive 1999/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (OJ 2005 L 158, p. 23). 1.

        "I - 8749 FOSELEV SUD-OUEST Article 2 This Decision is addressed to the French Republic.\u2019 5. By way of Decree No 2006-818 of 7 July 2006, which was published on 9 July 2006 in the Official Journal of the French Republic , the French State exempted the vehicles referred to in Decision 2005/449 from vehicle tax until 31 December 2009. III \u2014 The facts, reference for a prelim- inary ruling and proceedings 6. In the dispute in the main proceedings, Foselev Sud-Ouest SARL (\u2018Foselev\u2019) seeks from the Administration des douanes et des droits indirects (French Customs and Excise Authority) the refund of EUR 1 973.74 in respect of vehicle tax together with interest and costs, which it was unduly required to pay from 20 June 2005 to 9 July 2006. The applicant claims that its entitlement to the tax exemption already results directly from Commission Decision 2005/449, with the result that no further tax was payable from the time at which that decision was adopted, and not merely from the time at which the decree entered into force. 7. By judgment of 4 December 2007 the Tribunal d\u2019instance de Bordeaux, before which the dispute was brought, referred the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: Article 6(2)(b) of Directive 1999/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 1999 on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infra- structures provides for the possibility for a Member State to exempt certain categories of vehicle [from vehicle tax]. In this context, is the authorisation given to France by the Commission, in Decision 2005/449/EC, to exempt certain categories of vehicles directly applicable to individuals or, as it concerns an authorisation decision addressed to France, is a measure transposing it into national law necessary? 8. Foselev, the French and Italian Govern- ments and the Commission of the Euro- pean Communities have submitted written observations to the Court. There was no oral hearing. ",
        "I - 8750 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-18/08 IV \u2014 Legal assessment 9. Pursuant to the fourth paragraph of Article 249 EC, decisions are binding in their entirety upon those to whom they are addressed. Decision 2005/449 is addressed to the French Republic pursuant to Article 2 thereof. 10. However, as the Court has already held, it would be incompatible with the binding effect attributed to decisions by Article 249 EC to exclude in principle the possibility that persons affected may invoke the obli- gation imposed by a decision. 4 Accord- ingly, a provision of a decision addressed to a Member State may be relied on as against that Member State where the provision in question imposes on its addressee an obliga- tion which is unconditional and sufficiently clear and precise. 5 4 \u2014 Case 9/70 Grad [1970] ECR 825, paragraph 5, and Case C-156/91 Hansa Fleisch [1992] ECR I-5567, paragraph 12. See in detail, also, as regards the direct effect of decisions, the Opinion of Advocate General Trstenjak in Case C-80/06 Carp [2007] ECR I-4473, point 55 et seq . ). 5 \u2014 Grad (cited in footnote 4), paragraph 9, and Hansa Fleisch (cited in footnote 4), paragraph 13. 11. Unlike the governments which submitted observations and the Commis- sion, Foselev takes the view that Decision 2005/449 imposes an obligation on the French Republic to introduce the exemption referred to therein. 12. The question whether the Decision gives rise to an unconditional and sufficiently clear and precise obligation to exempt the ve- hicles specified from the tax from a certain date must be resolved having regard to its wording and the basis on which that deci- sion is authorised, namely Article 6(2)(b) of Directive 1999/62. 13. The wording of Decision 2005/449 does not establish any such obligation. On the contrary, Article 1 of the Decision confines itself to giving the Commission\u2019s agreement to the measures requested by France. It is true that the provision allows the exemp- tion only until 31 December 2009. It does not, however, set a date from which the exemption is to begin to apply. The French Republic was therefore free, even after the adoption of the agreement decision, to intro- duce the approved exemption at any point in time prior to 31 December 2009 through the enactment of the corresponding decree or possibly even to make no use whatsoever of the authorisation. ",
        "I - 8751 FOSELEV SUD-OUEST 14. Article 6(2)(b) of Directive 1999/62 gives the Member States the option of exempting from tax the vehicles referred to in the provi- sion or of making them subject to reduced rates of tax, as is unambiguously clear from the use of the words \u2018may apply\u2019. Accord- ingly, the Member States enjoy discretion as to whether to make use of the option for which the Directive provides. 15. The application of the corresponding national exemption rules is conditional on the Commission\u2019s agreement. As the Commission correctly states in its written observations, its decision to agree to the tax exemption cannot transform the discretion which the Directive confers on the Member State into a duty to adopt the exemption. 16. It is true that, in the judgment in Hansa Fleisch , the Court stated that the mere fact that a decision allows the Member States to which it is addressed to derogate from clear and precise provisions of that decision does not in itself deprive those provisions of direct effect. 6 17. The legal situation in Hansa Fleisch is not, however, comparable to that in the present case. The decision applicable in Hansa Fleisch set a flat-rate fee for meat hygiene inspections but allowed the Member States to apply fees which derogated from that flat-rate and which corresponded to the actual costs of the inspections. Unlike Deci- sion 2005/449, the decision in Hansa Fleisch therefore laid down an obligation to charge certain fees. That decision did, admittedly, permit the Member States to set fees which derogated from the flat-rate fees. However, that decision also laid down conditions relating to the operation of those national derogations. In that situation, the Court considered it necessary that the individual person paying the charge should be able to rely directly on the decision before a national court for verification of whether the deroga- tion from the flat-rate fees satisfied the terms of the decision. 7 6 \u2014 Hansa Fleisch (cited in footnote 4), paragraph 15. 7 \u2014 See Hansa Fleisch (cited in footnote 4), paragraph 15, which refers to Case 41/74 Van Duyn [1974] ECR 1337, paragraph 7. ",
        "I - 8752 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-18/08 18. The findings of the Court in Hansa Fleisch cannot therefore be transposed to the present case, since neither Decision 2005/449 nor Directive 1999/62, which forms the basis of that decision, imposes an obligation on the Member States to introduce the tax exemp- tion, compliance with which would have to be subject to judicial review. In the period in respect of which Foselev seeks the tax refund, there were, in addition, still no national implementation measures whatsoever, the operation of which would have required judi- cial review in the light of the Commission\u2019s decision. 19. A parallel with the Hansa Fleisch case could possibly have been drawn if the Commission had allowed the French Republic to apply a reduced rate to certain categories of vehicles and subsequently tax rates derogating from those reduced rates had been applied. That is not, however, the case. The fact thus remains that Decision 2005/449 does not impose on the French Republic any obligation to apply the exemp- tion from a specific point in time. 20. Foselev\u2019s reference to Article 254(3) EC alters nothing in this regard. According to that provision, decisions are to be notified to those to whom they are addressed and are to take effect upon such notification. However, only the rule which the decision in question also actually contains is to take effect. 21. The notification of Decision 2005/449 to the French Republic (or possibly also its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities 8 ) therefore has the effect that the agreement to the application of the exemption takes effect. If the French legislature had already enacted the decree before the agreement had been given and made application of the decree subject to the suspensive condition that the Commission should agree to the measure, Foselev could already have relied on the exemption from the time at which the Decision took effect. 9 In that case, however, the exemption would not have resulted directly from the Decision but from the decree. However, the national legislature chose a different course of action, which was also open to it: it waited for the Commission\u2019s agreement and enacted the decree which incorporated the exemption into national tax law only after that agree- ment had been given. The fact that more than one year elapsed between the two meas- ures is irrelevant from the point of view of Community law. 8 \u2014 See also, on the connection between notification and publica- tion in the Official Journal, my Opinion of 13 December 2007 in Case C-413/06 P Bertelsmann and Others v Impala , [2008] ECR I-4951, point 82. 9 \u2014 If one were to go along with Foselev\u2019s legal position, the French legislature would either have had to proceed in this way or give retroactive effect to the exemption, since other- wise there would still have been an infringement of the \u2018obli- gation\u2019 to introduce the exemption in the period between the notification of the decision and the enactment of the decree.

Rather, entitlement to the tax exemption arises only once the Member State concerned has adopted a measure transposing the exemption into national law.\u2019 ",

The reference was made in the course of proceedings brought by Foselev Sud-Ouest SARL (\u2018Foselev\u2019) seeking an order directing the Administration des douanes et droits indirects (administrative authority for customs and indirect taxes) to refund the sum of EUR 1 973.74 that it claims to have been unduly required to pay between 20 June 2005 and 9 July 2006 by way of axle tax, a tax on motor vehicles weighing 12 tonnes or more which are not specially designed for the carriage of persons, plus interest and costs.

        "I - 8758 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-18/08 The dispute in the main proceedings and the question referred for a preliminary ruling It is apparent from the order for reference that Foselev carries on business in the following sectors: lifting, handling, haulage, industrial maintenance, industrial piping, industrial cleaning and modular construction. Foselev maintains that axle tax has no longer been payable on the vehicles covered by Decision 2005/449 since 20 June 2005, the date on which that decision was adopted. The Administration des douanes et droits indirects argues, however, that the exemp- tion relied on by Foselev did not enter into force until the date on which Decree No 2006-818 was published in the Journal official de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise , that is to say, 9 July 2006. On the view that the dispute before it raises the question whether Decision 2005/449, which authorises the French Republic to exempt certain specified vehicles from axle tax, places that Member State under an obligation to implement the exemp- tion approved, and is therefore capable of producing direct effects in the relationship between the French tax authorities and Foselev, the Tribunal d\u2019instance de Bordeaux decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \u2018Article 6(2)(b) of Directive 1999/62 \u2026 provides for the possibility for a Member State to exempt [from the taxes covered by that directive] certain categories of vehicle. In this context, is the authorisation given to [the French Republic] by the Commission, in Decision [2005/449], to exempt certain categories of vehicle directly applicable to individuals or, as it concerns an authorisation decision addressed to [the French Republic], is a measure transposing it into national law necessary?\u2019 6 7 8 ",
        "I - 8759 FOSELEV SUD-OUEST The question referred for a preliminary ruling By its question, the referring court asks essentially whether Decision 2005/449 approving, pursuant to Article 6(2)(b) of Directive 1999/62, the exemption from axle tax envisaged by the French Republic may be relied on by an individual against that Member State in order to obtain the benefit of that exemption upon the notification or publication of that decision. In that connection, the fourth paragraph of Article 249 EC provides that a decision is to be binding in its entirety upon those to whom it is addressed. In the present case, it is evident that the addressee of Decision 2005/449 is the French Republic. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that the Court has held, first, that it would be incompatible with the binding effect attributed to decisions by Article 189 of the EEC Treaty (which became Article 189 of the EC Treaty, now Article 249 EC) to exclude in principle the possibility that persons affected may invoke the obligation imposed by the decision and, secondly, that a provision of a decision addressed to a Member State may be relied on as against that Member State where the provi- sion in question imposes on its addressee an obligation which is unconditional and sufficiently clear and precise (Case C-156/91 Hansa Fleisch Ernst Mundt [1992] ECR I-5567, paragraphs 12 and 13 and the case-law cited). It must therefore be determined whether Decision 2005/449 imposes on the French Republic an unconditional obligation which is sufficiently clear and precise. 9 10 11 12 ",
        "I - 8760 JUDGMENT OF 20. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-18/08 In that regard, it should be noted that the legal basis for that decision is Article 6(2)(b) of Directive 1999/62, under which it is possible for a Member State to exempt certain vehicles from motor vehicle tax or to apply a reduced rate of taxation to such vehicles. Furthermore, in accordance with that provision, use of that possibility by a Member State is conditional upon the Commission\u2019s approval of a draft measure. Accordingly, it is sufficient to hold that, in spite of the part played by the Commis- sion, the Member States have a broad discretion both as regards their decision to make use of the possibility and as regards the content of the measure envisaged, without the Commission\u2019s approval of that measure making it in any way obligatory to use that possibility. Thus, the aim and effect of Decision 2005/449 is not to compel the French Republic to grant the exemption proposed in its request for authorisation, but to authorise it to make such an exemption if it so wishes. Furthermore, the fact that Decision 2005/449 does not specify the date from which it first applies, but merely sets the expiry date for the approved exemption as 31 December 2009, does not affect the scope and the effects of that decision. 13 14 15 16 17 ",
        "I - 8761 FOSELEV SUD-OUEST Indeed, under the terms of Article 254(3) EC, Decision 2005/449 takes effect upon its notification to the addressee, in this case the French Republic. The fact remains that one such effect is to make possible an exemption \u2014 which, in the present case, does not yet exist and which cannot be implemented without a national legislative act \u2014 but in no way to impose such an exemption. In the light of all of the foregoing, the answer to the question referred must be that Decision 2005/449 cannot be relied on by an individual against the French Republic, to which that decision was addressed, in order to obtain the benefit of the exemption approved by that decision upon its notification or publication. Costs Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.

Regulation No 615/98 laying down specific detailed rules of application for the export refund arrangements as regards the welfare of live bovine animals during transport, and, in par - ticular, Articles 1 and 5(3) and (7) thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that a national authority with competence for export refunds is empowered to decide that a transport of animals was not carried out in accordance with the provi- sions of Directive 91/628 on the protec- tion of animals during transport, as amended by Directive 95/29, although, under Article 2(3) of that regulation, the official veterinarian had certified that that transport complied with the provi- sions of that directive. In order to reach that conclusion, that authority must rely on objective elements relating to the welfare of the animals such as to call into question the documents presented by the exporter, it being for the latter to show, in that case, that the elements relied on by the competent authority for its finding of non-compliance with Directive 91/628, as amended by Directive 95/29, are irrelevant.

When assessing if a right to a refund exists in the situations provided for under Regulation No 800/1999 laying down common detailed rules for the applica- tion of the system of export refunds on agricultural products, where a vessel has been authorised for the transport of animals in respect of a certain surface area by the Member State of registration of the vessel, the competent authority of the Member State of export must take that authorisation as a basis for assessing whether Community legislation on the ",
        "I - 8765 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP welfare of animals during transport has been complied with. In order to grant an authorisation, the competent authority of the Member State of registration must necessarily carry out detailed checks in order to calculate the total effective surface area of the vessel that is such as to ensure the welfare of the animals during transport. The surface area indicated in the author- isation must therefore be considered to represent the surface area within which the welfare of the animals is guaranteed. (see paras 36, 38, operative part 2) 3. The notion of \u2018compliance with the provisions established in Community legislation concerning animal welfare\u2019 referred to in Article 33(9) of Regula- tion No 1254/1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal, which makes payment of export refunds subject to compliance with those provisions, must be interpreted as meaning that, where it is established that the Community requirements relating to loading density laid down in Chapter VI, point 47(B), of the Annex to Directive 91/628 on the protection of animals during transport, as amended by Directive 95/29, were not complied with during the transport of the animals, it is necessary, in principle, to make a finding of non-compliance with those provi- sions in respect of all the live animals transported. (see para. 39, operative part 3) 4. Community law does not require national courts to apply, of their own motion, a provision of Community law where such application would lead them to deny the principle, enshrined in the relevant national law, of the prohibition of reformatio in pejus . Such an obligation would be contrary not only to the principles of respect for the rights of the defence, legal certainty and protection of legitimate expect- ations, which underlie the prohib- ition, but would expose an individual who brought an action against an act adversely affecting him to the risk that such an action would place him in a less favourable position than he would have been in, had he not brought that action.

By this reference for a preliminary ruling, the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven (Netherlands) asks the Court to interpret several Community provisions linking the payment of export refunds for live bovine animals to compliance with Community rules on the protection of animals during transport. 2. This reference was made in a dispute between Heemskerk BV and Firma Schaap, 2 on the one hand, and the Productschap Vee en Vlees, 3 on the other hand, regarding deci- sions taken by the latter demanding recovery of the export refund which it considers to have been paid unduly to those two undertakings. 3. Among the questions referred to the Court by the national court are two which 1 \u2014 Original language: French. 2 \u2014 \u2018The appellants in the main proceedings\u2019. 3 \u2014 \u2018The Productschap\u2019. are of particular interest in the light of the issue of application of Community law by a national court of its own motion. 4. The national court essentially asks the Court to rule on whether Community law requires a national court, in proceedings such as those in the main action, which is concerned not only with the protection of animals during transport but also with the protection of the financial interests of the European Community, to review, of its own motion, the legality of a national adminis- trative measure by having regard to pleas based on Community law, even where such an examination results in the applicant in the main proceedings being placed in a less advantageous position than that in which he would have found himself if he had not brought that action. 5. In this Opinion, I will set out my reasons for taking the view that, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, a national court, as a Community court of ordinary jurisdiction, is required to apply Community law of its own motion.

A more in-depth investigation, carried out by the General Inspectorate (AID), showed that the official veterinarian had not checked whether the loading density stand- ards set out in Chapter VI of the Annex to Directive 91/628/EEC had been complied with. Moreover, on the basis of a statement 11 \u2014 OJ 1989 L 388, p. 18. Regulation as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 2154/2002 of 28 November 2002 (OJ 2002 L 328, p. 4, \u2018Regulation No 4045/89\u2019). by the person attending the animals during the transport to Morocco, the General Inspectorate concluded that the welfare conditions of the bovine animals during that transport, as laid down by that directive, had not been complied with and that the vessel was clearly overloaded. 28. By decisions of 26 March 2004, the Productschap withdrew the refund which had been granted to the appellants in the main proceedings and demanded repayment of the amounts concerned, increased by 10%. It also determined the statutory interest owed. 29. By letters of 13 April 2004, each of appel- lants in the main proceedings lodged an objection against those decisions. 30. Having heard the appellants in the main proceedings on 6 May 2004, the Product- schap adopted the decisions challenged in the main proceedings on 2 and 25 August 2004. 31. By those decisions, the Productschap upheld the decisions to withdraw and recover the export refund, but reduced the amount to be recovered. Considering that ",
        "I - 8772 OPINION OF MR BOT \u2014 CASE C-455/06 only the number of bovine animals in excess of the number permitted with respect to the authorised area of 986 m 2 had been transported in breach of the standards laid down by Directive 91/628, including those governing loading density, the Product- schap took the view that it was necessary to withdraw and recover the refund granted in respect of the part of the load which was inconsistent with the welfare of the animals. 32. It started from the finding that, pursuant to Chapter VI, paragraph 47, B, of the Annex to Directive 91/628, it was necessary to provide each animal with a surface area of at least 1.70775 m 2 . In order to calcu- late the number of animals transported in breach of that loading standard, the Product- schap divided the authorised surface area of the vessel, that is 986 m 2 , by the area laid down for each animal. It concluded that the maximum number of animals which could be transported on that vessel was 577.36 and that the vessel in question was thus over- loaded by 62 animals. 33. The Productschap then calculated the portion of the refund to be recovered by refer- ence to the excess number of animals trans- ported, on a pro rata basis according to the share of the total consignment attributable to the appellants in the main proceedings. In accordance with that calculation, each of them was required to repay the refund for 29 animals. Moreover, pursuant to Article 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98, in conjunction with Article 5(4) of that regulation, the amount to be repaid was increased by an equal amount. 34. The appellants in the main proceed- ings appealed against those decisions to the national court. In support of their appeal, they relied on several pleas in law. Essentially they claim, first, that the certification carried out by the official veterinarian is probative in nature and, secondly, that the requirement under Irish law that only an area of 986 m 2 of the vessel could be used for the transport of the animals was not applicable to a transport from the Netherlands to Morocco. 35. Since it was uncertain as to the interpret- ation of Community law, the national court decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \u2018(1) (a) Is an administrative body empow- ered to decide, contrary to the dec - laration of the official veterinarian referred to in Article 2(2) of Regula- tion No 615/98, that the transport of animals to which the official veter- inarian\u2019s declaration relates is not in accordance with the conditions laid down in Directive 91/628? ",
        "I - 8773 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP (b) If the answer to Question 1a is in the affirmative: Is the exercise by the administra- tive body of that power on grounds of Community law subject to specific restrictions, and if so, what are those restrictions? (2) If the answer to Question 1 is in the affirmative: When assessing whether there is an entitlement to refunds, for which Regulation No 800/1999, for example, provides, should an administrative body of a Member State determine whether a transport of live animals complies with Community animal welfare legislation by reference to the requirements applic- able in the Member State or to those of the State in which the vessel trans- porting the live animals is registered and which has granted an authorisation for that vessel? (3) Does Community law require a court or tribunal to conduct, of its own motion, an examination of grounds derived from Regulation No 1254/1999 and Regula- tion No 800/1999 that is to say, an exam- ination of grounds falling outside the ambit of the dispute as submitted to it? (4) Is the phrase \u2018subject to compliance with the provisions established in Community legislation concerning animal welfare\u2019 in Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 to be understood as meaning that, where it is established that while transporting live animals a vessel was so heavily laden as to exceed the cargo permitted by the relevant welfare legislation, there was a failure to comply with Community animal welfare legislation only in respect of the number of animals by which the permitted cargo was exceeded, or must it be found that that legislation was not complied with in respect of all the live animals transported? (5) Does the effective application of Community law entail that a court\u2019s examination, of its own motion, of compatibility with provisions of Community law prevails over the prin- ciple enshrined in Dutch law of admin- istrative procedure that an individual bringing an action must not be placed thereby in a less advantageous position than if he had not brought that action?\u2019 ",
        "I - 8774 OPINION OF MR BOT \u2014 CASE C-455/06 III \u2014 Analysis 36. I would point out from the outset that in my view two sets of provisions occupy a central place in this reference for a prelim- inary ruling. 37. They are, first, the second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/99 and Article 1 of Regulation No 615/98, under which payment of the export refund is subject to compliance with Community legislation on animal welfare and, in par - ticular, the protection of animals during trans- port. Those provisions lay down a condition governing the grant of export refunds for live animals. 12 38. Secondly, Article 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98 is also central to these proceed- ings. That provision seeks, as is shown by the sixth recital in the preamble to that regulation, to ensure the recovery of export refunds which are considered to have been paid unduly in the light of the animal welfare requirement. It thus constitutes the legal 12 \u2014 See, to that effect, judgments in Joined Cases C-37/06 and C-58/06 Viamex Agrar Handel and ZVK [2008] ECR I-69, paragraph 37, and Case C-96/06 Viamex Agrar Handel [2008] ECR I-1413, paragraph 46. basis for decisions taken by competent national authorities to recover from recipi- ents any export refunds which the latter have unduly received, where it is established, following payment of such refunds, that Community legislation on the protection of animals during transport has not been complied with. 39. It is on the basis of Article 5(7) of Regula- tion No 615/98 and in the light of the condi- tion governing the grant of export refunds referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 and Article 1 of Regulation No 615/98 that the Productschap took the decisions which are the subject-matter of the main proceedings. I take the view that the questions referred by the national court must therefore be under- stood as primarily seeking interpretation of those provisions. According to the inter- pretation of those provisions given by the Court, the national court will be in a position to determine whether or not the contested decisions are consistent with Community law. A \u2014 The first question 40. By its first question, the national court essentially wishes to ascertain whether the second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 and Articles 1 and 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98 must be ",
        "I - 8775 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP interpreted as meaning that the compe- tent national authority in matters relating to export refunds is empowered to decide that a transport of animals has not been carried out in accordance with the provi- sions of Directive 91/628, although, under Article 2(3) of Regulation No 615/98, the official veterinarian had at the outset cer - tified that that transport complied with the provisions of Directive 91/628. If the answer is in the affirmative, the national court also asks the Court to define the limits of that competence. 41. Like the Netherlands and Greek Govern- ments and the Commission of the European Communities, I take the view that the first part of that question must be answered in the affirmative, for the following reasons. 42. It should first be pointed out that, under both the second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 and Article 1 of Regulation No 615/98, compli- ance with Community provisions concerning the welfare of live bovine animals during transport, and in particular those contained in Directive 91/628, constitutes a condition governing the grant of export refunds for live animals. 43. According to the second indent of Article 5(2) of Regulation No 615/98, the certification issued by the official veter- inarian at the point of exit of the animals from the customs territory of the Commu- nity constitutes, together with, where appro- priate, the report on the checks containing the findings made upon arrival of the animals by the control authority of the third country of final destination, evidence of compliance with that condition governing the grant of export refunds and it must, on that basis, supplement an application for payment of an export refund. 44. Although presentation of that evidence is necessary for obtaining such payment, it is, nevertheless, not an absolute guarantee of entitlement to payment, as is expressly shown by the wording of Article 5(3) of Regulation No 615/98. I would point out that, under that provision, the export refund is not to be paid for animals for which the competent authority considers, in the light of the docu- ments referred to in Article 5(2), the reports on the checks referred to in Article 4 of that regulation and/or all other elements at its disposal concerning compliance with Article 1 of that regulation , that Directive 91/628 on the protection of animals during transport was not complied with. 45. That provision, in a very extensive manner, confers on the paying bodies the power to rely on any element which has some ",
        "I - 8776 OPINION OF MR BOT \u2014 CASE C-455/06 bearing on the welfare of the animals 13 and is capable of showing that Directive 91/628 has not been complied with, in order to justify a refusal to pay the export refund applied for. The certification issued by the official veter - inarian at the point of exit of the animals from the Community customs territory is there- fore necessarily relative in nature, in that it may be rebutted, prior to payment, by other evidence. 46. The Court recently endorsed and clari- fied that analysis in its judgment in Viamex Agrar Handel . In particular, it took the view that presentation by the exporter of the docu- ments referred to respectively in Articles 2(3) and 3(2) of Regulation No 615/98 \u2018does not constitute irrefutable proof of compliance with Article 1 of that regulation, or of compli- ance with Directive 91/628. That evidence is sufficient only in so far as the compe- tent authority does not have at its disposal elements in the light of which it may find that the directive has not been complied with\u2019. 14 The Court deduced from this that \u2018despite the documents produced by the exporter in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regula- tion No 615/98, the competent authority 13 \u2014 See, in that regard, the judgment in Viamex Agrar Handel and ZVK , paragraph 41. 14 \u2014 Paragraph 34. may consider, pursuant to Article 5(3) of the regulation, that Directive 91/628 has not been complied with\u2019. 15 47. In that same judgment, the Court also stated that \u2018Article 5(3) of Regulation No 615/98 cannot be interpreted as entitling the competent authority arbitrarily to call into question the evidence attached by the exporter to its export refund application.\u2019 16 That is why it circumscribed the competent authority\u2019s discretion as to the nature and the evidentiary value of the elements which may be taken into consideration. 48. Accordingly, with regard to the nature of those elements, the Court took the view that \u2018it is only in the light of the docu- ments relating to animal health referred to in Article 5(2) of Regulation No 615/98, the reports on the checks referred to in Article 4 of that regulation and/or other elements at its disposal concerning compliance with Article 1 of the regulation and having a bearing on animal welfare that the compe- tent authority may conclude that Direct- ive 91/628 has not been complied with.\u2019 17 15 \u2014 Paragraph 44. 16 \u2014 Paragraph 38. 17 \u2014 Paragraph 39 and case-law cited. ",
        "I - 8777 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP 49. Moreover, with regard to the evidentiary value of the elements which may be taken into account, the Court considers that \u2018[t]he competent authority is \u2026 required, pursuant to Article 5(3) of Regulation No 615/98, to base itself on objective and specific elements relating to the welfare of the animals which are capable of establishing that the docu- ments attached by the exporter to its export refund application do not prove compli- ance with the provisions of Directive 91/628 during transportation, and it is for the exporter to show, where appropriate, that the elements relied on by the competent authority to substantiate its finding of non- compliance with Regulation No 615/98 and Directive 91/628 are not relevant.\u2019 18 The competent authority is also \u2018required to justify its decision by stating the reasons why it considers the evidence presented by the exporter does not enable it to be concluded that Directive 91/628 was complied with.\u2019 19 50. Ultimately, the competent authority retains a broad discretion as to the exist- ence of and justification for entitlement to payment of the export refund, provided that that authority bases its decision on objective elements having a bearing on animal welfare and adequately justifies its decision not to pay that refund. 18 \u2014 Paragraph 41 and case-law cited. 19 \u2014 Paragraph 42. 51. I take the view that the same reasoning applies where the competent authority has in its possession, not only prior to payment of the export refund, but also after its payment, proof that Directive 91/628 has not been complied with. 52. To assert the contrary would be tanta- mount to depriving Article 5(7) of Regula- tion No 615/98 of effectiveness. As stated above, that article actually constitutes the legal basis for demands for recovery of export refunds which have been paid unduly, where it is established, following payment of the latter, that the Community legislation on the protection of animals during transport has not been complied with. I take the view that all the objective elements having a bearing on animal welfare which are collected during subsequent checks may help to justify a paying body\u2019s assessment as to whether or not an export refund initially granted was paid unduly. 53. I would add that any interpretation which conferred on the certification issued by the official veterinarian an evidentiary value which was incapable of being rebutted would be incompatible with the very existence of ",
        "I - 8778 OPINION OF MR BOT \u2014 CASE C-455/06 the subsequent checks as laid down by Regu- lation No 4045/89 and would undermine the effectiveness of such checks. 54. According to Article 1(1) thereof, the purpose of that regulation is to make provi- sion for scrutiny of the commercial docu- ments of those entities receiving payments relating directly or indirectly to the system of financing by the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF (European Agricultural Guid- ance and Guarantee Fund), in order to ascer- tain whether transactions forming part of that system of financing have actually been carried out and have been executed correctly. Such documents, which are defined broadly in Article 1(2) of that regulation, 20 may, as is the case in the main proceedings, be incon- sistent with the official veterinarian\u2019s certifi- cation and result in the recovery of an export refund which subsequently appears to have been paid unduly. 55. That is why I take the view that the Court\u2019s reply to the national court\u2019s question should be that the second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 and Articles 1 and 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98 must be interpreted as meaning that the national authority having competence to pay export refunds is empowered to decide that a 20 \u2014 According to that provision, commercial documents are defined as \u2018all books, registers, vouchers and supporting documents, accounts, production and quality records, and correspondence relating to the undertaking\u2019s business activity, as well as commercial data, in whatever form they may take, including electronically stored data, in so far as these documents or data relate directly or indirectly to the transactions referred to in paragraph 1\u2019. transport of animals has not been carried out in accordance with the provisions of Direct- ive 91/628, even though the official veter- inarian had at the outset certified, pursuant to Article 2(3) of Regulation No 615/98, that that transport complied with the provisions of Directive 91/628. In order to reach such a conclusion, the competent national authority must base its decision on objective elements having a bearing on animal welfare and capable of calling into question the docu- ments presented by the exporter and must adequately justify its decision demanding recovery of the export refund. B \u2014 The second question 56. By its second question, the national court essentially asks the Court to rule on whether the second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 and Articles 1 and 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98 must be interpreted as meaning that the competent authority of the Member State of export- ation must, with a view to establishing that the Community provisions on animal welfare during transport have not been complied with, take into account the rules in force in that Member State or those in force in the Member State of registration of the vessel which transported the animals. ",
        "I - 8779 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP 57. In order properly to understand the origin and meaning of that question, I would point out that, in support of their appeal to the national court, the appellants in the main proceedings argue that the requirement under Irish law that the vessel could trans- port animals only on an area of 986 m 2 did not apply to transport from the Netherlands to Morocco. Those parties therefore seem to take the view that, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, only the less stringent rules in force in the Netherlands were relevant in determining the surface area of the vessel available for the transport of animals. 58. In so far as it is that surface area which serves as a reference for monitoring compli- ance with the Community requirements relating to loading density laid down in Chapter VI, paragraph 47, B, of the Annex to Directive 91/628, it is important to determine whether, in the case of a transport of animals departing from the Netherlands by means of a vessel registered in Ireland, it is consistent with Community law for the competent authority of the Member State of exportation to take into account authorisation granted on the basis of the Irish rules in determining the surface area of a vessel available for the trans- port of animals. 59. I take the view that that is indeed the case. 60. I would point out first of all that, under Article 5 A(1)(a)(ii) of Directive 91/628, the Member States must ensure that any transporter is covered by an authorisation valid for all transport of vertebrate animals within the Community granted by the competent authority of the Member State of establishment. 61. With regard in particular to means of transport, Article 5 A(1)(c) of that direct- ive requires in a general manner that the Member States ensure that any transporter uses, for the transport of animals, means of transport that will ensure compliance with Community requirements concerning welfare during transport. 62. In order to check compliance with that obligation in the context of the export refund arrangements, Article 2(2) of Regulation No 615/98 provides, inter alia, that an official veterinarian at the exit point of the animals must verify and certify that the means of transport by which those live animals are to leave the customs territory of the Commu- nity complies with Directive 91/628. 63. It should also be noted that, in order to ensure the uniform application of the condi- tions governing the grant of export refunds, ",
        "I - 8780 OPINION OF MR BOT \u2014 CASE C-455/06 the Community legislature has made payment of the latter subject to compliance with the Community provisions concerning animal welfare during transport and not to compliance with national rules which may vary from one Member State to another. 64. In particular, as regards the dispute in the main proceedings, entitlement to the export refund is subject to compliance with the Community requirements relating to loading density laid down in Chapter VI, para- graph 47, B, of the Annex to Directive 91/628. I would point out that those requirements are set out for each type of transport and on the basis of an animal\u2019s weight as a surface area in square metres per animal. 65. In order to verify that those require- ments are actually complied with, the surface area of the vessel which is fit for the purpose of transporting animals must be taken as the basis. However, Directive 91/628 does not contain rules for precisely calculating that surface area. It is, therefore, for the Member States to lay down the rules for determining on a vessel the surface area available for transporting animals. It was under such rules that authorisation for a surface area of 986 m 2 was issued by the competent authority of Ireland to the vessel at issue in the dispute in the main proceedings. 66. In so far as a vessel which has been granted authorisation in the Member State in which it is registered may be required, as in the dispute in the main proceedings, to transport animals from another Member State, the latter State must recognise that authorisation. In such a situation, only appli- cation of the principle of mutual recognition prevents, with regard to the same vessel, the surface area available for the transport of animals to be taken into account in order to check compliance with Community require- ments relating to loading density from varying according to the Member State of departure. Application in that way of the principle of mutual recognition is therefore suitable for ensuring that, with regard to a transport of animals on the same vessel, en- titlement to the export refund is to be deter- mined uniformly whatever the Member State of departure. 67. I therefore propose that the Court should rule that the second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 and Articles 1 and 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98 must be interpreted as meaning that the competent authority of the Member State of exportation must, in order to estab- lish that the Community requirements ",
        "I - 8781 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP relating to loading density laid down in Chapter VI, paragraph 47, B, of the Annex to Directive 91/628 have not been complied with, take into account the rules for deter- mining the surface area of that vessel avail- able for transporting animals in force in the Member State of registration of the vessel which transported the animals, by recog- nising the authorisation which was issued to that vessel by the competent authority of the latter State. 68. Before examining the third question, which is, together with the fifth question, of particular interest in the light of the problem of the application of Community law by a court of its own motion, it seems to me necessary to answer the fourth question. C \u2014 The fourth question 69. It is clear from the answers which I have proposed that the Court should give to the first two questions that I take the view that the Productschap, in its decisions forming the subject-matter of the main proceedings, rightly took into account objective elements arising from subsequent checks which are inconsistent with the certification of the official veterinarian and show that the vessel was clearly overloaded in the light of the Community requirements relating to loading density. It was also correct to take as a refer- ence the authorised surface area of 986 m 2 in order to verify whether those requirements had actually been complied with. 70. I would point out that, in contrast to its first decisions dated 26 March 2004, by which the Productschap sought to recover from the appellants in the main proceedings the entire amount of the export refund which had been granted to them, it finally decided, following objections by the latter, to reduce the amount to be recovered. The Product- schap considered that only the number of bovine animals in excess of that permitted for the authorised 986 m 2 had been trans- ported contrary to the rules laid down by Directive 91/628 and it therefore sought to recover from each of the appellants in the main proceedings the export refunds for only 29 animals. 71. In its order for reference, the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven expressed its doubts as to the manner in which the refund entitlement of the appellants in the main proceedings had been determined. It took the view that it was more appro- priate to regard the overloading found to exist as resulting in the infringement of the welfare standards relating to all the animals transported, in so far as that overloading affected 640 in-calf heifers and not solely the 62 to which the Productschap refers in the contested decisions. It therefore took the ",
        "I - 8782 OPINION OF MR BOT \u2014 CASE C-455/06 view that the entire refund paid should have been recovered. 72. That is why the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven essentially asks the Court to rule on whether the second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 and Articles 1 and 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98 must be interpreted as meaning that, where it is established that the Community require- ments relating to loading density laid down in Chapter VI, paragraph 47, B, of the Annex to Directive 91/628 have not been complied with, the export refund must be considered to have been paid unduly for all the animals transported or for only the number of excess animals. 73. I take the view that in the case of infringement of such requirements the export refund must, in principle, be consid- ered to have been paid unduly for all the animals transported. 74. As the Greek and Hungarian Govern- ments, as well as the Commission, rightly point out, if the total surface area available on the vessel for the transport of animals divided by the number of animals actu- ally transported does not comply with the surface area per animal laid down in Chapter VI, paragraph 47, B, of the Annex to Dir - ective 91/628, it seems logical to conclude that the Community standards relating to loading density have not been complied with for any of the animals transported. In such a situ- ation, the space available to each animal is reduced since the number of animals on the vessel is greater than that permitted under those standards. In particular, as the Greek Government notes, the overloading of a vessel restricts the animals\u2019 physical move- ments, reduces the amount of space neces- sary for their comfort, increases the risk of those animals being injured and causes distressing transport conditions for all the animals transported and not only for the number of excess animals. 75. In such a situation, as also in a situation in which it might be found, for example, that there has been an infringement of Commu- nity requirements relating to the duration of journeys and rest periods, I take the view that the \u2018relevant part of the refund\u2019 which, within the meaning of Article 5(7) of Regula- tion No 615/98, should be considered to have been paid unduly and must be recovered is, in principle, the total amount of the export refund initially paid. ",
        "I - 8783 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP 76. However, as the Netherlands and Hungarian Governments have cogently noted, it would be necessary to adjust that solution where it were shown that, on account of the way the vessel is fitted out, certain animals were provided during the transport with a surface area satisfying the requirements of Chapter VI, paragraph 47, B, of the Annex to Directive 91/628. That would be the case, for example, if certain animals had been loaded into compartments of the vessel which satisfied those requirements. 77. Having regard to those considerations, I therefore propose that the Court should rule that the second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 and Articles 1 and 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98 must be interpreted as meaning that, where it is established that the Community require- ments relating to loading density laid down in Chapter VI, paragraph 47, B, of the Annex to Directive 91/628 have not been complied with, the export refund must, in principle, be considered to have been paid unduly for all the animals transported, unless its recipient furnishes proof that, on account of the way the vessel is fitted out, certain animals were provided during the transport with a surface area complying with those requirements. 78. As I have previously stated, it is apparent from the order for reference that the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven seems, in the light of the documents before the Court, to take the view that, in the main proceed- ings, the Community standards relating to loading density have been breached with regard to all the animals transported. It follows that the national court takes the view that the competent national authority ought to have sought to recover from the appellants in the main proceedings the entire amount of the export refund initially paid. Moreover, that was the position first adopted by that authority in its initial decisions of 26 March 2004. 79. The national court states, however, that it has doubts as to its power to call into ques- tion on that ground the decisions which are the subject-matter of the main proceedings. 80. It notes that Article 8:69 of the General Law on administrative law entails an ana - lysis by the national court of the points at issue which have been brought before it and thereby, in principle, prevents it from considering arguments which fall outside the ambit of the dispute as defined by the parties. That is why it has referred to the Court the third question, concerning the application of Community law by a court of its own motion. ",
        "I - 8784 OPINION OF MR BOT \u2014 CASE C-455/06 81. Furthermore, the national court explains that it faces a further obstacle under Nether- lands law on administrative judicial pro - cedure, namely the principle of the prohibition on reformatio in pejus . According to that principle, an appellant must not be placed, following an appeal, in a less advantageous position than that in which he would have found himself if he had not brought that appeal. 21 82. In that regard, the national court notes that the conclusions which it could draw from the finding that the Product- schap incorrectly limited the amount to be recovered from the appellants in the main proceedings would place the latter in a less advantageous position than that in which they found themselves when they lodged their appeal against the decisions of 2 and 25 August 2005. Indeed, they would also lose that part of the refund which the Product- schap had not sought to recover from them by those decisions. 21 \u2014 That prohibition on reformatio in pejus is also contained, albeit implicitly, in Article 8:69 of the General Law on administrative law. An examination of the laws of the Member States reveals that, as in Netherlands administra- tive law, the principle of the prohibition on reformatio in pejus is closely associated with the principle that it is for the parties to delimit the subject-matter of the proceedings (the \u2018principe dispositif\u2019). Accordingly, whether laid down by legislation or recognised by case-law, the prohibition on reformatio in pejus results from the idea that the party bringing an action does so in order to serve and protect his interests as set out and defined in the application submitted to the court. More general considerations are also put forward in different legal systems. Those considerations relate, inter alia, to legal certainty and, in particular, to liti- gants\u2019 expectations concerning the circumstances in which justice is done, expectations which do not allow the worsen- ing of a situation that the use of a legal remedy was, on the contrary, intended to improve. 83. The national court therefore seeks to ascertain whether, in circumstances such as those in the dispute in the main proceedings, the effective application of Community law requires it to set aside such a national pro - cedural rule. That is the purpose of the fifth question. 84. In the following arguments, I shall examine the third and fifth questions. D \u2014 The third and fifth questions 85. By its third and fifth questions, the national court essentially asks the Court to rule on whether Community law requires a national court, in circumstances such as those in the dispute in the main proceed- ings, to review of its own motion the legality of a national administrative measure in the light of pleas based on the infringement of the second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 and Articles 1 and 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98, including where such a review results in the appellant in the main proceedings being placed in a less advantageous position than that in which he would have found himself if he had not brought the appeal. ",
        "I - 8785 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP 86. The Netherlands and Greek Govern- ments, like the Commission, take the view that that question should be answered in the negative. The Hungarian Government, for its part, adopts a more qualified position in so far as it initially states that the national court should examine of its own motion the relevant provisions of Community law but then takes the view that the effective applica- tion of Community law does not mean that, through that review, it is necessary to set aside the principle enshrined in Netherlands law on administrative judicial procedure that the person bringing an appeal must not be placed in a less advantageous position than that in which he would have found himself in the absence of an appeal. 87. I should state at the outset that I take the view that the Court should answer that ques- tion in the affirmative. 88. We have seen that Article 8:69 of the General Law on administrative law is the national procedural provision which limits the scope of the review of legality which may be carried out by the national court. 89. In so far as that provision was at issue in van der Weerd and Others 22 and the judg- ment in that case contains a summary of the case-law on the application of Community law by a national court of its own motion, that judgment will be the starting point for my reasoning. I shall therefore start by describing the context in which that judg- ment was given and then the Court\u2019s deci- sion, before explaining my reasons for taking the view that that judgment does not provide a satisfactory resolution in this case. 90. In van der Weerd and Others , the dispute in the main proceedings was between the operators of cattle-breeding holdings and the Director of the national cattle and meat inspection service, and was concerned with decisions taken by the latter. Under the terms of those decisions, all biungulate animals on their holdings were to be treated as under suspicion of being infected by foot- and-mouth disease, on the ground that, since a case of foot-and-mouth disease had been ascertained in the vicinity of their holdings, the possibility could not be ruled out that the animals on those holdings might have been infected by that disease. Accordingly, those animals had to be vaccinated and then slaughtered. 91. In their appeal to the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven, the appellants in the main proceedings sought to challenge the legality of those decisions. The pleas in law raised in support of their appeal did not 22 \u2014 Joined Cases C-222/05 to C-225/05 [2007] ECR I-4233. ",
        "I - 8786 OPINION OF MR BOT \u2014 CASE C-455/06 include certain pleas which had, however, been raised in related cases pending before that court. 23 Those pleas in law consisted in the claim that the Director of the national cattle and meat inspection service was not entitled to take measures to control foot- and-mouth disease based on the result of tests carried out by the ID-Lelystad BV laboratory because the latter had not been authorised to carry them out by Council Directive 85/511/EEC of 18 November 1985 introducing Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease 24 and that he was not entitled to base the measures at issue solely on the content of the facsimile sent by that laboratory. 92. In its order for reference, the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven held that those pleas in law could have an influence on the resolution of the disputes brought before it. It stated, however, that because those pleas had not been raised before it, its national rules of procedure prevented their being taken into account. Indeed, Article 8:69 of the General Law on administrative judicial procedure provides that the court is to give its ruling solely on the basis of the issues which are put before it. While it is true that paragraph 2 of that article states that the court is to supple- ment the pleas in law of its own motion, that provision means, however, that the court is 23 \u2014 Those cases gave rise to the judgment in Case C-28/05 Dokter and Others [2006] ECR I-5431. 24 \u2014 OJ 1985 L 315, p. 11. Directive as amended by Council Directive 90/423/EEC of 26 June 1990 (OJ 1990 L 224, p. 13, \u2018Directive 85/511\u2019). to put the objections made by the applicant against the contested administrative measure into legal form. Moreover, the analysis which the court is required to make on its own initi- ative is required only in cases involving the application of rules of public policy, which are construed in Dutch law as those relating to the powers of administrative bodies and those of the court itself, and provisions as to admissibility. 93. In the light of those considerations, the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven sought to ascertain whether it was required under Community law to take into consid- eration arguments based on that law which had not been put forward by the appellants in the main proceedings. It took the view that the question which arose was whether a national procedural provision meaning that the court cannot examine pleas in law which go beyond the ambit of the dispute rendered the exercise of rights conferred by Commu- nity law virtually impossible or excessively difficult. 94. The Court\u2019s response started with the traditional observation that \u2018in the absence of Community rules in the field, it is for the domestic legal system of each Member State to designate the courts and tribunals having jurisdiction and to lay down the detailed procedural rules governing actions for safe- guarding rights which individuals derive from Community law, provided, first, that ",
        "I - 8787 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP such rules are not less favourable than those governing similar domestic actions (prin- ciple of equivalence) and, secondly, that they do not render virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Community law (principle of effectiveness)\u2019. 25 95. As regards, first of all, the principle of equivalence, the Court stated that the rele- vant provisions of Directive 85/511 could not be considered as being equivalent to national rules of public policy within the meaning of Netherlands law. It inferred from this that application of the principle of equiva- lence did not mean that the national court is obliged to conduct of its own motion an examination of the validity of the administra- tive measures in question by having regard to criteria based on that directive. 26 96. It also noted that \u2018were those provi- sions to form part of public health policy, they would have been put forward in the main proceedings essentially in order to take account of the private interests of individ- uals who had been the object of measures to control foot-and-mouth disease.\u2019 27 25 \u2014 Paragraph 28 and case-law cited. 26 \u2014 Paragraphs 29 to 31. 27 \u2014 Paragraph 32. 97. As regards, secondly, the principle of effectiveness, the Court first pointed out that it is clear from its case-law that \u2018each case which raises the question whether a national procedural provision renders the exercise of rights conferred by the Community legal order on individuals impossible or exces- sively difficult must be analysed by reference to the role of that provision in the procedure, its progress and its special features, viewed as a whole, before the various national instances. In that context, it is necessary to take into consideration, where relevant, the principles which lie at the basis of the national legal system, such as the protection of the rights of the defence, the principle of legal certainty and the proper conduct of the proceedings.\u2019 28 98. The Court then referred to its judgment in Van Schijndel and van Veen. 29 99. In that judgment, the Court examined the compatibility with the principle of effect - iveness of the principle of Netherlands law which provides that the power of the court to raise pleas of its own motion in domestic civil proceedings is limited by its obligation to keep to the subject-matter of the dispute as defined by the parties themselves and to base its decision on the facts put before it. 28 \u2014 Paragraph 33 and case-law cited. 29 \u2014 Joined Cases C-430/93 and C-431/93 [1995] ECR I-4705.

It held that that limitation on the power of the national court was justified by \u2018the principle that, in a civil suit, it is for the parties to take the initiative, the court being able to act of its own motion only in exceptional cases where the public interest requires its intervention.\u2019 30 The Court added that \u2018[t]hat principle reflects conceptions prevailing in most of the Member States as to the relations between the State and the individual; it safeguards the rights of the defence; and it ensures proper conduct of proceedings by, in particular, protecting them from the delays inherent in examination of new pleas.\u2019 31 101. The Court concluded that \u2018Community law does not require national courts to raise of their own motion an issue concerning the breach of provisions of Community law where examination of that issue would oblige them to abandon the passive role assigned to them by going beyond the ambit of the dispute defined by the parties themselves and relying on facts and circumstances other than those on which the party with an interest in application of those provisions bases his claim.\u2019 32 102. In the case giving rise to the judgment in van der Weerd and Others , the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven emphasised the similarity in that regard of the procedure followed before it and the procedure at issue in van Schijndel and van Veen . The Court 30 \u2014 Judgment in van Schijndel and van Veen , paragraph 21. 31 \u2014 Ibid. 32 \u2014 Ibid., paragraph 22. therefore applied the reasoning that it had followed in the latter judgment. 103. In order to supplement its reasoning, the Court also explained why its case-law in several judgments conferring on national courts the power to apply Community law of their own motion was not relevant in that case. Those further details are of interest since they show that the Court\u2019s position on this matter may be adapted according to the context in which a national procedural provi- sion is to be applied. 104. The Court first referred to the line of case-law beginning with the judgment in Peterbroeck , 33 concerning which it states that \u2018[o]ne of those cases can be distin- guished by reason of circumstances peculiar to the dispute, which led to the applicant in the main proceedings being deprived of the opportunity to rely effectively on the incompatibility of a domestic provision with Community law.\u2019 34 33 \u2014 Case C-312/93 [1995] ECR I-4599. In that judgment the Court\u2019s answer to the question referred by the Cour d\u2019Appel, Brussels (Belgium), was that \u2018Community law precludes application of a domestic procedural rule whose effect, in procedural circumstances such as those in question in the main proceedings, is to prevent the national court, seised of a matter falling within its jurisdiction, from considering of its own motion whether a measure of domestic law is compatible with a provision of Community law when the latter provision has not been invoked by the litigant within a certain period\u2019. 34 \u2014 Judgment in van der Weerd and Others , paragraph 40. ",
        "I - 8789 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP 105. It then referred to another line of its case-law which is justified, in its view, \u2018by the need to ensure that consumers are given the effective protection which Council Direct- ive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts [ 35 ] \u2026 seeks to achieve.\u2019 36 106. Finally, the Court referred to the case- law stemming from the judgment in Eco Swiss , 37 which in its view seeks \u2018to determine whether equal treatment is given to pleas based on national law and those based on Community law.\u2019 38 107. On the basis of all those considerations, the Court, in its judgment in van der Weerd 35 \u2014 OJ 1993 L 95, p. 29. 36 \u2014 Judgment in van der Weerd and Others , paragraph 40. Accordingly, the Court took the view that the consumer protection afforded by Directive 93/13 means that a national court may assess of its own motion whether or not the term of a contract submitted to it for assessment is unfair (see Joined Cases C-240/98 to C-244/98 Oc\u00e9ano Grupo Editor \u00ad ial and Salvat Editores [2000] ECR I-4941; Case C-473/00 Cofidis [2002] ECR I-10875, and Case C-168/05 Mostaza Claro [2006] ECR I-10421). See also judgment in Case C-429/05 Rampion and Godard [2007] ECR I-8017, which applied that case-law in the context of Council Dir - ective 87/102/EEC of 22 December 1986 for the approxima- tion of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning consumer credit (OJ 1987 L 42, p. 48), as amended by Directive 98/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 (OJ 1998 L 101, p. 17). 37 \u2014 Case C-126/97 [1999] ECR I-3055. In that judgment the Court held, inter alia, that \u2018where its domestic rules of procedure require a national court to grant an applica- tion for annulment of an arbitration award where such an application is founded on failure to observe national rules of public policy, it must also grant such an application where it is founded on failure to comply with the prohibition laid down in Article 85(1) of the Treaty [now Article 81(1) EC]\u2019 (paragraph 37). 38 \u2014 Judgment in van der Weerd and Others , paragraph 40. and Others , drew the conclusion that \u2018the principle of effectiveness does not, in circum- stances such as those which arise in the main proceedings, impose a duty on national courts to raise a plea based on a Community provision of their own motion, irrespective of the importance of that provision to the Community legal order, where the parties are given a genuine opportunity to raise a plea based on Community law before a national court.\u2019 39 It added that \u2018[s]ince the appel- lants in the main proceedings have had a genuine opportunity to raise pleas based on Directive 85/511, the principle of effective- ness does not require the national court to examine of its own motion a plea based on Articles 11 and 13 of that directive.\u2019 40 108. It is possible to draw from the foregoing the following conclusions for the present case. 109. With regard to the principle of equiva- lence, I take the view that the reasoning set out by Court in paragraphs 29 to 31 of its judgment in van der Weerd and Others , applies by analogy in this case. The relevant provisions of Regulations No 1254/1999 and 615/98, which seek, as we shall see, to safeguard animal welfare and to protect the financial interests of the Community, cannot be regarded as equivalent to national rules of public policy, within the meaning of Neth- erlands law, which are essentially concerned 39 \u2014 Ibid., paragraph 41. 40 \u2014 Ibid.

        "I - 8790 OPINION OF MR BOT \u2014 CASE C-455/06 with the jurisdiction of the court, the admis- sibility of the action and the competence of the administrative authority which adopted the contested decision. 110. The central issue in this case is there- fore concerned with the scope of the prin- ciple of effectiveness. 111. I take the view that the Court\u2019s reasoning in its judgment in van der Weerd and Others , in relation to the scope of that principle is irrelevant in a situation such as that in the main proceedings, even though the national procedural provision concerned is, as in the case giving rise to that judgment, Article 8:69 of the General Law on adminis- trative law. 112. Indeed, I take the view that both the purpose of the Community provisions which the national court wishes to apply in the dispute in the main proceedings and the context in which the national procedural provision at issue applies require that the Court consider this case from a different viewpoint. 113. This case has certain specific features which preclude, in my view, the straightforward application of the Court\u2019s reasoning in its judgments in van Schijndel and van Veen and van der Weerd and Others . 114. In that regard, I would point out, first, that the aim of the second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 and of Article 1 of Regulation No 615/98 is to make payment of the refunds for exports of live bovine animals subject to compliance with Community rules concerning animal welfare and, in particular, compliance with the provisions of Directive 91/628. They therefore lay down a condition governing the grant of those refunds. 115. The Court has shown, in its judgment in Viamex Agrar Handel and ZVK , that the Community legislature seeks to uphold public-interest requirements such as the protection of the health and life of animals. Accordingly, the Court takes the view that \u2018the purpose of the general reference made by Regulation No 615/98 to Directive 91/628 is to ensure, for the purposes of the imple- mentation of Article 13(9) of Regulation No 805/68 [now Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999], compliance with the relevant provisions of that directive on the welfare of live animals and, in particular, the protection of animals during transport.\u2019 41 41 \u2014 Paragraph 29. ",
        "I - 8791 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP 116. In the same judgment, the Court recog- nises that \u2018[t]he link thus made also has the advantage of ensuring that the Community budget does not finance exports made in breach of Community provisions on animal welfare.\u2019 42 117. The relevant Community provisions in these proceedings thus have a dual purpose, namely, first, the protection of the health and life of animals and, secondly, the protection of the financial interests of the Community. 118. It is in order to ensure that those two objectives are fully realised that Article 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98 supplements the legislation by providing that, where it is established after payment of the refund that Community legislation on the protection of animals during transport has not been complied with, the relevant part of the refund is to be considered to have been paid unduly and must be recovered in accordance with the provisions of Article 11(3) to (6) of Regu- lation No 3665/87, replaced by Article 52 of Regulation No 800/1999. 43 42 \u2014 Paragraph 24. 43 \u2014 In the judgment in Case C-428/05 Laub [2007] ECR I-5069, the Court gave its view on the purpose of the recovery procedure referred to in Article 11(3) of Regula- tion No 3665/87. It stated that \u2018[t]his provision has the aim of ensuring the protection and the proper application of the Community budget in regard to export refunds and, in particular, of ensuring that only those exporters entitled to refunds benefit from them, in accordance with the ob- jective conditions established by the Community legislature\u2019 (paragraph 22). 119. I would also point out that those two objectives constitute, at the Community level, requirements in the general interest whose importance cannot be denied. 44 120. Next, it should be noted that, consid- ered as a whole, the Community provisions which the national court wishes to apply of its own motion in the main proceedings do not create rights for the appellants in the main proceedings, but instead impose upon them an obligation, that of repaying an export refund which was paid unduly. 121. The issue here is therefore not to seek to determine whether Article 8:69 of the General Law on administrative law is, as the principle of effectiveness is presently under- stood, such as to make it impossible or exces- sively difficult in practice to exercise rights conferred by Community law . 44 \u2014 See, in that regard, concerning the objective of the protec- tion of the health and life of animals, the judgment in Viamex Agrar Handel and ZVK , paragraphs 22 and 23. With regard to the objective of the protection of the finan- cial interests of the Community, I would refer, inter alia, to Article 280 EC and to Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities financial interests (OJ 1995 L 312, p. 1). That regulation introduces a common set of legal rules for all areas covered by Community policies in order to counter acts detrimental to the Communities\u2019 financial interests. ",
        "I - 8792 OPINION OF MR BOT \u2014 CASE C-455/06 122. Accordingly, the principle of effective- ness, in so far as it is protective of the rights conferred directly on individuals by Commu- nity law, is not, in this case, the appro- priate reference for determining whether the national court is required to set aside a national procedural provision which prevents the application of Community law by a court of its own motion. 123. Nor does it seem relevant to me, in circumstances such as those in the dispute in the main proceedings, to ascertain whether the parties have had a real opportunity to raise a plea based on Community law before a national court. 124. Having regard to the facts giving rise to the dispute in the main proceedings, it is actually evident that the appellants in the main proceedings had no interest in invoking before the national court the issue of whether, under the second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 and Articles 1 and 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98, the export refund must be considered to have been paid unduly for all the animals trans- ported or for only some of them. I would point out, in that regard, that the Product- schap had initially sought to recover the total amount of the refund and had then, following objections by the appellants in the main proceedings, limited that recovery to only some of the animals transported. The litigation strategy of the appellants in the main proceedings has thus been to seek to obtain from the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven a further reduction in the amount to be recovered or even to exclude all recovery, by raising other pleas in law. 125. I would add that neither was it in the Productschap\u2019s interests to raise arguments which might lead to the calling into ques- tion of the method of calculation it used in its recovery decisions adopted on 2 and 25 August 2005. 126. Accordingly, the finding that the parties had a genuine opportunity to raise a plea based on Community law before the national court cannot be decisive in this case. 127. I suggest, therefore, that the Court should adopt another approach, better suited to a context in which the scope of applica- tion of Community law by a court of its own motion is not limited, in the words used by the Court in its judgment in van der Weerd and Others , to taking into account the \u2018private interests of individuals\u2019, 45 but consists more 45 \u2014 Paragraph 32. ",
        "I - 8793 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP fundamentally in safeguarding requirements in the general interest at Community level. 128. Indeed, in circumstances such as those in the dispute in the main proceedings, it is only the national courts, as Community courts of ordinary jurisdiction, which may be prompted to invoke Community law in order to ensure compliance therewith. They thus constitute the last line of defence for correcting a misapplication of Community law by a competent national authority. In other words, only the national courts can restore Community legality. 129. I therefore propose that the Court should hold that the effective application of Community law requires a national court, in circumstances such as those in the dispute in the main proceedings, to review of its own motion the legality of a national administra- tive measure in the light of pleas based on the infringement of the second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 and Articles 1 and 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98, including where such a review leads to the appellant in the main proceedings being placed in a less advantageous position than that in which he would have found himself if he had not brought the appeal. 130. That position is consistent with the requirement, reiterated on many occa- sions by the Court, that a national legal rule must not undermine the application or the effectiveness of Community law. 46 It has been expressed in a number of ways by the Court in its case-law, in particular in matters relating to agriculture. 131. Before examining that case-law, it should be stated that, under Article 8(1)(b) and (c) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy, 47 the Member States must, in accord- ance with national provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action, take the measures necessary to prevent and deal with irregularities affecting the transactions of the EAGGF and to recover sums lost as a result of irregularities or negligence. 132. In its judgment in Deutsche Milchkontor and Others , 48 the Court, inter alia, inter- preted the corresponding provision of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of the Council 46 \u2014 See in particular, to that effect, the judgments in Case 106/77 Simmenthal [1978] ECR 629, paragraph 22, and Case C-213/89 Factortame and Others [1990] ECR I-2433, paragraph 20. 47 \u2014 OJ 1999 L 160, p. 103.

It pointed out that \u2018in the absence of provisions of Community law disputes concerning the recovery of amounts unduly paid under Community law must be decided by national courts pursuant to their own national law subject to the limits imposed by Community law \u2026\u2019. 50 Those limits are as follows. 134. \u2018[N]ational law must be applied in a manner which is not discriminatory compared to procedures for deciding similar but purely national disputes\u2019 51 and it \u2018must not affect the scope and effectiveness of Community law\u2019. 52 135.

Furthermore, the exercise of any discretion to decide whether or not it would be expe- dient to demand repayment of Community funds unduly or irregularly granted would be inconsistent with the duty to recover such sums which Article 8(1) of Regula- tion No 729/70 imposes on the national administration\u2019. 53 136. The Court recently considered those requirements in its judgment in Vereniging Nationaal Overlegorgaan Sociale Werkvoor\u00ad ziening and Others . 54 It concluded, in essence, that the national court is required to implement an obligation to recover Commu- nity financial assistance which flows from a provision of Community law 55 when it has before it a dispute concerning the repayment of sums lost as a result of abuse or negligence 53 \u2014 Ibid. In its judgment in Joined Cases 146/81, 192/81 and 193/81 BayWa and Others [1982] ECR 1503, the Court also stated that an interpretation allowing the competent national authorities to exercise a discretion as to the expedi- ency of demanding repayment of Community funds unduly granted \u2018would lead to an erosion both of the principle of equal treatment between undertakings from different Member States and of the application of Community law which must, so far as possible, remain uniform throughout the Community\u2019 (paragraph 30). 54 \u2014 Joined Cases C-383/06 to C-385/06 [2008] ECR I-1561. 55 \u2014 Article 23(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of the activities of the different Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Invest- ment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (OJ 1988 L 374, p. 1), as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93 of 20 July 1993 (OJ 1993 L 193, p. 20).

The Court also stated that although under national law principles such as the principle of legal certainty and the protection of legitimate expectations may be taken into consideration by the national court in add - ition to the principle of legality, that is so only on condition that full account is taken of the interests of the Community. 57 138. In the light of that case-law, I take the view that, in circumstances such as those in the dispute in the main proceedings, the effective application of Community law means that the national court must take into full consideration the interests of the Community in recovering assistance which has been paid in breach of the conditions governing the granting of that assistance and that it must therefore set aside the proced- ural principles contained in Article 8:69 of the General Law on administrative law. 139. I consider that safeguarding the general interest requirements consisting in the 56 \u2014 Judgment in Vereniging Nationaal Overlegorgaan Sociale Werkvoorziening and Others, paragraphs 51 and 59. 57 \u2014 Ibid., paragraph 52, and case-law cited, and paragraphs 55 and 59. protection of the health and life of animals and the protection of the financial interests of the Community therefore requires the national court to verify that the competent authority has not exercised any discretion as to the expediency of demanding repayment of Community funds unduly granted. 140. It is true that it is for the competent national authority, where it adopts, under Article 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98, a deci- sion seeking recovery of an export refund paid unduly, to assess in the light of the objective elements available to it whether the \u2018the relevant part of the refund\u2019 to be recov- ered is the total amount of the refund initially paid or merely a part thereof. 141. Accordingly, the discretion enjoyed by the competent national authority consists, in particular, in determining whether or not the Community legislation on the protection of animals during transport has been infringed, whether that infringement has had an impact on animal welfare and whether it relates to all the animals or merely some of them. 58 58 \u2014 See, in that regard, the judgment in Viamex Agrar Handel and ZVK , paragraph 44. ",
        "I - 8796 OPINION OF MR BOT \u2014 CASE C-455/06 142. Such discretion is not, however, unlim- ited and it is for the national court to review whether, in accordance with Article 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98, as the legal basis for the decision to recover the amount paid unduly, that decision actually seeks to recover the \u2018relevant part of the refund\u2019. 143. In other words, it is for the national court to verify that the competent authority has not transformed the discretion it enjoys into discretion as to the expediency of demanding repayment of Community funds unduly granted. 144. That review by the national court, as the ultimate guarantor of the proper appli- cation of Community law, is decisive in safe- guarding requirements in the general interest such as the protection of the health and life of animals and the protection of the financial interests of the Community, in so far as it encourages the competent national authority to be more rigorous when adopting its recovery decisions and ensures that Commu- nity funds unduly granted are not retained by their recipients. The application of Commu- nity law by a court of its own motion there- fore constitutes an effective instrument in combating fraud against the financial inter- ests of the Community. 145. I would point out, in that connec- tion, that the argument put forward by the Commission at the hearing that there are other means of protecting the financial interests of the Community, such as the pro - cedure for the clearance of the accounts in the context of the EAGGF, does not appear rele- vant to me. I take the view that, in so far as Article 5(7) of Regulation No 615/18 requires a recipient to repay the amounts which he has unduly received, the fact that the Community was repaid by the Member State does not, as such, dispense the latter from the obligation to recover such amounts from that recipient. That is, in essence, the pos - ition taken by the Court in its judgment in Vereniging Nationaal Overlegorgaan Sociale Werkvoorziening and Others . 59 146. In the light of all those reasons, I propose that the court should rule that the effective application of Community law requires a national court, in circumstances such as those in the dispute in the main proceedings, to review of its own motion the legality of a national administrative measure in the light of pleas based on the infringement of the second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 and Articles 1 and 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98, including where such a review leads to the appellant in the main proceedings being placed in a less advantageous position than that in which he would have found himself if he had not brought the appeal. 59 \u2014 Paragraph 58.

In the light of all the foregoing considerations, I propose that the Court should answer the questions referred by the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven as follows: \u2018(1) The second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal and Articles 1 and 5(7) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 615/98 of 18 March 1998 laying down specific detailed rules of application for the export refund arrangements as regards the welfare of live bovine animals during trans- port must be interpreted as meaning that the national authority having compe- tence to pay export refunds is empowered to decide that a transport of animals has not been carried out in accordance with the provisions of Council Dir- ective 91/628/EEC of 19 November 1991 on the protection of animals during transport and amending Directives 90/425/EEC and 91/496/EEC, as amended by Council Directive 95/29/EC of 29 June 1995, even though the official veterinarian had at the outset certified, pursuant to Article 2(3) of Regulation No 615/98, that that transport complied with the provisions of Directive 91/628, as amended. In order to reach such a conclusion, the competent national authority must base its decision on objective elements having a bearing on animal welfare and capable of calling into question the documents presented by the exporter and must adequately justify its decision demanding recovery of the export refund. (2) The second subparagraph of Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 and Art - icles 1 and 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98 must be interpreted as meaning that the competent authority of the Member State of exportation must, in order to establish that the Community requirements relating to loading density laid down in Chapter VI, paragraph 47, B, of the Annex to Directive 91/628 have not been complied with, take into account the rules for determining the surface area of that vessel available for transporting animals in force in the Member State of registration of the vessel which transported the animals, by recognising the authorisation which was issued to that vessel by the competent authority of the latter State.

        "I - 8808 JUDGMENT OF 25. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-455/06 The dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a prelim- inary ruling It is clear from the order for reference that, on 25 January 2000, each of the appli- cants in the main proceedings notified the export of 300 in-calf heifers to Morocco, for which they applied and obtained payment of an export refund in accordance with Regulation No 800/1999. On the same day, at Moerdijk (Netherlands), the 600 in-calf heifers, together with 40 in-calf heifers belonging to another undertaking, were loaded onto the M/S Irish Rose, a vessel registered in Ireland (\u2018the vessel\u2019), for transport to Casablanca (Morocco). The official veterinarian who checked the loading certified that the conditions set out in Article 2 of Regulation No 615/98 had been fulfilled. The vessel was authorised by the Irish authorities for the transport of animals on a surface area of 986 m 2 . During a check carried out pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 of 21 December 1989 on scrutiny by Member States of transactions forming part of the system of financing by the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund and repealing Directive 77/435/EEC (OJ 1989 L 388, p. 18), a document was found among the administrative files of the applicants in the main proceedings from which it was apparent that the capacity of the vessel for the trans- port of live animals had been exceeded by up to 111 head of cattle. Further inves- tigation by the General Inspectorate showed that the official veterinarian had not checked at the exit point if the loading density standards in Chapter VI of the Annex to Directive 91/628 had been complied with. On the basis of that investigation and a statement by the person who accompanied the animals during their transport to 10 11 12 13 ",
        "I - 8809 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP Morocco, the General Inspectorate concluded that the welfare conditions for bovine animals during transport laid down by Directive 91/628 had not been complied with and that the vessel had clearly been overloaded. By decisions of 26 March 2004, the Productschap withdrew the export refund granted to the applicants in the main proceedings and called for repayment of the amounts already paid, plus 10%. In addition, it fixed the statutory rate of interest payable. By letters of 13 April 2004, each of the applicants lodged a complaint against the decisions of 26 March 2004. By decisions of 2 and 25 August 2005, the Productschap decided, after hearing the applicants in the main proceedings on 6 May 2004, to uphold the withdrawal and the repayment of the refund, but to reduce the amounts of the sums to be recovered. Considering that the number of bovine animals in excess of that permitted for the authorised surface area of 986 m 2 had been transported in breach of the standards laid down by Directive 91/628, including those governing loading density, the Productschap took the view that it was necessary to withdraw and recover the refund granted in respect of the part of the load which did not comply with the animal welfare requirements. To that end, it was established that, according to point 47 of the Annex to Direct- ive 91/628, the loading standard for the transportation of in-calf heifers by sea amounted to 1.70775 m 2 . In order to calculate the number of animals transported in breach of that loading standard, the Productschap divided the authorised surface area of the vessel, namely 986 m 2 , by the area laid down for each animal. It concluded that 62 excess animals had been transported. 14 15 16 17 ",
        "I - 8810 JUDGMENT OF 25. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-455/06 The amount of the export refund to be recovered from the applicants in the main proceedings was calculated by the Productschap on the basis of the amount granted in respect of the number of excess animals transported, in proportion to the appli- cants\u2019 participation in the operation as a whole. According to that calculation, each of the applicants in the main proceedings was required to repay the refund in respect of 29 animals. In accordance with Article 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98, read in conjunction with Article 5(4) thereof, the refund granted was, moreover, reduced by an amount equal to that of the refund withdrawn. The applicants in the main proceedings brought an action before the national court against the decisions of 2 and 25 August 2005, cited above. In support of their action, they relied on several pleas in law. Essentially, they claim, first, that the certificate issued by the official veterinarian is conclusive and, second, that the requirement under Irish law that the vessel could transport animals only on a surface area of 986 m 2 was not applicable to a transport from the Netherlands to Morocco. It is, moreover, clear from the order for reference that the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven identified other arguments which might have an influence on the resolution of the dispute in the main proceedings. However, as those arguments had not been raised before it, national rules of procedure precluded their being taken into account. It is apparent from Article 8:69 of the General Law on administrative law that the court is to give its ruling solely on the basis of the issues submitted to it by the parties. Although Article 8:69(2) states that the court is to supplement the pleas in law of its own motion, that provision should, however, be interpreted as meaning that the court is to put the applicants\u2019 objections to the contested administrative measure into the correct legal form. It is necessary to make a distinction between that duty of the court to supplement those pleas in law of its own motion and the assessment which the court is required to make on its own initiative. Such an assess- ment is required only in cases involving the application of rules of public policy, that is to say those rules relating to the powers of administrative bodies and those of the court itself along with the provisions on admissibility. 18 19 20 ",
        "I - 8811 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP The national court wishes, however, to know whether it is required, in the light of Community law, to take into consideration arguments based on that law which were not put forward by the appellants in the main proceedings. It is in those circumstances that the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \u2018(1) (a) Is an administrative body empowered to decide, contrary to the declar- ation of the official veterinarian referred to in Article 2(2) of Regulation \u2026 No 615/98, that the transport of animals to which the official veterinarian\u2019s declaration relates is not in accordance with the conditions laid down in Directive [91/628]? (b) If the answer to Question 1a is in the affirmative: Is the exercise by the administrative body of that power on grounds of Community law subject to specific restrictions, and if so, what are those restrictions? (2) If the answer to Question 1 is in the affirmative: When assessing whether there is an entitlement to refunds, for which Regula- tion \u2026 No 800/1999, for example, provides, should an administrative body of a Member State determine whether a transport of live animals complies with Community animal welfare legislation by reference to the requirements 21 22 ",
        "I - 8812 JUDGMENT OF 25. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-455/06 applicable in the Member State or to those of the State in which the vessel trans- porting the live animals is registered and which has granted an authorisation for that vessel? (3) Does Community law require a court or tribunal to conduct, of its own motion, an examination of grounds derived from Regulation \u2026 No 1254/1999 and Regu- lation \u2026 No 800/1999, that is to say, an examination of grounds falling outside the ambit of the disputes as submitted to it? (4) Is the phrase \u2018subject to compliance with the provisions established in Commu- nity legislation concerning animal welfare\u2019 in Article 33(9) of Regulation \u2026 No 1254/1999 to be understood as meaning that, where it is established that while transporting live animals a vessel was so heavily laden as to exceed the cargo permitted by the relevant welfare legislation, there was a failure to comply with Community animal welfare legislation only in respect of the number of animals by which the permitted cargo was exceeded, or must it be found that that legisla- tion was not complied with in respect of all the live animals transported? (5) Does the effective application of Community law entail that a court\u2019s exam- ination, of its own motion, of compatibility with provisions of Community law prevails over the principle enshrined in Dutch law of administrative procedure that an individual bringing an action must not be placed thereby in a less advan- tageous position than if he had not brought that action?\u2019 ",
        "I - 8813 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP The questions referred for a preliminary ruling The first question By its first question, the national court asks essentially whether Regulation No 615/98 and, in particular, Articles 1 and 5(3) and (7) thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that a national authority with competence for export refunds is empowered to decide that a transport of animals has not been carried out in accordance with Dir - ective 91/628, although the official veterinarian had certified, pursuant to Article 2(3) of the regulation, that that transport complied with the provisions of that directive. If the answer is in the affirmative, the national court also asks whether the power of that authority is subject to certain limits. It should be pointed out that, in the light of the wording of Articles 1 and 5(3) of Regulation No 615/98, the payment of export refunds is conditional upon compli- ance with Directive 91/628. It is for the exporter to establish, in accordance with Article 5(1) and (2) of that regulation, that the conditions for the grant of the export refund are met. It should be noted that the exporter must, in order to obtain payment of the export refund, provide the competent authority of the Member State where the declaration is accepted with proof of compliance with Article 1 of that regulation and, accordingly, with that directive, by producing the documents referred to in Art - icles 2(3) and 3(2) respectively of that regulation. The official veterinarian\u2019s certificate is one of those documents. 23 24 ",
        "I - 8814 JUDGMENT OF 25. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-455/06 With regard to the evidential nature of such documents, the Court has held that, as is clear from the aim of Articles 3 and 5 of Regulation No 615/98, presentation by the exporter of those documents does not constitute irrefutable proof of compli- ance with Article 1 of that regulation, or of compliance with Directive 91/628. That evidence is sufficient only in so far as the competent authority does not have at its disposal evidence in the light of which it may find that the directive has not been complied with. That interpretation is confirmed by the wording of Article 5(3) of that regulation, under which the competent authority is entitled not to pay the export refund for animals in respect of which it considers \u2014 in the light of the docu- ments referred to in Article 5(2), the reports on the checks referred to in Article 4 of that regulation and/or any other element at its disposal concerning compliance with Article 1 of the regulation \u2014 that Directive 91/628 has not been complied with (see Case C-96/06 Viamex Agrar Handel [2008] ECR I-1413, paragraphs 34 and 35). Despite the production by the exporter of a certificate from the official veterinarian, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation No 615/98, the competent authority may consider that the exporter has complied neither with Article 1 of that regula- tion nor with Directive 91/628, provided, inter alia, that the conditions laid down in Article 5(3) of that regulation are met ( Viamex Agrar Handel , above, paragraph 36). As the Advocate General has pointed out at point 51 of his Opinion, it is necessary to treat that reasoning \u2014 according to which the competent authority may decide, despite the documents provided by the exporter, not to pay the refund \u2014 as also applying if the refund has already been paid to the exporter. Any other interpretation would render redundant, first, Article 5(7) of Regulation No 615/98, by virtue of which, where it is established, after payment of the refund, 25 26 27 28 ",
        "I - 8815 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP that Community legislation on the protection of animals during transport has not been complied with, the refund shall be recovered in accordance with the provisions of Article 11(3) to (6) of Regulation No 3665/87 and, second, the checks organised ex posteriori, referred to in Regulation No 4045/89. With regard to the question whether such competence is subject to certain limits, the Court has already held that Article 5 of Regulation No 615/98 cannot be interpreted as permitting the competent authority arbitrarily to call into question the evidence attached by the exporter to its export refund application. The discretion which the competent authority enjoys is not unlimited, since it is circumscribed by Article 5. That discretion appears, in particular, limited as to the nature and the evidentiary value of the elements on which the competent authority relies (see Viamex Agrar Handel , paragraph 38). The Court held that the competent authority is thus required, pursuant to Article 5(3) of Regulation No 615/98, to base itself on objective and specific elements relating to the welfare of the animals which are capable of establishing that the docu- ments attached by the exporter to its export refund application do not prove compli- ance with the provisions of Directive 91/628 during transportation, and it is for the exporter to show, where appropriate, that the elements relied on by that authority to substantiate its finding of non-compliance with that regulation and that directive are not relevant ( Viamex Agrar Handel , paragraph 41). The Court held that, in any event, the competent authority is required to justify its decision by stating the reasons why it considers the evidence presented by the exporter does not enable it to be concluded that Directive 91/628 was complied with. For that purpose, the authority is required, in particular, to make an objective assess- ment of the documents presented to it by the exporter and to show the pertinence of 29 30 31 ",

In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question must be that Regulation No 615/98 and, in particular, Articles 1 and 5(3) and (7) thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that a national authority with competence for export refunds is empowered to decide that a transport of animals was not carried out in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/628, although, under Article 2(3) of the regulation, the official veterinarian had certified that that transport complied with the provisions of that directive. In order to reach that conclusion, that authority must rely on objective elements relating to the welfare of the animals such as to call into question the documents presented by the exporter, it being for the latter to show, in that case, that the elements relied on by the competent authority to substan- tiate its finding of non-compliance with Directive 91/628 are irrelevant. The second question By its second question, the national court asks, essentially, for clarification whether \u2014 when assessing if a right to a refund exists in the situations for which Regulation No 800/1999 provides \u2014 the competent authority of the Member State of export should take into account, for the purpose of determining whether Commu- nity legislation on animal welfare during transport have been complied with, the available surface area of the vessel based on the standards in force in that Member State or that mentioned upon the grant of authorisation based on the standards in force in the State in which the vessel is registered. 32 33 ",
        "I - 8817 HEEMSKERK AND SCHAAP In that regard, it should be pointed out that both the State of export and the State of registration of the vessel referred to by the national court are Member States of the European Union. Directive 91/628 does not contain any express provision concerning the total surface area of a vessel capable of being used for the transport of animals. In that context, if a vessel is authorised in respect of a certain surface area by the competent authority of the Member State of registration, it is necessary to assess whether the surface area indicated in the authorisation represents the surface area within which the welfare of the animals is guaranteed. It is common ground that, in order to grant an authorisation, the competent authority must necessarily carry out detailed checks in order to calculate the total effective surface area of the vessel that is such as to ensure the welfare of the animals during transport. Accordingly, the competent authority of the Member State of export must take that effective surface area into account in order to assess whether the transport of the animals on the vessel was carried out in compliance with the provisions of Dir - ective 91/628 on animal welfare. In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second question must be that, where a vessel has been authorised for the transport of animals in respect of a certain surface area by the Member State of registration of the vessel, the competent authority of the Member State of export must take that authorisation as a basis for assessing whether Community legislation on the welfare of animals during transport has been complied with. 34 35 36 37 38 ",

Under Chapter VI, point 47(B) of the Annex to the directive, the loading density for each animal is to be determined, in the case of transport by sea, in square metres. As the Advocate General has pointed out at point 74 of his Opinion, if the total surface area available on the vessel for the transport of animals divided by the number of animals actually transported does not comply with the surface area per animal laid down in Chapter VI, point 47(B) of the Annex to Directive 91/628, it must be held that the Community standards relating to loading density have not been complied with for any of the animals transported. It is common ground that if the loading density is exceeded, the space available for each animal is reduced since the number of animals on the vessel is greater than that permitted under those standards. Moreover, it should be pointed out that the overloading of a vessel necessarily affects all the animals, since it results in the restriction of their physical movements, reduces the amount of space necessary for their comfort, increases the risk that those animals 39 40 41 42 ",

In those circumstances, the answer to the fourth question must be that the notion of \u2018compliance with the provisions established in Community legislation concerning animal welfare\u2019 referred to in Article 33(9) of Regulation No 1254/1999 must be interpreted as meaning that, where it is established that the Community require- ments relating to loading density laid down in Chapter VI, point 47(B) of the Annex to Directive 91/628 were not complied with during the transport of the animals, it is necessary, in principle, to make a finding of non-compliance with those provisions in respect of all the live animals transported. The third and fifth questions By its third and fifth questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the national court asks, essentially, whether Community law requires national courts to examine, of their own motion, pleas in law derived from Regulations No 1254/1999 and Regulation No 800/1999 falling outside the ambit of the dispute, where such an examination would result in denial of the principle of Dutch law that an individual bringing an action must not be placed in a less favourable position than if he had not brought that action (principle of the prohibition of reformatio in pejus ). The College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven indicates that, in accordance with Article 8:69 of the General Law on administrative law, it may not, as a rule, take account of arguments which fall outside the ambit of the dispute as defined by the 43 44 45 ",

It states, moreover, that, if Community law required it to raise of its own motion pleas based on Regulations Nos 1254/1999 and 800/1999, it might come up against the procedural rule prohibiting reformatio in pejus enshrined in Dutch administrative law, according to which an individual who brings an action cannot find himself in a less favourable position than he would have been in, had the action not been brought. It does not rule out the possibility that, if those regulations are taken into account, the burden on the applicants in the main proceedings may be increased. In that regard it should be pointed out that Community law cannot oblige a national court to apply Community legislation of its own motion where this would have the effect of denying the principle, enshrined in its national procedural law, of the pro - hibition of reformatio in pejus . Such an obligation would be contrary not only to the principles of respect for the rights of the defence, legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations, which underlie the prohibition, but would expose an individual who brought an action against an act adversely affecting him to the risk that such an action would place him in a less favourable position than he would have been in, had he not brought that action. In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the third and fifth questions must be that Community law does not require national courts to apply, of their own motion, a provision of Community law where such application would lead them to deny the principle, enshrined in the relevant national law, of the prohibition of reformatio in pejus . 46 47 48 ",

        "I - 8827 INTEL CORPORATION OPINION OF ADVOCATE GENERAL SHARPSTON delivered on 26 June 2008 1 1. This reference for a preliminary ruling from the Court of Appeal of England and Wales concerns the extent to which trade marks with a reputation may be protected against \u2018dilution\u2019. 2. Community trade mark law 2 allows a Member State to provide that a national trade mark may be declared invalid if it is similar to an earlier national trade mark, even though the two marks may be registered for dissimilar goods or services, if the earlier mark has a reputation in the Member State and if \u2018use of the later trade mark without due cause would take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the earlier trade mark\u2019. 3. The Court of Justice has interpreted that wording as requiring a degree of similarity 1 \u2014 Original language: English. 2 \u2014 Article 4(4)(a) of First Council Directive 89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks (OJ 1989 L 40, p. 1) (\u2018the Dir - ective\u2019 or \u2018The Trade Marks Directive\u2019). I shall set out the legislation in greater detail below (point 14 et seq.). between the two marks which need not be such as to give rise to a likelihood of confu- sion but may merely have the effect that the relevant section of the public \u2018establishes a link\u2019 between them. 4. The issue in the national proceedings is whether the owners of the trade mark \u2018Intel\u2019, which has a reputation in respect of computer related goods and services, may obtain invalidation of the later mark \u2018Intel- mark\u2019, registered in respect of marketing services. In that context, the Court of Appeal seeks further clarification of the nature of the \u2018link\u2019 required by the case-law, and of the concepts of (i) unfair advantage and (ii) detri- ment to the distinctive character or repute of the earlier mark. The notion of dilution 5. A significant function of a trade mark is to link goods or services to a source of ",
        "I - 8828 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-252/07 supply, whether the original producer or a commercial intermediary. That is in the interest of both supplier and consumer. The supplier can establish a reputation, which is protected from usurpation by competitors, for products bearing the mark, and can thus promote trade in those products. Likewise, the consumer can make purchasing decisions on the basis of the qualities he perceives as attached to the mark. Since those decisions may be negative, suppliers have an incentive to maintain and improve the quality of the goods or services supplied under the mark. 6. In that context, marks which are identical, or similar enough to be confused, should not coexist unless the goods or services for which they are used are sufficiently dissimilar to rule out the danger of confusion. Trade marks are therefore protected by a basic rule 3 which prevents the registration or use of a sign identical or similar to a registered trade mark, for goods or services identical or similar to those for which the mark is regis- tered. To put it more graphically, around each trade mark there is an \u2018exclusion zone\u2019 which other marks may not enter. The extent of that zone will vary according to circum- stances. An identical or extremely similar mark must be kept at a greater distance in terms of the goods or services covered. 3 \u2014 Such as that in Article 4(1) of the Directive; see point 16 below. Conversely, a mark used for identical or extremely similar products must be kept at a greater distance in terms of similarity with the protected mark. 7. Such protection is seen as sufficient as a general rule. Similar or even identical trade marks can coexist for dissimilar products without causing confusion in consumers\u2019 minds or harming traders\u2019 commercial interests. 8. But that is not true in all circumstances. In an apparent paradox, the best known trade marks are particularly vulnerable to the exist- ence of similar marks even in highly dissim- ilar product areas, where actual confusion is unlikely. Moreover, such marks frequently perform functions which go beyond linking goods or services to a uniform source. They present a powerful image of quality, exclusivity, youth, fun, luxury, adventure, glamour or other reputedly desirable lifestyle attributes, not necessarily associated with specific products but capable of presenting a strong marketing message in itself. 4 4 \u2014 See also the Opinion of Advocate General Ruiz-Jarabo in Case C-206/01 Arsenal Football Club [2002] ECR I-10273, at points 46 and 47.

One can imagine how, if \u2018Coca-Cola\u2019 were registered only in respect of soft drinks, the distinctiveness of the mark could be eroded if it (or a similar mark or sign) were used by others in respect of a host of unrelated prod- ucts; or how its reputation could be harmed if it were used for low-grade engine oils or cheap paint strippers. 10. The notion of protecting trade marks against dilution arose in response to such concerns. As Advocate General Jacobs noted in Adidas I , 5 it was first articulated by Schechter in 1927 \u2014 although Schechter considered that it was \u2018arbitrary, coined or fanciful marks\u2019, rather than famous marks, which should benefit from such protection. 6 11. Two types of dilution are commonly recognised: blurring and tarnish - 5 \u2014 Case C-408/01 Adidas\u00adSalomon and Adidas Benelux [2003] ECR I-12537; Opinion, points 37 and 38; quoted in full at point 33 below. 6 \u2014 Frank I. Schechter, \u2018The rational basis of trademark protec- tion\u2019, Harvard Law Review , 1927, p. 813. Schechter himself drew inspiration from a 1924 decision of the Landesgericht Elberfeld, Germany, which allowed the owner of the well- known trade mark \u2018Odol\u2019, registered for mouthwash, to obtain cancellation of registration of the same mark for steel products, on the ground that the complainant had \u2018the utmost interest in seeing that its mark is not diluted [ verw\u00e4s\u00ad sert ]: it would lose in selling power if everyone used it as the designation of his goods\u2019 (Schechter\u2019s translation). It is satis- fying to find that the concept of dilution has its origins in mouthwash. ment. 7 Broadly, the former corresponds to the notion of detriment to the distinctive character of the earlier mark in Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive, and to my first example concerning Coca-Cola, while the latter corresponds to that of detriment to its repute, and to my second example. 12. Article 4(4)(a) adds a further category of abuse: taking unfair advantage of the distinct - iveness or repute of the earlier mark, often referred to as free-riding. 8 13. The protection thus afforded concerns less the link established between a product and its source than the use of the trade mark 7 \u2014 These are the terms used in the United States Trade- mark Dilution Revision Act of 2006. The term \u2018dilution\u2019 is, however, sometimes used only for blurring, with tarnishment treated as a separate concept. 8 \u2014 See point 39 of, and footnote 18 to, the Opinion in Adidas I. I n this Opinion, when I use the terms \u2018free-riding\u2019, \u2018blur- ring\u2019 and \u2018tarnishment\u2019, I do so as shorthand for, respectively, the notions of taking unfair advantage of the distinctive char- acter or repute of the earlier mark, being detrimental to the distinctive character of that mark and being detrimental to the repute of that mark, as embodied in the Directive.

Within the European Community, trade mark law comprises two limbs. On the one hand, there is a system of Community trade marks, valid throughout the Community and governed by the Community Trade Mark Regulation. 9 On the other, there are separate systems of national trade marks, each limited to the Member State concerned but to a very large extent harmonised by the Trade Marks Directive. 10 15. According to its preamble, the basic protection afforded by the Directive \u2014 the function of which is in particular to guarantee the trade mark as an indication of origin \u2014 is absolute in the case of identity between the mark and the sign and between the goods or services covered, but applies also in the case of similarity between the mark and the sign and between the goods or services, in which case likelihood of confusion is the specific condition for such protection. 11 9 \u2014 Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 on the Community trade mark (OJ 1994 L 11, p. 1) (\u2018the Regulation\u2019). 10 \u2014 Cited in footnote 2. 11 \u2014 See the 10th recital. 16. Article 4(1) consequently provides: \u2018A trade mark shall not be registered or, if registered, shall be liable to be declared invalid: (a) if it is identical with an earlier trade mark, and the goods or services for which the trade mark is applied for or is registered are identical with the goods or services for which the earlier trade mark is protected; (b) if because of its identity with, or simi- larity to, the earlier trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by the trade marks, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, which includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade mark.\u2019 17.

In that connection, Article 4(4)(a) \u2014 the provision directly in issue in the present case \u2014 allows any Member State to provide that \u2018a trade mark shall not be registered or, if registered, is liable to be declared invalid where, and to the extent that \u2026 the trade mark is identical with, or similar to, an earlier national trade mark \u2026 and is to be, or has been, registered for goods or services which are not similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is registered, where the earlier trade mark has a reputation in the Member State concerned and where the use of the later trade mark without due cause would take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the earlier trade mark\u2019. 13 19. In similar terms, Article 5(2) allows any Member State to give a trade mark propri- etor the right to prevent all third parties not having his consent from using in the course of trade any sign which is identical with, or similar to, his trade mark in relation to goods or services which are not similar to those for which the mark is registered, where it has a reputation in the Member State and \u2018where use of that sign without due cause takes 13 \u2014 It may be noted that the wording of this provision, as regards the terms \u2018reputation\u2019 and \u2018repute\u2019 used in English, is not consistent across the language versions of the Dir - ective.

The Directive and the Regulation were drafted in parallel, and many of their substantive provisions are similar, so that interpretation of one is often transposable to the other. That is relevant in the present case with regard to Article 8(5) of the Regulation, which allows proprietors of earlier national or Community trade marks having a reputa- tion in the territory in which they are regis- tered to oppose registration of a Community trade mark on the same grounds as those in Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive. 14 21. The Directive \u2014 including the optional provisions in Articles 4(4)(a) and 5(2) \u2014 has been implemented in the United Kingdom by the Trade Marks Act 1994. The referring court expressly states that the Act has the same meaning as the Directive, so that it is unnecessary to refer separately to the provi- sions of the Act. 14 \u2014 Article 52(1)(a) of the Regulation provides for a Community trade mark, once registered, to be declared invalid on the same grounds, thus completing the parallel with Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive.

The Court decided that, notwithstanding their use of the words \u2018not similar\u2019, Articles 4(4)(a) and 5(2) extended also to cases where the goods or services covered were identical or similar (confirmed in Adidas I , paragraph 19, and Case C-102/07 adidas and adidas Benelux [2008] ECR I-2439 (\u2018 Adidas II \u2019), paragraph 37). 16 \u2014 The Court of First Instance has also delivered a number of judgments concerning the equivalent provisions of the Regulation. 17 \u2014 Case C-375/97 [1999] ECR I-5421, especially at para- graphs 22 to 30. even when used for non-similar products or services, and that the earlier trade mark may consequently be damaged. In order to determine whether that threshold has been reached, all the relevant facts must be taken into consideration, in particular the market share held by the trade mark, the intensity, geographical extent and duration of its use, and the size of the investment made by the undertaking in promoting it. The Court also observed that the stronger the earlier mark\u2019s distinctive character and reputation the easier it will be to accept that detriment has been caused to it. 24. In Adidas I , 18 the Court considered, in substance, that Article 5(2) of the Dir - ective does not require a likelihood of confu- sion on the part of the public, but supposes a degree of visual, aural or conceptual simi- larity between the mark with a reputation and the sign 19 used such that the relevant section of the public \u2018makes a connection\u2019, or \u2018establishes a link\u2019, between the two, even though it does not confuse them. The exist- ence of such a link must, just like a likelihood 18 \u2014 Cited above in footnote 5, paragraphs 27 to 30.

Although the provisions thus differ in their sphere of application, the parallelism between them means that references to a \u2018sign\u2019 in one context are equivalent to references to a \u2018later trade mark\u2019 in the other.

In Adidas II , 20 the Court confirmed its judgment in Adidas I and went on to state that the requirement of availability (namely, that the use of certain signs should not be unduly restricted for other traders, a concept known in German as Freihaltebed\u00fcrfnis ) is extraneous both to the assessment of the degree of similarity between the mark with a reputation and the sign used by the third party and to the link which may be made by the relevant public between that mark and the sign. It cannot therefore constitute a relevant factor for determining whether the use of the sign takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the trade mark.

Assessment Preliminary remarks The law to be interpreted 30. The theory of dilution has long been the subject of disagreement among commen- tators (and exasperation at the perceived obtuseness of others, including the courts). 22 Current United States and European legisla- tion is sometimes criticised because it does not conform to Schechter\u2019s original view that highly distinctive marks should be protected rather than simply very famous marks. 23 Conversely, courts are sometimes criticised for not acknowledging the full extent to which famous marks should be protected. 24 31. The Court\u2019s task, on the other hand, is not to define the doctrine of dilution, as articulated by Schechter or by others, but to interpret the wording of a Community dir - ective. Only the latter is the law, however much light can be shed on it by the former. 32. But even when interpreting that wording as such, the Court cannot ignore the 22 \u2014 \u2018No part of trademark law that I have encountered in my forty years of teaching and practicing IP law has created so much doctrinal puzzlement and judicial incomprehen- sion as the concept of \u201cdilution\u201d as a form of intrusion on a trademark.

Owners of famous marks have a particular interest in creating as wide an exclusion zone as possible around their marks, and other market participants have an interest in keeping that exclusion zone to the minimum. And there is a public interest not only in protecting such para- doxically vulnerable trade marks but also in preventing dominant traders \u2014 who, by and large, own those marks \u2014 from abusing that protection to the detriment of other, weaker operators. Any interpretation should, as far as possible, aim for a fair balance between those interests. Advocate General Jacobs\u2019s description of dilution in Adidas I 33. Extensive reference has been made to points 36 to 39 of Advocate General Jacobs\u2019s Opinion in Adidas I. I t may be helpful to set out in full the text 25 of those points. He stated: \u2018Article 5(2) protects the proprietor of a mark with a reputation against use of an 25 \u2014 For ease of reading, I omit the paragraph numbers and the footnotes. identical or similar sign \u201cwhere use of that sign without due cause takes unfair advan- tage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the trade mark\u201d. There are thus in principle four types of use which may be caught: use which takes unfair advantage of the mark\u2019s distinctive character, use which takes unfair advantage of its repute, use which is detrimental to the mark\u2019s distinctive character and use which is detrimental to its repute. The concept of detriment to the distinctive character of a trade mark reflects what is generally referred to as dilution. That notion was first articulated by Schechter, who advo- cated protection against injury to a trade mark owner going beyond the injury caused by use of an identical or similar mark in rela- tion to identical or similar goods or services causing confusion as to origin. Schechter described the type of injury with which he was concerned as the \u201cgradual whittling away or dispersion of the identity and hold upon the public mind\u201d of certain marks. The courts in the United States, where owners of certain marks have been protected against dilution for some time, have added richly to the lexicon of dilution, describing it in terms of lessening, watering down, debilitating, weakening, undermining, blurring, eroding and insidious gnawing away at a trade mark. The essence of dilution in this classic sense is that the blurring of the distinctiveness of the mark means that it is no longer capable of arousing immediate association with the goods for which it is registered and used. Thus, to quote Schechter again, \u201cfor instance, if you allow Rolls Royce restaurants and Rolls ",
        "I - 8837 INTEL CORPORATION Royce cafeterias, and Rolls Royce pants, and Rolls Royce candy, in 10 years you will not have the Rolls Royce mark any more\u201d. In contrast, the concept of detriment to the repute of a trade mark, often referred to as degradation or tarnishment of the mark, describes the situation where \u2014 as it was put in the well-known Claeryn / Klarein deci- sion of the Benelux Court of Justice \u2014 the goods for which the infringing sign is used appeal to the public\u2019s senses in such a way that the trade mark\u2019s power of attraction is affected. That case concerned the identically pronounced marks \u201cClaeryn\u201d for a Dutch gin and \u201cKlarein\u201d for a liquid detergent. Since it was found that the similarity between the two marks might cause consumers to think of detergent when drinking \u201cClaeryn\u201d gin, the \u201cKlarein\u201d mark was held to infringe the \u201cClaeryn\u201d mark. The concepts of taking unfair advantage of the distinctive character or repute of the mark in contrast must be intended to encom- pass \u201cinstances where there is clear exploit- ation and free-riding on the coattails of a famous mark or an attempt to trade upon its reputation\u201d. Thus by way of example Rolls Royce would be entitled to prevent a manufacturer of whisky from exploiting the reputation of the Rolls Royce mark in order to promote his brand. It is not obvious that there is any real difference between taking advantage of a mark\u2019s distinctive character and taking advantage of its repute; since however nothing turns on any such differ- ence in the present case, I shall refer to both as free-riding.\u2019 34. The referring court states that the passage is a \u2018far-reaching view of the scope of protection\u2019, but that the Court of Justice did not find it necessary to decide whether that view was correct. 35. I, however, do not read the passage as setting out a view of the extent of the protection afforded by Community law to marks with a reputation. Rather, it seems to me, Advocate General Jacobs was there presenting the historical and concep- tual context in which that protection was adopted, as an aid to understanding, much as I have myself attempted to do at points 5 to 13 above.

        "I - 8838 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-252/07 37. Taken together, they ask, essentially, what factors are to be taken into account when assessing, and what is needed in order to establish, (i) a \u2018link\u2019 in the mind of the relevant public; (ii) unfair advantage taken of the distinctiveness or repute 26 of the earlier mark (free-riding); (iii) detriment to distinct- iveness (blurring); and (iv) detriment to repute (tarnishment). 38. I shall therefore address those issues in that order, referring to the specific criteria suggested in the questions in their appro- priate place. It is first necessary, however, to consider the relationship between the \u2018link\u2019 and the three other issues. Moreover, it seems clear from the case-file that the most important issues in the main proceedings are the criteria for determining the existence of a \u2018link\u2019 and of detriment to distinctiveness, to which I shall pay particular attention. I shall conclude with some more general consider- ations which affect all four issues. 26 \u2014 I agree with Advocate General Jacobs\u2019s view in Adidas I (point 39 of the Opinion, in fine) that there is no relevant difference between taking advantage of distinctiveness and taking advantage of repute. Relationship between \u2018link\u2019 and \u2018infringement\u2019 39. According to the case-law: 27 \u2018The infringements referred to in Article 5(2) of the Directive, where they occur, are the consequence of a certain degree of similarity between the mark and the sign, by virtue of which the relevant section of the public makes a connection between the sign and the mark, that is to say, establishes a link between them even though it does not confuse them\u2019. By \u2018infringements\u2019 in that context, the Court means free-riding, blurring or tarnishment. 40. It seems clear from the structure of Articles 4(4)(a) and 5(2) of the Directive that registration or use can be prevented or halted, as the case may be, if two sets of conditions are fulfilled. First, there are the preconditions which are themselves cumu- lative: there must be an earlier mark and a later mark or sign, the two must be iden- tical or similar, the earlier mark must have a reputation and the use of the later mark must be without due cause. 28 Second, there are the consequences to be guarded against, which are alternative: there must be, at least 27 \u2014 Adidas I , paragraph 29, and Adidas II , paragraph 41. 28 \u2014 On a literal reading, the two must also be registered or used in respect of dissimilar goods or services, but that condition was found to be superfluous in Davidoff II . ",
        "I - 8839 INTEL CORPORATION potentially, unfair advantage or detriment, relating to the distinctive character or repute of the earlier mark. If both the first and second sets of conditions are fulfilled, the trade mark owner may claim the protection of the relevant provision. 41. Where does the link to which the Court has referred in Adidas I and II (and which finds its origin in the \u2018association\u2019 referred to in General Motors ) fit within that structure? 42. It seems to me to fit logically with the first set of conditions. It is bound up with the question of similarity or identity. And if the infringements, where they occur, are the consequence of a degree of similarity which leads to the public establishing a link between the marks, it is futile to enquire whether there is free-riding, blurring or tarnishment unless it has been established that such a link is made. 43. Moreover, the existence of a link in the public\u2019s mind is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for the existence of an infringement. There are three types of possible infringement, each of which seems capable of occurring, in some circumstances, without the others. The mental link between the marks therefore cannot automatically, without further evidence, lead to the conclu- sion that any one of those infringements has occurred or would occur if the contested mark were registered. 44. Consequently, I do not accept the impli- cation, which permeates Intel\u2019s submissions to the Court, that once a relevant link has been established there is no need to look any further before granting the protection offered by the provision. 45. That said, I do accept that many of the factors which are relevant when assessing the existence of a link will be relevant also when, in the second stage of the analysis, one turns to assess the presence or likelihood of free-riding, blurring or tarnishment \u2014 and in particular of blurring, which seems likely to follow more closely on the heels of a mental link than do the other two. However, each criterion (whether in the first or the second stage of assessment) must be assessed sep - arately and, when the factors in question are being used to assess a different criterion, they may have to be taken into account in different ways. ",
        "I - 8840 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-252/07 Existence of a link 46. First of all, it seems to me that, of the circumstances set out in the national court\u2019s first question, (d) \u2014 the fact that for an average consumer the earlier mark would be \u2018brought to mind\u2019 by the later mark \u2014 is itself tantamount to the establishment of a link (or the making of an association or connec- tion) between the two marks, as expressed in the Court\u2019s case-law. I would not distin- guish between those terms, which all imply a mental process above the threshold of consciousness, something more than a vague, ephemeral, indefinable feeling or subliminal influence. 47. If the national court meant, by the term \u2018brought to mind\u2019, something less than the actual establishment of a link (which must be of a reasonably substantial nature, since it must be made by a significant part of the relevant public 29 ), then clearly other factors must be examined too. 48. Of the remaining circumstances listed in question 1, it seems to me that (a) \u2014 the \u2018huge reputation\u2019 of the earlier mark for certain goods or services \u2014 is in part (as regards the existence of a reputation) simply 29 \u2014 General Motors , paragraph 26. one of the express conditions for the applica- tion of Article 4(4)(a) or 5(2). 49. Circumstance (b) \u2014 the use of the later mark for dissimilar goods or services \u2014 also represents a condition for the application of those provisions, although it no longer seems relevant since Davidoff II . This point is linked, however, to that raised in the second question, which I address below. 30 50. It may be the case that the public will more readily establish a link between the two marks if the earlier mark has a \u2018huge\u2019 repu- tation and is \u2018unique in respect of any goods or services\u2019 (circumstances (a) and (c) in the first question). However, those facts seem more relevant when assessing the existence of free-riding, blurring or tarnishment. 51. There is thus nothing in facts (a) to (c) set out in the first question which would be inconsistent with finding a link between marks in the mind of the public, within the meaning of the case-law, though they do not appear sufficient in themselves for that purpose. The finding must be made in the 30 \u2014 Points 58 to 61. ",
        "I - 8841 INTEL CORPORATION light of all the relevant circumstances. Some indication can be given of the circumstances which may be relevant, but there can be no exhaustive list. 52. The Court has stated that the exist- ence of a link must be appreciated globally, \u2018just like a likelihood of confusion\u2019. 31 Both that formulation and common sense suggest that factors relevant to establishing a likeli- hood of confusion will also be relevant when assessing the existence of a link, even though \u2018the existence of a link\u2019 in the mind of the public is not the same standard as \u2018a likeli- hood of confusion \u2026 which includes the like- lihood of association with the earlier trade mark\u2019. In that regard, it may be noted that the Court does not speak of the likelihood but of the existence of a link, which implies an assessment of a different nature \u2014 although, where the later mark is merely at the stage of application for registration and has not yet been used, it may be impossible to establish the current existence of such a link. 53. According to the 10th recital in the preamble to the Directive, the appreciation of a likelihood of confusion \u2018depends on numerous elements and, in particular, on the recognition of the trade mark on the market, [on] the association which can be made with the used or registered sign, [on] the degree of similarity between the trade mark and the sign and between the goods or services identified\u2019. 31 \u2014 Adidas I , paragraph 30; see also Adidas II , paragraph 42. 54. The Court, for its part, has consistently held that the global assessment of the likeli- hood of confusion, in relation to the visual, aural or conceptual similarity of the marks in question, must be based on the overall impression given by the marks, bearing in mind, in particular, their distinctive and dominant components. The perception of the marks by the average consumer of the goods or services in question plays a decisive role in the global appreciation of that likeli- hood of confusion. The average consumer normally perceives a mark as a whole and does not proceed to analyse its various details. 32 Moreover, likelihood of confusion may arise from conceptual similarity between marks and may be increased if the earlier mark has a particularly distinctive character, either per se or because of its reputation with the public. 33 55. All those factors can be considered when assessing whether a link between the two marks is established in the mind of the rele- vant public. 56. It may be helpful to consider also the factors set out in Section 43(c) of the United States Trademark Act of 1946, as amended by the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006. According to that provision, in 32 \u2014 See, for example, with regard to Article 8(1)(b) of the Regu- lation, Case C-334/05 P OHIM v Shaker [2007] ECR I-4529, paragraphs 34 and 35 and the case-law cited there. 33 \u2014 See in particular SABEL , paragraph 24, and Marca Mode , paragraph 38 (both cited in footnote 18 above). ",
        "I - 8842 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-252/07 determining whether a mark or trade name is likely to cause dilution by blurring, the court may consider all relevant factors, including the degree of similarity between the mark or trade name and the famous mark, the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the famous mark, the extent to which the owner of the famous mark is engaging in substan- tially exclusive use of the mark, the degree of recognition of the famous mark and any actual association between the mark or trade name and the famous mark. 57. That provision has of course no force in Community law, but the factors listed are fully consistent with the Court\u2019s approach to the assessment of a likelihood of confu- sion. And even though those factors are to be considered when assessing the likelihood of dilution itself, rather than the existence of a link in the mind of the public (which is not an explicit condition in the American legisla- tion), they also seem relevant to establishing whether such a link exists. 58. In the context of its second question, the Court of Appeal asks about the significance, for the establishment of a link, of the nature of the goods or services covered. It suggests that it is relevant whether, having regard to the nature of the goods or services for which the later mark is used, the average consumer would consider that there is an economic connection between the owners of the two marks. 59. I would agree that, if the circumstances were such as to cause the average consumer to suppose such a connection, that is more than enough to establish the existence of a link within the meaning of the case-law. However, the absence of such circumstances does not necessarily lead to the opposite conclusion. The Directive quite clearly speaks of goods or services which are not similar, and no requirement of similarity can be imposed. 34 That would come very close to effacing the distinction between the respect- ive conditions under which the basic protec- tion against likelihood of confusion and the extensive protection under Article 4(4)(a) are available. Nor, the Court has held, are Art - icles 4(4)(a) and 5(2) dependent on a finding of a belief that the goods or services in ques- tion come from the same undertaking or from economically-linked undertakings. 35 34 \u2014 That point is unaffected by the Court\u2019s ruling in Davidoff II to the effect that dissimilarity is not essential. 35 \u2014 See, most recently, Adidas II , paragraphs 28 and 40. ",
        "I - 8843 INTEL CORPORATION 60. There is, however, a way in which the nature of the goods or services covered by the respective marks may be relevant when determining the existence of a link in the mind of the public. If two marks are similar, yet used in widely separated product areas, the fact that the earlier mark has a reputation in one area \u2014 say, deep-sea drilling equip- ment \u2014 might not lead to the establishment of a mental link with the later mark if it were used in a quite different area \u2014 such as agri- cultural pesticides \u2014 since there might be very little overlap between the two relevant publics. Where either mark is used for goods or services familiar to the general public, or where both are used for similar products, the likelihood of overlap and of the estab- lishment of a link is correspondingly much stronger. 61. The nature of the goods or services may therefore be relevant when determining the existence of a link in the mind of the relevant public, but an absence of similarity between the product areas concerned cannot be taken to imply the absence of such a link, and belief in an economic connection between the marks is not a necessary criterion. Free\u00adriding 62. The concept of \u2018unfair advantage\u2019 focuses on benefit to the later mark rather than harm to the earlier mark. What must be estab- lished is some sort of boost given to the later mark by its link with the earlier mark. If, despite its reputation, the connotations of the earlier mark have a dampening or even merely neutral effect on the performance of the later mark, unfair advantage seems less likely. In the hypothesis, for example, of a select range of expensive hand-made jewel- lery sold under the trade mark \u2018Coca-Cola\u2019 or a similar mark, it does not seem inevitable that the marketing of the jewellery would benefit unfairly (or at all) from the Coca-Cola Company\u2019s trade mark. 63. In that light, the facts set out in question 1 seem too flimsy on their own to support a finding of free-riding. 64. It is, of course, necessary as a precondi- tion for such a finding that the earlier mark should have a reputation and that the later mark should bring the earlier mark to mind for the average consumer. There is (at least since Davidoff II ) no necessity for the goods or services covered by the two marks to ",
        "I - 8844 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-252/07 meet any particular standard of similarity or dissimilarity. Nor can it be concluded, simply from the fact that the earlier mark is unique, that the later mark takes unfair advantage of it. 65. That said, it seems clear that, as the repu- tation and distinctiveness of the earlier mark, and the similarity between the goods or ser - vices covered by the two marks, increase, so will the likelihood that the later mark will derive advantage from any link established between the two in the mind of the public. 66. But more is needed. If the later mark is to derive unfair advantage, the associ- ations of the earlier mark must be such as to enhance the performance of the later mark in the use that is made of it. A relevant factor to consider, therefore, will be the relation- ship between the prestigious connotations of the earlier mark and the context in which the later mark is used. Any advantage may well be greater if the earlier mark is unique, but there is nothing in the legislation to suggest that protection against free-riding can vary according to the extent of the unfair advan- tage derived. 67. If the later mark has already been regis- tered and used (as in the main proceed- ings), or if it is a sign whose use it is sought to prevent under Article 5(2), it may well be possible to provide consumer survey evidence indicating whether there has been any boosting or enhancing effect on the later mark as a result of the existence of the earlier mark. If, under Article 4(4)(a), it is a question of preventing the registration of a mark that has not yet been used, such evidence may be less easy to obtain, and inferences may have to be drawn from all the circumstances of the case as to the likely effect. Blurring 68. Unlike free-riding, the notion of blur- ring focuses on harm to the earlier mark. The concept of detriment to the distinctive character of a mark necessarily implies a less- ening of distinctiveness. 69. The factors listed in the national court\u2019s first question again seem insufficient, on their own, to support a finding of detriment to the distinctive character of the earlier mark, although they are in no way inconsistent with ",
        "I - 8845 INTEL CORPORATION such a finding. My remarks at point 64 above are equally applicable here. 70. It further seems to me impossible to assume that the establishment of a link in the mind of the relevant public will automatically entail detriment to the distinctive character of the earlier mark. If, for example, a food supplement were sold under the trade mark \u2018Kadok\u2019, 36 it might well be possible to find that purchasers made a link in their minds with the well-known Kodak trade mark, without its necessarily being possible to establish or conclude that the latter\u2019s distinct- iveness was in any way impaired. The link is a precondition for examining the existence of blurring and, when the public does estab- lish a link between the two marks, it may well be that the first step on the road to blur- ring has been taken, but other factors and evidence are needed to determine whether actual detriment is caused to distinctive character. 37 36 \u2014 Kadok is a Malaysian name for piper sarmentosum , a South East Asian plant used for aromatic and medicinal purposes and believed to have antioxidant properties. It has not to my knowledge been registered as a trade mark, although a fig - urative mark featuring the restaurant name \u2018Kadok\u2019s\u2019 is regis- tered in the United States for various Asian foods. 37 \u2014 In that regard, I feel that the Court of First Instance may have gone too far in speculating (in Case T-215/03 SIGLA v OHIM [2007] ECR II-711, paragraph 48) that \u2018it is possible, particularly in the case of an opposition based on a mark with an exceptionally high reputation, that the probability of a future, non-hypothetical risk of detriment to or unfair advantage being taken of the mark cited in opposition by the mark applied for is so obvious that the opposing party does not need to put forward and prove any other fact to that end\u2019. 71. In its third question, the Court of Appeal asks whether, in order to establish detriment to distinctive character, the earlier mark must be unique, whether a first conflicting use is sufficient and whether an effect on the economic behaviour of the consumer is required. 72. Uniqueness does not seem to me to be essential. I pause here for a moment to consider the word \u2018unique\u2019. The Court of Appeal states that the \u2018Intel\u2019 mark has not been used for any category of product by any person other than the claimant. Intel, in its observations, asserts that a mark which is \u2018truly unique\u2019 in that sense is very rare indeed, and that marks which are \u2018substan- tially unique\u2019 must also qualify for protection. I take that to refer to a looser (but commonly found) usage of the word \u2018unique\u2019, closer to \u2018very unusual\u2019. 38 In any event, any distinctive mark is likely to be (at least \u2018substantially\u2019) unique in some regard. A \u2018truly\u2019 unique mark will be particularly distinctive. The more distinctive a mark is, the more likely it is that its distinctiveness will be impaired by the presence of other, similar marks. 38 \u2014 \u2018Those of us still on the burning deck of good usage believe that unique \u2014 the paradigm of absolute solitude \u2014 can never be modified with an insipid very, quite, rather, almost or practically\u2019 \u2014 William Safire, \u2018Uniquer than unique? I don\u2019t think so\u2019, International Herald Tribune , 24 June 2007. ",
        "I - 8846 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-252/07 73. The question whether a first conflicting use is enough to establish detriment seems to me misconceived. A first conflicting use may not in itself cause detriment, but the point of both Article 4(4)(a) and Article 5(2) is to prevent or pre-empt repeated conflicting use which would dilute, whittle away, disperse, lessen, water down, debilitate, weaken, undermine, blur, erode or insidiously gnaw away at the earlier mark, in particular its distinctive character. A first use cannot produce such an effect on its own, but the likelihood of its being caused by repeated use \u2014 which is, after all, the norm with trade marks \u2014 may be extrapolated from the circumstances of the use. 74. As to whether an effect on consumers\u2019 economic behaviour is required, it seems to me that detriment to distinctiveness need not necessarily involve economic detriment, so that a change in economic behaviour is not essential. If the trade mark Coca-Cola, or a similar mark or sign, were used for a range of unrelated goods or services, its distinct- iveness might well be lessened, but people might drink the beverage in undiminished quantities. Clearly, however, any evidence of actual negative change in consumer behav- iour would buttress the claimant\u2019s case. 75. In the context of its third question, the Court of Appeal proposes that the following factors should be considered when assessing whether there is detriment to the distinctive character of the earlier mark: \u2014 whether the \u2018pulling power\u2019 of the earlier mark for its specific goods or services is really likely to be affected by the use of the later mark for its specific goods or services; \u2014 whether the user of the later mark is likely to get a real commercial advantage from its use for its specific goods or ser - vices by reason of the repute of the earlier mark for its specific goods or services; \u2014 whether, if the earlier mark is unique, it really matters that it is used for the dissimilar goods or services of the later mark; \u2014 where the later mark is not the same as the earlier mark, what difference that will make on the average consumer and ",
        "I - 8847 INTEL CORPORATION in particular whether there is merely a calling to mind of the earlier mark; \u2014 whether the economic behaviour of the average consumer in relation to the earlier mark when used for its goods or services is likely to be affected; \u2014 how inherently distinctive the earlier mark is; and \u2014 how strong the reputation of the earlier mark for its goods or services is. 76. Of those, I have already dealt with the economic behaviour of the consumer, 39 and the question of the commercial advantage to the user of the later mark concerns free- riding rather than blurring. The question whether there is \u2018merely\u2019 a calling to mind of the earlier mark goes to the establishment of a link between the marks in the mind of the relevant public, and is thus logically prior 39 \u2014 At point 74. to the question of blurring. The strength of the distinctiveness (whether inherent or acquired) and reputation of the earlier mark are, however, factors which must of course be examined and which may tend to indicate the extent of blurring. The degree of simi- larity or dissimilarity between the goods or services covered by the two marks (whatever the \u2018uniqueness\u2019 of the earlier mark) may also be an indication in that regard but cannot \u2014 in view of the wording of Article 4(4)(a) and of the judgment in Davidoff II \u2014 be decisive one way or the other. Finally, the effect on the \u2018pulling power\u2019 of the earlier mark seems to me to be simply another description of the very concept of blurring \u2014 detriment to distinctive character \u2014 itself. 77. I should mention, however, the word \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018really\u2019 used in the context of several of those factors. It might suggest that the Court of Appeal had in mind a threshold (perhaps rather a high threshold) below which the factor in question could be ignored. I do not think that would be the correct approach. The need for a global appreciation, taking all relevant facts into consideration, means that each factor must be accorded the significance which it deserves, but it is the overall balance which will be decisive. 78. Finally, the Court of Appeal suggests that \u2018when the legislation refers to \u201cdetrimental ",
        "I - 8848 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-252/07 to the distinctive character or repute of the earlier trade mark\u201d it must mean the distinct- ive character or repute of the earlier mark for the goods or services for which it is regis- tered\u2019. As regards distinctive character, that is indeed the approach taken by Advocate General Jacobs in his Opinions in Marca Mode and Adidas I 40 and followed by the Court of First Instance in a number of judg- ments. 41 As regards repute, however, I do not see that a distinction can be drawn between tarnishment in general and tarnishment with regard to specific products \u2014 which brings me to the final issue. Tarnishment 79. The final type of infringement with which Article 4(4)(a) is concerned again concerns harm to the earlier mark, in the form of detriment to its repute. It appears to be a step beyond blurring, in that the mark is not merely weakened but actually degraded by the link which the public makes with the later mark. Since no allegation of such damage appears to have been made in the 40 \u2014 At points 44 and 43 respectively. 41 \u2014 Most recently, Case T-47/06 Antartica v OHIM , paragraph 55. main proceedings, and since much of what I have said above in relation to blurring is also relevant here, I shall deal with it only briefly. 80. First, the circumstances set out in the first question are clearly insufficient in them- selves to establish tarnishment although, once the preconditions, including the link, have been established, the extent of the earlier mark\u2019s reputation and \u2018uniqueness\u2019 will be relevant when assessing the occur- rence of such harm. The most important factor, however, must be whether the conno- tations of the later mark are indeed such as to harm the repute of the earlier mark. 81. I have above given two imaginary ex- amples of unrelated goods sold under the name \u2018Coca-Cola\u2019, or a similar mark: on the one hand, low-grade engine oil or cheap paint stripper; on the other hand, a select range of expensive hand-made jewellery. It seems likely that the former, and unlikely that the latter, would damage the repute of the Coca-Cola Company\u2019s trade mark. In each case of alleged tarnishment, it will be necessary to compare the connotations of each mark, in relation either to the goods or services covered or to the broader message which they may convey, and to evaluate the damage entailed. ",
        "I - 8849 INTEL CORPORATION General and concluding remarks 82. Finally, I would stress three points rele- vant to all four issues (mental link, free- riding, blurring and tarnishment). 83. First, the assessment must be a global one, taking all relevant facts into consider- ation. The types of fact which will be relevant will vary from case to case, and no exhaust- ive list can be formulated. It is likely that no single fact will be decisive. It will be a matter of evaluating a number of criteria, each representing a point on a scale. A \u2018low score\u2019 on one scale may be offset by a \u2018high score\u2019 on another scale. Only when all the points on all the relevant scales have been taken into consideration can it be decided whether the balance tips one way or the other. 84. Second, with regard to the need for evidence, on which CPM has laid great emphasis, it must be borne in mind that the provisions concerned cater for two types of situation: existing use of a registered mark or other sign, and future use of a mark which has not yet been registered. Where the later mark or sign is already in use, it is likely to be possible for the owner of the earlier mark to obtain actual evidence of the existence of a link in the mind of the public, and of the alleged infringement, to support his case, in particular from consumer surveys or marketing figures, although it may not be practicable for each element to be exactly quantified. Where the later mark is merely at the stage of application for registration, such evidence is unlikely to be readily avail- able. Whenever evidence of that kind can be presented, it will obviously carry considerable weight in the assessment. If it is not available, or if only limited evidence is available, infer- ences must necessarily be drawn from that which can be established. Evidence of the reputation, repute and distinctive character of the earlier mark should however always be available, and those characteristics should never need to be established by inference. 85. Third, in that connection, I would agree with the line taken by the Court of First Instance in its case-law on Article 8(5) of the Regulation to the effect that, in order to prevent registration of a similar mark, the proprietor of the earlier mark \u2018is not required to demonstrate actual and present harm to his mark. He must, however, adduce prima facie evidence of a future risk, which is not hypothetical, of unfair advantage or detriment\u2019. 42 42 \u2014 See, most recently, Case T-181/05 Citigroup v OHIM [2008] ECR II-669 (judgment delivered on the same day as the hearing in the present case), paragraph 77 and the case-law cited there. ",
        "I - 8850 OPINION OF MS SHARPSTON \u2014 CASE C-252/07 Conclusion 86. In the light of all the above considerations, I propose that the Court should answer the questions raised as follows: \u2018For the purposes of Article 4(4)(a) of Council Directive 89/104/EEC: \u2014 the fact that the earlier mark would be brought to mind by the average consumer when he or she encounters the later mark used for the goods or services of the later mark is in principle tantamount to the establishment of a link in the mind of the relevant public within the meaning of paragraphs 29 and 30 of the Court\u2019s judgment in Case C-408/01 Adidas\u00adSalomon and Adidas Benelux ; \u2014 the facts that the earlier mark has a huge reputation for certain specific types of goods or services, that those goods or services are dissimilar to the goods or ser - vices of the later mark and that the earlier mark is unique in respect of any goods or services are not sufficient in themselves to establish either such a link or unfair advantage or detriment within the meaning of that article; \u2014 in order to decide whether a link or unfair advantage or detriment is established, the national court must take account of all factors relevant to the circumstances of the case; ",

The appeal brought by Intel Corporation to the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Chancery Division (Intellectual Property), was dismissed on 26 July 2006. Intel Corporation then appealed to the Court of Appeal (England and Wales) (Civil Division).

A \u2018link\u2019 means any kind of mental association between those two marks, so a mere bringing to mind of the earlier mark is enough. Furthermore, relying on paragraph 30 of the judgment in General Motors , Intel Corporation submits that, where the earlier mark both is unique and has a strong distinctive character, it must be accepted that detriment to it will be caused by virtu- ally any use for any other goods or services. It adds that, where the earlier mark is unique and well known, it is important to stop any encroachment at the outset, otherwise that mark will suffer a death by a thousand cuts. The national court states, first, that \u2018Intel\u2019 is an invented word with no meaning or significance beyond the products which it identifies, that the INTEL mark is unique in the sense that the word of which it consists has not been used by anyone for any goods or services other than those marketed by Intel Corporation and, finally, that that mark has a huge reputation in the United Kingdom for computers and computer-linked products. Secondly, the national court considers that the INTEL and INTELMARK trade marks are similar, but starts from the premiss that the use of INTELMARK does not suggest a trade connection with Intel Corporation. 18 19 20 ",

It is uncertain whether, in such factual circumstances, the proprietor of the earlier mark with a reputation is entitled to the protection provided for in Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive. More generally, it raises the question of the conditions and scope of that protection. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal (England and Wales) (Civil Division) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a prelim- inary ruling: \u2018(1) For the purposes of Article 4(4)(a) of the [Directive], where: (a) the earlier mark has a huge reputation for certain specific types of goods or services, (b) those goods or services are dissimilar or dissimilar to a substantial degree to the goods or services of the later mark, 21 22 23 ",

        "I - 8863 INTEL CORPORATION The questions Preliminary observations It should be noted that the wording of Articles 4(4)(a) and 5(2) of the Directive is essentially identical and is designed to give trade marks with a reputation the same protection. Accordingly, the interpretation of Article 5(2) of the Directive given by the Court in Adidas\u00adSalomon and Adidas Benelux , applies equally to Article 4(4)(a) of the Dir - ective (see, to that effect, Case C-292/00 Davidoff [2003] ECR I-389, paragraph 17). The protection given by Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive establishes, for the benefit of trade marks with a repu- tation, a wider form of protection than that provided for in Article 4(1). The specific condition of that protection consists of a use of the later mark without due cause which takes or would take unfair advantage of, or is or would be detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the earlier mark (see, to that effect, in respect of Article 5(2) of the Directive, Marca Mode , paragraph 36; Adidas\u00adSalomon and 24 25 26 ",

The types of injury against which Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive ensures such protection for the benefit of trade marks with a reputation are, first, detriment to the distinctive character of the earlier mark, secondly, detriment to the repute of that mark and, thirdly, unfair advantage taken of the distinctive character or the repute of that mark. Just one of those three types of injury suffices for that provision to apply. As regards, in particular, detriment to the distinctive character of the earlier mark, also referred to as \u2018dilution\u2019, \u2018whittling away\u2019 or \u2018blurring\u2019, such detriment is caused when that mark\u2019s ability to identify the goods or services for which it is registered and used as coming from the proprietor of that mark is weakened, since use of the later mark leads to dispersion of the identity and hold upon the public mind of the earlier mark. That is notably the case when the earlier mark, which used to arouse immediate association with the goods and services for which it is registered, is no longer capable of doing so. The types of injury referred to in Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive, where they occur, are the consequence of a certain degree of similarity between the earlier and later marks, by virtue of which the relevant section of the public makes a connection between those two marks, that is to say, establishes a link between them even though it does 27 28 29 30 ",

In the absence of such a link in the mind of the public, the use of the later mark is not likely to take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the earlier mark. However, the existence of such a link is not sufficient, in itself, to establish that there is one of the types of injury referred to in Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive, which constitute, as was stated in paragraph 26 of this judgment, the specific condition of the protection of trade marks with a reputation laid down by that provision. The relevant public The public to be taken into account in order to determine whether registration of the later mark may be declared invalid pursuant to Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive varies depending on the type of injury alleged by the proprietor of the earlier trade mark. First, both a trade mark\u2019s distinctiveness and its reputation must be assessed, first, by reference to the perception of the relevant public, which consists of average 31 32 33 34 ",
        "I - 8866 JUDGMENT OF 27. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-252/07 consumers of the goods or services for which that mark is registered, who are reason- ably well informed and reasonably observant and circumspect (as regards distinctive character, see Case C-363/99 Koninklijke KPN Nederland [2004] ECR I-1619, para- graph 34; as regards reputation, see, to that effect, General Motors , paragraph 24). Accordingly, the existence of injury consisting of detriment to the distinctive char- acter or the repute of the earlier mark must be assessed by reference to average consumers of the goods and services for which that mark is registered, who are reasonably well informed and reasonably observant and circumspect. Secondly, as regards injury consisting of unfair advantage taken of the distinctive character or the repute of the earlier mark, in so far as what is prohibited is the drawing of benefit from that mark by the proprietor of the later mark, the existence of such injury must be assessed by reference to average consumers of the goods or services for which the later mark is registered, who are reasonably well informed and reasonably observant and circumspect. Proof In order to benefit from the protection introduced by Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive, the proprietor of the earlier mark must adduce proof that the use of the later mark \u2018would take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the earlier trade mark\u2019. 35 36 37 ",
        "I - 8867 INTEL CORPORATION The proprietor of the earlier trade mark is not required, for that purpose, to demon- strate actual and present injury to its mark for the purposes of Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive. When it is foreseeable that such injury will ensue from the use which the proprietor of the later mark may be led to make of its mark, the proprietor of the earlier mark cannot be required to wait for it actually to occur in order to be able to prohibit that use. The proprietor of the earlier mark must, however, prove that there is a serious risk that such an injury will occur in the future. When the proprietor of the earlier mark has shown that there is either actual and present injury to its mark for the purposes of Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive or, failing that, a serious risk that such injury will occur in the future, it is for the proprietor of the later mark to establish that there is due cause for the use of that mark. Point (i) of Question 1 and Question 2 By point (i) of Question 1 and Question 2, the national court asks, essentially, what the relevant criteria are for the purposes of establishing whether there is a link, within the meaning of the judgment in Adidas Salomon and Adidas Benelux (\u2018a link\u2019), between the earlier mark with a reputation and the later mark in respect of which a declaration of invalidity is sought. The existence of such a link must be assessed globally, taking into account all factors relevant to the circumstances of the case (see, in respect of Article 5(2) of the Dir - 38 39 40 41 ",

Those factors include: \u2014 the degree of similarity between the conflicting marks; \u2014 the nature of the goods or services for which the conflicting marks were regis- tered, including the degree of closeness or dissimilarity between those goods or services, and the relevant section of the public; \u2014 the strength of the earlier mark\u2019s reputation; \u2014 the degree of the earlier mark\u2019s distinctive character, whether inherent or acquired through use; \u2014 the existence of the likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. In that respect, the following points must be made. As regards the degree of similarity between the conflicting marks, the more similar they are, the more likely it is that the later mark will bring the earlier mark with a 42 43 44 ",
        "I - 8869 INTEL CORPORATION reputation to the mind of the relevant public. That is particularly the case where those marks are identical. However, the fact that the conflicting marks are identical, and even more so if they are merely similar, is not sufficient for it to be concluded that there is a link between those marks. It is possible that the conflicting marks are registered for goods or services in respect of which the relevant sections of the public do not overlap. The reputation of a trade mark must be assessed in relation to the relevant section of the public as regards the goods or services for which that mark was registered. That may be either the public at large or a more specialised public (see General Motors , paragraph 24). It is therefore conceivable that the relevant section of the public as regards the goods or services for which the earlier mark was registered is completely distinct from the relevant section of the public as regards the goods or services for which the later mark was registered and that the earlier mark, although it has a reputation, is not known to the public targeted by the later mark. In such a case, the public targeted by each of the two marks may never be confronted with the other mark, so that it will not establish any link between those marks. Furthermore, even if the relevant section of the public as regards the goods or ser - vices for which the conflicting marks are registered is the same or overlaps to some 45 46 47 48 49 ",
        "I - 8870 JUDGMENT OF 27. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-252/07 extent, those goods or services may be so dissimilar that the later mark is unlikely to bring the earlier mark to the mind of the relevant public. Accordingly, the nature of the goods or services for which the conflicting marks are registered must be taken into consideration for the purposes of assessing whether there is a link between those marks. It must also be pointed out that certain marks may have acquired such a reputation that it goes beyond the relevant public as regards the goods or services for which those marks were registered. In such a case, it is possible that the relevant section of the public as regards the goods or services for which the later mark is registered will make a connection between the conflicting marks, even though that public is wholly distinct from the relevant section of the public as regards goods or services for which the earlier mark was registered. For the purposes of assessing where there is a link between the conflicting marks, it may therefore be necessary to take into account the strength of the earlier mark\u2019s reputation in order to determine whether that reputation extends beyond the public targeted by that mark. Likewise, the stronger the distinctive character of the earlier mark, whether inherent or acquired through the use which has been made of it, the more likely it is that, 50 51 52 53 54 ",
        "I - 8871 INTEL CORPORATION confronted with a later identical or similar mark, the relevant public will call that earlier mark to mind. Accordingly, for the purposes of assessing whether there is a link between the conflicting marks, the degree of the earlier mark\u2019s distinctive character must be taken into consideration. In that regard, in so far as the ability of a trade mark to identify the goods or services for which it is registered and used as coming from the proprietor of that mark and, therefore, its distinctive character are all the stronger if that mark is unique \u2014 that is to say, as regards a word mark such as INTEL, if the word of which it consists has not been used by anyone for any goods or services other than by the proprietor of the mark for the goods and services it markets \u2014 it must be ascertained whether the earlier mark is unique or essentially unique. Finally, a link between the conflicting marks is necessarily established when there is a likelihood of confusion, that is to say, when the relevant public believes or might believe that the goods or services marketed under the earlier mark and those marketed under the later mark come from the same undertaking or from econom- ically-linked undertakings (see to that effect, inter alia, Case C-342/97 Lloyd Schuh\u00ad fabrik Meyer [1999] ECR I-3819, paragraph 17, and Case C-533/06 O2 Holdings and O2 (UK) [2008] ECR I-4231, paragraph 59). However, as is apparent from paragraphs 27 to 31 of the judgment in Adidas\u00adSalomon and Adidas Benelux , implementation of the protection introduced by Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive does not require the existence of a likelihood of confusion. 55 56 57 58 ",
        "I - 8872 JUDGMENT OF 27. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-252/07 The national court asks, in particular, whether the circumstances set out in points (a) to (d) of Question 1 referred for a preliminary ruling are sufficient to establish a link between the conflicting marks. As regards the circumstance referred to in point (d) of that question, the fact that, for the average consumer, who is reasonably well informed and reasonably observant and circumspect, the later mark would call the earlier mark to mind is tantamount to the existence of such a link. As regards the circumstances referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) of that question, as is apparent from paragraph 41 to 58 of this judgment, they do not necessarily imply the existence of a link between the conflicting marks, but they do not exclude one either. It is for the national court to base its analysis on all the facts of the case in the main proceedings. The answer to point (i) of Question 1 and to Question 2 must therefore be that Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive must be interpreted as meaning that whether there is a link, within the meaning of Adidas\u00adSalomon and Adidas Benelux , between the earlier mark with a reputation and the later mark must be assessed globally, taking into account all factors relevant to the circumstances of the case.

Point (ii) of Question 1 and Question 3 By point (ii) of Question 1, the national court asks whether the circumstances set out in points (a) to (d) are sufficient to establish that the use of the later mark takes or would take unfair advantage of, or is or would be detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the earlier mark. By Question 3, the national court asks, essentially, what the relevant criteria are for the purposes of assessing whether the use of the later mark is or would be detrimental to the distinctive character of the earlier mark. 64 65 ",
        "I - 8874 JUDGMENT OF 27. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-252/07 First, as was pointed out in paragraph 30 of this judgment, the types of injury referred to in Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive, where they occur, are the consequence of a certain degree of similarity between the earlier and later marks, by virtue of which the relevant section of the public makes a connection between those two marks, that is to say, establishes a link between them even though it does not confuse them. The more immediately and strongly the earlier mark is brought to mind by the later mark, the greater the likelihood that the current or future use of the later mark is taking unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the earlier mark. It follows that, like the existence of a link between the conflicting marks, the exist- ence of one of the types of injury referred to in Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive, or a serious likelihood that such an injury will occur in the future, must be assessed globally, taking into account all factors relevant to the circumstances of the case, which include the criteria listed in paragraph 42 of this judgment. As regards the strength of the reputation and the degree of distinctive character of the earlier mark, the Court has already held that the stronger the earlier mark\u2019s distinctive character and reputation the easier it will be to accept that detriment has been caused to it (see, regarding Article 5(2) of the Directive, General Motors , paragraph 30). Secondly, the circumstances listed in points (a) to (d) of Question 1 are not sufficient to establish the existence of unfair advantage and/or detriment within the meaning of Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive. 66 67 68 69 70 ",
        "I - 8875 INTEL CORPORATION So far as concerns, in particular, the fact referred to in point (d) of that question, as follows from paragraph 32 of this judgment, the existence of a link between the conflicting marks does not dispense the proprietor of the earlier trade mark from having to prove actual and present injury to its mark, for the purposes of Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive, or a serious likelihood that such an injury will occur in the future. Lastly, as regards, more particularly, detriment to the distinctive character of the earlier mark, the answer to the second part of the third question must be that, first, it is not necessary for the earlier mark to be unique in order to establish such injury or a serious likelihood that it will occur in the future. A trade mark with a reputation necessarily has distinctive character, at the very least acquired through use. Therefore, even if an earlier mark with a reputation is not unique, the use of a later identical or similar mark may be such as to weaken the distinctive character of that earlier mark. However, the more \u2018unique\u2019 the earlier mark appears, the greater the likelihood that the use of a later identical or similar mark will be detrimental to its distinctive character. Secondly, a first use of an identical or similar mark may suffice, in some circum- stances, to cause actual and present detriment to the distinctive character of the earlier mark or to give rise to a serious likelihood that such detriment will occur in the future. 71 72 73 74 75 ",
        "I - 8876 JUDGMENT OF 27. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-252/07 Thirdly, as was stated on paragraph 29 of this judgment, detriment to the distinctive character of the earlier mark is caused when that mark\u2019s ability to identify the goods or services for which it is registered and used as coming from the proprietor of that mark is weakened, since use of the later mark leads to dispersion of the identity and hold upon the public mind of the earlier mark. It follows that proof that the use of the later mark is or would be detrimental to the distinctive character of the earlier mark requires evidence of a change in the economic behaviour of the average consumer of the goods or services for which the earlier mark was registered consequent on the use of the later mark, or a serious like- lihood that such a change will occur in the future. It is immaterial, however, for the purposes of assessing whether the use of the later mark is or would be detrimental to the distinctive character of the earlier mark, whether or not the proprietor of the later mark draws real commercial benefit from the distinctive character of the earlier mark. The answer to point (ii) of Question 1 and to Question 3 must therefore be that Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive is to be interpreted as meaning that whether a use of the later mark takes or would take unfair advantage of, or is or would be detri- mental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the earlier mark must be assessed globally, taking into account all factors relevant to the circumstances of the case. 76 77 78 79 ",

Mirja Juuri worked in the canteen of a metalworking company in Finland for nine years. When her employer transferred the catering sector to another undertaking, Ms Juuri\u2019s working conditions deteriorated. Community law provides a remedy for a worker in this position, but the national court is uncertain how the Community rules should be interpreted. Specifically, Dir - ective 2001/23/EC, relating to the safeguarding of employees\u2019 rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, 2 attributes responsibility for a case such as that of Ms Juuri to her new employer. The Court of Justice must deter- mine the extent of that responsibility, as well as its financial consequences. 1 \u2014 Original language: Spanish. 2 \u2014 Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees\u2019 rights in the event of trans- fers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses (OJ 2001 L 82, p. 16), which reformulates Council Directive 77/187/EEC of 14 February 1977 on the approxi- mation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees\u2019 rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses (OJ 1977 L 61, p. 26), as amended by Council Directive 98/50/EC of 29 June 1998 (OJ 1998 L 201, p. 88). 2. Directive 2001/23 is part of what is called \u2018Community social law\u2019. This branch of Community law offers workers a minimum level of protection, although the Member States may increase that protection. The complexity inherent in the regulation of national labour markets meant that the adop- tion of this legislation involved achieving wide consensus, with the result that its provi- sions, which are open-ended and ambiguous, often require the intervention of the Court of Justice in the form of preliminary rulings. 3. Furthermore, Community social law is characterised by its fragmented structure. It is made up of certain rules for resolving specific problems which emerge in the course of the employment relationship. Metaphor- ically speaking, it resembles an archipelago 3 whose small islands do not always seem to 3 \u2014 The expression is taken from Rodr\u00edguez-Pi\u00f1ero Royo, M.C., \u2018Transmisi\u00f3n de empresas y derecho europeo\u2019, in La trans\u00ad misi\u00f3n de empresas en Europa, Cacucci Editore, Bari, 1999, p. 1, in which it is argued that, despite its importance, Community social law has a fairly limited impact in that it only covers aspects of this area of regulation and leaves the remainder entirely unharmonised. This results in what has been called the \u2018insular\u2019 or \u2018archipelagic structure\u2019 of Commu- nity employment law, under which only certain elements of national law receive attention; by contrast, national employ- ment law is more \u2018continental\u2019 and embraces all aspects of the employment relationship.

In the present case, the Court is being asked to address questions arising on one of these islands. 4 The risk is, therefore, that while the issues of inter- pretation concerning the directive in ques- tion may be satisfactorily resolved, those concerning other related directives may not. For this reason, it is important to be rigorous and not to overlook connections in an area as diffuse as social law, which is more coherent, however, than it first appears. II \u2014 Facts 4. On 5 April 1994 Mirja Juuri started working for Rautaruukki Oyj (\u2018the trans- feror\u2019), in H\u00e4meenlinna (Finland), in the company canteen. From 10 December 1999, Ms Juuri\u2019s employment contract became permanent. 4 \u2014 I am reminded of Don Quixote\u2019s advice to Sancho Panza shortly before he becomes governor of the island of Bara- taria. Aware that his advice is only as good as the strength of his arguments, Don Quixote ends with these words: \u2018Let the tears of the poor man find with thee more compassion, but not more justice, than the pleadings of the rich. Strive to lay bare the truth, as well amid the promises and presents of the rich man, as amid the sobs and entreaties of the poor. When equity may and should be brought into play, press not the utmost rigour of the law against the guilty; for the reputation of the stern judge stands not higher than that of the compas- sionate \u2026\u2019 Cervantes, M. de, Don Quixote, Part II, Chapter XLII, translation by John Ormsby, 1885, http://www.online- literature.com/cervantes/don_quixote/ 5. Although her duties were limited to the canteen, Ms Juuri came under the metal- working industry collective agreement, which was due to expire on 31 January 2003 and was automatically renewable for periods of one year unless one of the parties gave notice of termination at least two months prior to its expiry. No termination was neces- sary because, on 12 December 2002, a new agreement for the sector was signed, with effect from 1 February 2003. 6. On that date, when the previous agree- ment had already expired, the transferor handed over the running of the canteen to Amica Ravintolat Oy (\u2018the transferee\u2019). Once the transfer had taken place, the workers started to work for the transferee, albeit under a new collective agreement, which in this case was the agreement relating to the hotel and catering sector. 7. Ms Juuri was unhappy with her employ- ment being governed by the hotel and catering agreement and considered herself covered by the metalworking agreement. She maintained that the change of regime had meant a reduction in her pay of EUR 300 a month, as well as the need to transfer to different workplaces. For its part, the ",
        "I - 8888 OPINION OF MR RUIZ-JARABO \u2014 CASE C-396/07 transferee has conceded that the more recent agreement required Ms Juuri to undergo a number of changes, including carrying out her work in other workplaces, albeit tem - porarily, and a reduction in her pay of EUR 100 a month due to a proportional reduction in working hours. 8. Following these changes in the system of collective agreements governing her employ- ment, Ms Juuri decided to terminate her contract of employment on 19 February 2003. Relying on Finnish employment legislation, she brought legal proceedings against the transferee, claiming compensa- tion in respect of holiday corresponding to the notice period and further compensa- tion equivalent to 14 months\u2019 pay for unfair dismissal. On 11 February 2005 the Hels- ingin K\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus (Helsinki District Court) rejected Ms Juuri\u2019s claim. A year later, on 28 February 2006, the Helsingin hovioikeus (Helsinki Court of Appeal) upheld the judg- ment at first instance but Ms Juuri took her case to the Korkein oikeus (Supreme Court), which is the court now referring questions to the Court of Justice concerning the inter- pretation of Directive 2001/23. III \u2014 Legal framework A \u2014 Community legislation 9. Directive 2001/23 sets out a system of minimum standards in order to preserve the rights of workers in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of under- takings or businesses. In the context of the dispute between Ms Juuri and the transferee, the relevant provisions of that directive are Articles 3(3) and 4(2). \u2018 Article 3 \u2026 3. Following the transfer, the transferee shall continue to observe the terms and condi- tions agreed in any collective agreement on the same terms applicable to the trans- feror under that agreement, until the date of termination or expiry of the collective agree- ment or the entry into force or application of another collective agreement. Member States may limit the period for observing such terms and conditions with the proviso that it shall not be less than one year. \u2026 ",
        "I - 8889 JUURI Article 4 \u2026 2. If the contract of employment or the employment relationship is terminated because the transfer involves a substantial change in working conditions to the detri- ment of the employee, the employer shall be regarded as having been responsible for termination of the contract of employment or of the employment relationship\u2019. B \u2014 National legislation 10. According to the order for reference from the Korkein oikeus, Paragraph 2 of Chapter 6 of the Ty\u00f6sopimuslaki (Finnish Law on employment contracts) provides that \u2018a contract of employment concluded for an indeterminate period or otherwise in force until further notice may be terminated by the giving of notice to that effect by one of the parties.\u2019 11. Paragraph 6 of Chapter 7 transposes Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/23 into Finnish law by providing that, \u2018If a contract of employment is terminated because the employee\u2019s working conditions become substantially worse as a result of a transfer of the undertaking, the employer shall be regarded as responsible for ending the employment relationship.\u2019 12. Paragraph 1(2) of Chapter 8 of the Ty\u00f6sopimuslaki permits an employee to terminate the employment contract if the employer is in serious breach of obligations which are of fundamental importance to the employment relationship, at least until the date of expiry of the notice period. 13. Under Paragraph 5 of the Ty\u00f6e- htosopimuslaki (Finnish Law on collective agreements), if the employer is party to or is otherwise bound by a collective agreement, all his rights and obligations thereunder pass to his successor. The transferee is therefore obliged to comply with the provisions of the collective agreement binding upon the trans- feror until that collective agreement expires, and thereafter with the provisions of the collective agreement binding on it, the trans- feree, in accordance with Paragraph 4 of the Ty\u00f6ehtosopimuslaki. 14. Paragraph 2 of Chapter 12 of the Ty\u00f6e- htosopimuslaki covers the right of an ",

Paragraph 2 of Chapter 12 of the Ty\u00f6sopimuslaki also indicates the extent of the compensation that the worker can claim, which ranges from 3 months\u2019 to 24 months\u2019 pay. 16. The employee is not entitled to compen- sation under Paragraph 2 of Chapter 12 of the Ty\u00f6sopimuslaki if the employer termin- ates the employment contract on object- ive and serious grounds, but even in these circumstances the employee can claim pay and other entitlements relating to the notice period. There is no right to pay or other en- titlements under the employment relation- ship if it can be shown that the employer had especially serious grounds for terminating the employment contract with immediate effect. 17. Paragraph 1 of Chapter 12 of the Ty\u00f6sopimuslaki also requires an employer who, intentionally or through carelessness, breaches or fails to fulfil obligations under the employment contract or the Ty\u00f6sopimuslaki to compensate the employee for any losses suffered. IV \u2014 The questions referred for a prelim- inary ruling 18. By a decision of 24 August 2007 in the proceedings brought by Ms Juuri against the transferee, the Korkein oikeus, referred the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \u2018(1) Is Article 4(2) of Council Direct- ive 2001/23/EC to be interpreted as meaning that a Member State must, in a situation in which an employee has himself given notice to termin- ate his contract of employment after his working conditions have become substantially worse following the transfer of an undertaking, in its law guarantee the employee the right to obtain finan- cial compensation from the employer in the same way as in the case where the employer has unlawfully terminated the employment contract, having regard to the fact that, as permitted by Article 3(3) of the directive, the employer has observed a collective agreement, binding on the transferor and guaranteeing the employee better working conditions, ",
        "I - 8891 JUURI only until its expiry and the worsening of the working conditions arises from that? (2) If the employer\u2019s responsibility in accordance with the directive is not as extensive as described in Ques- tion 1, must the responsibility of the employer nevertheless be implemented by providing compensation, for example, for pay and other benefits for the notice period to be observed by the employer?\u2019 19. Observations were submitted, within the time-limits laid down in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, by the Finnish Government, the Hungarian Government and the Commission. 20. At the general meeting of the Court held on 29 April 2008, the Court ordered that two written questions be submitted to the Finnish Government, the replies to which reached the Court Registry on 23 May 2008. V \u2014 Reformulation of the questions referred for a preliminary ruling 21. The two questions referred by the supreme Finnish court both revolve around the same event: the change in employment regime following the expiry of the collect- ive agreement for the metalworking sector. The idea of that event being the point of departure is more controversial than it might seem, as the two Governments which submitted observations in these proceedings, as well as the Commission, have addressed the point in their statements. Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/23 applies once the lawfulness of the change in regime affecting the contract of employment has been established. If the change were unlawful due to its infringement of Article 3(3) of that directive, the outcome would be different. It is therefore necessary to clarify the factual circumstances of the case before the referring court in order to deter- mine whether there is any illegality, since the collective agreement which initially bound Ms Juuri expired on the same date as the transfer of the undertaking took place. This coincidence has given rise to doubts on the part of the Court of Justice, leading it to put a number of questions 5 to the Finnish Govern- ment and it prompts me to reformulate the questions put by the Korkein oikeus. 6 5 \u2014 The written questions to the Finnish Government concerned only the system of entry into force and termination of the metalworking sector collective agreement. 6 \u2014 The practice of reformulating questions is very well estab- lished in the case-law of the Court of Justice and dates back to Case 16/65 Schwarze [1965] ECR 877. For more recent cases, see Case C-334/95 Kr\u00fcger [1997] ECR I-4517, para- graph 22; Case C-66/95 Sutton [1997] ECR I-2163, para- graph 35; Case C-284/96 Tabouillot [1997] ECR I-7471, paragraphs 20 and 21; Joined cases C-171/94 and C-172/94 Merckx and Neuhuys [1996] ECR I-1253, paragraph 28; Case C-88/99 Roquette Fr\u00e8res [2000] ECR I-10465, paragraph 18; Case C-469/00 Ravil [2003] ECR I-5053, paragraph 27; Case C-286/05 Haug [2006] ECR I-4121, paragraph 17; and Case C-429/05 Rampion and Godard [2007] ECR I-8017, para- graph 27.

        "I - 8892 OPINION OF MR RUIZ-JARABO \u2014 CASE C-396/07 22. In the present case I think it appro- priate to merge the two questions put by the national court and then, after a thorough analysis of the position regarding the succes- sive collective agreements, to go on to explain the implications in terms of compensation of Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/23. 23. I therefore propose that the Court refor- mulate the two questions referred as follows: \u2018(1) Is it in conformity with Article 3(3) of Directive 2001/23/EC to continue observance of the terms and conditions agreed in a collective agreement until the date of its expiry, where the timing of the transfer of the undertaking coincides with the timing of the expiry? (2) Is Article 4(2) of Council Direct- ive 2001/23 to be interpreted as requiring a Member State to ensure, by law, that the employee has the right to financial compensation from the employer or is it to be interpreted exclusively as a provision attributing responsibility.\u2019 VI \u2014 Question 1 24. Article 3(3) of Directive 2001/23 created a means of protecting workers which offers legal certainty to employees when their employer undertakes a transfer. If there is a collective agreement prior to the transfer, workers can rely on it until its expiry or until \u2018the entry into force \u2026 of another collective agreement\u2019. Member States are entitled to limit this entitlement in time, provided that they do not limit it to a period of less than one year. 7 25. Directive 2001/23 seeks an equilibrium between the stability, in legal terms, of the employment relationship and the employer\u2019s flexibility of action. The rights of the worker continue after the transfer for a restricted period. Once the limit of the validity of these rights has been reached, the worker is en- titled to take a decision in this regard, bringing Article 4(2) into play. Under that provision, the employer is regarded as responsible for the termination of the employment relation- ship in the event that the transfer has resulted in \u2018a substantial change in working conditions to the detriment of the employee\u2019. 8 Further- more, case-law has allowed such detrimental changes, despite the mandatory nature of the rules laid down in Directive 2001/23, 7 \u2014 Second subparagraph of Article 3(3) of Directive 2001/23. 8 \u2014 The origins of Directive 2001/23, as well as its amendments, show that the political consensus achieved accounts for the flexible nature of its provisions. In this regard, see Hardy, S. and Painter, R., \u2018Revising the Acquired Rights Directive\u2019, Industrial Law Journal, vol. 25, No 2, 1996. ",
        "I - 8893 JUURI if national law permits them in the normal course of the employment relationship, whether or not the transfer has taken place. 9 26. Article 3(3) and Article 4(2) do not operate as airtight compartments. 10 The fact that the Community legislature offers the worker the possibility of terminating the employment contract stems from the deteri- oration of the relationship with the employer, which in turn is caused by a change in the rules. It seems clear that although Article 3 safeguards the original rights of the worker, it does, where appropriate, permit a change in the employment regime. It is precisely because such a change is contemplated that, under Directive 2001/23, someone is made responsible for the termination of the contract: the employer. 11 This is a way of making up for allowing exceptions to the rule prohibiting changes in working conditions. Attribution of responsibility to the transferee 9 \u2014 Taking the approach laid down in Case 324/86 Daddy\u2019s Dance Hall [1988] ECR 739, the Court of Justice has confirmed that: \u2018\u2026 such an alteration is not precluded merely because the undertaking has been transferred in the meantime and the agreement has therefore been made with the new employer. Since by virtue of Article 3(1) of the Directive the trans- feree is subrogated to the transferor\u2019s rights and obligations under the employment relationship, that relationship may be altered with regard to the transferee, to the same extent as it could have been with regard to the transferor, provided that the transfer of the undertaking itself may never constitute the reason for that amendment\u2019 (Case C-209/91 Watson Rask and Christensen [1992] ECR I-5755, paragraph 28). 10 \u2014 According to Barnard, C., EC Employment Law , 3rd edition, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2006, pp. 663 to 664. 11 \u2014 On flexibility of working conditions: Arrigo, G., Il diritto del lavoro dell\u2019Unione europea, volume II, Guiffr\u00e8, Milan, 2001, pp. 97-103. means that the worker\u2019s rights can be main- tained, at least financially speaking. 12 27. The consequences of the termin- ation referred to in Article 4(2) of Direct- ive 2001/23 as far as compensation is concerned fall to be examined under Ques- tion 2, but at this point I will borrow part of that reasoning in support of the following idea. 28. The safeguarding of workers\u2019 rights as provided for in Article 3(3) of Direct- ive 2001/23 places a positive duty on the Member States, which ultimately falls on employers. If the conditions set out in the provision are met, the worker\u2019s condi- tions of employment are maintained after the transfer, either indefinitely or \u2014 within certain limits \u2014 for a set period of time. 13 However, any breach of that provision en - 12 \u2014 This flexibility is not without its problems of interpretation, as highlighted by Barnard, C., op. cit., pp. 657-658. 13 \u2014 The mandatory nature of the rights recognised by Dir - ective 2001/23 has been confirmed by the Court on several occasions. The first was in Daddy\u2019s Dance Hall, where the Court stated that \u2018employees are not entitled to waive the rights conferred on them by the directive and that those rights cannot be restricted even with their consent. This interpretation is not affected by the fact that, as in this case, the employee obtains new benefits in compensation for the disadvantages resulting from an amendment to his contract of employment so that, taking the matter as a whole, he is not placed in a worse position than before. \u2019 This approach has been confirmed in Case C-362/89 d\u2019Urso and Others [1991] ECR I-4105, paragraph 9; Case C-209/91 Watson Rask and Christensen [1992] ECR I-5755, paragraph 28; Case C-4/01 Martin and Others [2003] ECR I-12859, para- graphs 42 and 43; Case C-305/94 Rotsart de Hertaing [1996].

        "I - 8894 OPINION OF MR RUIZ-JARABO \u2014 CASE C-396/07 titles the worker to demand, before the courts if necessary, the application of the employ- ment regime prevailing prior to the transfer, or the equivalent financial compensation. 14 In the latter case, implementation is in accordance with the substantive and pro- cedural rules of national employment law, but never losing sight of the aim of Dir- ective 2001/23, which indicates the objective which must be sought by the national rules. 29. That being so, it is clear that the provi- sion at issue establishes, indirectly and by way of a minimum standard, a dual system of compensation in the event of termination of an employment relationship. In the first situation envisaged, the worker terminates the contract, but the detailed requirements under Article 3(3) of Directive 2001/23 have been complied with. In the second situation envisaged, the worker\u2019s termination of the contract occurs following a breach of that provision. The gravity of the two situations differs as in the second case the worker is less protected and consequently national employ- ment law must deal more severely with the employer. That approach would also apply in situations where, although the require- ments of Article 3(3) of Directive 2001/23 have technically been complied with, the law has been circumvented, as may be the case here, although, given the preliminary nature 14 \u2014 The legal effects of non-compliance fall to be determined by national law, as the Court has emphasised in Joined Cases 144/87 and 145/87 Berg and Busschers [1988] ECR 2559; Case 105/84 Danmols Inventar [1985] ECR 2639, para- graphs 26 to 28; Joined cases C-132/91, C-138/91 and C-139/91 Katsikas and Others [1992] ECR I-6577, para- graph 21; and Case C-399/96 Europi\u00e8ces [1998] ECR I-6965, paragraph 37. of these proceedings, this is for the national court to determine. 30. In order to assess whether there is circumvention of the law, it is necessary to be in possession of certain factual elements which are not always available to the Court of Justice. 15 However, the case-law 16 devotes 15 \u2014 \u2018Circumvention of the law\u2019 occurs where \u2018acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision seek a result which is prohibited by law \u2026, the provision whose applica- tion it was sought to evade shall apply\u2019. This is the defin- ition given in Article 6.4 of the Spanish Civil Code, which is similar to Article 1344 of the Italian Civil Code, although this is limited to the field of contract: \u2018si reputa altres\u00ec illecita la causa quando il contratto costituisce il mezzo per eludere l\u2019applicazione di una norma imperativa\u2019 (the object of the contract ( la causa ) shall also be unlawful where the contract constitutes a means of evading the application of a mandatory provision). Although it does not refer to circumvention, Article 39 of the Czech Civil Code describes it in similar terms: \u2018Neplatn\u00fd je pr\u00e1vn\u00ed \u00fakon, kter\u00fd sv\u00fdm obsahem nebo \u00fa\u010delem odporuje z\u00e1konu nebo jej obch\u00e1z\u00ed anebo se p\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed dobr\u00fdm mrav\u016fm.\u2019 (Any legal act the content or purpose of which is incompatible with or in circumven- tion of the law or is in contravention of good practice shall be void). In French law, circumvention of the law is more a creature of case-law than of legislation, but Article 336 of the Civil Code expressly refers to the concept. In the various national legal systems there is some confusion between the concept of \u2018circumvention of the law\u2019 and the concept of \u2018abuse of right\u2019, as well as other legal notions such as that of good faith. As noted in Miquel Gonz\u00e1lez, J.M., Comen\u00ad tario al art\u00edculo 7 , \u2018Comentario del C\u00f3digo Civil\u2019, Ministerio de Justicia, Madrid, 1993, p. 45, \u2018the differences between the two concepts are not clear. The attempts by academic writers to differentiate between them have not been successful. Nor has the case-law managed to do so satisfac- torily \u2026\u2019. I do not consider it vital to go into further detail concerning the disparities between these different notions, since the Court of Justice has not done so. 16 \u2014 The Court has left consideration of the factual elements to the national courts in those cases where circumvention of the law has been alleged (specifically, in Case 33/74 van Bins\u00ad bergen [1974] ECR 1299, paragraph 13; Case 115/78 Knoors [1979] ECR 399; Case 205/84 Commission v Germany [1986] ECR 3755, paragraph 22; Case C-370/90 Singh [1992] ECR I-4265, paragraph 24; Case C-148/91 Veronica Omroep Organisatie [1993] ECR I-487, paragraph 12; and Case C-23/93 TV10 [1994] ECR I-4795, paragraph 21). Advocate General Tesauro gives an account of the current state of the case-law in his Opinion in Case C-367/96 Kefalas and Others [1998] ECR I-2843, at points 24 and 25: \u2018any legal order which aspires to achieve a minimum level of comple- tion must contain self-protection measures \u2026 to ensure that the rights it confers are not exercised in a manner which is abusive, excessive or distorted. This requirement is not at all alien to Community law; on the contrary, it has been repeatedly recognised in the Court\u2019s case-law \u2026 according to which \u201cthe facilities created by the Treaty cannot have the effect of allowing the persons who benefit from them to evade the application of national legislation and of prohib- iting Member States from taking the measures necessary to prevent such abuse\u201d.\u2019 The Opinion of Advocate General Poiares Maduro in Case C-255/02 Halifax and Others [2006] ECR I-1609, develops this idea at points 80 and 81.

        "I - 8895 JUURI particular attention to disputes in which one of the parties acts in an abusive manner. 17 This sensitivity has also emerged in cases connected with Community social law, specifically when applying Directive 2001/23. In Bork 18 the Court of Justice was confronted with the dismissal of an entire work- force, which was immediately followed by the transfer of the undertaking and the re-employment of a substantial proportion of the staff previously employed, although on less favourable terms. Using its customary methodology, the Court of Justice empha- sised that it is for the national court to assess the facts and then to apply the Community rules, outlining the criteria which should govern the actions of the referring court, which must weigh up \u2018the objective circum- stances in which the dismissal took place and, in particular, in a case such as this, whether it took effect on a date close to that of the transfer and whether the employees in ques- tion were taken on again by the transferee.\u2019 19 The outcome following the evaluation of these factors was a judgment confirming the application of Directive 2001/23 to a situ- ation such as that in question. 20 17 \u2014 It is not appropriate to debate here whether the prohib- ition of circumvention of the law (or abuse of right, for that matter) is a general principle of Community law. In Case C-296/95 EMU Tabac and Others [1998] ECR I-1605, at point 89 of my Opinion, I invited the Court to have recourse to \u2018the general legal principle prohibiting acts in contravention of the law\u2019, but this point, even now, needs more detailed study. Although Halifax seems to confirm this tendency, the debate continues. On this point, see de la Feria, R., \u2018Prohibition of abuse of (Community) Law: the creation of a new general principle of EC Law through tax\u2019, CML Rev, 2008, 45. 18 \u2014 Case 101/87 Bork International [1988] ECR 3057. 19 \u2014 Ibid. 20 \u2014 The Court indicated that Article 1(1) of the directive is to be interpreted \u2018as meaning that the directive applies where, after giving notice bringing the lease to an end or upon termination thereof, the owner of an undertaking retakes possession of it and thereafter sells it to a third party who shortly afterwards brings it back into operation, which had ceased upon termination of the lease, with just over half of the staff that was employed in the undertaking by the former lessee, provided that the undertaking in question retains its identity.\u2019 31. It can be seen from Bork that the Court of Justice allows the national court a wide margin of discretion, only to snatch it back at a later stage. By imposing specific criteria and confirming the relevance of the Commu- nity provisions to the resolution of the case, the analysis of the factual elements is mini- mised and the position of the national court is compromised. I do not subscribe to this approach on the part of the Court of Justice. At the very least it represents an artificial technique which puts the participants in the preliminary ruling proceedings in a difficult position, demonstrating an insatiable thirst for the limelight as well as a disrespectful attitude towards the institutional autonomy which should be accorded to the national court. 21 In the present case this type of discussion can be avoided, without affecting the authority of the Court or the prerogatives of the Korkein oikeus. 32. Whilst accepting that it is for the national court to determine whether the synchronisation of the date of the transfer of an undertaking with expiry of the collect- ive agreement constituted circumvention of the law, the Finnish Government has provided the Court with some interesting additional information. It has been shown that the agreement by which Ms Juuri and her employer were initially bound expired on the day of the transfer. There was no tacit renewal as a new agreement for the sector, 21 \u2014 My position with regard to the limits of replies to questions referred for a preliminary ruling and respect for the insti- tutional autonomy of the referring court is set out in my Opinion in Case C-30/02 Recheio \u2014 Cash & Carry [2004] ECR I-6051 at point 35.

The period between the ratification of the new agreement and its entry into force was very short, barely a month and a half. In add - ition, the conduct of the transferor prior to the transfer, particularly in dealings with the employees and their representatives, sheds light on the way in which the transaction was handled. It is for the national court to assess whether this changeover of agreements, as well as the time elapsing and the informa- tion made available to the employees, form a basis for suggesting that the transferor and the transferee circumvented the law and, in doing so, infringed the rules prohib- iting changes in working conditions on the transfer of an undertaking. 33. Having embarked upon the factual ana - lysis, the referring court must be able to rely on clear guidelines from the Court of Justice in order to arrive at the legally correct solu- tion. The Court must not be reluctant to give its assistance and to this end I would reiterate the arguments set out at points 29 to 32 of this Opinion: if, in the light of the matters of fact and of law available to it, the Korkein oikeus confirms that the law has been circumvented, Article 3(3) of Direct- ive 2001/23 will have been infringed. The failure to comply with this provision means that Article 4(2) of the directive must be given a more restrictive interpretation. In such circumstances, the employer would have deliberately brought about the infringe- ment and, in consequence, would deserve to incur heavier liability. 34. Accordingly, and in reply to Question 1, I am of the view that Article 3(3) of Dir - ective 2001/23 precludes the terms and condi- tions agreed in a collective agreement from ceasing to have effect upon its expiry, where the timing of the transfer of the undertaking coincides with the timing of that expiry and where the transferor and the transferee have acted in circumvention of the law. It is for the national court to determine whether the synchronisation of the date of the transfer with the date of the expiry of the collective agreement constitutes circumvention of the law. 35. It now falls to elucidate the scope and boundaries of this liability, which requires an explanation of Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/23. VII \u2014 Question 2 36. The Finnish and Hungarian Govern- ments and the Commission are in agree- ment that Article 4(2) allocates responsibility only following a significant change in the employment relationship. Directive 2001/23 is not seeking to confer any specific benefit in determining the legal status of a worker in an undertaking that has been trans- ferred. This approach rests on the idea that the directive is an instrument of minimum ",
        "I - 8897 JUURI harmonisation, whose interpretation requires that the national legislature enjoy a wide margin of discretion. 22 Although I am in agreement with the main thrust of this argument, further analysis of the meaning of the provision is required. The fact that the Community may have started out on a path of minimum harmonisation does not automatically rule out some form of finan- cial protection in favour of the worker. It is only through a detailed examination of the text that it is possible to arrive at an ac - curate interpretation and it is therefore helpful to break the provision down into its various component parts. A \u2014 Substantial change in working condi\u00ad tions to the detriment of the employee 37. The basis on which the employee is en- titled to terminate the contract and regard the employer as responsible for the termination is to be found in the first part of Article 4(2), which requires that the transfer should involve \u2018a substantial change in working conditions to the detriment of the employee\u2019. 22 \u2014 Daddy\u2019s Dance Hall , paragraph 16; Watson Rask and Chris\u00ad tensen , paragraph 27; Martin and Others , paragraph 41.

The national court is the most appro- priate body to determine whether, in the present case, there was a significant change to the detriment of Ms Juuri. Notwithstanding the fact that Finnish law doubtless contains provisions which would lead the Korkein oikeus to decide one way or the other, the case-law of the Court provides some guid- ance for analysing whether or not there has been a change for the worse. 23 In Merckx and Neuhuys , 24 two employees terminated their contracts in accordance with Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/23 when their new employer refused to guarantee their previous pay, which was calculated by reference to turn- over. The Court opted to assess the facts directly, stating that \u2018[a] change in the level of remuneration awarded to an employee is a substantial change in working conditions within the meaning of that provision, even where the remuneration depends in par - ticular on the turnover achieved\u2019. 25 39. Several years on, Delahaye 26 provided the Court with a further opportunity to make a ruling on \u2018substantial changes\u2019 in employ- ment contracts, although the focus was different from that in Merckx and Neuhuys . In a dispute between an employee and her new employer concerning a 37% reduc- tion in pay, the judgment did not give a definite response to the national court but confined itself to stating that \u2018application of the national rules governing the position of State employees entails a reduction in the 23 \u2014 Barnard, C., op. cit., pp. 656-664 gives an overview of this case-law. 24 \u2014 Joined Cases C-171/94 and C-172/94 Merckx and Neuhuys [1996] ECR I-1253. 25 \u2014 Ibid. , paragraph 38. 26 \u2014 Case C-425/02 Delahaye [2004] ECR I-10823.

Such a reduction must, if it is substantial, be regarded as a substantial change in working conditions to the detri- ment of the employees in question, within the meaning of Article 4(2) of the directive\u2019. 27 40. In Delahaye , by contrast with Merckx and Neuhuys , the Court repeated, with greater emphasis, the requirement that the change should be of a \u2018substantial\u2019 nature and declined to assess the facts in the main proceedings. However, both decisions were given in a similar context, characterised by a pay cut prompting the worker to termin- ate the contract unilaterally. In order to discern the meaning of a \u2018substantial\u2019 change, as specified in Directive 2001/23, it is neces- sary to approach the expression subject- ively, from the perspective of the worker, and in the context of the worker\u2019s legal and financial circumstances. If the expression were approached objectively, by weighing up factors unrelated to the individual situ- ation of the employee, there would be a risk of this leading to outcomes inconsistent with the objective of Directive 2001/23. In the two cases examined above, the Court of Justice directed the attention of the national court to other relevant factors which tipped the scales in favour of a unilateral termination of the employment contract. In Delahaye , the applicant\u2019s length of service was referred to in the judgment for the purposes of enabling the overall context of the employee to be 27 \u2014 Ibid , paragraph 33. taken into account. 28 Although paragraph 38 of the judgment in Merckx and Neuhuys does not refer to other relevant factors, it does make clear that the detriment caused to the position of the applicants was not solely pay-related, as the transfer of the under- taking had also resulted in a change in their workplace. 29 41. It seems, then, that, without openly saying so, the Court has opted for a sub - jective definition of the phrase \u2018substantial change\u2019, involving an evaluation of the legal and factual circumstances surrounding the employee at the time of the termination of the contract in reliance on Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/23. It is for the national court to appraise these circumstances using the guidelines given in Merckx and Delahaye . When these are applied to Ms Juuri\u2019s case, we find that her remuneration was reduced in proportion to her working hours. Further- more, the change of collective agreement may have brought about other alterations in the framework within which she was employed which would be relevant to the main proceed- ings as further elements for evaluating the true nature of the changes undergone. There should be added to these the occasional and temporary requirement for Ms Juuri to work in different locations. The national court has a duty to assess whether, in the legal and economic context surrounding Ms Juuri, all 28 \u2014 Ibid , paragraph 34. 29 \u2014 Merckx and Neuhuys , paragraph 9. ",

B \u2014 Attribution of responsibility to the employer: the starting point or the end of the line? 42. Under Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/23, once it has been ascertained that there has been a substantial change in the employment relationship, \u2018the employer shall be regarded as having been responsible for termination\u2019. Ms Juuri maintains that these words do not simply frame a rule for attributing responsi- bility but also a mandate as to the monetary value to be put on the termination. In the proceedings that have given rise to this refer- ence for a preliminary ruling, the Korkein oikeus is concerned about the extent of Ms Juuri\u2019s compensation in the event that Dir - ective 2001/23 goes beyond merely attributing responsibility, and is uncertain whether it should be the compensation payable under Finnish law for unfair dismissal or that corres - ponding to the notice period which the employer is obliged to respect. 43. I agree with the Finnish and Hungarian Governments and with the Commission that Directive 2001/23 solely and exclu- sively establishes a division of responsi- bility. Had the intention been to determine the financial consequences of the termin - ation, the Community legislature would have done so clearly. The objective of Article 4(2) is to allocate responsibility for the termin- ation, not to specify its legal consequences. This proposition is based on both a gram- matical and a teleological analysis of Dir - ective 2001/23, as well as on other harmonising legislation in the field of Community social law. 30 1. Taking words seriously 44. Philological interpretation is frequently not the lawyer\u2019s best tool, but it is always the first step on the road to be travelled. Commu- nity law, a legal order which is drafted in wide range of languages, all of them official, finds powerful arguments in the literal meaning of its provisions. 31 Sometimes this can be a double-edged sword, adding confusion when it comes to deciding which rules are applic- 30 \u2014 This methodology is one which, contrary to the arguments put forward in the well-known work by Dworkin, R., Taking Rights Seriously , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1977, does not lead to the only correct answer, but it does at least lead to the most correct answer. 31 \u2014 The Court recognised this in Joined Cases C-310/98 and C-406/98 Met\u00adTrans and Sagpol [2000] ECR I-1797, paragraph 32: \u2018Whatever the reasons which might be put forward \u2026 the Court is not entitled to assume the role of the Community legislature and interpret a provision in a manner contrary to its express wording.\u2019 Sometimes a simple comma turns out to be the determining factor, as in Case C-83/96 Dega [1997] ECR I-5001, paragraphs 13 and 14.

This becomes evident upon examination of the terms used in Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/23. 45. The precise words of the final part of the provision indicate that \u2018the employer shall be regarded as having been responsible\u2019 for the termination of the contract. The Spanish version, in common with the French, Czech and German versions, refers to the \u2018attribu- tion\u2019 of responsibility. 33 Other translations establish the \u2018responsibility\u2019 of the employer, without referring to attribution. This is the case in the Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Bulgarian and English versions, in which, for example, the termination \u2018\u00e8 considerata come dovuta alla responsabilit\u00e0 del datore di 32 \u2014 In the judgment of the United Kingdom Court of Appeal in Bulmer v Bollinger [1974] 1 Ch. 401 (C.A.), better known as the French Champagne Case, Lord Denning brought out the relative importance of the grammatical component in Community law: \u2018Seeing these differences, what are the English courts to do when they are faced with a problem of interpretation? They must follow the European pattern. No longer must they examine the words in meticulous detail. No longer must they argue about the precise grammatical sense. They must look to the purpose or intent. \u2026They must not confine themselves to the English text. They must consider, if need be, all the authentic texts \u2026. They must divine the spirit of the treaty and gain inspiration from it. If they find a gap, they must fill it as best they can. They must do what the framers of the instrument would have done if they had thought about it. So we must do the same. Those are the principles, as I understand it, on which the European Court acts.\u2019 33 \u2014 In the French version, \u2018la r\u00e9siliation du contrat de travail ou de la relation de travail est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme intervenue du fait de l\u2019employeur\u2019; in the Czech version, \u2018je zam\u011bstnavatel pova\u017eov\u00e1n za osobu, z jej\u00ed\u017e strany byly pracovn\u00ed smlouva nebo pracovn\u00ed pom\u011br ukon\u010deny\u2019; and in the German version, \u2018dass die Beendigung des Arbeitsvertrags oder Arbeitsverh\u00e4ltnisses durch den Arbeitgeber erfolgt ist\u2019. lavoro\u2019. 34 So, some versions lay the emphasis on the attribution and others on the respon\u00ad sibility . 35 On a broad interpretation, the texts which tend towards \u2018responsibility\u2019 reflect a desire on the part of the Community legis- lature to go beyond simple attribution, in order to promote an autonomous meaning of the word, with a financial content which is defined by Community law rather than national law. 46. I go back to the words with which I started this section: a grammatical interpret- ation can, on occasion, cause more confu- sion than unanimous agreement. The literal meaning of written provisions is of particular importance when their analysis leads to an obvious conclusion, but not in cases such as this, where the words and their translations lead to different and contradictory outcomes. I do not think that the details of the drafting of some of the versions have significant legal implications and consequently this route can only lead to uncertainty. 34 \u2014 In the Portuguese version, \u2018a rescis\u00e3o do contrato ou da rela\u00e7\u00e3o de trabalho considera-se como sendo da respon- sabilidade da entidade patronal\u2019; in the Polish version, \u2018pracodawc\u0119 uwa\u017ca si\u0119 za odpowiedzialnego za rozwi\u0105zanie umowy o prac\u0119 lub stosunku pracy\u2019; and in the Bulgarian version, \u2018\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0442 \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u2019; and in the English-language version, \u2018the employer shall be regarded as having been responsible for termination of the contract of employment or of the employment relationship\u2019. 35 \u2014 The Slovak version offers an intermediate position by including both attribution and responsibility: \u2018zodpovednos\u0165 za skon\u010denie pracovnej zmluvy alebo pracovnopr\u00e1vneho vz\u0165ahu sa bude pripisova\u0165 zamestn\u00e1vate\u013eovi\u2019.

The apparently arbitrary use of the words \u2018attribution\u2019 and \u2018responsibility\u2019 in the various official translations leads me to think that the key lies not in the literal meaning of the provision but in its goal. 2. Taking goals seriously 48. Directive 2001/23, like other Commu- nity social legislation, seeks to protect workers in the European internal market. Its function of protecting the weaker party in the employment relationship should be seen in context, namely in relation to the goal of achieving a harmonised level of protec- tion throughout the Community, where the disparities in legislation must not impede the free movement of the factors of produc- tion. 36 Provisions of social legislation are therefore complex in terms of their aims and also in terms of their nature and effects. It is no coincidence that directives, or even minimum harmonisation directives, whose 36 \u2014 On the search for a balance between employment protec- tion and promotion of economic activity, see Ball, C.A., \u2018The making of a transnational capitalist society: the European Court of Justice, social policy and individual rights under the European Community\u2019s legal order\u2019, Harvard Inter - national Law Journal, No 37, 1996, p. 307 et seq. The Court has also shown that it is very sensitive to this blending of interests in its interpretation of Community social provisions, as pointed out in O\u2019Leary, S., Employment Law and the European Court of Justice. Judicial Structures, Policies and Processes, Hart Publishing, Oxford and Portland, Oregon, 2002, pp. 119-128. mandates allow scope for greater protection at the national level, have been the preferred vehicle in this field. 37 49. The protective stance can be seen in the recitals to Directive 2001/23, which was adopted \u2018for the protection of employees in the event of a change of employer, in particular, to ensure that their rights are safeguarded\u2019. 38 To this effect, the legislature resolved to remove the differences which still remained in the Member States \u2018as regards the extent of the protection of employ- ees\u2019. 39 In their interpretation of Direct- ive 2001/23 the Court and its Advocates General have highlighted the importance of its social aspects. In his Opinion in Luigi Spano , Advocate General Cosmas recog- nises that \u2018this is legislation which clearly 37 \u2014 The use of the directive has increased in this area, but owing to the delicate nature of any intervention in this field, the legislature has frequently turned to instruments of soft law , as pointed out in Kenner, J., \u2018EC Labour Law: The Softly, Softly Approach\u2019, IJCLLIR, No 14, 1995; Goetschy, J., \u2018The European Employment Strategy: Genesis and Develop- ment\u2019, EJIR, No 5, 1999; Santana, M., \u2018La Internalizaci\u00f3n de la Estrategia Europea de Empleo en Espa\u00f1a\u2019, REDE, No 21, 2007; and Zeitlin, J. and Trubek, D.

However, the Preamble also made clear that one of the principal reasons for the introduction of a minimum level of employment protection at EC level was the fear that disparities in employment protection legislation between Member States might have a deleterious effect on the trans- fers and mergers which it was the common market\u2019s aim to bring about as a result of greater economic integration. Thus, the Directive reflected the dual economic and social aims that characterised much of the Community\u2019s Social Action Programme. Like Article 141 EC \u2026, Directive 77/187 [now Directive 2001/23] reflected both the Community\u2019s attempts to ameliorate \u201cthe unacceptable by-products of growth\u201d and its intention to eliminate distortions of competition.\u2019 movement and fair competition within the internal market. The consensus of interests is clear from a comparison of the Commis- sion\u2019s original drafting 43 with the version which emerged from the Council. The final text demonstrates great concern for recon- ciling employee protection with support for instruments of business reorganisation, a concern which is evident in the provisions at issue in the present case. At points 25 to 29 of this Opinion I describe how, after a transfer, the employee\u2019s rights can subsist for a fixed or an indeterminate period. Dir - ective 2001/23 allows the transferee consid- erable freedom of action when it comes to making changes in the working conditions of staff, but it balances this flexibility with a series of measures in favour of the employee, including, most notably, the option of unilat- eral termination. This outcome marks an end to the reconciliation of the interests of the parties, since Directive 2001/23 adds that the employer is to be regarded as responsible for the termination if, by reason of the transfer, the worker\u2019s employment conditions deteri- orate. The Commission\u2019s proposal for a dir - ective, which dates back to 1974, confirmed that, as a result of this balancing act, Article 4 was restricted to allocating blame whilst leaving the determination of its implications to national law. 44 51.

The legal consequences involved, such as severance payment, compensation, etc., should again be prescribed by the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States\u2019 (emphasis added).

        "I - 8903 JUURI is struck by leaving the system of compensa- tion to national law. Directive 2001/23, by imposing minimum standards while allowing higher levels of protection in the national sphere, produces a sensible solution. On the one hand, it offers the employee the certainty that any deterioration in working conditions will be compensated by the transferee. On the other hand, it allocates the task of speci- fying the detail of the financial content of the compensation to national law. Bearing in mind the goal of Directive 2001/23, I am convinced that Article 4(2) attributes respon- sibility to the employer, rather than defining the employer as the party to whom responsi- bility accrues. 3. Taking directives seriously 52. There are further reasons, of a systemic nature, for interpreting Article 4(2) restrict- ively. Community social law as a whole reveals the intentions of the institutions at the time when Directive 2001/23 was adopted, because in cases where they intended to determine the compensation regime which would be applicable to the present applicant they have simply done so, without further ado. The inference a contrario is, therefore, that Article 4(2) merely assigns responsibility to the employer but does not define it. 53. Directive 2006/54/EC on the implemen- tation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation, 45 which recasts most of the Community anti- discrimination legislation, requires Member States to have in place mechanisms for compensating victims of discrimination (Article 18). In principle, it seeks the intro- duction of such measures as are \u2018necessary to ensure \u2026 compensation or reparation\u2019, provided that these are \u2018real and effective\u2019 and \u2018dissuasive and proportionate\u2019. It can be seen that the provision introduces a clear Commu- nity dimension into national law, particularly in the fields of employment law and the law of damages. 46 Likewise, Directive 2006/54 does not merely attribute responsibility to the employer, but also prohibits the fixing of upper limits, with the aim of safeguarding the 45 \u2014 Directive 2006/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 (OJ 2006 L 204, p. 23). 46 \u2014 This provision systematises the earlier Article 1(5) of Directive 2002/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 September 2002 (OJ 2002 L 269, p. 15) amending Article 2(6) of Directive 76/207. It is worth noting that the final version of this provision is even more protective of victims of discrimination. The Commission\u2019s proposal made no reference to the real, effective and dissua- sive nature of the compensation but simply prohibited any limit being set on the amount and guaranteed interest on late payment. However, in the Commission\u2019s comments on the proposal, the intention to influence the content of the responsibility seems clear: \u2018\u2026 as regards the right of a victim of discrimination to compensation which can guarantee real and effective judicial protection, has a real deterrent effect on the employer and must in any event be adequate in relation to the damage sustained.\u2019 (COM(2000) 334 final, point 45, p. 11).

Directive 2004/113/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services, 48 offers a similar solu- tion, in that Article 8, using terms resem- bling those of Directive 2006/54, requires Member States to introduce \u2018such measures as are necessary to ensure real and effective compensation or reparation as the Member States so determine, for the loss and damage sustained by a person injured as a result of discrimination \u2026, in a way which is dissua- sive and proportionate to the damage suffered.\u2019 That provision not only imposes a positive obligation on national law, but also a negative one, indicating in its final words that \u2018[t]he fixing of a prior upper limit shall not restrict such compensation or reparation\u2019. 47 \u2014 This provision gives legislative expression to case-law of the Court, specifically to Case 14/83 von Colson and Kamann [1984] ECR 1891, paragraph 23; Case 79/83 Harz [1984] ECR 1921, paragraph 26; Case C-271/91 Marshall [1993] ECR I-4367, paragraph 34; and Case C-180/95 Draehm\u00ad paehl [1997] ECR I-2195, paragraph 40. On this method of compensation in the area of equality, see McCrudden, C., \u2018The Effectiveness of European Equality Law: National Mechanisms for Enforcing Gender Equality Law in the Light of European Requirements\u2019, in Hepple, B. and Szyszczak, E., Discrimination: Limits of Law, Mansell, London, 1992. 48 \u2014 Council Directive 2004/113/EC of 13 December 2004 (OJ 2004 L 373, p. 37). 55. The remainder of the harmonising social legislation is silent as to the duty to compen- sate inherently attaching to breach on the part of the employer. Directive 2001/23 mentions it, but not in such clear terms as Directives 2004/113 and 2006/54, which leads me to think that Article 4(2) of Dir - ective 2001/23 strikes a happy medium by introducing a criterion of attributing respon- sibility but not a separate body of rules relating to that responsibility. It only remains to add \u2014 without wishing to detract from what I have said at points 25 to 29 of this Opinion \u2014 that, as stated there, Articles 3 and 4 of Directive 2001/23 are mutually complementary and, in my view, this justifies adjusting their interpretation, where they fall to be applied. 4. The exception to the general rule of attri- bution: an element of gradation 56. I have argued that termination of a contract of employment where Article 3(3) of Directive 2001/23 has been complied with should not be viewed in the same way as termination because of a breach of that provision. There is a difference in the ",
        "I - 8905 JUURI conduct of the employer which, depending on the circumstances, may demand a slightly different interpretation of Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/23. That is a consequence of the case-law of the Court, which requires the national courts to provide a certain level of procedural and substantive protection in accordance with the principles of effective- ness and equivalence, even in areas where there is minimum harmonisation. 49 Thus, where Article 3 has been complied with by the transferee at the time the transfer takes place, but the employment contract is ter - minated under Article 4(2), the responsibility is subject to the general rules of the relevant national employment law. In the contrary case, it is my understanding that Article 4(2), while not specifying a particular compensa- tion regime, requires the Member State to treat the case on an individual basis, also under its domestic law. 57. The Court should not indicate to the Korkein oikeus the most appropriate compensation regime to apply to Ms Juuri\u2019s claims. However, it should give the national court some direction and indicate to it that Directive 2001/23 creates two levels of 49 \u2014 Ever since Case 222/84 Johnston [1986] ECR 1651, para- graphs 18 to 21, Community law has included a measure of procedural protection at the national level, as a consequence of the fundamental right to effective judicial protection. responsibility. The Community legal order is not concerned with the actual finan- cial outcome, but it is concerned if clearly distinct situations give rise to identical legal effects. 50 It is for the national court to devise the best solution to the issue of responsibility, provided that it makes the necessary adjust- ments based on Article 3, read in conjunc- tion with Article 4(2). 58. In short, the reply to Question 2 should be that Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/23 is to be interpreted as a provision attributing responsibility. The Community legal order nevertheless requires such responsibility to be gradated, according to whether Article 3 of Directive 2001/23 was complied with. To that end, the national court should apply the factors which aggravate or mitigate responsi- bility under national law. 50 \u2014 Case C-279/93 Schumacker [1995] ECR I-225, paragraph 30; Case C-354/95 National Farmers\u2019 Union and Others [1997] ECR I-4559, paragraph 61; and Case C-148/02 Garcia Avello [2003] ECR I-11613, paragraph 31.

In the light of the foregoing, I suggest that the Court of Justice give the following reply to the questions referred by the Korkein oikeus for a preliminary ruling: \u2018(1) Article 3(3) of Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 on the approxi- mation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees\u2019 rights in the event of transfers of undertakings precludes the terms and conditions agreed in a collective agreement from ceasing to have effect upon its expiry, where the timing of the transfer of the undertaking coincides with that of the expiry and where the transferor and the transferee act in circumvention of the law. It is for the national court to determine whether the synchronisation of the date of the transfer with the date of the expiry of the collective agreement constitutes circumvention of the law. (2) Article 4(2) of Council Directive 2001/23 is to be interpreted exclusively as a provision attributing responsibility. The Community legal order nevertheless requires such responsibility to be gradated, according to whether Article 3 of Directive 2001/23 was complied with. To that end, the national court should apply the factors which aggravate or mitigate responsibility under national law.\u2019 ",

Under that provision, where the employer has terminated the employment contract in 5 6 7 8 ",
        "I - 8911 JUURI breach of the grounds laid down in that law, the employer is to be ordered to pay compensation. Furthermore, the employer may be ordered to pay compensation where the employee is regarded as having the right to terminate the employment contract himself. However, an employee is not entitled to the compensation provided for in Para- graph 2 of Chapter 12 of the Law on employment contracts in a situation where the employer has terminated the contract of employment on material and serious grounds. Nevertheless, even in such a case, the employee is to receive his salary and other benefits during the notice period. The dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a prelim- inary ruling Ms Juuri worked for Rautaruukki Oyj (\u2018Rautaruukki\u2019) from 5 April 1994 as an employee in the staff canteen in H\u00e4meenlinna. The metal industry collective agree- ment applied to her employment relationship. On 31 January 2003 \u2014 the last day of validity of that metal industry collective agree- ment \u2014 the canteen undertaking in H\u00e4meenlinna was transferred from Rautaru- ukki to Amica. Amica informed Ms Juuri that as from 1 February 2003 the collect- ive agreement for the accommodation and catering sector, binding on Amica, would apply to her employment. Ms Juuri insisted, however, that a metal industry collect- ive agreement should continue to apply to her. When Amica did not agree to that, Ms Juuri terminated her contract of employment on 19 February 2003 with imme- diate effect. 9 10 11 ",
        "I - 8912 JUDGMENT OF 27. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-396/07 Ms Juuri then brought an action before the Helsingin k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus (Helsinki District Court), claiming that Amica should pay compensation in lieu of notice in an amount corresponding to four months\u2019 pay; compensation for holiday leave in respect of the notice period; and compensation for unlawful termination of the employment contract in an amount corresponding to 14 months\u2019 pay. To that end, Ms Juuri relied, inter alia, on Paragraph 2 of Chapter 12 of the Law on employment contracts and argued that her income had fallen by EUR 300 per month as a result of the application of the collective agreement for the accommodation and catering sector. Furthermore, she was obliged to move to other Amica workplaces. Thus, her working conditions had become substantially worse as a result of the transfer of the undertaking. Accordingly, pursuant to Paragraph 6 of Chapter 7 of the Law on employment contracts, the transferee employer \u2014 Amica \u2014 was responsible for the termination of the contract of employment. Amica contested Ms Juuri\u2019s claims. It contended, first, that it was not responsible for the termination of Ms Juuri\u2019s contract of employment and, second, that it had not acted, intentionally or through carelessness, contrary to the contract of employment or the Law on employment contracts. It could not be held liable, therefore, for the harm brought about by the termination of that contract. The Helsingin k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus dismissed Ms Juuri\u2019s action on 11 February 2005. It held that Paragraph 6 of Chapter 7 of the Law on employment contracts could not be interpreted as supplementing the rules laid down in that law on compensation for damage by introducing new grounds for the compensation of employees. In conse- quence, Ms Juuri was not entitled to the compensation she claimed on the basis of that provision. Furthermore, the transferee employer \u2014 Amica \u2014 was not in breach of any of its obligations. 12 13 14 15 ",
        "I - 8913 JUURI Upon that decision being confirmed by the Helsingin hovioikeus (Court of Appeal, Helsinki), Ms Juuri brought an appeal before the Korkein oikeus (Supreme Court). In support of her appeal, she claimed that the purpose of Directive 2001/23 is to estab- lish liability on the part of employers with respect to employees where the employ- ment relationship is terminated as a result of substantial changes to it, even where \u2014 as in the case before the referring court \u2014 the transferee employer has admittedly observed, within the meaning of Article 3(3) of that directive, the collective agree- ment binding on the transferor and guaranteeing the employee better working conditions until the date on which the validity of that agreement expired. The Korkein oikeus states that such an interpretation means that an employer could be liable to pay compensation for the loss sustained by an employee who terminates his contract of employment even where the employer has behaved in all respects in accordance with the applicable laws and every collective agreement binding upon it. If such an interpretation were to be adopted, it would then be necessary, in the view of the Korkein oikeus, to decide whether the employee\u2019s compensation falls to be assessed on the basis of Paragraph 2 of Chapter 12 of the Law on employment contracts \u2014 which would involve payment of an amount corresponding to at most 24 months\u2019 pay \u2014 or whether the compensation should correspond at most to the amounts payable by an employer who has material and serious grounds for ter - minating the contract of employment, that is to say, the pay relating to the four- month notice period and the associated compensation for holiday leave. 16 17 18 ",
        "I - 8914 JUDGMENT OF 27. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-396/07 In those circumstances, the Korkein oikeus decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \u2018(1) Is Article 4(2) of [Directive 2001/23] to be interpreted as meaning that a Member State must, in a situation in which an employee has himself given notice to terminate his contract of employment after his working conditions have become substantially worse following the transfer of an undertaking, in its law guarantee the employee the right to obtain financial compensation from the employer in the same way as in the case where the employer has unlawfully terminated the employment contract, having regard to the fact that, as permitted by Article 3(3) of [that] directive, the employer has observed a collective agreement, binding on the transferor and guaranteeing the employee better working conditions, only until its expiry, and the worsening of the working conditions arises from that? (2) If the employer\u2019s responsibility in accordance with Directive [2001/23] is not as extensive as described in Question 1, must the responsibility of the employer nevertheless be implemented by providing compensation, for example, for pay and other benefits for the notice period to be observed by the employer?\u2019 The questions referred for a preliminary ruling By its questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks essentially whether Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/23 must be interpreted as requiring Member States, in cases where a contract of employment or an employment rela- tionship falling within the scope of that provision is terminated, to guarantee 19 20 ",
        "I - 8915 JUURI employees the right to financial compensation, for which the transferee employer is liable, in accordance with conditions identical to the right on which the employee can rely where an employer unlawfully terminates the employment contract or the employment relationship, or, at least, on which he can rely by virtue of the notice period to be observed by an employer under the applicable national law where the employment contract is terminated on material and serious grounds. In that connection, the referring court also has doubts concerning the implications of the fact that the transferee employer observed, within the meaning of Article 3(3) of Directive 2001/23, the collective agreement \u2014 which was binding on the trans- feror and guaranteed better working conditions for employees \u2014 only until the date of its expiry, the deterioration in working conditions being the result, according to the employee, of that expiry. The principle of financial compensation for which the employer is liable It is clear from the wording of Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/23 that it establishes a rule that the employer is to be regarded as responsible for the termination of a contract of employment or employment relationship, whichever party is technically responsible for the termination. However, that provision does not set out the legal consequences of that responsibility. Thus it does not impose on the Member States any obligation to guarantee employees a particular compensation scheme or, accord- ingly, to ensure that the detailed rules under that scheme are the same as those under the scheme from which employees can benefit if the employer unlawfully terminates the contract of employment or by virtue of the notice period to be observed by the employer. That is consistent with the aim of Directive 2001/23, which is intended to achieve only partial harmonisation in the field in question, essentially by extending the protection guaranteed to employees independently under the laws of the individual Member 21 22 23 ",
        "I - 8916 JUDGMENT OF 27. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-396/07 States to cover the case where an undertaking is transferred. It is not intended to establish a uniform level of protection throughout the Community on the basis of common criteria. Thus Directive 2001/23 can be relied on only to ensure that the employee is protected in his relations with the transferee to the same extent as he was in his relations with the transferor under the legal rules of the Member State concerned (Case C-4/01 Martin and Others [2003] ECR I-12859, paragraph 41). Furthermore, it is clear from the explanatory memorandum in the proposal for Directive 77/187 (COM (74) 351) that, although the employee\u2019s termination of his contract of employment must be treated as if it were due to the action of his employer, the legal consequences involved, such as severance payment or compensa- tion, must be prescribed by the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States. In those circumstances, Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/23 cannot be regarded as having impliedly fixed a uniform level of protection for employees above and beyond the rule it lays down regarding the responsibility to be attributed to employers. Thus, in particular, that provision does not specify the financial consequences flowing from the fact that, in the above circumstances, responsibility for termination of the contract of employment or the employment relationship can be attributed to the employer. Accordingly, those consequences must be established in each Member State in accordance with the applicable rules of national law. However, it should also be borne in mind that the freedom to choose the ways and means of ensuring that a directive is implemented does not affect the obligation incumbent upon on all Member States to which the directive is addressed to adopt, in their national legal systems, all the measures necessary to ensure that the dir - ective concerned is fully effective in accordance with the objective which it pursues (see Case 14/83 von Colson and Kamann [1984] ECR 1891, paragraph 15, and Case C-268/06 Impact [2008] ECR I-2483, paragraph 40). 24 25 26 ",
        "I - 8917 JUURI The Member States\u2019 obligation arising from a directive to achieve the result envis- aged by that directive, as well as their duty under Article 10 EC to take all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure the fulfilment of that obligation, is binding on all the authorities of the Member States including, for matters within their jurisdiction, the courts ( von Colson and Kamann , paragraph 26, and Impact , paragraph 41). In that connection, it should be borne in mind that Directive 2001/23 is intended to safeguard the rights of employees in the event of a change of employer by allowing them to continue to work for the transferee employer on the same conditions as those agreed with the transferor (see, inter alia, Case 324/86 Tellerup (\u2018Daddy\u2019s Dance Hall\u2019) [1988] ECR 739, paragraph 9, and Case C-499/04 Werhof [2006] ECR I-2397, paragraph 25). Directive 2001/23 pursues that objective a stage further in that it makes the trans- feree employer responsible for the termination of the contract of employment or employment relationship where the transfer of the undertaking involves a substan- tial change in working conditions, the consequences of that responsibility being governed by the applicable national law. In the light of the foregoing, Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/23 must be interpreted as meaning that, in cases where the termination of a contract of employment or an employment relationship is brought about because the conditions for the applic- ability of that provision have been met, independently of any failure on the part of the transferee employer to fulfil its obligations under that directive, the Member States are not required to guarantee the employee a right to financial compensation, for which the transferee employer is liable, in accordance with the same conditions as the right upon which an employee can rely where the contract of employment or the employment relationship is unlawfully terminated by his employer. However, the national court is required, in a case within its jurisdiction, to ensure that, at the very least, the transferee employer in such a case bears the consequences that the applicable national law attaches to termination by an employer of the contract of 27 28 29 30 ",

The scope of Article 3(3) of Directive 2001/23 As was mentioned in paragraph 21 of this judgment, the referring court has doubts in the case before it concerning the conduct of the transferee employer in the light of Article 3(3) of Directive 2001/23, given that it observed the metal industry collective agreement only until the expiry date of that agreement, which coincided with the date on which the undertaking was transferred. Under Article 3(3) of Directive 2001/23, following the transfer of an undertaking, the transferee is to continue to observe the terms and conditions agreed in a collect- ive agreement on the same terms applicable to the transferor under that agreement, until the date of termination or expiry of the collective agreement or the entry into force or application of another. Thus that provision aims to ensure that, despite the transfer of the undertaking, all the working conditions continue to be observed in accordance with the intention of the contracting parties to the collective agreement. However, that provision cannot derogate from the intention of those parties as expressed in the collective agreement. Accordingly, if the contracting parties have agreed not to guarantee certain working conditions beyond a particular date, Article 3(3) of Directive 2001/23 cannot impose on the transferee the obligation to observe those working conditions after the agreed date of expiry of the collective agreement, as after that date the agreement is no longer in force. 31 32 33 ",
        "I - 8919 JUURI It follows that Article 3(3) of Directive 2001/23 does not require the transferee to ensure that the working conditions agreed with the transferor are observed after the date of expiry of the collective agreement, even though that date coincides with the date on which the undertaking was transferred. In those circumstances, the answer to the questions referred for a preliminary ruling must be that Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/23 must be interpreted as meaning that, in cases where the termination of a contract of employment or an employment relationship is brought about because the conditions for the applicability of that provision have been met, independently of any failure on the part of the transferee employer to fulfil its obligations under that directive, the Member States are not required to guarantee the employee a right to financial compensation, for which the transferee employer is liable, in accordance with the same conditions as the right upon which an employee can rely where the contract of employment or the employ- ment relationship is unlawfully terminated by his employer.

It is for the referring court to assess the situation at issue in the case before it in the light of the interpretation of Article 3(3) of Directive 2001/23 as meaning that the continued observance of the terms and conditions agreed in a collective agreement which expires on the date of the transfer of the undertaking is not guaranteed after that date.

In the absence of subsequent finishing or processing of those bars the fact that, because of sintering, the tungsten or molybdenum is also no longer in powder form, but is a solid mass, cannot, as such, have the consequence that the metals in question are no longer to be regarded as being in their unwrought form, at least for the purposes of application of the Combined Nomenclature. In addition, it follows from the very wording of subheadings 8101 91 10 and 8201 91 10 of the Combined Nomen- clature that those metals in their unwrought form include, for the purposes of the Combined Nomenclature, \u2018bars and rods obtained simply by sintering\u2019. It follows that, since bars of tungsten and molybdenum \u2018obtained simply by sintering\u2019 correspond to those metals in their unwrought form for the purposes of headings 8101 and 8102 of the Combined Nomenclature respectively, such bars cannot be regarded as coming also within the concept of \u2018articles of those metals\u2019 within the meaning of those head- ings and that they cannot, consequently, be made definitely not usable as such because of breakage or cutting up.

The Combined Nomenclature The International Convention on the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System, concluded in Brussels on 14 June 1983, and the Protocol of Amend- ment thereto of 24 June 1986 were approved on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 87/369/EEC of 7 April 1987 (OJ 1987 L 198, p. 1).

Under Article 12(1) of that regulation, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 254/2000 of 31 January 2000 (OJ 2000 L 28, p. 16), the Commission of the Euro- pean Communities is required to adopt each year a regulation reproducing the complete version of the CN and the rates of customs duty, as resulting from meas- ures adopted by the Council of the European Union or by the Commission. That regulation is to apply from 1 January of the following year.

The titles of sections, chapters and sub-chapters are provided for ease of refer- ence only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes and, provided such headings or notes do not otherwise require, according to the following provisions. \u2026 6. For legal purposes, the classification of goods in the subheadings of a heading shall be determined according to the terms of those subheadings and any related subheading notes and, mutatis mutandis , to the above rules, on the understanding that only subheadings at the same level are comparable. For the purposes of this rule the relative section and chapter notes also apply, unless the context requires otherwise.\u2019 Under Note 8(a) to Section XV of the CN, \u2018Waste and scrap\u2019 means \u2018Metal waste and scrap from the manufacture or mechanical working of metals, and metal goods definitely not usable as such because of breakage, cutting-up, wear or other reasons\u2019. 19 20 ",
        "I - 8931 METHERMA The note to the subheadings in Chapter 81 of the CN states that Note 1 to Chapter 74 of the CN, defining \u2018\u201cbars and rods\u201d, \u201cprofiles\u201d, \u201cwire\u201d and \u201cplates, sheets, strip and foil\u201d\u2019 applies mutatis mutandis to Chapter 81. According to subparagraph (d) of that Note 1, the term \u2018bars and rods\u2019 means: \u2018Rolled, extruded, drawn or forged products, not in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons \u2026. Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular \u2026 cross-section exceeds one-tenth of the width. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms and dimensions, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings. Wire-bars and billets with their ends tapered or otherwise worked simply to facilitate their entry into machines for converting them into, for example, [\u201cprofiles\u201d, \u201cwire\u201d and \u201cplates, sheets, strip and foil\u201d and \u201ctubes and pipes\u201d] are, however, to be taken to be unwrought copper of heading No 7403\u2019.

At the time of the facts in the main proceedings, the applicable version of those notes was that resulting from Amending Supplement No 11 of February 2001 (\u2018the HS explanatory notes\u2019). According to the HS explanatory note to heading 81.01, tungsten is obtained in the form of powdered metal which is compressed into blocks or bars which are sintered in an atmosphere of hydrogen in an electric furnace. The compact sintered bars are then hammered mechanically, and finally rolled or drawn into sheets, bars of smaller section or wire. Tungsten is used in filaments for electric light bulbs but \u2018[t]he most important use of tungsten (usually as ferrotungsten, see Chapter 72 [of the HS]) is, however, in the preparation of special steels\u2019. The final part of the aforesaid explanatory note to heading 81.01 of the HS states in particular that \u2018tungsten (wolfram) falls in this heading whether in the form of: (A) Powders; (B) Unwrought metal, e.g., in blocks, ingots, sintered bars and rods, or as waste and scrap (for the latter see the Explanatory Note to heading 72.04); 23 24 ",

With regard to molybdenum, it follows from the HS explanatory note to heading 81.02 that, inter alia, the metal is obtained either in a compact form or as a powder which can be sintered like tungsten. This metal is used in the form of ferromo- lybdenum, falling under Chapter 72 of the HS, for the manufacture of alloy steels. This explanatory note also states that, in the light of the resemblance between the metallurgy of tungsten and that of molybdenum, and given their often similar uses, the final part of the HS explanatory note to heading 81.01 of the HS also applies to molybdenum. The HS explanatory note to heading 72.04 of the HS, entitled \u2018Ferrous waste and scrap; remelting scrap ingots of iron or steel\u2019, reads as follows: \u2018\u2026 The heading covers waste and scrap of iron or steel, as defined in Note 8(a) to Section XV [of the HS]. 25 26 ",

        "I - 8935 METHERMA The main proceedings and the question referred for a preliminary ruling During October 2001, Metherma applied for authorisation for processing, under customs control, of bars of tungsten or molybdenum obtained by sintering, for the purpose of converting those metal bars into \u2018waste and scrap\u2019 by shattering them manually. It appears that that application was based in particular on the fact that, under the CN, \u2018waste and scrap\u2019 were exempt from customs duties, whereas the conventional rates of duty on unwrought tungsten and molybdenum, \u2018including bars and rods obtained simply by sintering\u2019, were 5% and 3% respectively. After examining several samples, the customs testing and training institute attached to the Oberfinanzdirektion K\u00f6ln (Cologne Principal Revenue Office) concluded that the sintered bars of molybdenum comprised unwrought molybdenum and that it was impossible to convert those bars into waste or scrap by breaking them up or cutting them, because they could still be used, in particular for smelting. The HZA D\u00fcsseldorf agreed with that opinion and dismissed the application for processing under customs control made for unwrought forms of tungsten or molyb- denum such as blocks, bars or granulates obtained by sintering. In the action brought before it challenging that refusal, the Finanzgericht (Finance Court), by contrast, ordered the HZA D\u00fcsseldorf to grant the authorisation applied for. The Finanzgericht held that the economic conditions for the grant of an author- isation for processing under customs control were satisfied, because the sintered bars would be converted, by the manual shattering envisaged, into waste and scrap. According to it, the shattering of the sintered bars, which makes any subsequent conversion of them into sheets, bars or wire impossible, renders them definitively unusable. 27 28 29 30 ",
        "I - 8936 JUDGMENT OF 27. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-403/07 In its application for review on a point of law (\u2018Revision\u2019) brought before the referring court, the HZA D\u00fcsseldorf claims, first, that the sintered metal bars did not consti- tute \u2018metal goods\u2019 within the meaning of Note 8(a) to Section XV of the CN, but unwrought goods. Second, even after being shattered, the sintered metal bars still constituted unwrought metal. According to the referring court, the authorisation for processing under customs control sought by Metherma should be granted if the imported goods, namely the bars of tungsten or molybdenum obtained simply by sintering, after being broken up or shattered, had to be regarded as constituting \u2018waste and scrap\u2019. It is not disputed in the proceedings before that court that the other conditions for the grant of such authorisation are satisfied. That court states that it proceeds on the assumption that the metals in question, in their unwrought form, cannot be processed into scrap by being broken up or shat- tered. Where a block of pure tungsten or molybdenum is shattered, fragments of that same metal in unwrought form are produced, and not scrap. That court, however, adds that the subheadings of the CN which result in conven- tional rates of duty of 5% for tungsten and 3% for molybdenum apply not only to those metals in their unwrought form, but also to bars of such metals \u2018obtained simply by sintering\u2019. 31 32 33 34 ",
        "I - 8937 METHERMA The question therefore arises as to whether it must be inferred from the wording of the subheadings of the CN in question that metal bars \u2018obtained simply by sintering\u2019, although they are the product of the metal when it is first processed, can be treated as equivalent to the metal in its unwrought form, with the result that even breaking up or shattering cannot turn them into scrap falling under subheadings of the CN which would lead to an exemption from customs duties, or whether, on the other hand, it follows from that wording that metal bars \u2018obtained simply by sintering\u2019, although they are referred to in the same subheading as the unwrought metal, already consti- tute \u2018metal articles\u2019 which can be rendered unusable as a result of being broken up or shattered. If the latter interpretation is correct, the referring court is of the opinion that the question then arises as to whether the bars of tungsten or molybdenum \u2018obtained simply by sintering\u2019 can be processed into scrap by being broken up or shattered, since that process means that they cannot subsequently be converted into sheets, bars or wire, or whether the only application which remains following the breaking- up or shattering of the sintered fragments, namely their use for smelting in steel production, excludes the possibility that the original bars are nevertheless definitely \u2018not usable as such\u2019 within the meaning of Note 8(a) to Section XV of the CN. In those circumstances, the Bundesfinanzhof decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \u2018Can bars of tungsten (wolfram) or molybdenum which have been \u201cobtained simply by sintering\u201d and which fall respectively under subheadings 8101 94 00 and 35 36 37 ",

According to the case-file submitted to the Court, Metherma made its application for authorisation on 5 October 2001, and this was then dismissed by the HZA D\u00fcsseldorf on 3 December 2001. In that regard, it should be recalled that a regulation specifying the conditions for classification in a tariff heading or subheading is of a legislative nature and cannot have retroactive effect (Case 158/78 Biegi [1979] ECR 1103, paragraph 11 and Case C-479/99 CBA Computer [2001] ECR I-4391, paragraph 31). In addition, the Court of Justice may deem it necessary to consider provisions of Community law to which the national court has not referred when formulating its question for a preliminary ruling (see, to that effect, Case 35/85 Tissier [1986] ECR 1207, paragraph 9; Case C-315/88 Bagli Pennacchiotti [1990] ECR I-1323, paragraph 10; Case C-107/98 Teckal [1999] ECR I-8121, paragraph 39; and Joined Cases C-329/06 and C-343/06 Wiedemann and Funk , [2008] ECR I-4635, paragraph 45). In those circumstances, as the Commission has correctly argued, the question referred for a preliminary ruling must be examined in the light, not of the provisions 38 39 40 ",
        "I - 8939 METHERMA of Commission Regulation No 1810/2004 of 7 September 2004 amending Annex I to Regulation No 2658/87 (OJ 2004 L 327, p. 1), as suggested by the wording of the order for reference, but of those of Regulation No 2388/2000. Even if it appears that Metherma, in its written observations, based its argument on the version of the CN resulting from Regulation No 1810/2004, it later explicitly conceded, at the hearing before the Court, that the version of the CN to be applied in the main proceedings was that resulting from Regulation No 2388/2000. In addition, at that hearing, it was taken as agreed that, leaving aside their numbering and structure, the wording of the provisions of those two regulations concerning the subheadings of the CN in question in the present case was identical. Accordingly, Metherma\u2019s written and oral arguments should be understood as referring to headings 8101 and 8102 of the CN as laid down in Regulation No 2388/2000. It should also be pointed out that the subheadings in question are at the same level and can therefore, according to Rule 6 of the General Rules on the interpretation of the CN, be compared. Having regard to the foregoing, the question referred for a preliminary ruling is to be understood as seeking essentially to establish whether the CN, in the version applicable in 2001, namely that laid down in Regulation No 2388/2000, must be interpreted as meaning that bars of tungsten or molybdenum \u2018obtained simply by sintering\u2019, falling respectively under subheadings 8101 91 10 and 8102 91 10, can be processed, by being broken up or shattered, into scrap falling respectively under subheadings 8101 91 90 and 8102 91 90. 41 42 43 ",
        "I - 8940 JUDGMENT OF 27. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-403/07 On the substance, Metherma, relying in particular on the explanatory notes to the HS, claims in essence, first, that bars of tungsten or of molybdenum \u2018obtained simply by sintering\u2019 cannot be treated as equivalent to the metals in question in their unwrought form and, second, that even if it were to be conceded that they can be so treated, they can be processed into scrap by being broken up or shattered. The Commission takes the opposite view and maintains that such bars must be regarded as equivalent to the metals in their unwrought form and that shattering or breaking up the bars does not alter that situation. That view coincides, essentially, as follows from paragraph 31 of the present judgment, with that taken in the main proceedings by the HZA D\u00fcsseldorf, which did not submit observations to the Court. It is settled case-law of the Court that, in the interests of legal certainty and ease of verification, the decisive criterion for the classification of goods for customs purposes is in general to be sought in their objective characteristics and properties as defined in the wording of the relevant heading of the CN and in the section or chapter notes (see Case 145/81 W\u00fcnsche [1982] ECR 2493, paragraph 12; Case C-15/05 Kawasaki Motors Europe [2006] ECR I-3657, paragraph 38; and Case C-310/06 FTS Inter\u00ad national [2007] ECR I-6749, paragraph 27). In addition, the intended use of a product may constitute an objective criterion for classification if it is inherent to the product, and that inherent character must be capable of being assessed on the basis of the product\u2019s objective characteristics and properties (see Case C-459/93 Thyssen Haniel Logistic [1995] ECR I-1381, para- graph 13; Case C-201/99 Deutsche Nichimen [2001] ECR I-2701, paragraph 20; and Case C-142/06 Olicom [2007] ECR I-6675, paragraph 18). 44 45 46 47 ",
        "I - 8941 METHERMA Furthermore, it should be recalled that, according to the case-law of the Court, the explanatory notes drawn up, as regards the CN, by the Commission and, as regards the HS, by the World Customs Organisation may be an important aid to the inter- pretation of the scope of the various headings but do not have legally binding force (see Case C-35/93 Develop Dr. Eisbein [1994] ECR I-2655, paragraph 21, and Case C-400/05 B.A.S. Trucks [2007] ECR I-311, paragraph 28). The content of those notes must therefore be in accordance with the provisions of the CN and may not alter their meaning (Case C-280/97 ROSE Elektrotechnik [1999] ECR I-689, paragraph 23; Case C-495/03 Intermodal Transports [2005] ECR I-8151, paragraph 48; and Case C-445/04 Possehl Erzkontor [2005] ECR I-10721, paragraph 20). In the present case, with regard to the question whether bars of tungsten and molyb- denum \u2018obtained simply by sintering\u2019 can be treated as equivalent to those metals in their unwrought form, Metherma maintains first of all that the expression \u2018unwrought form\u2019 refers in the present case rather to \u2018the shapes, shaped pieces or shaping of the material\u2019. That interpretation cannot be accepted. It follows from the wording of the relevant subheadings of the CN in the present case, and form the context in which they are laid down, that the expression \u2018unwrought\u2019 which appears in those subheadings refers not to the dimensions of the metallic objects in question, but to their essen- tially unfinished state. Such an interpretation follows particularly clearly from certain language versions of Regulation No 2388/2000, such as the Danish (\u2018ubearbejdet\u2019), English (\u2018unwrought\u2019), Italian (\u2018greggio\u2019), Finnish (\u2018muokkaamaton\u2019) and Swedish (\u2018i obearbetad form\u2019) versions.

Admittedly, with regard to the HS explanatory notes to headings 81.01 and 81.02, it can perhaps be conceded that, by sintering, tungsten and molybdenum in the form of powder acquire additional properties, such as malleability. However, the fact remains that, as also follows from those notes, bars of tungsten or molybdenum obtained simply by sintering are the product of a process involving the coalescing into a solid and resistant mass of powder particles, without the bars disintegrating. As follows in particular from the last part of the HS explanatory note to heading 81.01, in the absence of subsequent finishing or processing of those bars the fact that, because of sintering, the tungsten or molybdenum is also no longer in powder form, but is a solid mass, cannot, as such, have the consequence that the metals in question are no longer to be regarded as being in their unwrought form, at least for the purposes of application of the CN. In any case, as the Commission has pointed out, it follows from the very wording of subheadings 8101 91 10 and 8201 91 10 of the CN, in the versions applicable at the time of the main proceedings, that those metals in their unwrought form included, for the purposes of the CN, \u2018bars and rods obtained simply by sintering\u2019. It is common ground that, as follows from the wording of the question asked by the referring court and from paragraphs 32, 35 and 51 of the present judgment, it is such bars that are at issue in the main proceedings. It follows that, since bars of tungsten and molybdenum \u2018obtained simply by sintering\u2019 correspond to those metals in their unwrought form for the purposes of headings 52 53 54 ",
        "I - 8943 METHERMA 8101 and 8102 of the CN respectively, such bars cannot be regarded as coming also within the concept of \u2018articles of those metals\u2019 within the meaning of those headings. If, however, the main proceedings concern those metals in their unwrought form or articles of those metals, according to Metherma the fact remains that bars of tung- sten or molybdenum \u2018obtained simply by sintering\u2019 can be made definitively unusable as such by being broken or cut up. Such shattered bars can no longer, according to Metherma, be processed into sheets, bars or wire. In that regard, Metherma refers to Note 8(a) in Section XV of the CN, according to which \u2018waste and scrap\u2019 means inter alia metal goods made definitely not usable as such because of breakage or cutting up. In so far as that argument is based on the premise that bars of tungsten or molyb- denum obtained simply by sintering constitute, in their original state, articles of those metals, that cannot be accepted, since it follows from paragraph 54 of the present judgment that such bars are of unwrought tungsten or molybdenum for the purposes of headings 8101 and 8102 of the CN respectively. Metherma takes issue, in that context, with the referring court\u2019s interpretation to the effect that tungsten or molybdenum in unwrought form cannot in principle be processed into waste and scrap. It maintains, first, with reference to the HS explana- tory note to heading 81.01, that only certain solid forms of the metals in question can be treated as equivalent to the unwrought form, that is, powder particles compressed into blocks or bars. Second, waste and scrap can also be obtained from unwrought 55 56 57 ",

With regard to the first of those arguments, it must be pointed out that the wording of the CN subheadings at issue in the main proceedings refers to tungsten or molyb- denum which is \u2018unwrought \u2026 including bars and rods obtained simply by sintering\u2019. It follows that those metals can take an unwrought form other than that of the bars thereby obtained. The possibility that fragments of bars of tungsten or molybdenum \u2018obtained simply by sintering\u2019 can also constitute the unwrought form of the metals in question is therefore by no means excluded. Concerning the second of those arguments, it must be pointed out that Metherma bases its argument on a selective reading of the explanatory note to heading 72.04 of the HS. In particular, it follows expressly from that note that scrap such as turnings must come from the manufacture or mechanical working of the metals in question. The manual shattering of tungsten or molybdenum in their unwrought form which is at issue in the main proceedings does not, however, correspond to those terms. Moreover, it follows from the extracts of the HS explanatory notes to headings 81.01 and 81.02 of the HS which are referred to in paragraphs 24 and 25 of this judgment, that bars of tungsten or molybdenum simply obtained by sintering do not correspond to \u2018articles\u2019 within the meaning of the HS explanatory note to heading 72.04 of the HS, which states that the category of waste and scrap does not include articles which, with or without repair or renovation, can be re-used for their former purposes or 58 59 60 ",

Moreover, even if Metherma\u2019s argument that bars of tungsten or molybdenum obtained simply by sintering can constitute \u2018art - icles\u2019 were to be accepted, it follows from, inter alia, the information provided by the referring court, which has not been contested by Metherma, that the broken bars at issue in the main proceedings lend themselves in particular, without first being recovered as the metals in question, to smelting for steel production. In the light of all of the foregoing, the answer to the question referred must be that the CN which is laid down in Annex I to Regulation No 2658/87, in the version applicable in 2001, namely that deriving from Regulation No 2388/2000, must be interpreted as meaning that bars of tungsten or molybdenum \u2018obtained simply by sintering\u2019 fall respectively under its subheadings 8101 91 10 and 8102 91 10. Such bars, which consist of the metals in question in their unwrought form and not of art - icles thereof, cannot be processed, by being broken up or shattered, into scrap falling respectively under subheadings 8101 91 90 and 8102 91 90 of the CN. Costs Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.

        "I - 8948 SUMMARY \u2014 CASE C-418/07 Article 52 of the Treaty (now, after amend- ment, Article 43 EC) is to be interpreted as meaning that it precludes legislation of a Member State by virtue of which a group tax regime is made available to a parent company which is resident in that Member State and holds subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries which are also resident in that State, but is unavail- able to such a parent company if its resident sub-subsidiaries are held through a subsid- iary which is resident in another Member State. Such legislation gives rise to unequal treat- ment based on the place of the registered office of the subsidiary through which the resident parent company holds its resident sub-subsidiaries. Inasmuch as, from a tax - ation perspective, it puts Community situ - ations at a disadvantage compared with purely domestic situations which are objectively comparable having regard to the objective pursued by that legislation, the legislation in question thus constitutes a restriction which is, in principle, prohibited by the provisions of the Treaty relating to the freedom of establishment. That restriction cannot be justified by the allocation of the power to impose taxes between Member States, since the question whether the profits and losses of companies belonging to the group should be taken into account arises only in relation to companies which are resident in a single Member State. That also excludes, prima facie, a risk of tax avoidance. Nor can that legislation be justified by the need to ensure the coherence of the tax system. It is true that, in refusing to extend the benefit of the tax integration regime to a resident parent company wishing to include its resident sub-subsidiaries in that regime where it holds those sub-subsidiaries through a non-resident subsidiary, the legislation in question has the effect of ensuring the coher- ence of that regime. Should the subsidiary be a non-resident company, the losses recorded by the sub-subsidiary would be taken into account twice, first, in the form of the direct losses of that sub-subsidiary and, secondly, in the form of a provision made by the parent company for the depreciation of its holding in that subsidiary. That is because internal transactions would not be neutralised since the non-resident subsidiary is not subject to the tax integration regime. In such circum- stances, resident companies would enjoy the advantages of the tax integration regime, as regards the consolidation of results and the immediate taking into account of the losses of all the companies subject to that tax regime, without the losses of the sub-subsid- iary and the provisions made by the parent company being capable of being neutralised. Accordingly, the direct link which exists between the tax advantages and the neutral- isation of intra-group transactions, which avoids, inter alia, the use of losses twice at the level of resident companies falling under the tax integration regime, would thus be elim- inated, thereby affecting the coherence of that regime. ",
        "I - 8949 PAPILLON However, where measures which are less restrictive of the freedom of establishment exist for the purposes of attaining the ob- jective of ensuring the coherence of the tax system, such legislation goes beyond what is necessary in order to attain that objective. First, practical difficulties, such as the diffi- culty in ascertaining whether a risk exists that losses may be used twice where a non- resident subsidiary is interposed between the parent company and its sub-subsidiaries, cannot of themselves justify the infringement of a freedom guaranteed by the Treaty. Next, the Member States may request from the competent authorities of the other Member States all information which may be relevant in assessing, inter alia, the corporation tax payable. Lastly, where parent companies which are resident in a Member State wish to benefit from the tax integration regime together with sub-subsidiaries held through subsidiaries resident in another Member State, the tax authorities of the first State may request those subsidiaries to provide the evidence the authorities consider neces- sary in order for the transparency of the provisions made by the subsidiaries to be fully guaranteed. The legislation in ques- tion prevents, in every case, those resident companies from proving that there is no risk of losses being used twice under the tax inte- gration regime.

This reference for a preliminary ruling from the French Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State) concerns provisions of the of the French Code G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Imp\u00f4ts (General Tax Code, \u2018the CGI\u2019) on group taxation. 2. The basic idea behind the \u2018tax integration\u2019 ( int\u00e9gration fiscale ) made possible by the CGI is to equate a group made up of parent and subsidiary companies to a single company which has a number of permanent estab- lishments. Group taxation allows a parent company to offset the profits and losses of all the members of the group of companies, and to be solely responsible for corporation tax on the overall result of the group. 3. The applicant in the main proceedings, a French company, would like to undertake 1 \u2014 Original language: German. \u2018tax integration\u2019 with its French sub-subsid- iary. The special feature of the case is that it holds the sub-subsidiary through a Dutch subsidiary. The French tax administration refused the \u2018tax integration\u2019 of the parent and sub-subsidiary on the grounds that a subsid- iary not liable to corporation tax in France was involved. 4. In those circumstances, the referring court asks itself whether this constitutes an unjustified restriction on the freedom of establishment. 5. First of all, it should be noted, for clarity, that the subject-matter of this preliminary ruling is not the question whether the Neth- erlands subsidiary is to be included in the \u2018tax integration\u2019. The French parent company had solely requested integration with the French sub-subsidiary. The facts at issue thus differ from those underlying the judgments in Oy AA 2 and Marks & Spencer . 3 These cases concern the treatment in a cross\u00adborder 2 \u2014 Case C-231/05 Oy AA [2007] ECR I-6373. 3 \u2014 Case C-446/03 Marks & Spencer [2005] ECR I-10837.

        "I - 8951 PAPILLON context of profits and losses of group com - panies established in various Member States. In the present case, the issue is whether a non-resident intermediate company can provide the necessary link between a resident parent company and a resident sub-subsidiary company. II \u2014 Legal framework 6. Article 223A of the CGI, in the version applicable to the dispute underlying the main proceedings, states: \u2018A company \u2026 can render itself the sole party liable for corporation tax due on the overall profits of the group formed by it and the companies of which it is the holder, continu- ously throughout the financial year, directly or indirectly through companies in the group, of at least 95% of the capital \u2026 The com - panies in the group remain obliged to declare their results, which may be audited under the conditions laid down by Articles L.13, L.47 and L.57 of the Manual on Tax Procedures. \u2026 Only those companies that have given their consent and whose results are subject to corporation tax may be members of the group \u2026\u2019. 7. The parent company may, in principle, freely define the extent of the membership of the consolidation, thereby determining which companies should participate in the \u2018tax integration\u2019. However, according to the order for reference, it follows from the wording of Article 223A of the CGI that, when the parent company of the group defines the membership of the group, it may include a company in which it has an indirect holding only if the company though which it has that holding is itself a member of the integrated group, and therefore subject to corporation tax in France. 8. Article 223B of the CGI states: \u2018The overall profit is determined by the parent company through the algebraic sum of the results of each of the companies in the group, determined under the conditions of the general law or according to the methods provided for in Article 217bis \u2026.\u2019 9. It is apparent from the order for refer- ence that Articles 223B, 223D and 223F of the CGI provide for the neutrality of intra- group transactions, such as provisions for doubtful claims or risks between the com - panies in the group, waiver of debt or intra- group payments, provisions for depreciation of the shares held in other companies in the group, and the transfer of fixed assets within the group. ",
        "I - 8952 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-418/07 III \u2014 The facts and the main proceedings 10. The applicant in the main proceedings, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Papillon (\u2018Papillon\u2019), is a company resident in France. Papillon held 100% of the capital of the Netherlands Company Artist Performance and Communication (APC) BV, which held 99.99% of the shares of SARL Kiron (\u2018Kiron\u2019), resident in France. Kiron also held further French companies. 11. From 1 January 1989 Papillion opted for the \u2018tax integration\u2019 scheme. Kiron and a number of its French subsidiaries were included in the membership of the integrated group of companies, which was headed by Papillon. The tax authorities however refused in retrospect to apply the \u2018tax integration\u2019 scheme. The justification given for refusal was that Papillon could not form an inte- grated group with companies indirectly held through a company resident in the Neth- erlands, because the latter was not subject to corporation tax in France and could not therefore be part of the \u2018tax integration\u2019 scheme. As a result, Papillon was taxed on the basis of its own profits, without being able to offset them by means of \u2018tax integra- tion\u2019 against the results of other companies of the group. 12. Papillon challenged both the corpor- ation tax levied on it retroactively for three years and the corresponding penalties. By judgment of 9 February 2004, the Tribunal administratif de Paris, 4 having ruled, in respect of part of the applicant\u2019s claim, that the case did not need to proceed to judgment to the extent of the tax relief granted by the tax authorities in the course of proceedings, dismissed the remainder of the company\u2019s claims. On appeal, the Cour administrative d\u2019appel de Paris, 5 having again ruled that the case did not need to proceed to judgment to the extent of tax relief granted in the course of proceedings and ordered a partial repay- ment of the disputed taxes and penalties, also dismissed the remainder of Papillion\u2019s claim. 13. Papillon appealed to the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat, the referring court, against the judgment of the Cour administrative d\u2019appel de Paris. IV \u2014 Reference for a preliminary ruling 14. By judgment of 10 July 2007, lodged at the Court on 12 September 2007, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat stayed the proceedings and referred the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: 4 \u2014 Administrative Court, Paris. 5 \u2014 Administrative Court of Appeal, Paris. ",
        "I - 8953 PAPILLON \u2018(1) Inasmuch as the tax benefit arising under the \u2018tax integration\u2019 scheme affects the liability to tax of the parent company of the group, which can offset the profits and losses of all the com - panies of the integrated group and benefit from the tax neutrality of the internal transactions of that group, does the impossibility \u2014 resulting from the scheme defined by Article 223A et seq. of the Code G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Imp\u00f4ts \u2014 of including within the membership of a tax-integrated group a sub-subsidiary of the parent company, when it is held through a subsidiary which, being estab- lished in another Member State of the European Community and not carrying on business in France, is not subject to French corporation tax and thus cannot itself form part of the group, constitute a restriction on the freedom of establish- ment by reason of the tax consequences arising from the choice of the parent company as to whether to hold a sub- subsidiary through a French subsidiary or instead through a subsidiary estab- lished in another Member State? (2) If the answer is in the affirmative, can such a restriction be justified either by the need to maintain the coherence of the \u2018tax integration\u2019 system \u2014 in particular the arrangements for the tax neutrality of transactions within the group, having regard to the consequences of a system in which a subsidiary established in another Member State is treated as belonging to the group solely for the purposes of the condition as to the indirect holding of the sub-subsidiary, while remaining automatically excluded from the applica- tion of the group scheme since it is not subject to French tax \u2014 or by any other overriding reason of public interest?\u2019 15. In the proceedings before the Court of Justice, the French, Netherlands and German Governments and the Commission of the European Communities presented written and oral submissions. The Spanish Govern- ment made oral submissions. V \u2014 Legal assessment 16. By its two questions, the referring court essentially asks whether the French provi- sions at issue constitute a restriction of the freedom of establishment and if so whether this restriction is justified.

        "I - 8954 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-418/07 A \u2014 Preliminary observations 17. The subject-matter of the provisions at issue is the taxation of companies and therefore direct taxation. As such it should be recalled at the outset that, according to the settled case-law of the Court, although direct taxation does not as such fall within the purview of the European Community, the powers retained by the Member States must nevertheless be exercised consistently with Community law. 6 18. Moreover, it must be stated that the referring court is correct to assume that the factual situation falls within the scope of the freedom of establishment under Article 43 EC and not the free movement of capital under Article 56(1) EC. 19. As regards the question whether national legislation falls within the scope of one or other of the freedoms of movement, the purpose of the legislation concerned must be taken into consideration. 7 6 \u2014 See, inter alia, Case C-284/06 Burda [2008] ECR I-4571, para- graph 66; Oy AA (cited in footnote 2 above), paragraph 18; Case C-374/04 Test Claimants in Class IV of the ACT Group Litigation [2006] ECR I-11673, paragraph 35, and Case C-196/04 Cadbury Schweppes and Cadbury Schweppes Over\u00ad seas [2006] ECR I-7995, paragraph 40. 7 \u2014 See inter alia Case C-157/05 Holb\u00f6ck [2007] ECR I-4051, paragraphs 22 and 23; Case C-524/04 Test Claimants in the Thin Cap Group Litigation [2007] ECR I-2107, paragraphs 26 to 34; Case C-452/04 Fidium Finanz [2006] ECR I-9521, paragraphs 34 and 44 to 49. 20. National provisions which apply only to holdings in the capital of a company that give definite influence over the company\u2019s decisions and allow its activities to be deter- mined, come within the substantive scope of the freedom of establishment. 8 In this respect, national rules solely concerning intra-group relationships primarily affect the freedom of establishment. 9 If those rules have at the same time restrictive effects on the free movement of capital, an inde- pendent examination of that legislation from the point of view of Article 56 EC et seq. is not justified, because those effects should be seen as the unavoidable consequence of any obstacle to freedom of establishment. 10 21. Accordingly, in the present case only the freedom of establishment is relevant. According to the provisions at issue, partici- pation in the tax integration scheme is only possible for those companies in which the parent company holds directly or indirectly at least 95% of the capital. Such a large share gives a definite and decisive influence over the companies held. 8 \u2014 Cadbury Schweppes and Cadbury Schweppes Overseas (cited in footnote 6 above), paragraphs 31 and 32, and Test Claim\u00ad ants in the Thin Cap Group Litigation (cited in footnote 7 above), paragraph 27; Oy AA (cited in footnote 2 above), paragraph 20; Case C-436/00 X and Y [2002] ECR I-10829, paragraph 37, and Case C-251/98 Baars [2000] ECR I-2787, paragraph 22. 9 \u2014 Case C-284/06 Burda (cited in footnote 6 above), para- graph 68; Case C-446/04 Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation [2006] ECR I-11753, paragraph 118; Test Claim\u00ad ants in Class IV of the ACT Group Litigation (cited in foot- note 7 above), paragraph 33; and Oy AA (cited in footnote 2 above), paragraph 23. 10 \u2014 Oy AA (cited in footnote 2 above), paragraph 24; Cadbury Schweppes and Cadbury Schweppes Overseas (cited in footnote 6 above), paragraph 33; and Test Claimants in the Thin Cap Group Litigation (cited in footnote 7 above), paragraph 34.

        "I - 8955 PAPILLON B \u2014 Restriction of the freedom of establishment 22. Freedom of establishment entails, for companies formed in accordance with the law of a Member State and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within the Euro- pean Community, the right to exercise their activity in other Member States through a subsidiary, branch or agency. 11 23. Even though, according to their wording, the provisions of the EC Treaty concerning freedom of establishment aim to ensure that foreign nationals and companies are treated in the host Member State in the same way as nationals of that State, they also prohibit the Member State of origin from hindering the establishment in another Member State of one of its nationals or of a company incorp- orated under its legislation. 12 24. For the purposes of clarity, it should once again be noted that the referring court does not ask whether a refusal to allow the 11 \u2014 See, in particular, Case C-414/06 Lidl Belgium [2008] ECR I-3601, paragraph 18; Case C-471/04 Keller Holding [2006] ECR I-2107, paragraph 29; Case C-141/99 AMID [2000] ECR I-11619, paragraph 20; Case C-307/97 Saint\u00ad Gobain ZN [1999] ECR I-6161, paragraph 35. 12 \u2014 Lidl Belgium (cited in footnote 11 above), paragraph 19; Case C-298/05 Columbus Container Services [2007] ECR I-10451, paragraph 33; Case C-264/96 ICI [1998] ECR I-4695, paragraph 21. Netherlands subsidiary to participate in the \u2018tax integration\u2019 constitutes a restriction of the freedom of establishment. The subject- matter of the preliminary reference is instead whether the refusal to allow a French parent company to form a \u2018tax integration\u2019 group with its sub-subsidiary, when a non-resident subsidiary is interposed, constitutes a restric- tion of the freedom of establishment. 25. As is clear from the order for reference, the \u2018tax integration\u2019 arrangement results, upon the taxation of the parent company, in a tax advantage due to the possibility of offsetting profits and losses. As a result of this offsetting, the group of companies can use the losses of individual companies imme- diately. Without the \u2018tax integration\u2019 scheme such a loss could only be carried forward and so only be used in the subsequent tax years. 26. Pursuant to the provisions of Article 223A et seq. of the CGI this tax advantage will not be granted, if the French parent company holds its French sub-subsid- iary, in exercise of its right to freedom of establishment, through a subsidiary which is resident in another Member State, and not commercially active in France. 27. The application of the \u2018tax integration\u2019 scheme is dependent on two requirements. ",
        "I - 8956 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-418/07 First, companies in which the parent com - panies have an indirect interest can be included in the \u2018tax integration\u2019, only if the interest is held through a subsidiary which is also included in the \u2018tax integration\u2019 scheme. An \u2018 unbroken chain \u2019 of holdings in the capital of a company must therefore exist. Second, only companies which are liable to French corporation tax may participate in the tax integration. 28. A French parent company which holds its French sub-subsidiary through a non- resident subsidiary cannot fulfil the require- ments for \u2018tax integration\u2019. As the non- resident subsidiary is not subject to French corporation tax, it cannot itself participate in the \u2018tax integration\u2019. As a result, the parent and subsidiary companies do not fulfil the first requirement. Through the involvement of the non-resident subsidiary, they do not form an \u2018unbroken chain\u2019. 29. However, a French parent company may form an integrated group for tax purposes with a French sub-subsidiary, if the subsid- iary is resident in France. 30. The legislation at issue in the main proceedings leads to an unequal treatment with regard to the possibility of opting for the \u2018tax integration\u2019 scheme, according to whether the parent company holds its indir- ect shares through a resident or non-resident subsidiary. 31. The Netherlands Government was certainly correct in pointing out that the prerequisite of an unbroken chain also applies to purely French constellations. However, a French parent company holding a sub-subsidiary through a French subsidiary has the free choice to incorporate the subsid- iary into the tax integration and therefore to close the chain. On the other hand, if it holds the sub-subsidiary through a non-resident subsidiary, the parent company basically does not have the possibility to close the chain of participation though the inclusion of the subsidiary in the tax integration scheme. The subsidiary cannot be included in the integration, as it is not subject to corporation tax in France. 32. For this reason, the Netherlands Govern- ment is of the opinion that the restriction does not result from the \u2018unbroken chain\u2019 prerequisite but rather from the fact that a non-resident company may not be included in the tax integration scheme. 33. However, the \u2018unbroken chain\u2019 criteria also result in discrimination against French ",
        "I - 8957 PAPILLON companies holding shares through foreign subsidiaries. And this alone \u2014 as already mentioned above \u2014 is the subject-matter of the order for reference. Normally, only French parent companies with non-resident subsidiaries will find themselves in the pos - ition of requesting group taxation without the inclusion of their subsidiaries, because foreign subsidiaries cannot from the outset be included. Purely domestic groups of companies may, on the other hand, without difficulty form an \u2018unbroken chain\u2019. 34. The French Government is of the view that the two situations, which are treated differently by the French provisions, are not comparable. In support of that assertion it claims that, in a case such as that in the main proceedings, the subsidiary is resident abroad and as a result not subject to French corporation tax. 35. The incomparability cannot be justified alone by the fact that the subsidiary, through which the shares are held, is not resident in France. Acceptance of the proposition that a Member State may freely apply different treatment solely by reason of the fact that the registered office of a company is situated in another Member State would deprive the provisions on freedom of establishment of all meaning. 13 13 \u2014 See, to that effect, inter alia Joined Cases C-397/98 and C-410/98 Metallgesellschaft and Others [2001] ECR I-1727, paragraph 42, and Case 270/83 Commission v France [1986] ECR 273, paragraph 18. 36. The mere fact that the subsidiary is not subject to French corporation tax due to its residence in the Netherlands cannot there- fore preclude comparability. The decisive point must, rather, be whether both constel- lations are comparable from the point of view of the objective pursued by the French legis- lation on taxation of groups of companies. 14 37. The purpose of the legislation at issue is to treat a group made up of parent and subsidiary companies as far as possible as a single undertaking with a number of perman- ent establishments. In order to achieve this, the individual results of the companies may be consolidated. A French parent company which would like to consolidate with its French sub-subsidiary has an interest in doing so, regardless of whether it holds the subsidiary through a resident or non-resident subsidiary. Consequently the two situations are comparable to each other. 38. In short, at this point it must be concluded that, according to the French legislation, the tax position of a parent company holding its sub-subsidiary through a non-resident subsidiary is less advanta- geous than the position of a parent company holding its sub-subsidiary through a resident subsidiary. The choice of a parent company to hold its sub-subsidiary through a French or a non-resident subsidiary therefore can have tax disadvantages. 14 \u2014 See, to that effect, Oy AA (cited in footnote 2 above), para- graph 38 and Metallgesellschaft (cited in footnote 13 above), paragraph 60. ",
        "I - 8958 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-418/07 39. This difference in treatment, according to where the subsidiaries are resident, consti- tutes a restriction on freedom of establish- ment, since it makes it less attractive for companies to exercise freedom of establish- ment, and they may, in consequence, refrain from acquiring, creating or maintaining a subsidiary in another Member State. 15 C \u2014 Justification of the restriction 40. A restriction of the freedom of estab- lishment is permissible only if it is justified by overriding reasons of public interest. It is necessary in such a case, moreover, that its application be appropriate to ensuring the attainment of the objective in question and not go beyond what is necessary to attain it. 16 1. Preservation of the allocation of the power to impose taxes between Member States 41. The German and Netherlands Govern- ments are of the view that a restriction of 15 \u2014 See, to that effect, inter alia Lidl Belgium (cited in foot- note 11), paragraph 25. 16 \u2014 See Lidl Belgium (cited in footnote 11 above), paragraph 27; Test Claimants in the Thin Cap Group Litigation (cited in footnote 7 above), paragraph 64; Cadbury Schweppes and Cadbury Schweppes Overseas (cited in footnote 6 above), paragraph 47; and Marks & Spencer (cited in footnote 3 above), paragraph 35. the freedom of establishment resulting from the French provisions may be justified by the necessity to preserve the allocation of the power to impose taxes between Member States. In addition, they consider these provi- sions to be necessary to prevent losses being used twice and the risk of tax avoidance. 42. These justifications have been recog- nised by the Court in its judgment in Marks & Spence r. 17 However, in this judgment and in those which followed, the subject-matter was the possibility of taking losses and profits into consideration in a cross-border context. 43. The particular features of the present case may be distinguished from those cases. The subject-matter of the question referred by the national court is not whether a Neth- erlands company should be included in the system of tax integration, or in other words whether its profits and losses should be included in the consolidation. In such a case, the allocation of the Member States\u2019 power to impose taxes and the use of losses twice would certainly be the relevant justifications for consideration. 17 \u2014 Marks & Spencer (cited in footnote 3), paragraph 51; on the question as to whether it is necessary for all three justifi- cations to be present in order for a restriction to be justi- fied, see, in the negative, Lidl Belgium (cited in footnote 11 above), paragraph 40 and the Opinion of Advocate General Sharpston in that case, point 18. ",
        "I - 8959 PAPILLON 44. The German and Netherlands Govern- ments consider it appropriate in the present case to consider whether tax integration should be allowed in a cross-border context. They examine whether the freedom of estab- lishment requires in principle that the Neth- erlands subsidiary be included in the tax integration. This examination however does not deliver any definitive answer to the actual question referred to the Court. The subject- matter of the order for reference is instead whether the French provisions which do not permit tax integration between two French companies when a non-resident company is interposed infringe the freedom of estab- lishment. The non-resident company is not itself to be included in the tax integration but only to provide the link between the parent company and the sub-subsidiary. 45. As, in the case at issue, the non-resi- dent company is not to be included in the tax integration, there is no direct problem with regard to the allocation of the power to impose taxes between Member States. In the present case, there is no basis for the presumption that the profits and losses of the Netherlands company are to be taken into account in a cross-border context. 46. In particular, the Netherlands company is not to be included in the tax integration in France. The risk that losses be used twice, as in the Marks & Spencer line of cases, is therefore not present. Where the subject- matter of the case-law of the Court of Justice has concerned the prevention of losses being used twice, it has been a question of the use of losses in two different Member States. This is logical, as justification based on the prevention of the danger that losses are used twice is closely connected to the allocation of the power to impose taxes. 18 It thus concerns the taking into consideration of the same loss by two different tax jurisdictions. In this case, the French Government refers only to the risk that the losses of French companies would be taken into consideration more than once in France. 47. Since the present case does not involve the tax integration of the Netherlands company, there is no basis for the presump- tion that the legislation at issue is necessary to prevent tax avoidance. 48. At this point, I therefore note that no arguments have been presented to the effect that the legislation at issue could be justified on the grounds of the allocation of the power to impose taxes between Member States, the use of losses twice and tax avoidance. The referring court and the French and Spanish Governments therefore correctly do not refer principally to these justifications, but rely on 18 \u2014 See my Opinion in Oy AA (cited in footnote 2 above), point 54.

        "I - 8960 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-418/07 the preservation of the coherence of the tax systems as a justification. 2. Coherence of the tax system 49. The French Government submits that the legislation under dispute is necessary in order to maintain the coherence of the system of \u2018tax integration\u2019. It states that the system of \u2018tax integration\u2019 provides for a tax consolida- tion of companies. However, in compensa- tion for this it provides for the neutralisa- tion of certain transactions between group companies in accordance with Articles 223B, 223D and 223F of the CGI. The involvement of a non-resident company in the chain of integrated companies prevents the neutral- isation of the transactions within the group and leads to the danger that, for example, losses could be taken into account more than once in the calculation of the results of the group. 50. The Court has recognised that the need to maintain the coherence of a tax system can generally justify a restriction on the exer- cise of the fundamental freedoms guaran- teed by the Treaty. 19 However, it applies this 19 \u2014 Case C-204/90 Bachmann [1992] ECR I-249, para- graph 28 and Case C-300/90 Commission v Belgium [1992] ECR I-305, paragraph 21. Also see Case C-319/02 Manninen [2004] ECR I-7477, paragraph 42; and Keller Holding (cited in footnote 11 above), paragraph 40. justification very restrictively, which is why it has now even been suggested that the Court has abandoned it. Nevertheless, the Court has examined it also in recent judgments. 20 51. For such an argument to succeed, the Court demands that a direct link must be established between the tax advantage concerned and the offsetting of that advan- tage by a particular tax levy. 21 The direct nature of the link must be established, in light of the objective pursued by the tax rules concerned, in relation to the relevant taxpayers by a strict correlation between the deductible element and the taxable element. 22 52. The further condition that the tax advan- tage and levy must concern one and the same taxpayer 23 appears to have been abandoned by the Court in its judgment in Manninen . 24 Incidentally, this further criterion would seem to be fulfilled in the present case, because it would be artificial not to regard the companies of a group whose very aim is 20 \u2014 Case C-293/06 Deutsche Shell [2008] ECR I-1129, para- graph 37; Case C-379/05 Amurta [2007] ECR I-9569, para- graph 46; Case C-443/06 Hollmann [2007] ECR I-8491, paragraph 56; and Test Claimants in the Thin Cap Group Litigation (cited in footnote 7 above), paragraph 68. 21 \u2014 Case C-484/93 Svensson and Gustavsson [1995] ECR I-3955, paragraph 18 and ICI (cited in footnote 12 above), para- graph 29.

As Advocate General Poiares Maduro correctly stated in his Opinion in Marks & Spencer , compliance with the principle of coherence of national tax systems serves to protect the integrity of those systems, whose organisation is a matter for the Member States, provided they do not impede the internal market more than is necessary. 25 Coherence must first and foremost be adjudged in light of the aim and logic of the tax regime at issue. 26 54. The purpose of the French legislation on \u2018tax integration\u2019 is to neutralise the effects of the formation of a group of companies for taxation purposes, in other words, to equate the group to a company with several permanent establishments. The advantage lies in the consolidation of the results of the members of the group: all profits and losses of the individual companies are added together at the level of the parent company and form, after this consolidation, the basis 25 \u2014 Opinion of the Advocate General Poiares Maduro in Marks & Spencer (cited in footnote 3 above), point 66. 26 \u2014 Opinion in Marks & Spencer (cited in footnote 3 above), point 71. for assessment. However, the group should not have any further advantages, in that consolidation should not lead to some losses being used more than once. Under the French legalisation, the logical correlation of this consolidation is that the same losses may not be used more than once within a group of companies. The use of losses twice would run counter to the goal of neutrality pursued by the rule. In order to prevent this, the French legislation provides that certain transactions are neutralised. 55. The French Government has presented the following example as an illustration of neutralisation measures. A sub-subsidiary suffers losses. This leads to the subsidiary making provision for the depreciation of its shares in the sub-subsidiary. For this reason, the parent company makes, in turn, provision for the depreciation of its shares in its subsid- iary. Thus, the sub-subsidiary suffers loss, which gives rise in each case to the making of provision by the subsidiary and the parent company. If the parent and the sub-subsid- iary were to form a tax integration group, this loss would be taken into consideration in the course of the consolidation of results. For the first time, as the direct loss of the sub-subsid- iary and once again for the same loss, but this time in the form of a provision made because of the loss of the subsidiary in relation to the parent company. 56. In order to prevent the uses of losses twice, the French legislation on \u2018tax ",
        "I - 8962 OPINION OF MRS KOKOTT \u2014 CASE C-418/07 integration\u2019 provides for certain neutral- isation measures. The result of the meas- ures, in the case of the example described above, is that a loss could only be used once. According to the French Government, if a non-resident subsidiary were involved, the losses would be used twice: once in the form of a provision made by the parent company for the loss of value in the shareholding of the parent company, because the non-resident subsidiary is not part of the group, with the result that the internal transaction cannot be neutralised. 57. At this point it must be noted that the purpose and the system of the French legisla- tion on \u2018tax integration\u2019 requires that certain intra-group transactions be neutralised before the consolidation of results. However, is there a direct link between the tax advan- tage of group taxation and the offsetting of that tax advantage by a tax deduction within the meaning of the case-law of the Court? 58. In the Bachmann judgment, the Court found a direct link between the tax-deduct- ibility of insurance premiums and the tax - ation of sums payable by the insurers under insurance contracts. Since Mr Bachmann had concluded an insurance contract in Germany pursuant to which payments made by the insurers would not be subject to tax - ation in Belgium, the refusal of the Belgian tax authorities to allow the deduction of his premiums paid pursuant to the insurance contracts was justified. 59. In the cases decided so far, in which the coherence of the tax system was the decisive justification, the disadvantage in question was a compensatory levy, in other words a tax. In the present case the disadvantage lies in the neutralisation of certain intra-group transactions. In the strict sense, this cannot be viewed as the imposition of tax, because neutralisation measures do not constitute the levying of a tax. Nevertheless, they are to be seen as a tax disadvantage, because certain measures, namely the provision for the loss of share value, in contrast to the individual assessment of a company, are not taken into consideration. There is also a direct link between the provisions on neutralisation and the tax integration, because a consolidation of the results of the various companies will only be accorded if it can at the same time be assured that the objective pursued is not distorted by the use of losses more than once. 60. Thus, a measure, which seeks to avoid the use of losses more than once, may be justified in order to maintain the coherence of the tax system. ",
        "I - 8963 PAPILLON 61. The French measures must however also be consistent with the principle of proportionality. 62. In particular, there should be no more moderate means available to prevent the use of the losses more than once. It would have to be established that, in a context of the interposition of a non-resident subsidiary between a parent company and sub-subsid- iary, it would not be possible to neutralise certain transactions in the same manner as in a purely French context in order to prevent the use of losses more than once. A more moderate means could be the neutralisation of the transactions in question in the same manner as in a purely French context. 63. France refers, however, to various prac- tical problems which, it claims, would exist when determining whether losses have been used twice, when a non-resident company had been interposed. According to France, any use of losses twice is not easy to identify because the amount of the provision does not generally correspond to the amount of loss of the subsidiary. In addition, it is not always possible to identify the exact origin of a provision. In order to achieve this, changes to legislation would be necessary. 64. First, it must be pointed out in this context that practical difficulties cannot justify infringement of freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty. 27 65. Second \u2014 as also pointed out by the Commission \u2014 Community law in the form of Directive 77/799/EEC 28 allows Member States to request the competent authority of the other Member State to forward any infor- mation which may be relevant in assessing the corporation tax payable. 66. Moreover, the tax authorities concerned are entitled to demand from the parent company itself such evidence as they consider necessary in order to determine whether the provisions made by the parent company for losses in share values are attributable indirectly to the loss of the sub-subsidiary through the provisions of the intermediary subsidiary. 29 27 \u2014 See, to that effect, Case C-386/04 Centro di Musicologia Walter Stauffer [2006] ECR I-8203, paragraph 48; Case C-334/02 Commission v France [2004] ECR I-2229, para- graph 30; Test Claimants in FII Group Litigation (cited in footnote 9 above), paragraphs 155 to 157; also the Opinion of Advocate General Sharpston in Lidl Belgium (cited in footnote 11 above), point 31. 28 \u2014 Council Directive 77/799/EEC of 19 December 1977 concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation (OJ 1977 L 336, p. 15). 29 \u2014 See, to that effect, Case C-347/04 Rewe Zentralfinanz [2007] ECR I-2647, paragraph 57; Centro di Musicologia Walter Stauffer (cited in footnote 27 above), paragraph 49; Case C-451/05 ELISA [2007] ECR I-8251, paragraph 95; and also Case C-150/04 Commission v Denmark [2007] ECR I-1163, paragraph 54.

On the basis of the information available to me, serious doubts exist as to whether the complete refusal to allow \u2018tax integration\u2019 between a parent company and a sub-subsid- iary held through a non-resident subsidiary is the most moderate means to prevent the use of losses twice and therefore to maintain the coherence of the tax system. Ultimately, it will be for the national court to establish whether the goal pursued, that is, the preven- tion of losses being used twice in the frame- work of a tax integration, can be achieved by the more moderate means of neutralisation also in a cross-border situation. VI \u2014 Conclusion 68. For the foregoing reasons, I propose that the Court\u2019s answer to the questions referred by the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat should be as follows: \u2018(1) National rules such as the French \u2018tax integration\u2019 scheme under Articles 223A et seq. of the Code G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Imp\u00f4ts, according to which a French parent company may include a French sub-subsidiary in the tax integration only if the sub-subsidiary is held through a French subsidiary and not a non-resident subsidiary, constitute an obstacle to the freedom of establishment. (2) This restriction can be justified on the basis of the coherence of the tax system if the exclusion is suitable to prevent losses being used twice when the results of the parent and the sub-subsidiary are being consolidated, and does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve this goal.\u2019 ",

That reference was made in proceedings between Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Papillon (\u2018Papillon\u2019), estab- lished in France, and the Minist\u00e8re du Budget, des Comptes publics et de la Fonc- tion publique (French Ministry of the Budget, Public Accounts and the Civil Service) relating to the refusal by the latter to acknowledge Papillon\u2019s entitlement to benefit from the scheme known as the \u2018tax integration\u2019 regime.

The national court states that the effect of Article 223A of the CGI is that the parent company of the group is entirely free to determine the membership of that group. However, the parent company may hold another of the group\u2019s member companies indirectly only through a company which is itself a member of the integrated group and therefore subject to corporation tax in France. Article 223B of the CGI provides that \u2018the overall profit is to be determined by the parent company through the algebraic sum of the results of each of the companies in the group \u2026\u2019. Articles 223B, 223D and 223F of the CGI provide, inter alia, for the neutrality of intra-group transactions, such as provisions for doubtful claims or risks between the companies in the group, waivers of debt or intra-group payments, provisions for depreciation of shares held in other companies in the group, and the transfer of fixed assets within the group. The dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred During the tax years at issue in the main proceedings, that is to say, from 1 January 1989 to 31 December 1991, Papillon held 100% of the capital of the Netherlands 4 5 6 7 ",
        "I - 8969 PAPILLON company Artist Performance and Communication, which in turn held 99.99% of the shares in Kiron SARL, a company resident in France. In those circumstances, Papillon elected to be taxed under the tax integration regime, governed by Art - icles 223A to 223F of the CGI, which allows a resident company to assume sole liability for the corporation tax due in respect of the whole of the results of the group comprising that company and the companies in which it holds, directly or indirectly, a minimum of 95% of their capital. For that purpose, Papillon included Kiron SARL and a number of subsidiaries of that company which were also resident in France as members of the integrated group of which it was the parent. The tax authorities refused to extend the benefit of that regime to Papillon on the ground that it could not form part of an integrated group with companies held indir - ectly through a company resident in the Netherlands, since, in the absence of a permanent establishment in France, the latter company was not subject to corpor- ation tax in France. On its tax liability being recalculated as a result, Papillon was charged to tax on the amount of the profits it had itself declared, and was unable to offset them by the results of the other companies in the integrated group. Papillon challenged the additional corporation tax levied on it for the period from 1989 to 1991 as a result before the Tribunal administratif de Paris (Administra- tive Court, Paris) which rejected its arguments by judgment of 9 February 2004.

The Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat asks whether, on the assumption that such a restriction is found to exist, it may be justified by overriding reasons of public interest, in particular by the need to ensure the coherence of the tax system. In those circumstances, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \u2018(1) Inasmuch as the tax benefit arising under the \u201ctax integration\u201d scheme affects the liability to tax of the parent company of the group, which can offset the profits and losses of all the companies of the integrated group, and benefit from the tax neutrality of the internal transactions of that group, does the impossibility \u2014 resulting from the scheme defined by Article 223A et seq. of the [CGI] \u2014 of including within the membership of a tax-integrated group a sub-subsidiary of the parent company, when it is held through a subsidiary which, being estab- lished in another Member State \u2026 and not carrying on business in France, is not subject to French corporation tax and thus cannot itself form part of the group, constitute a restriction on the freedom of establishment by reason of the tax consequences arising from the choice of the parent company as to whether to hold a sub-subsidiary through a French subsidiary or instead through a subsid- iary established in another Member State? 11 12 13 ",
        "I - 8971 PAPILLON (2) If the answer is in the affirmative, can such a restriction be justified either by the need to maintain the coherence of the \u201ctax integration\u201d system \u2014 in particular the arrangements for the tax neutrality of transactions within the group, having regard to the consequences of a system which consists of treating a subsidiary established in another Member State as belonging to the group solely for the purposes of the condition as to the indirect holding of the sub-subsidiary, while remaining automatically excluded from the application of the group scheme since it is not subject to French tax \u2014 or by any other overriding reason of public interest?\u2019 The questions referred By its two questions, which should be considered together, the national court is essentially asking whether legislation of a Member State in terms of which a group taxation regime is made available to a parent company which is resident in that Member State and has subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries which are also resident in that State, but the benefit of that regime is excluded in the case of a parent company if its sub-subsidiaries are held through a subsidiary which is resident in another Member State, constitutes a restriction on the freedom of establishment, and, should that be the case, whether that restriction can be justified. In that regard, it should be pointed out that freedom of establishment entails for companies or firms formed in accordance with the law of a Member State and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within the European Community, the right to exercise their activity in other Member States through a subsidiary, branch or agency (Case C-471/04 Keller Holding [2006] ECR I-2107, paragraph 29, and Case C-414/06 Lidl Belgium [2008] ECR I-3601, paragraph 18). 14 15 ",
        "I - 8972 JUDGMENT OF 27. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-418/07 Even though, according to their wording, the provisions of the EC Treaty concerning freedom of establishment are directed to ensuring that foreign nationals and com - panies are treated in the host Member State in the same way as nationals of that State, they also prohibit the Member State of origin from hindering the establishment in another Member State of one of its nationals or of a company incorporated under its legislation (Case C-264/96 ICI [1998] ECR I-4695, paragraph 21; Case C-298/05 Columbus Container Services [2007] ECR I-10451, paragraph 33; and Lidl Belgium , paragraph 19). It must be noted at the outset that the national court does not, in the main proceed- ings, ask whether the fact that it is impossible for the Netherlands subsidiary of Papillon to be included in the tax integration constitutes a restriction on the freedom of establishment. As the Advocate General observed in points 5 and 24 of her Opinion, the reference for a preliminary ruling asks whether a restriction on the freedom of establishment under Article 52 of the Treaty arises by virtue of the fact that a parent company established in one Member State cannot benefit from the tax integration regime as regards the group constituted by that company and its sub- subsidiaries, all of whom have their seat in the same State, where the intermediate subsidiary, which is established in another Member State, is not subject to corpor- ation tax in the first State. As the order for reference states, the tax integration regime reduces the tax liability of the parent company by allowing it to offset the profits and losses of all the com - panies in the fiscally-integrated group. That regime constitutes a tax advantage inas- much, in particular, as the offsetting which is permitted allows a group to take the losses of certain of its members into account immediately. Under Article 223A et seq. of the CGI, that tax advantage is, however, not available where a parent company established in France holds a sub-subsidiary which also has its registered office in France through a subsidiary which is established in another Member State and which does not carry on business in France. 16 17 18 19 ",
        "I - 8973 PAPILLON As was noted in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this judgment, the parent company of the group can, if it is to benefit from the tax integration regime, have an indirect holding in another group company only if this is done through a company which is itself a member of the integrated group and is accordingly liable to corporation tax in France. Thus, a parent company which has its registered office in France and which holds its French sub-subsidiaries through a subsidiary established in another Member State cannot benefit from the tax integration regime. By contrast, a French parent company is able to achieve tax integration with its French sub-subsidiaries where the intermediate subsidiary is established in France. As the Advocate General stated at point 30 of her Opinion, the effect is that the provisions of the CGI at issue in the main proceedings create a difference in treat- ment since the ability to elect for the tax integration regime is dependent on whether the parent company holds its indirect shares through a subsidiary established in France or in another Member State. The French Government contends, however, that that difference in treatment can be explained by the fact that those two situations are not objectively comparable. In a situation such as that which arises in the main proceedings, a subsidiary which is established in a Member State other than the French Republic is, by virtue of that fact, not subject to corporation tax in France, unlike the position which arises when the subsidiary has its registered office in that State. 20 21 22 23 24 ",
        "I - 8974 JUDGMENT OF 27. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-418/07 That argument cannot be accepted. Acceptance of the proposition that the Member State may freely apply a different treatment solely by reason of the fact that a company\u2019s registered office is situated in another Member State would deprive the rules relating to the freedom of establish- ment of all meaning (see, to that effect, Case 270/83 Commission v France [1986] ECR 273, paragraph 18, and Joined Cases C-397/98 and C-410/98 Metallgesellschaft and Others [2001] ECR I-1727, paragraph 42). In order to establish whether discrimination exists, the comparability of a Commu- nity situation with one which is purely domestic must be examined by taking into account the objective pursued by the national provisions at issue (see, to that effect, Metallgesellschaft and Others , paragraph 60, and Case C-231/05 Oy AA [2007] ECR I-6373, paragraph 38). In the main proceedings, the provisions of the CGI at issue aim to treat, as far as possible, a group constituted by a parent company with its subsidiaries and its sub- subsidiaries in the same way as an undertaking with a number of permanent estab- lishments, by allowing the results of each company to be consolidated. That objective can be attained both in the situation of a parent company which is resident in a Member State and holds sub-subsidiaries also resident in that State through a subsidiary which is itself resident, and in the situation of a parent company which is resident in the same Member State and holds sub-subsidiaries also resident in that State, but through a subsidiary established in another Member State. 25 26 27 28 29 ",
        "I - 8975 PAPILLON Having regard to the objectives of the CGI at issue in the main proceedings, those situations are thus objectively comparable. Consequently, the tax regime at issue in the main proceedings gives rise to unequal treatment based on the place of the registered office of the subsidiary through which the resident parent company holds its resident sub-subsidiaries. Inasmuch as, from a taxation perspective, they put Community situations at a disad- vantage compared with purely domestic situations, the provisions of the CGI at issue in the main proceedings thus constitute a restriction which is, in principle, prohib- ited by the provisions of the Treaty relating to the freedom of establishment. It is clear from the Court\u2019s case-law that such a restriction of the freedom of estab- lishment is permissible only if it is justified by overriding reasons of public interest. It is necessary in such a case, moreover, that its application be appropriate to ensuring the attainment of the objective in question and not go beyond what is necessary to attain it ( Lidl Belgium , paragraph 27 and the case-law cited). In that regard, it must be noted, first, that the German and Netherlands Govern- ments argue in the written observations which they have submitted to the Court that the restriction on the freedom of establishment which arises under the legislation at issue in the main proceedings may be justified by the necessity to preserve the alloca- tion of the power to impose taxes between Member States. 30 31 32 33 34 ",
        "I - 8976 JUDGMENT OF 27. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-418/07 In that regard, those Governments refer to Case C-446/03 Marks & Spencer [2005] ECR I-10837 and to Oy AA and argue that the restriction imposed by the CGI at issue in the main proceedings is necessary in order to prevent losses being used twice and the risk of tax avoidance. Those justifications cannot be accepted. In Marks & Spencer and Oy AA , the questions referred related, in the former case, to the taking into account of losses recorded in a Member State other than that in which the taxpayer was resident and, in the latter case, to a risk of tax avoidance. In the main proceedings, those questions do not arise, since the object of the refer- ence for a preliminary ruling is to establish whether the fact that a company which is resident in a Member State cannot benefit from the tax integration regime with its sub-subsidiaries which are also resident in that State when the intermediate subsidiary is established in another Member State constitutes a restriction, and not to establish whether the non-resident subsidiary should be capable of falling under that regime. In the main proceedings, the question as to whether the profits and losses of com - panies belonging to the group in question should be taken into account arises only in relation to companies which are resident in a single Member State. Accordingly, the question which is put relates to the taking into account of losses recorded in one and the same Member State, which also excludes, prima facie, a risk of tax avoidance. 35 36 37 38 39 ",
        "I - 8977 PAPILLON Consequently, the restriction established in paragraphs 22 to 32 of this judgment cannot be justified by the allocation of the power to impose taxes between Member States. Secondly, it must be noted that the national court asks whether the restriction at issue can be justified by the need to ensure the coherence of the tax system, with the French Government considering, in the written observations it has submitted to the Court, that that is the case in the main proceedings. The national court observes that, since the non-resident subsidiary is automatically excluded from the application of the tax integration regime, because it is not subject to corporation tax in France, the coherence of the system for neutralising intra- group transactions is affected, since the treatment of transactions involving that subsidiary is different from that applying to transactions involving a resident subsid- iary and might lead to cases of double deduction, unlike a system which applies only to companies subject to that tax. In that regard, it must be pointed out that the Court has already acknowledged that the need to maintain the coherence of a tax system can justify a restriction on the exercise of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty (Case C-204/90 Bachmann [1992] ECR I-249, paragraph 28; Case C-319/02 Manninen [2004] ECR I-7477, paragraph 42; and Keller Holding , paragraph 40). For an argument based on such a justification to succeed, the Court requires, however, that a direct link be established between the tax advantage concerned and the offsetting of that advantage by a particular tax levy (Case C-484/93 Svensson and Gustavsson [1995] ECR I-3955, paragraph 18; ICI , paragraph 29; Manninen , paragraph 42; and Keller Holding , paragraph 40), with the direct nature 40 41 42 43 44 ",
        "I - 8978 JUDGMENT OF 27. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-418/07 of that link falling to be examined in the light of the objective pursued by the rules in question ( Manninen , paragraph 43, and Case C-293/06 Deutsche Shell [2008] ECR I-1129, paragraph 39). In the main proceedings, the French Government states that the tax integration regime provides for the tax consolidation of companies and, to offset this, for the neutralisation of certain transactions between the group companies in accordance with Articles 223B, 223D and 223F of the CGI. In that regard, it must be pointed out that neutralisation of transactions which are internal to the group avoids, inter alia, the use of losses twice at the level of resident companies falling under the tax integration regime. In the case of losses recorded by the sub-subsidiary, the subsidiary will generally provide for the depreciation of its holding in that sub-subsidiary and the parent company will, as a result, provide for the depreciation of its holding in its subsidiary. Since those circumstances involve one and the same loss, originating at the level of the sub-subsidiary, where each of those companies is subject to the tax integration regime, the neutralisation mechanism results in the provision for depreciation made by the parent company and the subsidiary being disregarded. Nevertheless, should the subsidiary be a non-resident company, the losses recorded by the sub-subsidiary would be taken into account twice, first, in the form of the direct losses of that sub-subsidiary and, secondly, in the form of a provision made by the parent company for the depreciation of its holding in that subsidiary. The internal transactions would not be neutralised because the non-resident subsidiary is not subject to the tax integration regime. 45 46 47 48 ",
        "I - 8979 PAPILLON In such circumstances, it is clear that resident companies would enjoy the advantages of the tax integration regime, as regards the consolidation of results and the imme- diate taking into account of the losses of all the companies subject to that regime, without the losses of the sub-subsidiary and the provisions made by the parent company being capable of being neutralised. As a result, the direct link which exists under the tax integration regime between the tax advantages and the neutralisation of intra-group transactions would thus be eliminated, thereby affecting the coherence of that regime. Consequently, in refusing to extend the benefit of the tax integration regime to a resident parent company wishing to include its resident sub-subsidiaries in that regime where it holds those sub-subsidiaries through a non-resident subsidiary, the provisions of the CGI at issue in the main proceedings have the effect of ensuring the coherence of that regime. However, it is also necessary that that national legislation does not go beyond what is necessary to attain that objective, that is to say, that the same objective cannot also be attained by measures which are less restrictive of the freedom of establishment. In that regard, the French Government argues that the provisions of the CGI in ques- tion are made necessary by the difficulty which the French tax authorities have in ascertaining whether a risk exists that losses may be used twice where a non-resident subsidiary is interposed between the parent company and its sub-subsidiaries. The amount of a provision does not generally correspond to the loss of the subsidiary and it is not always possible to identify the exact origin of a provision. 49 50 51 52 53 ",
        "I - 8980 JUDGMENT OF 27. 11. 2008 \u2014 CASE C-418/07 In this respect, it must first be pointed out that practical difficulties cannot of them- selves justify the infringement of a freedom guaranteed by the Treaty (Case C-334/02 Commission v France [2004] ECR I-2229, paragraph 29; Case C-386/04 Centro di Musicologia Walter Stauffer [2006] ECR I-8203, paragraph 48; and Case C-446/04 Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation [2006] ECR I-11753, paragraph 70). Next, it must be noted that Community legislation, namely Council Directive 77/799/EEC of 19 December 1977 concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation (OJ 1977 L 336, p. 15), allows the Member States to request from the competent authorities of the other Member States all information which may be relevant in assessing, inter alia, the corporation tax payable. Lastly, it must be added, as the Advocate General stated at point 66 of her Opinion, that the tax authorities concerned are entitled to demand from the parent company such documents as they consider necessary in order to determine whether the provi- sions made by that company for the losses in share values in the subsidiary can be explained indirectly by a loss of the sub-subsidiary through the provisions of that subsidiary (see, to that effect, Centro di Musicologia Walter Stauffer , paragraph 49; Case C-150/04 Commission v Denmark [2007] ECR I-1163, paragraph 54; Case C-347/04 Rewe Zentralfinanz [2007] ECR I-2647, paragraph 57; and Case C-451/05 ELISA [2007] ECR I-8251, paragraph 95). In relations between Member States, information requested or provided by the tax authorities concerned is all the more likely to allow it to be ascertained whether the conditions laid down under national legislation are satisfied since Community harmonisation measures apply in the field of company accounts, with the result that it is possible to produce reliable and verifiable evidence relating to a company established in another Member State (see, to that effect, Case C-101/05 A [2007] ECR I-11531, paragraph 62). 54 55 56 57 ",
        "I - 8981 PAPILLON Thus, where parent companies which are resident in a Member State wish to benefit from the tax integration regime together with sub-subsidiaries held through subsid- iaries resident in another Member State, as in the main proceedings, the tax author- ities of the first State may request those subsidiaries to provide the evidence the authorities consider necessary in order for the transparency of the provisions made by the subsidiaries to be fully guaranteed. Companies established in France which hold resident sub-subsidiaries through subsidiaries which are resident in another Member State and which are accord- ingly not entitled to benefit from the tax integration regime are not permitted, under the provisions of the CGI at issue in the main proceedings, to provide documen- tary evidence which might serve to establish that there is no risk of losses being used twice. Consequently, that legislation prevents, in every case, those resident companies from proving that there is no risk of losses being used twice under the tax integration regime. It follows that measures which are less restrictive of the freedom of establishment exist for the purposes of attaining the objective of ensuring the coherence of the tax system. Accordingly, the provisions of the CGI at issue in the main proceedings go beyond what is necessary in order to attain that objective and cannot, as a result, be justified by the need to ensure the coherence of the tax system. In the light of all of the above, the answer to the questions referred must be that Article 52 of the Treaty is to be interpreted as meaning that it precludes legislation of a Member State by virtue of which a group tax regime is made available to a parent 58 59 60 61 62 63 ",
