        "change and pandemics, have now become realities which are having increasingly severe impacts on various aspects of human life, as well as on development opportunities, the worldwide geopolitical order and stability; K. whereas the use of global maritime information is vital in ensuring strategic monitoring, making risk analysis and early warning to the EU and its Member States possible and strengthening the provision of information to support civilian and military marine security operations; L. whereas counter-terrorism is a high priority on the European agenda on security 2015-2020; M. whereas the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the EU\u2019s vulnerability vis-\u00e0-vis authoritarian regimes, the fragility of the EU\u2019s traditional external alliances and the need for the Union to ensure a foreign policy that is consistent with its fundamental values; whereas this calls for the EU to reconsider its external relations and base them on the principles of solidarity and multilateralism; whereas the COVID-19 pandemic and its wide-ranging consequences are hitting the most vulnerable particularly hard, mainly in regions with weaker healthcare and social systems; N. whereas new multidimensional challenges have emerged in recent years, such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the questioning of agreements on the non-proliferation of weapons, the worsening of regional conflicts that have given rise to population displacement, competition for natural resources, energy dependency, climate change, the consolidation of failed states, terrorism, organised transnational crime, cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns; O. whereas in view of the collapse of important arms control and disarmament agreements and of the rapid developments of new arms technologies, disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation should become a major focus of the CFSP in order to protect EU citizens and international stability and security alike; whereas Common Position 2008/944/CFSP must be updated for the criteria to be strictly applied and implemented; Positioning the EU as a \u2018partner of choice\u2019 in a changing geopolitical order 1. Highlights that the COVID-19 pandemic is a wake-up call for the need for a stronger, more autonomous, more united and assertive foreign and security policy to step up the Union\u2019s leadership on the international scene in order to defend and develop a rules-based international order which guarantees multilateralism, democracy and human rights, and to promote its values and interests more decisively worldwide; underlines that in order to achieve this, the EU first has to successfully assist its partners in the immediate neighbourhood; 2. Promotes and defends the EU\u2019s role as a reliable partner worldwide, a preferred \u2018partner of choice\u2019 for third parties, a principled, but not dogmatic, honest broker, an actor of reference for conflict resolution and mediation, which promotes diplomacy and dialogue as the preferred way to play a constructive role in global conflicts, as a leading promoter of sustainable development and a major contributor to the multilateral framework, but also as a global actor that is ready to act autonomously and decisively when necessary to defend the EU\u2019s own values and interests, that takes responsibility by ensuring its own security and promoting international peace and stability, based on the principles and values of the UN Charter and as enshrined in international law, with respect for the international rules-based order; takes the view that creativity, a more proactive attitude and more unity and solidarity among the Member States, as well as commitment and resources from the Member States, are needed to increase the EU\u2019s influence globally and to promote its positive power model and its responsible role in global governance, and in order to allow it to assume its strategic responsibility in its immediate neighbourhood; 3. Stresses that the world\u2019s growing instability, the increasingly confrontational environment, the erosion of multilateralism and the rise of authoritarianism, as well as multifaceted global challenges, especially the increasing climate of conflict which translates into the continuation and sometimes resumption of armed conflicts including at the eastern and southern borders of the European continent, terrorism, climate change and increasing threats to natural resources, uncontrolled migration flows, health-related risks, hybrid threats such as disinformation campaigns, active measures and cyberattacks, among others, should lead the EU to develop its strategic autonomy while strengthening cooperation with its allies; underlines the importance for the Union, in this respect, of establishing more strategic cooperation with third countries based on trust and mutual benefit, and of building alliances with like-minded democracies, including from the southern hemisphere, as well as ad hoc coalitions with other like-minded partners where necessary; C 456/66 EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2021 Wednesday 20 January 2021 ",

Expresses concerns at the unprecedented scale of state- and non-state-sponsored disinformation and propaganda campaigns, which have devastating effects on societies, including in the European neighbourhood and in particular in the Western Balkans; condemns the manipulation and weaponisation of information, including by state, sub-state and non-state actors with malign intentions, and platforms and organisations used by authoritarian third countries to directly and indirectly finance and influence Europe\u2019s political parties and actors; welcomes the much-needed response by the EU institutions to this new challenge, such as the setting up of a new special committee in Parliament focusing on foreign interference in democratic processes in the EU, including disinformation, and the adoption of the Council decision concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States ( 5 ); stresses the need for a response which does not limit fundamental rights and freedoms; points out the importance of effective EU strategic communication and commends the strengthening of Stratcom within the European External Action Service (EEAS) and its efforts to identify and supress disinformation campaigns; highlights the need for the EU to further strengthen its capacities to proactively combat fake news and disinformation as a threat to democracy, and to improve its security culture in order to better protect its information and communication networks; calls on the EU to become a frontrunner in advocating for a collective self-defence and cooperation framework against hybrid threats and the malign influence of authoritarian regimes in particular on democratic governance and private enterprises globally; stresses, therefore, the need for the EU to strengthen its alliances with other global democratic actors to confront such threats globally, including through reformed, more resilient multilateral institutions; 6. Insists that the EU\u2019s foreign and security policy must be guided by the promotion of the objectives outlined in Article 21 TEU, such as democracy, human dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of religion or belief, the protection of all minorities and of religious communities, including Christians, Jews, Muslims, non-believers and others, and the promotion of gender equality; welcomes in this respect the recent Commission decision to renew the mandate of the Special Envoy for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief outside the EU, but urges an appointment to be made as soon as possible; calls on EU delegations to closely monitor the global human rights situation, identify trends and support citizens and civil society organisations in their efforts to reverse negative human rights trends worldwide; stresses that the EU\u2019s foreign and security policy is made more effective through the use of conditionality in its economic and political incentives; recalls in this regard that the Commission should monitor and report regularly to Parliament on the human rights situation in the third countries which are beneficiaries of the visa waiver and should suspend this waver in the event of violations in the country concerned; calls on the Commission and the Council to strengthen the Union\u2019s democracy support programmes globally by fostering pro-democratic bottom-up processes and building institutional resilience, and by supporting the work of European political foundations in strengthening democratic processes; reiterates its call, made in its recommendation of 13 March 2019, for a reform and review of the EU Special Representatives and Special Envoys; 7. Underlines that the EU should address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, unemployment, instability and the lack of security in third countries in which illegal mass migration originates; stresses that the focus should also be on assisting the development of stable institutions to promote sustainable societal development in these states; 10.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 456/67 Wednesday 20 January 2021 ( 5 ) Council Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 of 17 May 2019 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States (OJ L 129 I, 17.5.2019, p. 13).

        "A new level of ambition for the CFSP: strategic regional approaches based on a stronger political will 8. Recalls that no EU Member State alone has sufficient capability and resources to effectively deal with current international challenges; considers that, in this context, the EU needs first and foremost a stronger and genuine political will on the part of the EU Member States to jointly agree on and push EU foreign policy goals such as conflict prevention and peace agreements and to counter third countries\u2019 attempts to weaken and divide the EU, including by undermining European values; stresses that only a strong and united European Union with established foreign, security and defence policies, and with EU Member States supporting the VP/HR in the implementation of agreed objectives, will be able to play a strong role in the new geopolitical environment; calls on the EU institutions and Member States to coordinate any actions in response to the COVID-19 crisis among themselves and with international partners in order to foster a coherent and inclusive global response to the pandemic and welcomes in this regard the Team Europe approach; 9. Reiterates its call for a revision of the EU Global Strategy in order to draw the lessons from the new geopolitical dynamics, current threats including the COVID-19 pandemic and expected upcoming challenges, and to reassess the goals and means of the CFSP; highlights that while further developing its cooperation with international partners and allies the EU has to speed up decision-making in foreign affairs and its ability to work with like-minded partners while strengthening multilateralism, and to strengthen its strategic capacities to act, also autonomously if needed; stresses that the EU has a responsibility to forge its strategic autonomy on common diplomacy, security, and defence issues as well as on economic, health and trade matters, in order to address the many common challenges to defending its interests, norms and values in the post-pandemic world; stresses, therefore, the need for European countries to retain the capacity to take decisions and to act alone; urges Member States to swiftly implement and apply the new regulation to establish mechanisms for screening foreign investments in critical sectors; encourages EU Member States to create a new forum for multilateral cooperation, drawing on the legacy of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Strategic Export Controls, to monitor and control the export of technologies, trade flows and sensitive investments to countries of concern; 10. Takes the view that there is still a large untapped potential in combining and integrating all strands of EU external action\u2019s hard and soft power to achieve CFSP goals; recalls in this respect that the European Parliament\u2019s diplomacy constitutes an important pillar of the EU\u2019s foreign policy, with its own distinct and complementary instruments and channels; believes that the European Parliament should therefore be recognised as an integral part of the \u2018Team Europe\u2019 approach promoted by the Commission and the EEAS); highlights in this respect the importance of Parliament\u2019s role in mediation and democracy support, as well as the valuable contribution of parliamentary assemblies to Europe\u2019s external action, also with regard to security and defence, and the need to promote their activities and ensure that their work is properly conducted; calls on the VP/HR and the Commission and Council presidents to continuously inform Parliament and involve it in the EU\u2019s external action; 11. Considers that the ambition of having an EU foreign and security policy that is robust, independent and fully developed also entails having a diplomatic body with the same characteristics, established from the outset as a specifically European body; in this connection, supports progress towards the creation of a European diplomatic academy with the remit of establishing an independent selection and training system for future EU diplomats, within the framework of a genuine European diplomatic career path; 12. Highlights that EU Treaty provisions on consulting and providing information to Parliament in the field of CFSP should translate into clear rules on sharing the relevant documents, including draft strategies, in a transparent and timely manner; points to the need to significantly improve the way in which the Commission and the EEAS currently forward sensitive or confidential information to Parliament; calls furthermore, for an examination of how the quality, scope and format of committee meetings and exchanges with the EEAS and the Commission can be improved; considers that the 2010 \u2018declaration on political accountability\u2019 is no longer an appropriate basis for relations between Parliament and the VP/HR and should be replaced by an interinstitutional agreement to enhance the democratic scrutiny rights of Parliament, in accordance with the Treaties; recalls, furthermore, that it has requested a review of the Council decision establishing the EEAS; 13. Regrets the lack of progress in improving the decision-making process on CFSP matters, which impacts the efficiency, speed and credibility of EU action and decision-making on the international scene; calls on the Member States to urgently open a debate on the possibility of moving from unanimity to qualified majority voting at least in selected areas of CFSP, such as decisions on human rights issues and sanctions, as a concrete means by which to strengthen the EU\u2019s influence on the global scene; C 456/68 EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2021 Wednesday 20 January 2021 ",

Emphasises the fact that the EU has committed to strengthening the role of the UN on the international stage and stresses, therefore, the need to reform the United Nations system, reinforcing the coherence of actions by all its agencies, organisations and programmes in order to ensure that the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals are achieved; calls, once again, on Member States to support reforms to the composition and operation of the Security Council to make it more effective and operational, vital in securing world peace, with an agenda that goes beyond military security and includes movements of refugees and displaced persons, food security, climate change and combating pandemics; 18.
