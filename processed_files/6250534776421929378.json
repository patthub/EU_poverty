        "EN 2 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL \u2022 Reasons for and objectives of the proposal With 180 million people who are considered 'water poor', the Mediterranean area is generally characterised by high levels of hydric stress. This is why the sustainable management of water provision and food systems in the area is so important. Climate change is increasingly causing severe water shortages in the area, with major impacts on agriculture. Most water available is used for irrigation. This means that such shortages result in decreasing and irregular crop yields, putting additional pressure on natural resources and on the capacity to provide clean water and affordable food for the region\u2019s inhabitants. This in turn has a negative effect on nutrition, health, livelihoods, standards of living and levels of wellbeing. This social and economic stress is a major cause of instability. It also contributes to migration, both internally, leading numerous farm families to move to cities and externally, driving part of the population to migrate, in particular to Europe. The unsustainable management of water provision and food systems in the Mediterranean area is due to a number of factors including political instability, climate change and the rapidly growing population. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of a set of common innovative solutions that are adapted to the realities of the region and are easily transferable across it. These solutions are not forthcoming because the overall level of research and innovation (R&I) investment in the Mediterranean is not commensurate with the size of the regional challenge. Investment levels also differ greatly from one country to another. Funding is not geared towards tackling the water and food problem and the relevant stakeholders \u2013 for instance, the private sector \u2013 do not always have sufficiently strong R&I capabilities. On top of all this, R&I collaboration efforts between Union Member States and Southern and Eastern Mediterranean countries are too fragmented (mostly governed by bilateral agreements) to have any significant impact. In this context and with regard to migration, the PRIMA Joint Programme initiative, led by Participating States from the Union and the Southern Mediterranean 1 , is particularly important and relevant. The initiative follows the approach of the new Migration Partnership for enhanced financial collaboration with Member States and other partners. It shows how research policy can bring about effective coordination by leveraging national budgets and bringing Mediterranean countries together to tackle long-term common problems. The programme\u2019s strategic objective is to develop the common innovative solutions for water provision and food systems that the Mediterranean region urgently needs. Achieving this strategic objective will make water provision and food systems more efficient, cost-effective and sustainable. In this way R&I could help solve bigger problems in relation to nutrition, 1 The PRIMA Joint Programme involves 19 countries: - 11 Member States: Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain; - 8 third countries: Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey. Of these, 14 countries (Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Egypt, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malta, Morocco, Portugal, Spain and Tunisia) have agreed to jointly undertake the PRIMA initiative.

        "EN 3 EN health and social wellbeing, and ultimately help address mass migration trends. R&I policies can thus be leveraged to the maximum to tackle the migration challenge, in line with the Communication from the Commission on establishing a new Partnership Framework with third countries under the European Agenda on Migration , (COM(2016)385). \u2022 Institutional background The process leading to the PRIMA Joint Programme started with the Euro-Mediterranean Conference on Science, Technology and Innovation in Barcelona in 2012. The aim is to strengthen Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in R&I as part of the broader objectives of the Union\u2019s external policy with regard to the Southern Neighbourhood. Several Council Presidencies have highlighted the need to set up a regional partnership to tackle major common challenges, including water availability and management, innovation and institutional coordination. The idea behind a regional partnership is to work on the basis of co-ownership, mutual interest and shared benefit in a long-lasting, structured framework. The Competitiveness Council of 5 December 2014 invited the Commission to assess whether the Union\u2019s participation in the PRIMA Joint Programme on the basis of Article 185 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) would be justified by the scope of the objectives and the extent of the resources required. In its Conclusions, the Council endorsed in particular the programme\u2019s focus on developing and implementing innovative, integrated solutions for the sustainable management of water provision and food systems in the Mediterranean area. The Council regarded this as a priority, in order to improve the health, wellbeing and sociocultural conditions of the populations of the Mediterranean area and boost economic growth. Consequently, in December 2014 Member States and third countries of the Mediterranean area submitted a proposal to the Commission to participate in the PRIMA Joint Programme. On the basis of the Competitiveness Council\u2019s Conclusions and after the formal submission of the proposal, Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation Carlos Moedas asked the Commission services to prepare an impact assessment of the available policy options, including an initiative based on the legal basis of Article 185 TFEU. \u2022 Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area The PRIMA Joint Programme fits into an institutional context which, at the highest political level, highlighted the need to strengthen Union cooperation with Southern Mediterranean countries in the key areas of water resources and food systems and related areas. PRIMA anchors key regional R&I challenges in broader socioeconomic and geopolitical objectives. It is intended to complement recent relevant institutional actions in Union policies other than R&I. These are listed below. a) Water diplomacy (Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions dated 22 July 2013) The effects of climate change and demographic and economic development, coupled with stress on water quality, availability and management are major security challenges likely to give rise to tension and conflicts over access to water. In this context, the Union plays an important role in supporting water diplomacy across the world and in transboundary waters in ",
        "EN 4 EN Europe \u2013 including by promoting water initiatives with countries in the EU neighbourhood and other countries identified in the EU water security mapping exercise. b) Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) (Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions dated 14 December 2015) The Council welcomed the Review of the ENP as a key political priority for the Union in the coming years. This includes the crucial role of R&I for socioeconomic development in the neighbourhood and helps neighbourhood countries modernise and diversify their economies by facilitating their participation in EU initiatives. c) Sustainable Development Goals (Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions dated 26 May 2015) Reference is made to Horizon 2020\u2019s commitment to supporting sustainable development, both within the Union and with international partners, as well as to the need to foster science, technology and innovation as part of the overall post-2015 approach to eradicating poverty and promoting sustainable development. d) Migration (Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions dated 12 October 2015 and 17-18 March 2016) These Council Conclusions acknowledge that the migration crisis within and beyond the EU neighbourhood is exacerbated by poverty, poor socioeconomic development and violations of human rights, and call for a strong EU external migration and asylum policy. The Council also renewed its commitment to mobilising all instruments and policies to address the root causes of migratory flows, mainly poor socioeconomic conditions and climate change. e) European climate diplomacy after COP21 (Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions dated 15 February 2016) In the overall context of climate diplomacy, the Council refers to the development of a climate diplomacy action plan, including efforts measures focusing on the nexus of climate change, natural resources (including water), prosperity, stability and migration. \u2022 Consistency with other Union policies The objectives are in line with the problem definition and cover the related R&I challenges, ensuring interaction with European, Mediterranean and global policies. In particular, PRIMA is consistent with the recent Communication from the Commission on establishing a new Partnership Framework with third countries under the European Agenda on Migration , (COM(2016)385). It focuses on tackling the root causes of migration and forced displacement through \u2018all EU policies including education, research, climate change, energy, environment, agriculture\u2019. It also advocates new development cooperation models involving the private sector, innovative financing mechanisms and investments in SMEs and sustainable infrastructures. Horizon 2020 has already identified \u2018Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials\u2019 and \u2018Food security, sustainable agriculture and forestry, marine, maritime and inland water research, and the bio-economy\u2019 as two of the priority societal challenges to be addressed by supporting R&I investments. It also recognises that R&I activities aimed at addressing these challenges should be carried out at EU level and beyond, given the ",
        "EN 5 EN transnational and global nature of climate and the environment, their scale and complexity and the international aspect of the food and agricultural supply chain. The R&I objectives related to water provision and food systems in the Mediterranean area appear to be consistent with and relevant to the following initiatives. \u2022 The Post-2015 Development Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. \u2022 The Barcelona Process launched in November 1995 at the initiative of the Euro- Mediterranean Foreign Ministers and the related Communication Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean (COM(2008)319), which set up a multilateral partnership, focusing on regional and transnational projects. \u2022 The Communication Enhancing and focusing EU international cooperation in research and innovation: A strategic approach (COM(2012)497), which establishes a focus on fostering integration into \u2013 or alignment with \u2013 the European Research Area (ERA) for the neighbourhood. 2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY \u2022 Legal basis The proposal for the PRIMA Programme is based on Article 185 TFEU. This instrument allows the EU, in implementing the multiannual framework programme, to make provision for participation in research and development programmes run by several Member States, in agreement with the Member States concerned, including participation in the structures created for the execution of those programmes. \u2022 Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) PRIMA is a joint programme based on and composed of national programmes run and activities carried out by the participating Member States and Associated Countries, with the support and participation of the EU. The Commission\u2019s proposal for Horizon 2020 makes provision for the EU\u2019s participation in PRIMA under Article 185 TFEU. It is the appropriate instrument for the EU to support the initiative since it makes both the coordination of national research programmes and the EU\u2019s participation in the joint programme possible. The national, bilateral and transnational programmes that have been used so far to improve R&I in water provision and food systems have not proved sufficient to tackle cross-border issues and attract further public and private investments. On top of that, the challenges of water provision and food systems in the Mediterranean area are complex, interrelated, transnational and multi-sectorial. They require transdisciplinary research and integrated solutions that include innovation. Other factors, such as the social behaviour of rural communities, economic constraints, or the stability of the legal and institutional frameworks, may also be conducive to the adoption of the most appropriate measures. One country alone would hardly be able to cope with such complexity. ",
        "EN 6 EN The experience of similar Article 185 initiatives shows that action at Union level can produce a well-coordinated and integrated programme by: a) Attaining the scale and scope needed and getting a critical mass of resources b) Stimulating leverage effects and having impacts on and implications for the EU\u2019s external policies and migration c) Contributing to global cooperation and the Southern European Neighbourhood \u2022 Proportionality The proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives. Union participation in PRIMA will take place within the limits of the competence provided under the TFEU and will only facilitate and support, including financially, the fulfilment of PRIMA's objectives by the participating states. The participating states will have to work together to better coordinate, align and integrate the relevant national programmes or activities, and ultimately develop a common long-term strategic research agenda. Please refer also to the impact assessment report, section 6.5. \u2022 Choice of instrument The conclusions of the stakeholder consultation activities and the analysis and comparison of the options in the impact assessment have shown that Article 185 TFEU is the most appropriate way to achieve the objectives of PRIMA. Article 185 TFEU is also the choice of the participating states. An Article 185 TFEU initiative is the most efficient and effective mode of intervention to achieve PRIMA\u2019s strategic and specific objectives. An Article 185 TFEU initiative is likely to have the highest overall leverage effect in comparison to other instruments in a stable, long- term and integrated manner. An Article 185 TFEU would further enable the development of a more equal relationship with neighbourhood countries. The Union and the countries concerned will determine together their mutual priorities, entering a new phase of cooperation, in line with the priorities of the European Neighbourhood Policy. 3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS \u2022 Stakeholder consultations Two main consultation activities were organised as part of the PRIMA impact assessment: \u2022 a 12-week online public consultation, from 1 February to 24 April 2016; \u2022 a stakeholder event in Malta on 17 March 2016. Different European and southern Mediterranean stakeholders from research, academia, industry and civil society gave their views. The preparation of the proposal has taken full account of the many contributions and inputs received. The consulted stakeholders were largely in favour of an Article 185 option. ",
        "EN 7 EN \u2022 Collection and use of expertise A group of external experts (the PRIMA Expert Group) from Mediterranean and non- Mediterranean Member States and third countries, was set up to support the impact assessment exercise. The Group\u2019s findings were compared with findings from other sources (for example a literature review carried out by Commission services, results of the online public consultation) and taken into account in the impact assessment. \u2022 Impact assessment Different possible policy options were identified during the impact assessment, differing in terms of scope, geographical coverage and the type of instrument used. All these options were screened using Tool #14 of the Better Regulation Toolbox. On that basis, the following policy options have been retained. \u2022 Option 0: No policy change - Baseline scenario - Horizon 2020 will continue providing support for water and food issues in general on an ad hoc basis. It is unlikely that dedicated initiatives aimed at integrating Mediterranean R&I systems will be launched. Individual actions would typically last three to four years, with limited impact. \u2022 Option 1: ERA-NET Cofund action \u2013 The main activity under Horizon 2020 is the implementation of a single co-funded joint call for proposals for each action, resulting in the funding of transnational research and/or innovation projects. Individual actions would typically last five years. This option would consist of a series of ERA- NET Cofund actions, limited to the remainder of Horizon 2020. It would not allow to address substantially the innovation dimension, since the national programmes that would collaborate and coordinate their activities mainly focus on the research activities of public research organisations. Option 1 is not expected to integrate national funding programmes into a common strategic research agenda. \u2022 Option 2: PRIMA Joint Programme based on Article 185 TFEU \u2013 This enables the EU to make provisions for its participation in research and development programmes run by several Member States, including its participation in the structures created for the implementation of those programmes. Article 26 of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme Regulation specifies the conditions and criteria for identifying and proposing an initiative pursuant to Article 185 TFEU. Among other criteria, the Commission may only propose Article 185 initiatives if there is a need for a dedicated implementation structure and participating states have expressed a high level of commitment to a closer integration at scientific, management and financial level. This option involves coming up with a comprehensive strategic research agenda and its complete implementation through multiple transnational calls for proposals, undertaken by several Participating States and implemented through a dedicated implementation structure (hereinafter referred to as DIS funding body). This is typically a long-term commitment (ten years). The Union would provide financial support by matching national investments. This option is the best one for achieving the specific and general objectives and implementing a number of pilots and demonstrators in strategically important areas related to water provision and food systems. It takes full account of all the lessons learned \u2013 with respect to the management of the Union financial contribution, the achievement of impacts, etc. \u2013 from implementing past and ongoing Article 185 initiatives. It is also designed to ensure sound ",
        "EN 8 EN financial management and protect the financial interests of the Union through adequate ex- ante checks, financial reporting and ex-post verification. Taking into account their likely impacts, these options were compared with each other using the baseline scenario as the reference point and applying the following criteria. \u2022 effectiveness: the proposed options should improve the R&I framework in the Mediterranean area in the fields of water provision and food systems. \u2022 efficiency: the proposed options should achieve the impacts with the greatest cost/benefit ratio. \u2022 consistency with other policies: the proposed options should be consistent with other EU and national R&I policies and programmes and with international coordination and cooperation policies. Previous and ongoing Article 185 TFEU initiatives show that such an initiative is likely to have a high leverage effect on national public funds in a stable, long-term and integrated manner, helping to: \u2022 deliver the desired structuring effect on national R&I policies and programmes and to integrate them; \u2022 enable the formulation of stable, long-term, common strategic research agendas with the adequate scale and scope of actions; \u2022 support the alignment of national R&I programmes; \u2022 enable the involvement of partner countries on an equal footing; \u2022 enable the structural involvement of different types of stakeholders, both public and private, bringing together and leveraging their respective knowledge and financial resources; \u2022 strengthen R&I capabilities in a lasting manner. \u2022 Fundamental rights The initiative is consistent with Article 37 on Environmental protection of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU: \u2018A high level of environmental protection and the improvement of the quality of the environment must be integrated into the policies of the Union and ensured in accordance with the principle of sustainable development\u2019. 4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The Legislative Financial Statement accompanying this decision sets out the indicative budgetary implications. The EU contribution shall be up to EUR 200 million including the EFTA contribution. The envelope is in current prices. The EU contribution shall be made as ",
        "EN 9 EN part of the implementation of Horizon 2020 \u2013 the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. \u2022 From DG Agriculture and Rural Development: \u2013 Societal Challenge 2 \u2018Research and innovation related to agriculture \u2013 Securing sufficient supplies of safe and high quality food\u2019. \u2022 From DG R&I: \u2013 Societal Challenge 2 \u2018Food Security, Sustainable Agriculture and Forestry, Marine, Maritime and Inland Water Research and the Bio-economy\u2019; \u2013 Societal Challenge 5 \u2018Climate Action, Environment, Resource Efficiency and Raw Materials\u2019; \u2013 Industrial Leadership. The maximum amount of the EU contribution to administrative costs is up to 5%. This corresponds to EUR 10 million. The EU contribution will be managed by the Prima Implementation Structure PRIMA-IS (indirect management of EU funds). Before the delegation of management and transfer of funds the PRIMA-IS will be subject to an ex-ante assessment in accordance with the requirements set out in Article 61 of the Financial Regulation, in order to assess its capacity to implement the programme, including receiving, allocating and monitoring the EU's financial contribution in the framework of indirect management of the EU budget. The provision of the Decision and of the delegation agreement to be concluded between the Commission and the dedicated implementation structure ensure that the EU financial interests are protected. The risk of non-recovery is covered by the financial guarantees that the Participating States will have to provide in due time and at the latest before the signature of the delegation agreement. The Participating States and the EU make up-front commitments to contribute to PRIMA. The EU's commitment of \u20ac200 million from the current Multiannual Financial Framework will be mainly used to finance indirect actions resulting from calls launched by the PRIMA-IS. This will cover a series of seven Annual Work Plans (2018 \u2013 2024), with the last commitment from the Commission being made in 2020 that will be used for the funding of projects resulting from the calls in the years 2020 \u2013 2024. The Participating States will describe in the Annual Work Plan their activities funded from national programmes and the respective budgets allocated to these activities. Participating States have been made aware of the need to provide substantial commitments already in the first years of programme implementation and front- load the initiative to balance the strong up-front commitment from the Union budget. The EU contribution to each Annual Work Plan will not exceed the commitment of the participating states to it. This ensures that there is a balance with at least matching contributions of EU funding and Participating States. This allows a mechanism to reduce the EU commitment if participating states fail to commit as expected. Furthermore, an assessment by the Commission of Participating States commitments undertaken through the first two annual work plans has been foreseen in the legislative proposal as a condition for the EU financial contribution. Following this evaluation, the maximum EU contribution may be reviewed in accordance with the applicable safeguards ",
        "EN 10 EN regarding termination, reduction or suspension of the EU financial contribution, which set out that \" If the Participating States do not contribute, contribute partially or late to the financing of PRIMA the Commission may terminate, proportionally reduce or suspend the Union\u2019s financial contribution, taking into account the amount of funding allocated by the Participating States to implement PRIMA .\" 5. OTHER ELEMENTS \u2022 Annual Work Plans, monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements The PRIMA Annual Work Plans (AWP) will ensure consistency and coordination between all activities and their orientation towards the achievement of the operational, specific and general objectives of PRIMA. The AWP, which is subject to approval by the Commission, will include: - Transnational calls for proposals to be funded by the PRIMA-IS with EU contribution, in accordance with the Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation; - Activities only funded by the Participating States, and counting for the matching with the Union contribution under certain conditions. In particular, these activities will be included in the AWP after positive external evaluation by international peer review with regard to the objectives of the PRIMA Joint Programme. They will be implemented in compliance with common principles, to be agreed by the Participating States and the Commission. These activities will include calls between Participating States' programmes for transnational projects, organised by the PRIMA-IS (including proposal evaluations). Activities should increasingly address also the higher Technology Readiness Levels, as defined in the General Annexes to the Horizon 2020 Work Programmes 2 . The annual reporting of the PRIMA-IS will cover both strands. This allows close monitoring by the Commission services and facilitates taking corrective measures, if necessary, in particular reducing EU commitments to individual Annual Work Plans if the implementation of the activities by Participating States does not maintain the necessary level of commitment to match the one of the EU. The Directorate-General for Research and Innovation has adopted standard supervision arrangements for Article 185 TFEU initiatives. These arrangements will also apply to the PRIMA Joint Programme. Their effectiveness should be evaluated at both programme level (focusing on whether the overall objectives have been achieved) and national level (focusing on the goals of individual countries). The responsibilities of the Commission services and those of the PRIMA-IS and the Participating States with regard to monitoring and audit mechanisms are clearly differentiated in the basic act. They will be further developed in the delegation agreement between the Commission and the PRIMA-IS. An interim and a final independent evaluation are envisaged. The Commission will also ensure that all actions taken and supported as part of the initiative respect the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. 2 European Commission Decision C(2016)4614 of 25 July 2016 ",
        "EN 11 EN \u2022 Derogations from the Horizon 2020 Rules on Participation The approach chosen for the Article 185 PRIMA option requires only limited derogations from the Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation. To ensure balanced core participation in indirect actions in a north-south configuration, as a derogation from point (b) of Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013, the minimum number of participants should be three legal entities established in three different Participating States, one of which is established in a Member State or in a country associated to Horizon 2020 and one in a third country, associated or not to Horizon 2020. Derogation from Article 9(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 is necessary to ensure that the minimum eligibility conditions for participation in indirect actions with a minimum condition of the participation of one legal entity are not discriminatory for entities established in third countries participating in PRIMA as Participating States. This would only apply in the exceptional case that calls for proposals in the annual work plan include mono-beneficiary actions, and subject to the approval of the Commission. Derogations from Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 are necessary to broaden cooperation through joint calls launched by the PRIMA Implementation Structure with legal entities other than third countries and international organisations.

Moreover, Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 recognises that research and innovation activities for these challenges should be carried out at the Union level and beyond, given the transnational and global nature of the climate and the environment, their scale and complexity, and the international dimension of the food and agricultural supply chain. (5) Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 acknowledges that international cooperation with third countries is necessary to address effectively common challenges. International cooperation in research and innovation is a key aspect of the Union\u2019s global commitments and has an important role to play in the Union\u2019s partnership with neighbourhood countries. This cooperation follows the approach taken in the European neighbourhood policy to differentiate the level of cooperation with each country in the neighbourhood based on their commitment towards the Union. (6) In its Communication of 7 June 2016 on establishing a new Partnership Framework with third countries under the European Agenda on Migration, the Commission emphasised the need to call upon all policies, including research and innovation, to address the root causes of migration through a new cooperation model involving private investors, leveraging limited budget resources, and focusing on SMEs and sustainable infrastructure. (7) On 23 December 2014, a group of 19 countries of the Mediterranean Area submitted to the Commission a proposal for a Joint Programme initiative 'Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area' (PRIMA). Among these countries, 14 countries have agreed to jointly undertake the PRIMA initiative by committing financial contributions: Cyprus, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal and Spain, Member States of the Union; Israel and Tunisia, third countries associated to Horizon 2020; Egypt, Lebanon and Morocco, third countries not associated to Horizon 2020. (8) PRIMA aims at implementing a joint programme for the development and the adoption of innovative and integrated solutions for improving the efficiency, safety, security and sustainability of food production and water provision in the Mediterranean area. PRIMA should contribute to the achievement of the recently- agreed Sustainable Development Goals and to the forthcoming European Sustainable Development Strategy. (9) For ensuring participation of the third countries not associated to Horizon 2020 in PRIMA, namely Egypt, Lebanon and Morocco, international agreements between the Union and these third countries should be required in order to extend to them the legal regime established by this Decision. (10) In line with the objectives of Horizon 2020, any other Member State and third country associated to Horizon 2020 should be entitled to participate in PRIMA if it commits to contribute to the financing of PRIMA. ",

Its participation should also be provided for by the relevant international agreement between such third country and the Union. (12) In order to ensure the joint implementation of PRIMA, an implementation structure should be set up ('PRIMA-IS'). The PRIMA-IS should be the recipient of the Union\u2019s financial contribution and it should ensure the efficient implementation of PRIMA. (13) The Union\u2019s financial contribution should be subject to formal commitments from the Participating States to contribute to the financing of PRIMA and to the fulfilment of those commitments in accordance with the terms of this Decision. Flexibility should be provided to the Participating States to optionally contribute financially to the PRIMA-IS in view of funding indirect actions, thus achieving a high degree of financial integration. Furthermore, Participating States should contribute financially or in kind to activities implemented without Union contribution. The period during which the Participating States have to provide their contribution should be clearly defined. (14) A ceiling should be established for the Union\u2019s contribution in PRIMA with funding from Horizon 2020. Within that ceiling, the Union contribution should be equal to the contribution of the Participating States to PRIMA in order to achieve a high leverage effect and ensure a stronger integration of the Participating States' programmes. It should be possible to use a limited part of the Union contribution to cover administrative costs of the PRIMA-IS. (15) In order to avoid a prolonged implementation of PRIMA, a deadline should be fixed for the launch of the last activities, including the last calls for proposals.

(21) Participation in indirect actions funded by the PRIMA-IS is subject to Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 . However, due to the specific operating needs of PRIMA, it is necessary to provide for derogations in accordance with Article 1(3) of that Regulation. (22) Derogations from point (b) of Article 9(1) and from Article 9(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 are necessary in order to account for the specificities resulting from the geographical scope of PRIMA, by further adjusting the minimum eligibility conditions for participation in indirect actions. In order to ensure balanced core participation in indirect actions under a north-south configuration, as a derogation from point (b) of Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013, the minimum number of participants should be three legal entities established in three different Participating States of which one is established in a Member State or in a country associated to Horizon 2020, and one is established in a third country, associated or not to Horizon 2020. Derogation from Article 9(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 is necessary in order to ensure that the minimum eligibility conditions for participation in indirect actions are not discriminatory for entities established in third countries participating in PRIMA as Participating States. In order to ensure that funding conditions are not discriminatory for entities established in third countries participating in PRIMA as Participating States, it should be provided for that legal entities established in the Participating States are eligible for funding in addition to entities referred to in Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013. Derogations from Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 are necessary in order to allow broadening cooperation through joint calls launched by the PRIMA-IS with legal entities other than third countries and international organisations. (23) For the purpose of simplification, administrative burden should be reduced for all parties. Double audits and disproportionate documentation and reporting should be avoided. When audits are conducted, the specificities of the national programmes should be taken into account, as appropriate. (24) Audits of recipients of Union funds provided in accordance with this Decision should ensure a reduction of administrative burden, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013.

(28) The objective of this Decision is to strengthen the integration and alignment of research and innovation systems and activities in the Mediterranean countries in the fields of water provision and food systems. The scale of the research and innovation necessary to address the challenges in the Mediterranean area is immense due to the systemic character of the major bottlenecks. The scope of research and innovation is complex, multidisciplinary and requires a multi-actor and cross-border approach. A collaborative approach with a wide set of Participating States can help to increase the required scale and scope, by pooling financial and intellectual resources. Since the objective can therefore be better achieved at Union level by integrating national efforts into a consistent Union approach, by bringing together compartmentalised national research programmes, by helping design common research and funding strategies across national borders, and by achieving the critical mass of actors and investments required, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

Grounds for the proposal/initiative 1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term PRIMA will combine EU and national resources to develop, in a structured way, a durable framework for research and innovation in the field of water provision and food systems in the Mediterranean area. Please refer to the PRIMA Impact Assessment Report, accompanying the legislative proposal, for more information. 1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement The initiative is in line with the new Partnership Framework with third countries under the European Agenda on Migration as it addresses some of the root causes of migration; is clearly situated at the interchange between research, climate change, environment and agriculture policies; and exemplifies the new development cooperation model championed by the new Partnership Framework insofar as it involves private investors, leverages limited budget resources, and focuses on SMEs and sustainable infrastructure. Only action at EU level is capable of achieving a well-coordinated and integrated programme reaching the needed scale, scope and critical mass to deliver on the specific and general objectives. Action at EU level is characterised by a strong leverage effect as it mobilises significant additional public and private investment. It also generates impacts that go beyond R&I policy and solutions, thus supporting the EU's external policies and efforts to address the root causes of migration. The involvement of the EU in PRIMA is also likely to strengthen Europe's visibility and global responsibility, in the spirit of the EU Neighbourhood Policy, which encourages differentiation and greater mutual ownership with neighbourhood partners. 1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past PRIMA is designed to operate as an Art. 185 initiative, i.e. a multiannual joint programming undertaken by the PS, with EU participation. The experience from past and on-going initiatives from FP6 to Horizon 2020 shows positive effects, in particular on: - long-term scientific, managerial and financial integration of national and European efforts on common challenges with clear up-front financial and political ",

Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments PRIMA will contribute to a number of flagship initiatives, in particular to the sustainability policy: A resource-efficient Europe Flagship initiative, European Neighbourhood Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development. PRIMA is also relevant to a number of external policies, in particular the Partnership framework with third countries under the European Agenda on migration and Post-2015 Development Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.

The PRIMA-IS will be subject to an ex-ante assessment in accordance with the requirements set out in Article 61 of the Financial Regulation before the delegation agreement is signed. The PRIMA-IS provides comprehensive annual reporting including auditor opinions and a management declaration and is responsible for the ex-ante control of expenditure of all indirect actions funded by the PRIMA-IS. Furthermore, as required by the Financial Regulation, the Participating States will have to provide adequate financial guarantees in due time and at the latest before signature of the Delegation Agreement by the Commission. The Participating States will determine the costs of their activities in accordance with the usual accounting practices and accounting standards of the concerned Participating States and with applicable International Accounting Standards/International Financial Reporting Standards. These include audit certificates and a management declaration. The Commission is observer in the decision-making body of the PRIMA-IS and verifies and approves the Annual Work Plan (AWP) and related budget plans by Commission decision and the annual reporting. If the accounts cannot be accepted then follow-up action will be taken in order to mitigate any financial and reputational risks to the Commission. Where necessary, payments to the PRIMA-IS will be suspended and/or recovered, if necessary by drawing on the financial guarantees provided by the Participating States. If all of the above steps are inadequate to protect the financial interests of the Union or to ensure that policy objectives are properly achieved then, after due consideration, an audit of the PRIMA-IS may be performed. Furthermore, the Commission may decide if necessary to suspend the implementation or terminate the Delegation Agreement. Implementation of PRIMA will be monitored through annual reports.
