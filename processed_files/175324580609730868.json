INTRODUCTION 1. On 30 May 2018 the Commission adopted the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Rights and Values programme for the period 2021-2027 1 . It is one of the proposals related to the Multiannual Financial Framework (hereinafter: MFF), part of the Justice, Rights and Values Fund' fund. 1 Doc. 9605/18 + ADD 1; 9605/1/18 REV 1 ",
        "15347/18 PN/hm 2 JAI.A EN 2. The Rights and Values Programme aims at protecting and promoting rights and values enshrined in the EU Treaties in order to sustain open, democratic and inclusive societies. It has three specific objectives: (i) to promote equality and rights (gender equality, anti- discrimination, rights of children), (ii) to promote citizens engagement and participation in the democratic life of the Union (Citizens' engagement and participation strand) and (iii) to fight violence, notably against children and women (Daphne strand). As part of the new Justice, Rights and Values Fund (947 million EUR), the Commission proposes to allocate 642 million EUR for the Rights and Values Programme (which is roughly equivalent to the previous period budget allocation). 3. In the European Parliament, Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) is the lead committee and Ms Bodil VALERO, Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has been appointed as the rapporteur for the file. The draft report was voted at committee level on 10 December 2018. 4. The European Economic and Social Committee adopted its opinion on 18 October 2018. II. WORK WITHIN THE COUNCIL 5. The Commission presented the proposal and its impact assessment to the Ad Hoc Working Party on JHA Financial instruments in September 2018. 6. The examination of the proposal started in October 2018 and since then the proposal has been intensively discussed in a number of meetings, on the basis of several Presidency compromise texts 2 . Delegations broadly welcomed the Commission's proposal but raised a number of questions and requested further details, clarifications and concerns which were subsequently addressed by the Presidency compromise texts. 2 Docs, 13607/18 + REV1 + REV2 ",
        "15347/18 PN/hm 3 JAI.A EN 7. Based on the progress achieved at Working Party level and following the written consultation after the last Working Party meeting on 5 December 2018, the Presidency noted that there is sufficient support for the text as annexed to this note. Therefore, the Presidency will propose to adopt a partial general approach at the COREPER meeting on 19 December 2018. 8. The text of the partial general approach is included in the Annex to this note. Since the proposed Regulation is one of the package of proposals linked to the MFF, all provisions with budgetary implications or of horizontal nature have been set aside pending further progress on the MFF. These provisions, which appear in square brackets, are the following: - Article 6(1) and amounts mentioned in Article 6(2) relating to the budget; - Article 7 and recital 26 relating to third countries associated to the Programme; - Article 8(3) relating to contributions to a mutual insurance mechanism; - (Partly) Article 11(1) relating to the cumulative financing; - Article 17 and recital 25 relating to the protection of the financial interests of the Union - Recital 27 relating to horizontal financial rules adopted on the basis of Article 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the protection of the Union's budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States; - Recital 29 relating to climate-related spending targets. III. CONCLUSION 9. In the light of the above, the Presidency considers that the current text is a solid and balanced basis for reaching a partial mandate for negotiations with the European Parliament. The Coreper is therefore invited to adopt the partial negotiation mandate at its meeting of 19 December 2018. _________________________ ",

        "15347/18 PN/hm 5 ANNEX JAI.A EN Whereas: (1) In accordance with Article 2 of the Treaty of the European Union, \u2018the Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom democracy, equality, the rule of law and the respect for human rights, including the rights of the persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society where pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail\u2019. Article 3 further specifies that the \u2018Union\u2019s a im is to promote peace, its values and the well- being of its people and, among others, \u2018it shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, and shall ensure that Europe\u2019s cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced\u2019. Those values are further rea ffirmed and articulated in the rights, freedoms and principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. (2) Those rights and values must continue to be promoted and enforced and shared among the citizens and peoples and be at the heart of the EU project. Therefore , a new Justice, Rights and Values Fund, comprising the Citizens, Rights and Values and the Justice programmes shall be created in the EU budget. At a time where European societies are confronted with extremism, radicalism and divisions, it is more important than ever to promote, strengthen and defend justice, rights and EU values: human rights, respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law. This will have profound and direct implications for political, social, cultural and economic life in the EU. As part of the new Fund, the Justice Programme will continue to support the further development of Union area of justice and cross-border cooperation. The Citizens , Rights and Values Programme will bring together the 2014-2020 Programme Rights, Equality and Citizenship established by Regulation (EU) No 1381/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 and the Europe for Citizens programme established by Council Regulation (EU) No 390/2014 2 , (hereafter 'the predecessor Programmes'). 1 Regulation (EU) No 1381/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme for the period 2014 to 2020 ( OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 62) 2 Council Regulation (EU) No 390/2014 of 14 A pril 2014 establishing the \u2018Europe for Citizens\u2019 programme for the period 2014 -2020 (OJ L 115, 17.4.2014, p.3) ",
        "15347/18 PN/hm 6 ANNEX JAI.A EN (3) The Justice, Rights and Values Fund and its two underlying funding programmes will focus primarily on persons and entities, which contribute to make our common values, rights and rich diversity alive and vibrant. The ultimate objective is to nurture and sustain a rights-based, equal, inclusive, open, pluralist and democratic society. That includes a vibrant civil society, encouraging democratic, civic and social participation and fostering the rich diversity of European society, based on our common history and memory. Article 11 of the Treaty of the European Union further specifies that the institutions of the Union shall, by appropriate means, give citizens and representative associations the opportunity to make known and publicly exchange their views in all areas of Union action. (4) The Citizens, Rights and Values programme (the 'Programme') should allow developing synergies to tackle the challenges that are common to the promotion and protection of our common values and to reach a critical dimension to have concrete results in the field. That should be achieved by building on the positive experience of the predecessor Programmes. This will enable to fully exploit the potential of synergies, to more effectively support the policy areas covered and to increase their potential to reach persons and civil society. To be effective, the Programme should take into account the specific nature of the different policies, their different target groups and their particular needs through tailor-made approaches. (5) In order to bring the European Union closer to its citizens, a variety of actions and coordinated efforts are necessary. Bringing together citizens in town-twinning projects or networks of towns and supporting civil society organisations in the areas covered by the programme will contribute to increase citizens' engagement in society and ultimately their involvement in the democratic life of the Union. At the same time supporting activities promoting mutual understanding, diversity, dialogue and respect for others fosters a sense of belonging and a European identity, based on a shared understanding of our common European values, culture, history and heritage. The promotion of a greater sense of belonging to the Union and of Union values is particularly important amongst citizens of the EU outermost regions due to their remoteness and distance from continental Europe. ",
        "15347/18 PN/hm 7 ANNEX JAI.A EN (6) Remembrance activities and critical reflection on Europe\u2019s historical memory are necessary to make citizens aware of the common history, as the foundation for shared values and a common future. Remembrance activities should reflect on the causes of totalitarian regimes in Europe's modern history \u2013 in particular Nazism which led to the Holocaust, Fascism, Stalinism and totalitarian communist regimes \u2013 and commemorate the victims of their crimes. They should as well encompass activities concerning other defining moments and reference points in recent European history. The relevance of historical, cultural and intercultural aspects should also be taken into account, as well as the links between remembrance and the creation of a European identity and sense of belonging together. (7) Citizens should also be more aware of their rights deriving from citizenship of the Union, and should feel at ease about living, travelling, studying, working and volunteering in another Member State, and should feel able to enjoy and exercise all their citizenship rights, place their trust in equal access, full enforceability and protection of their rights without any discrimination, no matter where in the Union they happen to be. Civil society, needs to be supported for the promotion, safeguarding and raising awareness of common European values under Article 2 TEU and in contributing to the effective enjoyment of rights under Union law. European Citizenship and European identity should be developed and advanced by encouraging citizens\u2019 understanding of the policymaking process and by promoting civic engagement in the actions of the Union. ",
        "15347/18 PN/hm 8 ANNEX JAI.A EN (8) Gender equality is a fundamental value and an objective of the European Union. Discrimination against and unequal treatment of women violates their fundamental rights and prevents their full political, social and economic participation in society. In addition, the existence of structural and cultural barriers hinders the achievement of real gender equality. The promotion of gender equality and gender mainstreaming, in all activities of the Union is therefore a core task for the Union and a driver for economic growth and social development, and should be supported by the programme. Particular focus should be put on work-life balance and on equal sharing of unpaid household and care work for children, the elderly and other dependants, between men and women which remain pillars to the equal economic independence and are intrinsically related to the achievement of equality between women and men. (9) Gender-based violence and violence against women, children, young persons and persons with disabilities constitute a serious violation of fundamental rights. Violence persists throughout the Union, in all social and economic contexts, and has serious repercussions on victims\u2019 physical and psychological health and on society as a whole. Women, children, young persons, persons with disabilities and particularly affected groups including gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons) are at risk of being subjected to violence, particularly in family and intimate relationships. Action should be taken to promote their rights, in particular, rights of, children (including children orphans, children orphaned of domestic crimes and other particularly vulnerable groups of children) \u2013 and to contribute to their protection from harm and all forms of violence, which pose a danger to their physical and mental health, and constitute a breach of their rights to development, protection and dignity. Combatting violence against women, who are among the most significantly affected persons of violence and harassment in both the domestic and public sphere, is a key action in promoting gender equality. Combating all forms of violence, promoting prevention and protecting and supporting victims, are priorities of the Union which help fulfil individuals\u2019 fundamental rights and contribute to gender equa lity. Those priorities should be supported by the Programme. ",
        "15347/18 PN/hm 9 ANNEX JAI.A EN (10) Strong political will and coordinated action based on the methods and results of the previous Daphne Programmes, the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme and the Justice Programme are necessary in order to prevent and combat all forms of violence and to protect victims. In particular, since its launch in 1997, the Daphne funding to support victims of violence and combat the violence against women, children and young persons has been a genuine success, both in terms of its popularity with stakeholders (public authorities, academic institutions and non-governmental organisations) and in terms of the effectiveness of the funded projects. It has funded projects to raise awareness, to provide support services to victims, to support the activities of civil society organisations working on the ground. It has addressed all forms of violence, such as for instance domestic violence, sexual violence, trafficking in human beings, as well as new emerging forms of violence such as digital violence. It is therefore important to continue all these actions and that those results and lessons learned are taken into due consideration in the implementation of the Programme. ",
        "15347/18 PN/hm 10 ANNEX JAI.A EN (11) Non-discrimination is a fundamental principle of the Union. Article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides for action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Non- discrimination is also enshrined in Article 21 of the Charter. The specific features of the diverse forms of discrimination should be taken into account and appropriate action should be developed in parallel to prevent and combat discrimination on one or more grounds. The Programme should support actions to prevent and combat all forms of discrimination, racism, xenophobia, anti-semitism, anti-muslim hatred and other forms of intolerance including homophobia, biphobia, transphobia and interphobia and other forms of intolerance based on gender identity. In that context, particular attention should also be devoted to preventing and combating all forms of violence, hatred, segregation and stigmatisation, as well as combating bullying, harassment and intolerant treatment, including online. The Programme should be implemented in a mutually reinforcing manner with other Union activities that have the same objectives, in particular with those referred to in the Commission Communication of 5 April 2011 entitled \u2018An EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 1 \u2019 and in the Council Recommendation of 09 December 2013 on effective Roma integration measures in the Member States 2 . (12) Social and environmental barriers as well as lack of accessibility hinder the full and effective participation of persons with disabilities in society, on an equal basis with others. Persons with disabilities face barriers to, among other things, access the labour market, benefit from an inclusive and quality education, avoid poverty and social exclusion, enjoy access to cultural initiatives and media, or use their political rights. As a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the UNCRPD), the Union and all its Member States have committed to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities. The provisions of the UNCRPD have become an integral part of the Union legal order. 1 COM(2011)173. 2 OJ C 378, 24.12.2013, p. 1. ",
        "15347/18 PN/hm 11 ANNEX JAI.A EN (13) The right to respect for one\u2019s private and fa mily life, home and communications (right to privacy) is a fundamental right enshrined in Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The protection of personal data is a fundamental right enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data is subject to the control by independent supervisory authorities. The Unions\u2019 legal framework, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 and Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council 2 lay down provisions to ensure that the right to protection of personal data is effectively protected. These legal instruments entrust the national data protection supervisory authorities with the task of promoting public awareness and understanding of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data. The Union should be able to conduct awareness-raising activities, carry out studies and other relevant activities given the importance of the right to the protection of personal data in times of rapid technological developments. (14) Article 24 TFEU obliges the European Parliament and the Council to adopt provisions for the procedures and conditions required for a citizen's initiative within the meaning of Article 11 of the Treaty on European Union. This has been done by adopting Regulation [(EU) No 211/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 3 ]. The Programme should support the financing of technical and organisational support to implement Regulation [(EU) No 211/2011], thereby underpinning the exercise by citizens of the right to launch and support European citizens\u2019 initiatives. 1 OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1-88. 2 OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 89-131. 3 Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on the citizens\u2019 initiative (OJ L 65, 11.3.2011, p. 1). ",
        "15347/18 PN/hm 12 ANNEX JAI.A EN (15) Pursuant to Articles 8 and 10 TFEU, the Programme in all its activities should support gender mainstreaming and the mainstreaming of non-discrimination objectives. (16) Article 3(3) TEU requires the Union to promote the protection of the rights of the child, in line with Article 24 of the Charter and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. ",
        "15347/18 PN/hm 13 ANNEX JAI.A EN (17) In accordance with Union acts on equal treatment, Member States set up independent bodies for the promotion of equal treatment, commonly known as \"equality bodies\", in order to combat discrimination based on race and ethnic origin as well as gender. However, many Member States have gone beyond these requirements and ensured that equality bodies can also deal with discrimination based on the other grounds such as age, sex characteristics, gender identity and gender diversity, sexual orientation, religion and belief, disability or other grounds. Equality bodies play a key role in promoting equality and ensuring effective application of equal treatment legislation by providing in particular an independent assistance to victims of discrimination, conducting independent surveys concerning discrimination, publishing independent reports and making recommendations on any issue relating to discrimination in their country. It is essential that the work of equality bodies is coordinated at Union level in this respect. EQUINET was created in 2007. Its members are the national bodies for the promotion of equal treatment as established by Council Directives 2000/43/EC 1 and 2004/113/EC 2 , and by Directives 2006/54/EC 3 and 2010/41/EU 4 of the European Parliament and of the Council. EQUINET is in an exceptional situation, being the only entity which ensures coordination of activities between equality bodies. This coordination activity by EQUINET is key for the good implementation of Union anti-discrimination law in Member States and should be supported by the Programme. 1 Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22). 2 Council Directive 2004/113/EC of 13 December 2004 implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services (OJ L 373, 21.12.2004, p. 37). 3 Directive 2006/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation (OJ L 204, 26.7.2006, p. 23). 4 Directive 2010/41/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity and repealing Council Directive 86/613/EEC (OJ L 180, 15.7.2010, p. 1). ",
        "15347/18 PN/hm 14 ANNEX JAI.A EN (18) Independent human rights bodies and civil society organisations play an essential role in promoting, safeguarding and rai sing awareness of the Union\u2019s common values under Article 2 TEU, and in contributing to the effective enjoyment of rights under Union law, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. As reflected in the European Parliament Resolution of 18 April 2018, adequate financial support is key to the development of a conducive and sustainable environment for civil society organisations to strengthen their role and perform their functions independently and effectively. Complementing efforts at national level, EU funding should therefore contribute to support, empower and build the capacity of independent civil society organisations active in the promotion of human rights whose activities help the strategic enforcement of rights under EU law and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, including through advocacy and watchdog activities, as well as to promote, safeguard and raise awareness of the Union\u2019s common values at national level. (19) The Commission should ensure overall consistency, complementarity and synergies with the work of Union bodies, offices and agencies, in particular the European Institute for Gender Equality and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, and should take stock of the work of other national and international actors in the areas covered by the Programme. (20) The Programme should be open, subject to certain conditions, to the participation of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) members which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA) and EFTA members which are not members of the EEA and other European countries. Acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidate countries benefiting from a pre-accession strategy should also be able to participate in the Programme. ",
