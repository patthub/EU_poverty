        "EESC info \u2014 December 2008 \u2014 Special edition \u0018 Mr Mario Sepi \u2014 New President of the EESC praises Solidarity In the middle of the French Presidency of the EU, the Eu- ropean Economic and Social Committee, at its plenary ses- sion of 22 October 2008, elected Mr Mario Sepi President of the EESC for the period 2008-2010. Mr Mario Sepi comes from the Employees\u2019 Group in which he was President for the period 2006-2008. The new President comes at a crucial moment for Eu- rope and for the rest of the world. The financial crisis is strongly knocking the door of all the European citizens and countries. Europe must prove to its citizens and moreover to the rest of the world that the leaders of this entity composed by 27 countries is capable to react accordingly in order to face this crisis and more particularly to protect its citizens offering them solutions and inspiring trust. The key theme of the new President of the EESC \u2018rights and solidarity to guide globalisation\u2019 may be a part of the solution to face this globalised financial crisis. During this critical phase, Europe must show this kind of \u2018Solidarity\u2019 to its citizens. Solidarity is not confronted with Globalisation but on the contrary provides the right tools to the concerned to face it. The new President says: Globalisation is an ongoing proc- ess, while solidarity is the set of actions and objectives which Debate on rights and solidarity to guide globalisation A major challenge for Europe: promoting growth and tackling the crisis while rethinking the European social model >>> page 2 EDITORIAL www.eesc.europa.eu Dear reader, The next two years will be crucial for Europe and its citizens. Apart from the historical financial crisis we are facing now, Europe will have a new Commission, a new Parliament, hopefully a new Treaty. We will have to discuss the new Lisbon strategy and issues of great importance for European citizens and for our future. For our Committee, this means that we will have to face a moving context, we have to keep a high profile and communication will have an overriding importance. As Vice-President for Communication, I want to focus on the following five actions which are all building upon the work of our predecessors. First, we have to continue developing our contacts with the other institutions. Within the context of the Inter-institutional Group on Information, we have already met with Commission Vice- President Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, the Vice-President of the European Parliament, Alejo Vidal Quadras, as well as the French Minister for European Affairs, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, to discuss the priorities for communication in 2009 \u2014 the year of Creativity and Innovation: \u2022 Energy and Climate Change \u2022 The June 2009, EP elections \u2022 20 years since the fall of the Iron Curtain, and \u2022 Growth, jobs & economic stability Second, we need to step up contacts with journalists and the media in Brussels, as well as at home in our respective countries. Third, we need timely, fresh, lively, targeted, active and interactive communication. The tools, resources and professional support for this exist. Fourth, we need to have a strategic plan and communicate on selected subjects taking into account our President\u2019s priorities as well as current events and topics. Last but not least, communication has to be a joint effort: we need to bring together EESC members and the secretariat, the groups, sections and the communication team. With this in mind I will be meeting the groups, sections and other bodies, such as the CCMI, to identify our communication priorities. I will dedicate myself with enthusiasm, energy and responsibility to pursuing our common goals. Together and with your help we can do it! Irini Pari, EESC Vice-President for Communication December 2008/\u00180 EN \u2014 Special edition ISSN 1725-1923 The new challenges presented by the economic and social situa- tion in the European Union were the subject of a new debate held at the European Parliament on 22 October 2008 on \u2018Rights and solidarity to guide globalisation\u2019, on the occasion of Mario Sepi\u2019s election as President of the Euro- pean Economic and Social Com- mittee.

Issues of key importance at the heart of the debate One of the recommendations adopted at the summit concerned the social aspect of relations be- tween the EU and its partner coun- tries. The network recommended that all initiatives, programmes and projects implemented as part of Mediterranean policies should take account of the social aspect, a factor that is crucial for the part- ner countries\u2019 sustainable develop- ment. In addition to the social aspect raised at the Rabat Summit, other themes of great importance to civil society in the region were ad- dressed, such as the prospects of a free trade area in 2010, women\u2019s access to economic and social life, intercultural dialogue, freedom of association and stronger consulta- tive bodies in the region. Union for the Mediterranean The session on the role of civil society in the Union for the Medi- terranean gave rise to a lively dis- cussion and solid recommenda- tions were made. The network of economic and social councils and similar institutions proposed that it could play a key role in design- ing, promoting and following up projects for the Union for the Mediterranean and called for the network to be properly represent- ed in the Union for the Mediterra- nean\u2019s bodies. At the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers of For- eign Affairs held in Marseilles on 3 and 4 November 2008, Ms Le Nouail Marli\u00e8re, who was recently appointed President of the EESC Euromed Follow-up Committee, presented the recommendations of the network of economic and social councils and similar insti- tutions. She emphasised the im- portance of more closely involv- ing civil society, in particular the network of economic and social councils and similar institutions, in implementing projects for the Union for the Mediterranean.

        "EESC info \u2014 December 2008 \u2014 Special edition \u0018 Programme of President Mario Sepi 2008\u201310: \u2018Rights and solidarity to guide globalisation\u2019 European social model and solidarity as an instrument for competitiveness This concept of solidarity does not focus exclusively on quality, an idea of society or a raft of values underpinning our civilisation: it is also a tool to promote competitiveness in the challenging climate of globalisation. >>> page 6 www.eesc.europa.eu Introduction On 22 October 2008, I assumed the responsibility of the Com- mittee presidency with both conviction and determination. My ambition is for the Com- mittee to become a consulta- tive body that is increasingly valued and listened to by the EU institutions. It should be capable of raising awareness of the problems and hopes of civil society, workers and entrepreneurs at European level. My commitment and that of the Vice-Presidents is unwavering. \u2018Rights and solidarity to guide globalisation\u2019 is the message of my presidency This means, first of all, a new concept of solidarity, which has been taking form throughout the course of European history. It implies reciprocity and give and take, care for other people and active sharing. It does not mean some giving and others receiving, and even less is it a mat- ter of pity and compassion, in which some decide and others wait in resignation \u2014 it recognises only the sharing of unequal situations in one common project. Mario Sepi President of the European Economic and Social Committee December 2008/\u00180 EN \u2014 Special edition Seen in this light, solidarity is able to force the economy to pick up pace towards a form of development revolving around quality, raising the overall level of economic and social processes, making society more stable and preventing the social and environmental disasters which would result should the pursuit of competitiveness be seen solely in terms of cost control and social conflicts. The pursuit of solidarity and the European social model does not put us on a collision course with glo- balisation. Globalisation is an ongoing process, while solidarity is the set of actions and objectives which make it possible to realise the potential inherent in economic and social development: the growth of civilisation and equality for all. Summary of the programme 2008\u201310 The fact that the start of my presidency coincides with the European Economic and Social Committee\u2019s 50th anniversary confers upon me a twofold responsibility: to capitalise on the history of the Committee, while at the same time ensuring that the Committee looks to the future. The EESC has a key role to play in this respect: as the voice of organised civil society, it is a microcosm and a mirror of social and cultural differences. It is an institutional forum in which civil society stakeholders propose solutions agreed as part of their consul- tative role of providing support for the EU\u2019s legislative and executive institutions.

        "\u0018 EESC info \u2014 December 2008 \u2014 Special edition The second priority is therefore the Lisbon strategy. This strategy is fundamental: cooperation with the EU institutions to tackle the issues of modernisation, the knowledge-based society, international competi- tion, research and the rights of Europeans as citizens and as workers is key to contributing to the renewal of society. The time is right to submit new proposals to the in- stitutions, the Member States, the social partners and the other organisations with links to the Committee. The principle aim of these new proposals is to re- vitalise European production but this is impossible without better protection of rights and living condi- tions. This leads us to the third priority: rights and the European social model \u2014 from the strug- gle to ensure the entry into force of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU to the struggle to ensure its effective application at every level. A prerequisite for this is identifying the consequences of European decisions as soon as possible. Through its members and their organisations, the Committee has access to an excellent net- work through which it can assess the grassroots impact of directives and European policies and we must ensure that we make proper use of it. Only in this way will the Committee be able to perform its function not only of support- ing the European institutions in their decision-making, but also of providing answers at national and organisational level to the questions: What are the implications of this decision for the various sectors of society? What is the impact on industrial relations? What are the consequences for social and civil progress in individual countries? Three key priorities The Treaty of Lisbon includes a series of articles reinforcing participatory democracy. It is primarily the responsibility of the Committee to explore ways in which these articles may be applied effectively, by stepping up its role in the consultative process, making full use of the popular right of initiative and putting the requirement to consult and inform civil society into practice in secondary legislation. The deep fault lines running through our society and the breakdown that we are currently witnessing of social pact employers, trade unions and governments make an improvement in the quality of the economic fabric imperative. My background\u2026 Looking ahead to the EESC after 2008, we must build on its great potential in terms of: \u2022 promoting change in our societies; \u2022 defending the European social model. Assessing the consequences of policies on our societies In order to ensure that the Committee reflects the views of society, we must promote assess- ments of the real impact of European policies when applied to our societies. I have been an EESC member since 1995 and I have been inspired by a great commitment to European economic and social policy. Among my key opinions for which I was rapporteur is the 2002 own-initiative opinion on \u2018Trends, structures and institutional mechanisms of the international capital markets\u2019. My opinion also focused on competition policy, Euro- pean industrial policy and monetary union, among other things, and I was a member of the study group that pre- pared the opinion of the Committee on EMU and indus- trial relations \u2014 and the Lisbon strategy. Since the 1960s, I have followed European issues with par- ticular reference to social and labour matters in Europe and I have been part of the European federalist move- ment as secretary of the Rome section of the Federalist Youth Movement. Concerned with social and trade union policy in Europe since 1966, I was a researcher with the Institute of Inter- national Affairs (IAI), whose President at the time was Altiero Spinelli. From 1969 to 1974, I worked with the Economic and Social Committee as an expert on relations with the Mediterranean countries. For my first job with this institute, I wrote an essay on the role of the Economic and Social Committee. As an active trade unionist with the CISL in the 1970s and 1980s, first as an international policy expert and then as National Secretary of the FIM (Italian Metalworkers\u2019 Federation), I have been responsible for industrial and contract policy and a member of the EMF (European Metalworkers\u2019 Federation). I was also one of those who got the union to sign the Fiat agreement in 1984, which ended the long crisis that had begun as a result of the struggles of 1980. I have been strongly committed to development coop- eration, working on the idea of the social development of civil society at the heart of relations with non-member countries such as Brazil, Chile, Mali and Mozambique. As I move on from a side role, to which I have belonged throughout my career in the Committee to take on over- all responsibility, I am fully aware of the difficulties facing me, but I am heartened by the good relationship I have established with the members of every Committee group. The new \u2018social pact\u2019 made up of the Charter and the Treaty of Lisbon must become prac- tical policy and the first step towards achieving this is to bring the social agenda up to date. Clarifying labour law and defining the relationship between European and national or contractual provisions is vital if European citizens are to regain legal and social certainty. Conveying a strong message: the importance of communication In parallel, the Committee must develop an effective internal and external communication strategy: timeliness, efficiency and policy content must be the watchwords for the official communication activities of a modern Economic and Social Committee. Tapping into current political debates must be a priority for the Committee, showing that the Committee itself can deal properly and promptly with issues flowing from the institu- tional debate. ",
        "EESC info \u2014 December 2008 \u2014 Special edition \u0018 lines the EU\u2019s duty to pass on the lessons learned from this unique peace-building experience to oth- er conflict regions in the world. It notes, however, that conflict reso- lution in the region is still \u201cwork in progress\u201d and recommends that EU support for community rec- onciliation continues for the long term. It also calls for consideration to be given to the proposal to cre- ate a European centre for conflict resolution in Northern Ireland. Based on evidence from a fact- finding mission and major confer- ence in Belfast, the Opinion was drawn up by a sub-committee Chaired by Henri Malosse who was particularly moved by what he witnessed in the city. The sight of \u201cpeace walls\u201d dividing Protestant and Catholic communities was a stark reminder of how much work still needs to be done. Rapporteur, EU peace-building methods in Northern Ireland must be passed on by Jane Morrice Giving farmers the \u2018freedom to farm\u2019 Jane Morrice, hopes others can learn lessons from her homeland. The Opinion includes a Conflict Resolution Took Kit designed to be adapted to help other regions facing similar difficulties. It iden- tifies the ways in which the EU influenced positive change by sup- porting the efforts of civil society, local consultation and the inclu- sion of all interest groups \u2014 politi- cal, business, trade union, volun- tary sector \u2014 using the European Social Partnership Model. This ap- proach allowed more than half the population to take part in EU PEACE programmes in what is seen as unprecedented grass-roots involvement. But all are agreed that the follow up to the Opinion will be more im- portant than the work already cov- ered. The aim, according to Jane Morrice, is to ensure that the \u2018Tool The CAP, Common Agricultural Policy, is currently facing one of its \u2018health checks\u2019. And the EESC, as always, has promptly presented its opinion on the issue. The EESC considers the CAP one of the backbones of the Euro- pean Union. Agriculture plays a major role in many important sectors and issues that are at the top of now- adays\u2019 agenda: climate change, biodiversity, reduction of Green House Gas emission and renew- able energies, water management. Today, farmers play an essential multifunctional role: they are the main actors in achieving world high standards for food safety and quality, as well as for environmen- tal protection and animal welfare; ensuring supplies of safe and var- ied food and of sustainable bio- energy; conserving the country- side and the nature; contributing Kit\u2019 is carried in the briefcases of European peace builders wherever they travel. \u2018As the world\u2019s greatest \u2018role model\u2019 for peace-building, the EU has the expertise, the diversity and the resources to support conflict resolution wherever it is required in the world. But it has more than this. It has a duty to do so and an obligation to place peace-building at the very core of its future strate- gic direction\u2019. . \u25cf Closer relations between Brazilian civil society and the European Union: setting up a round table On 23 October of this year, the EESC adopted an opinion on EU-Brazil relations, which made a number of recommen- dations for the new strategic EU-Brazil partnership, formal- ised in July 2007. The opinion\u2019s main recommendation is to establish an EU-Brazil civil so- ciety round table. Along the lines of those already existing with India and China, this new body would help to main- tain a permanent dialogue between civil society in Brazil and in the European Union. In partnership with Brazil\u2019s Council for Economic and Social Development, the EESC proposed strengthening bilateral relations between the EU and Brazil, which has in recent years gained considerable prominence on the in- ternational stage. This EESC opinion also analyses issues relating to the environment, social cohesion and the role of multinational and European companies in Brazil, as well as education, poverty, climate change and bio fuels, amongst others. All of these issues will be discussed once the round table is up and running. It is worth noting that the next EU-Brazil Summit will take place in Rio de Janeiro in December 2008. PLENARY SESSION IN A NUTSHELL For more information please consult the link: http://www.eesc.europa.eu/documents/opinions/avis_en.asp?type=en funding as before. It calls on politi- cians to better explain to the pub- lic the necessity of the CAP, in or- der to avoid further never-ending discussions about financing. Eventually, it appeals to the Eu- ropean Commission for a deeper and better analysis of the changes that it has proposed to bring to the individual measures and sections of the CAP, because in some cases (GAEC, decoupling, extension of the tendering system, dairy mar- ket, set-aside mechanism, modula- tion), they might not perfectly fit with the concrete and actual needs both of the European farmers and consumers. \u25cf \u2018Ground-breaking and innovative\u2019, is how EESC President Mario Sepi described the EU influence on the peace process in Northern Ireland following the adoption of an own initiative opinion at the EESC Ple- nary in October. Entitled \u2018The role of the EU in the Northern Ireland Peace Process\u2019, the opinion under- Combating fraud and counterfeiting of means of payment The EU needs to improve its strategy for combating fraud and the counterfeiting of means of payment by deploying a range of measures. In doing so, it must involve not only the authorities but also consumer associations, with a view to alerting users to the potential risks of using non-cash means of payment. The Committee regrets that the steps taken so far to crack down on fraud and counterfeiting have proved insufficient to halt the spread of the problem. Closer cooperation is needed between the relevant national authorities in order to ensure more effective preventative action. Recommended measures include harmonising national legislation to provide more effective deterrence, ensur- ing that each national authority creates a digital database containing information on levels of fraud risk, and tasking Europol with monitoring the drive to prevent and counter fraud. A new framework for services of general interest and globalisation Economic globalisation is shaping a new landscape in which the decisions taken by a number of in- ternational bodies such as the WTO, for example, could jeopardise the very survival of services of general interest. The EESC has drawn up an own-initiative opinion on this subject, calling on the other Community institutions to prepare an in-depth debate on the need to establish policy guidelines for services of general interest and the effects of globalisation. The Committee emphasis- es that it is crucial to establish policy guidelines that help maintain the current legal framework in this area. In fact, services of general interest play such a major role in the daily lives of Europe\u2019s citizens that their contribu- tion to social, economic and territorial cohesion and to the EU\u2019s sustainable development forms an integral part of the European social model. It is worth bearing in mind that the purpose of social services of general interest is to address all social disadvantages that are likely to threaten people\u2019s physical or moral integrity, in particular sick- ness, old age, inability to work, lack of job security, social exclusion, etc. Jane Morrice to employment by keeping up the agricultural production; and last but not least, saving the rural areas from depopulation and abandon- ment. And all that will remain still valid in future. According to the Committee, farmers\u2019 multifunctional role has to be preserved and the current CAP \u201cHealth Check\u201d should shoot exactly for this aim and, more gen- erally, for giving new responses to the changed food market situation. This would imply adapting the ex- isting legislation towards an easier and more straightforward imple- mentation of the reform measures. Market organization, simplifica- tion and adjustment are likely to be the key-tools that, if pursued and accomplished, could lead to the desired ultimate aim, stability.

Today\u2019s economic crisis and so- cial difficulties show that public authorities should adopt specific policies in favour of the family and especially the poor ones who con- stitute the first victims of the world economic crisis. \u25cf 2008 emphasized and proposed the key word \u2018solidarity\u2019 as a solu- tion, to tackle today\u2019s financial and social crisis. Part of the slogan of the new President of the EESC, Mr Mario Sepi, the word \u2018solidarity\u2019 was gift- ed with a deeper social meaning in the context of that seminar. Mrs Leila Kurki, new President of the Section for Social Affairs, Employment and Citizenship of the EESC strongly insisted that: \u2018A social policy which encourages solidarity is not a luxury\u2019. The participants of the seminar sent the message that solidarity does not automatically flow from economic growth and at the same time it requires commitment and action. Participants underlined that nowadays society cannot de- velop without human values and without solidarity. The current crisis puts it more in evidence now than ever. The first place where these values can be learnt and de- veloped is the family.

The Europa Diary is a practical agenda with EU information for pupils aged 15-18 years old, to be distributed in schools. The EESC will become the second institu- tion, after the European Commis- sion, to finance and participate in the project. The content dedicated to the EESC will inform young Eu- ropean citizens on the importance of being involved in European civil society. An initiative of the DG SANCO, the diary is coordinated by Gener- ation Europe and was created with the goal to inform young Europe- ans on their consumer rights. It soon became a learning tool used by teachers and students in class, with information on all aspects of the European Union, covering areas such as the EU institutions, environmental responsibility, edu- cation and career planning. The diary is printed in 22 lan- guages and distributed free of charge to over 18 000 schools in all 27 European Union countries. The EESC will participate in the 2009- 2010 school year edition. The Di- rector of Consumer Affairs in DG SANCO, Ms Jacqueline Minor, the President of Generation Europe Foundation, Ms Catie Thorburn, and DG SANCO\u2019s administrator Ginette Nabavi, were present at the ceremony. \u25cf IN SHORT Hearing on socially innovative solutions to transport and energy challenges The hearing organised on 26 Sep- tember 2008 at the General Coun- cil of C\u00f4tes d\u2019Armor (St Brieuc, France) in the framework of the EESC study group on \u2018The social implications of transport and en- ergy developments\u2019 (rapporteur Mrs Batut) provided a platform for exchanging the views of the vari- ous components of organised civil society from the Brittany region active in the field of transport and energy. The participants empha- sised that structural developments From left to right: Mihai Manoliu, Mattia Pellegrini and Laure Batut Left to right: Jacqueline Minor, Catie Thorburn, Ginette Nabavi and Dimitris Dimitriadis played a key role in the evolution of fuel and commodity (e.g. fish, road transport services) prices, that recent transport and energy price hikes did represent a risk for social cohesion, and that this risk could be contained through politi- cal innovation and will to review obsolete practices. Mr Mattia Pellegrini, member of the private office of the Vice-President of the European Commission responsi- ble for transport policy, underlined the key role played by the EESC in fostering debate on this issue at European level, and welcomed the socially innovative apporaches developed by the General Council of C\u00f4tes d\u2019Armor, which he be- lieved should serve as examples for other regions in Europe. \u25cf tion\u2019 (available at: http://www.eesc. europa.eu/activities/press/media/ AV/index_en.asp), a web page on the EESC website that explains what the EESC is and what it does, through video-clips regarding several main events and activi- ties of the Committee.
