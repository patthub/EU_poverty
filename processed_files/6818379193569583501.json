        "EN 1 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL \u2022 Reasons for and objectives of the proposal The European Union (EU) has granted trade preferences to developing countries 1 through the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) since 1971. It is part of its common commercial policy, in accordance with the general provisions governing the EU's external action 2 . The GSP is one of the key EU trade instruments to assist developing countries to integrate in the world economy, reduce poverty, and support sustainable development through the promotion of core human and labour rights, environmental protection, and good governance. The GSP consists of three arrangements: \uf0b7 Standard GSP: for low and lower-middle income countries, providing for a reduction or full removal of customs duties on two thirds of EU tariff lines. \uf0b7 GSP+: the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, which reduces tariffs to 0% for broadly the same tariff lines as Standard GSP. It is granted to vulnerable low and lower-middle income countries that implement 27 international conventions related to human rights, labour rights, protection of the environment and good governance. \uf0b7 EBA (Everything But Arms): the special arrangement for least developed countries (LDCs), providing them with duty-free, quota-free access to the EU market for all products except arms and ammunition. The current scheme shall apply until on 31 December 2023. Unless a new Regulation is adopted, the Standard GSP and the GSP+ arrangements will cease to apply on 1 January 2024. Imports from developing countries under Standard GSP and GSP+ would thus be charged with higher duties. However, imports from LDCs would still be covered by the EBA arrangement, which does not have an expiry date. The proposal for a new GSP Regulation aims to renew the scheme for a further period of ten years. The GSP is a mature part of the EU\u2019s trade policy toolbox. Its review is about fine -tuning the way the GSP works and improving its efficiency and effectiveness. Hence, the chosen set of policy options, also defined and further explored in the External Study and Impact Assessment, have a high level of granularity. They aim at specific and limited improvements, to ensure the continued relevance of the GSP overall, and to achieve its development and sustainability objectives. 1 The expression \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d is used following WTO terminology, see for instance the chapeau of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the WTO (\u201cRecognizing further that there is need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries, and especially the least developed among them, secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development\u201d) and the GATT Enabling Clause (\u201cDecision on Differential and More Favourable Treatment, Reciprocity and Fuller Participation of Developing Countries\u201d). 2 Treaty on European Union - TITLE V: GENERAL PROVISIONS ON THE UNION'S EXTERNAL ACTION AND SPECIFIC PROVISIONS ON THE COMMON FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY Chapter 1: General provisions on the Union's external action - Article 21 http://data.europa.eu/eli/treaty/teu_2008/art_21/oj ",
        "EN 2 EN The EU\u2019s overarching objectives with the revised GSP Regu lation are to maintain the essential features of the present Regulation, namely poverty eradication and support for sustainable development and good governance, while also not jeopardising EU interests. At the same time, the aim is to improve the GSP\u2019s ove rall efficiency and effectiveness to respond to future challenges: (a) Facilitate access to the GSP+ arrangement to the growing number of LDCs graduating from the EBA status; (b) Adjust product graduation thresholds to better focus preferences on less competitive products and countries; (c) Reflect the evolving priorities such as those underpinning the European Green Deal by extending negative conditionality also to environmental and good governance conventions; (d) Update the list of international conventions in a targeted and manageable way, while not jeopardizing the monitoring process; (e) Make the preferences withdrawal process more responsive in urgent cases; (f) Enhance the monitoring and implementation of GSP+ commitments, for instance through increased transparency and participation of relevant stakeholders, including through the recently created Single Entry Point (SEP) mechanism for non- compliance related complaints. This is an initiative within the Regulatory Fitness Programme (REFIT). \u2022 Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area The general objectives of the GSP are consistent with the analysis and perspective of the Commission Communication Trade Policy Review: An Open, Sustainable and Assertive Trade Policy 3 of 18 February 2021. The Trade Policy Review (TPR) confirms the objective of the GSP review to increase trading opportunities for developing countries to reduce poverty and to create jobs, based on international values and principles. It further notes the EU\u2019s interest in supporting vulnerable developing countries to integrate into the world economy and to support multilateralism, and ensure adherence to universal values, adding a focus on climate and environmental challenges, while also remaining ready to act assertively in defending its interests. The initiative is consistent with the establishment of the Chief Trade Enforcement Officer (CTEO) and the Single Entry Point (SEP); the on-going development of supply chain due- diligence legislation, the newly established EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, as well as on-going programming of development cooperation. 3 COM(2021) 66 final, 18 February 2021 https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2021/EN/COM- 2021-66-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF ",
        "EN 3 EN \u2022 Consistency with other Union policies The continuation of GSP is part of the EU\u2019s political commitment to support sustainable development globally, as reflected in the implementation of the United Nations (UN) Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \u2013 to which all World Trade Organisation (WTO) Members have committed. The GSP\u2019s objectives are also in line with EU\u2019s Policy Coherence for Development (PCD), which constitutes a key pillar of EU efforts to enhance the positive impact and increase effectiveness of development cooperation 4 . Furthermore, it is consistent with Treaty provisions on promotion of sustainable development and human rights through external action, trade provisions regulating imports, EU Green Deal initiatives, and the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy. 2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY \u2022 Legal basis The legal basis for a new GSP Regulation lies in Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which sets out the EU\u2019s common commercial policy. \u2022 Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) The common commercial policy is listed in Article 3 of the TFEU among the areas of exclusive competence of the Union. Pursuant to Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the subsidiarity principle does not apply in areas of exclusive EU competence. \u2022 Proportionality The principle of proportionality is satisfied since the proposal includes limited effectiveness and efficiency adjustments only. The proposal is accompanied by an Impact Assessment Report, which discusses proportionality in Chapters 3 (Why should the EU act?), 6 (What are the impacts of the policy options?) and 7 (How do the options compare?). The practical implications of the initiative are discussed in Annex 3 of the Impact Assessment Report accompanying the legislative proposal (Who is affected and how?). The policy choices in the proposal are described in Chapter 8 of the accompanying Impact Assessment Report (Chapter 8 \u2013 Preferred Options) and can be summarised as follows: \u2013 To maintain the current architecture consisting of three arrangements. \u2013 To amend the vulnerability (economic eligibility) criteria for GSP+ to allow LDC countries that graduate from LDC status to join GSP+. \u2013 To review the product graduation thresholds. 4 Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functi oning of the EU concerning PCD reads: \u201c The Union shall take account of the objectives of development cooperation in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries \u201d. ",
        "EN 4 EN \u2013 To extend negative conditionality to environmental and good governance conventions and review the list of international conventions. \u2013 To expand and improve the withdrawal procedure (carry out a socio-economic impact assessment, provide for a rapid response mechanism that can be activated in cases of exceptionally grave violations, expand the scope of the instrument to cover also the principles of the environment and good governance conventions and additional areas such as relating to migration). \u2013 To improve transparency and inclusion of civil society and streamline the monitoring cycle (reporting every 3 years). \u2022 Choice of the instrument The GSP Regulation is the only appropriate action that the Union can take to establish unilateral, non-reciprocal, preferential access to the Union market for developing countries. 3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS \u2022 Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation A Mid-term Evaluation (MTE) of the current GSP Regulation was completed in 2018 5 . The MTE concluded that, overall, the GSP was delivering on its objectives 6 and there was no need to amend the Regulation before its expiry on 31 December 2023. However, the MTE made several recommendations to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the scheme. These recommendations underpinned the identification of the problems defined in detail in Section 2 of the Impact Assessment Report accompanying this proposal. The MTE Project Team presented the following recommendations: (1) Improve transparency and awareness of EU\u2019s GSP and GSP+ monitoring; (2) Safeguard provisions to be more effectively used; (3) Temporary withdrawal of tariff preferences to be more effectively used; (4) Update the list of conventions on core human and labour rights as well as on environment and good governance principles; (5) Evaluate the continued relevance of the Standard GSP arrangement as distinct and separate from the GSP+ and consider expanding conditionality related to conventions; (6) Take stock of the WTO\u2019s services waiver for LDCs; and (7) Consider the issue of coherence between GSP and the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)/Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) regimes . Several of these aspects were addressed during the implementation of the GSP Regulation, in particular through the GSP Hub Project on transparency and awareness. The safeguard and withdrawal mechanisms were also applied since the MTE; lessons learned from their application are presented in the Impact Assessment accompanying this proposal. 5 Commission Staff Working Document Midterm Evaluation of the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (SWD(2018) 430 final), http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/september/tradoc_156085.pdf 6 For instance, since 2011, EBA-beneficiary Bangladesh has almost doubled its exports to the EU from EUR 9 billion to approximately EUR 18 billion in 2018. Exports from GSP countries, in particular the LDCs expanded significantly over the last few years. The scheme\u2019s safeguards were used. Through promotion of socio-economic development while respecting the core values the GSP contributed positively to promoting and protecting human and labour rights. The MTE noted, however, that impact of GSP on environment protection was less clear. ",
        "EN 5 EN \u2022 Stakeholder consultations An open public consultation on the GSP and the proposed reform options was open from 11 March 2020 to 15 July 2020. A detailed summary of the stakeholder consultation is provided in Annex 2 of the accompanying Impact Assessment Report. 512 responses were submitted to the public consultation. Among the respondents, 54% are EU stakeholders, 41% from GSP countries, and the remaining 5% from other countries (including the UK). In terms of the type of respondent, \u201ccompanies/business organisations\u201d account for the largest share of responses (28%), followed by business associations (24%) and EU citizens (17%), public sector (12%), civil society (NGOs, environmental and consumer organisations, and academia; 8%), and others (including trade unions; 7%). A large majority i.e., about 70% of respondents considers that international trade can make an important contribution to poverty eradication in developing countries and another 10% think that it can make a minor contribution; 17% think that it cannot contribute to poverty alleviation. Views in GSP countries are clearly more positive regarding the poverty alleviating role of trade: here, 92% of respondents state that trade can make an important contribution, compared to 52% of EU respondents; conversely, 19% of EU respondents do not believe that trade can help eradicate poverty, compared to 2% in GSP countries. Asked about how trade contributed to poverty alleviation, most respondents pointed to the generation of employment and, in the long term, skills development through exporting. On average, the GSP is viewed to have positive impacts across all areas of sustainable development. 86% of respondents consider it important for the EU to continue monitoring the level of implementation of the 27 international conventions by GSP+ beneficiary countries, compared to 8% who consider it unimportant. Respondents consider that a wide range of information sources provide useful information for the Commission\u2019s monitoring of the implementation of international conventions. The most relevant source, with some distance, are reports by the conventions\u2019 monitoring bodies, i.e., the UN, International Labour Organization (ILO) and other international organisations, followed by information provided by business and social partners in the beneficiary countries, and by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). The input received was considered in the accompanying Impact Assessment Report in particular in the construction of the problem definitions (Chapter 2), the general and specific objectives of the initiative (Chapter 4), and the available policy options (Chapter 5). \u2022 Collection and use of expertise An External Study (hereafter the Study) informing the draft Impact Assessment Report was undertaken by BKP Economic Advisors GmbH. The final report of the Study was published in May 2021 and is available on the DG Trade website 7 . The Study followed onto the conclusions of the MTE and focused on several policy options that could improve achieving the overall objectives of the GSP instrument. It took into account existing literature and the 7 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/706f539c-f0db-11eb-a71c- 01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-221478841 and https://op.europa.eu/en/publication- detail/-/publication/be174994-f337-11eb-aeb9-01aa75ed71a1/language-en ",
        "EN 6 EN results of the open public consultation described above. An executive summary of the recommendations of the Study is available on the DG Trade website 8 . The results of the supporting Study were presented to the GSP Expert Group on the following dates: 20 October 2020, 7 December 2020, and 23 February 2021; and to INTA at an in- camera technical presentation on 12 April 2021. The key elements of this proposal were further discussed with the GSP Experts on 19 April 2021 and 14 June 2021. \u2022 Impact assessment The summary sheet of the accompanying Impact Assessment Report is available as part of the proposal package. The Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive opinion on the Impact Assessment Report on 9 April 2021. The Impact Assessment examined policy alternatives in five thematic clusters: (1) GSP arrangements and beneficiary countries, (2) product coverage and product graduation mechanism, (3) conditionality of gaining/maintaining tariff preferences, (4) transparency in GSP implementation and (5) safeguards. For each cluster, several policy options were assessed against the baseline of keeping the GSP scheme as it is. (1) GSP arrangements and beneficiary countries (country graduation) This cluster looks at the continuous reduction of the number of the GSP beneficiaries. Countries may lose access to GSP if they conclude a Free Trade Agreement with the EU or if they move up to the Upper-Middle-Income country category. The Impact Assessment looks at options to amend the three-tier structure of the GSP and the country coverage of the scheme. The analysis shows that there is no compelling reason to change the existing structure or country coverage of the GSP, as the scheme is already focused on countries most in need and the three-tier structure addresses the different developmental needs of beneficiaries. The option which contributes most to the general objective of contributing to poverty eradication and the specific objective of expanding exports from developing countries is to amend the economic vulnerability criteria for GSP+. This option attempts to mitigate the significant negative consequences of losing EBA preferences following graduation from LDC status. Continued access to GSP (in particular to GSP+) matters to the relatively high number of LDCs beneficiaries expected to lose EBA status in the coming years. The supporting Study finds that of the 12 countries likely to graduate from EBA over the lifespan of the next Regulation, six are likely to face significant economic impact and notably this is the case for Bangladesh. The supporting Study and Impact Assessment Report, therefore, suggest the following options to ensure that all EBA countries expected to graduate from LDC status could transition to GSP+ arrangement: (1) To maintain the current architecture consisting of three arrangements; 8 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/f7031da3-f0dc-11eb-a71c- 01aa75ed71a1/language-en ",
        "EN 7 EN and (2) To amend the vulnerability (eligibility) criteria to facilitate access by a larger number of countries that graduate from LDC status to the GSP+ arrangement. (2) Product coverage and product graduation mechanism The supporting Study and Impact Assessment Report analysed whether the product graduation mechanism targets well enough the most competitive products 9 and the most competitive countries (option to extend the product graduation mechanism from Standard GSP to GSP+ or EBA beneficiaries). Furthermore, they assessed whether the product coverage reflects the export potential of GSP beneficiaries. The socio-economic analysis found that the current definition of the graduation mechanism could be maintained and continue to apply only for Standard GSP. No significant economic and social impacts are observed if product graduation is extended to GSP+ or EBA beneficiaries or if product coverage is extended to new sectors and products. We, therefore, propose to maintain product graduation only for Standard GSP but review the thresholds for product graduation. We propose to maintain the current graduation method by section and decrease the product graduation thresholds by 10 percentage points. (3) Conditionality of gaining/maintaining tariff preferences GSP conditionality remains one of the key EU instruments to promote respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and labour rights, environmental protection, and good governance in GSP beneficiary countries: a country should not benefit from preferential trade arrangements if it is acting in a way that is contrary to international standards and principles and thereby also to its own developmental needs. The Impact Assessment looks at options on extending positive and negative conditionality, amending the list of GSP relevant conventions, and introducing changes to the preferences withdrawal process. Building upon the MTE and the supporting Study, the main conclusion is to extend negative conditionality (i.e. the withdrawal provisions under Article 19(1), point (a) of the current GSP Regulation (EU) No 978/2012) also to environmental and good governance conventions (currently it only concerns the core human and labour rights UN/ILO conventions). Another aim is to further reinforce GSP\u2019s contribution to sustainable development by updating the list of international conventions, and by improving the withdrawal procedure. The experience of the GSP monitoring and withdrawal mechanisms as currently applied to human and labour rights conventions suggests that an extension of negative conditionality to environmental and good governance conventions would create similar opportunities to engage on such issues in support of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the contribution of the EU\u2019s green agenda to GSP beneficiary countries. Regarding the GSP withdrawal procedure, the experience so far has shown such procedure can be slow in reaching a final decision; all past withdrawals took up to two years to conclude, including the preparatory stages before launching a withdrawal investigation. Exceptionally grave violations require, however, that the Commission have the tools to 9 Calculated as percentage share of a given product group imported from a beneficiary country to the EU in the total EU imports of that product group from all GSP beneficiaries. ",
        "EN 8 EN respond promptly. We, therefore, propose a rapid response mechanism in view of the specific circumstances in the beneficiary country. The experience with the temporary and partial withdrawal 10 of EBA preferences from Cambodia in 2020 has shown that it is necessary to carefully assess the socio-economic impact of withdrawal of preferences on the sectors of production affected to avoid hurting the most vulnerable part of the population. (4) Transparency in the monitoring and implementation of GSP commitments In July 2020, the Commission appointed the Chief Trade Enforcement Officer (CTEO) with the role of better enforcing trade policy. In this connection, in November 2020, the Commission launched a new complaints mechanism, the Single Entry Point (SEP) as part of its increased efforts to strengthen the enforcement and implementation of trade commitments. Through the SEP, the Commission receives complaints on various matters related to trade policy, including breaches of the GSP commitments. It is necessary, therefore, to integrate this new system of complaints within the framework of the GSP Regulation, in particular with respect to the withdrawal procedure. Stakeholders consulted during the 2018 MTE and the 2021 IA supporting Study preparation raised the need to improve the transparency and communication across the various stages of GSP monitoring and implementation work. This could help make the monitoring system more robust and contribute towards a more effective dialogue with beneficiary countries, as well as strengthen stakeholder involvement in the GSP. The Impact Assessment reviews options on improving the monitoring process and civil society\u2019s involvement and on adjusting the GSP+ monitoring cycle. We, therefore, propose to publish guidance on the monitoring process as developed through administrative practice, on the actors involved and the opportunities for civil society\u2019s involvement. In the legislative proposal, we further clarify the wide inclusion of information sources for GSP+ monitoring and sugge st to change the GSP monitoring cycle\u2019s duration from two to three years. (5) Application of safeguards The supporting Study and Impact Assessment Report consider two types of expansion regarding automatic safeguards - in terms of the product coverage and the GSP beneficiaries covered. The conclusion is that neither would lead to a more frequent application of this mechanism. Hence, there does not appear a need for major changes to the safeguard mechanism. It is, therefore, proposed to proceed only with a number of technical adjustments and improvements aiming at aligning better the automatic safeguards with product graduation, namely: (1) Base the calculation of import surges at GSP Section level on import values rather than import volumes due to the heterogeneity of products within Sections; this will better reflect instances of increased imports which could harm EU industry; (2) Align the thresholds for automatic safeguards and product graduation so as to complement each other. Overall impact of the preferred set of options The overall economic and non-economic impact (social, environmental, human rights) of the proposed policy options is limited as the current GSP three-tier structure is proposed to be 10 The possibility of partial withdrawal of preferences was introduced as a result of 2012 GSP reform. ",
        "EN 9 EN maintained. This choice has been made to precisely limit the expected decline in real GDP, in welfare, in total exports to the EU, and in governmental revenues compared to the current baseline that could be felt by Standard GSP or GSP+ countries, should the current structure be modified. In case of discontinuation of the Standard GSP and/or GSP+, a significant reduction in exports would be expected in specific sectors such as textiles and apparel, leather and footwear, agri-food products, chemical, rubber and plastics. The economic analysis in the supporting Study has been made using Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model-based simulations. It has showed (in all other scenarios than maintaining the current architecture of GSP), the negative impact on GDP and trade for both the EU and the GSP beneficiaries, (some of them may be more affected) 11 and supports this fundamental choice in favour of continuity of the scheme and its current structure. The choice to build a bridge towards GSP+ for LDCs which exit EBA (by amending GSP+ economic eligibility criteria) strengthens the continuity choice and reduces the negative impact which could have been felt on LDCs. More active use of conditionality linked to potential (partial or sectoral) withdrawals is expected to positively impact the effectiveness of the GSP scheme: it would further advance the GSP sustainable development objective. It would also be coherent with other EU policies, in particular development cooperation, promotion of human rights and social issues, and the EU contribution to Agenda 2030. Overall impact on political relations Continuing GSP with the targeted changes proposed will be a key encouraging signal from the EU to developing partners, maintaining an important platform to engage with beneficiary countries to bring about change that is consi stent with the EU\u2019s values agenda and policy coherence for development. The political impact of the preferred options is a key consideration. For this area, the analysis is qualitative and based on formal and informal consultations. We expect the choice of continuity of the current GSP architecture to be welcomed by beneficiary countries and by developed WTO partners. This is in line with the long-standing principle of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Enabling Clause, which grants a permanent exemption from the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) principle (non-discrimination) for developed countries to unilaterally grant elimination or reductions of the tariffs paid on imports from developing countries which share the same trade, financing and development needs. The continuation of GSP is in line with EU\u2019s Policy Cohere nce for Development (embedded in Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU) which constitutes a key pillar of EU efforts to enhance the positive impact and increase effectiveness of development cooperation. Moreover, it is part of the EU\u2019s pol itical commitment to support sustainable development globally, as reflected in the implementation of the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and Sustainable Development Goals to which all WTO Members have committed. 11 The CGE analysis shows that EU GDP would fall by up to 0.01% whereas the GSP countries losses would be larger in relative terms i.e. between 0.04% and 0.07%. This relatively moderate average does not change the fact that some individual countries would be more adversely affected in particular Pakistan and Bangladesh, losing up to 0.3% and 0.36% of GDP, respectively. ",
        "EN 10 EN \u2022 Regulatory fitness and simplification The full tables with benefits and costs can be found in Annex 3 of the Impact Assessment Report accompanying the proposal. The potential benefits of the proposed set of objectives are difficult to quantify, as they often involve technical improvements to the existing structure and provisions of the GSP framework \u2013 in order to maximise its efficiency and effectiveness and increase the potential for sustainable economic development of the beneficiary countries. The proposal maintains the status quo whenever there is no compelling reason for change, in order to ensure the predictability and stability of the system. For the changes proposed, the initiative has the following practical implications, benefits, and associated costs, relative to the baseline, per cluster: (g) Arrangements and country coverage: All graduating EBA countries would be a priori eligible for GSP+, in case their authorities wish to apply for the arrangement. This is a mitigation measure: no gains are expected, but it aims to avoid losses and serious negative economic impact for graduating LDCs which would lose EBA preferences. It further supports the development goal of GSP, by ensuring continued access to the scheme for the countries most in need. This would also entail some simplification of the system and a reduction of administrative burden for calculating and monitoring the relevant criteria. (h) Product coverage and product graduation: Amending the product graduation thresholds aims at increasing the effectiveness of the product graduation mechanism in targeting specific competitive products. This is expected to contribute to better focusing the scheme on the products and countries most in need. (i) Conditionality: Extending negative conditionality contributes to the fight against climate change by encouraging GSP beneficiary countries to improve the implementation of climate and environment conventions and to improvements in good governance in all beneficiary countries. The role played by GSP can be significant as environmental degradation tends to hit developing countries hardest due to extensive manufacturing of products dependent on natural resources (such as textiles), as well as the often observed lack of environmental protection laws and programs in those countries. Updating the list of international conventions increases leverage and attention on key human rights (e.g. the rights of people with disabilities, rights of children) and standards (e.g. on labour inspection) and supports action combating climate change through the inclusion of the Paris Agreement (and the removal of the out-of-date Kyoto Protocol). The introduction of an impact assessment before a withdrawal of preferences will make it possible to balance GSP\u2019s general objectives of contributing to poverty reduction and supporting sustainable development. In particular, it ensures that a possible withdrawal is adapted to the circumstances in the targeted beneficiary country, its economic development needs, and the socio-economic impact of any withdrawal measures. Introducing a faster withdrawal procedure provides for a specific instrument to address specific circumstances characterised by exceptionally grave violations and a need to react urgently. This also increases the effectiveness of the withdrawal by increasing pressure on beneficiaries to respond to identified concerns. ",
        "EN 11 EN (j) Transparency: Extending the GSP+ monitoring cycle improves effectiveness and efficiency by approximating the length of the GSP+ monitoring cycle to the monitoring cycle of the international conventions by the respective treaty monitoring bodies and allowing beneficiary countries more time to address issues on implementation of the conventions. (k) Safeguards: The technical changes proposed ensure consistency between measures aimed at protecting EU industry and provide for simplification of automatic safeguards procedure and reduction in administrative burden. The evolution of the GSP Regulation is not expected to be significantly influenced by digital technologies. In the implementation of the proposal, the EU can use existing business processes and solutions that securely handle information in an electronic manner (i.e., exchanging information with beneficiary countries authorities, international convention monitoring bodies, and civil society; open public consultations; REX (Registered Exporter System) declarations on imports from third countries, etc.). \u2022 Fundamental rights Supporting respect for fundamental rights in GSP beneficiary countries is part of the general objectives of the GSP Regulation, namely, (1) to assist developing countries in their efforts to reduce poverty, (2) to promote good governance and sustainable development. Therefore, relevant aspects and impact on fundamental rights have been considered throughout the accompanying Impact Assessment. Particular consideration has been given to international human rights and labour rights instruments, which are also part of the list of conventions in Annex VI of this proposal. Relevant Commission services (SJ, DG JUST, HOME, EMPL, INTPA) and EEAS have been consulted on this proposal which is foreseen to have an overall positive impact on fundamental rights. 4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The proposed Regulation does not incur costs charged to the EU budget. Its application does, however, entail loss of customs revenue. Based on the last available data (2019) 12 , these preferences represent under the proposed GSP Regulation a loss of revenue for the EU of EUR 2,977.6 million. The new Regulation would largely perpetuate existing preferences, but would tighten the conditions for the graduation of individual product sections. Consequently, the trajectory of revenue losses under the new Regulation would be somewhat lower than under the current Regulation. 13 Additionally, the possibility of countries losing coverage of the scheme due to reaching upper-middle-income statues or signing an FTA with the EU would contribute to lowering the revenue losses. A detailed financial statement is available in the proposal below. Overall impact on the administrative costs 12 Data for 2020 is available, but was not chosen as a basis for the calculations as it is considered an unusual and non-representative year. 13 For details cf. financial statement ",
        "EN 12 EN The proposal emphasises continuity, resulting in an overall assessment of a moderate impact, in terms of administrative burden, for the EU and beneficiary countries. Within the preferred options, the issues that are most likely to have such an impact are the proposals on conditionality and the resulting increased monitoring efforts which will be necessary. In particular, under the conditionality cluster (detailed in section 6.3.1 of the Impact Assessment Report) the following policy options can generate additional administrative costs: adding new conventions as a conditionality to continue to receive or enjoy GSP; extending negative conditionality to environmental and good governance conventions; reducing the duration of the withdrawal procedure in exceptional circumstances; preparing the socio-economic impact assessment as additional step after launching the GSP withdrawal procedure or adding elements linked to the obligation to readmit the beneficiary country\u2019s own nationals would add administrative costs (mostly staff involvement). Administrative burden (assessed in Table 6 of the Impact Assessment Report) is prevented by opting against the choice to extend positive conditionality i.e., ratification of conventions and robust monitoring obligations to the Standard GSP and EBA beneficiaries. The policy options in relation to monitoring, (detailed in section 6.4 of the Impact Assessment Report) also have a direct bearing on the administrative costs. In particular, they can add to the administrative tasks on the EU side. However, this is difficult to quantify as it represents a codification of practices that are already in place. Furthermore, the change would address demands of from stakeholders such as trade unions and NGOs to play a more active role in the monitoring process. Another cost would be the EU\u2019s technical assistance and support to GSP countries to enhance their institutional capacity to ratify and implement international conventions. These elements of costs are, however, very difficult to estimate due to the lack of relevant information at this stage. The lengthening of the monitoring cycle from two to three years is expected to reduce the administrative burden both for the EU and for beneficiary countries. 5. OTHER ELEMENTS \u2022 Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements As this proposal introduces minimal changes, aimed at improving effectiveness and efficiency, the implementation of the GSP Regulation will be able to continue without major adjustments based on current practices upon its entry into force. The Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of the Regulation every three years, starting 1 January 2027. The Commission will regularly report on the implementation of the Regulation to the Commission\u2019s GSP Expert Group and the Council Working Party. A mid-term evaluation of the Regulation is suggested for 1 January 2030 i.e., after five years of actual application of the scheme. \u2022 Explanatory documents (for directives) Not applicable. ",

Article 3.2 added possibility for updating the list of eligible countries based on changes in their trade and development needs. No other substantive changes proposed. Chapter II Standard arrangement (Standard GSP): Article 4.3 removed as it was a transitional clause for the 2012 Regulation. No other substantive changes proposed. Chapter III Special incentive arrangement: (GSP+) Article 9.1 point (d) added a requirement for GSP+ candidate countries to submit a plan of action for the effective implementation of the GSP relevant conventions as part of the GSP+ application. Article 9.2 removed as it links to the export competitiveness vulnerability criterion for GSP+, which is proposed to be removed, based on the supporting Study and Impact Assessment. Article 10.8 added to provide transitional arrangements for current GSP+ beneficiaries, which would have to reapply to fulfil new requirements for GSP+ (ratify six additional conventions that are proposed to be added to the list of GSP+ relevant conventions). Article 14 amended the reporting period to three years to streamline and better synchronise with monitoring bodies reports. Article 15.9 introduced a provision so that the Commission considers the socio- economic effect of the temporary withdrawal of tariff preferences in the beneficiary country when proposing the withdrawal. Article 16 introduces the possibility to extend the scope of withdrawal measures where additional reasons or violations occur. Chapter IV Special arrangement (EBA): Article 18.2 and .3 removed as they are no longer necessary. Chapter V Temporary withdrawal: Article 19.1 point (c) introduced a withdrawal procedure related to readmission of own nationals. ",

(2) The Union's common commercial policy shall be guided by the principles and pursue the objectives set out in the general provisions on the Union's external action, laid down in Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). (3) The Union's common commercial policy is to be consistent with and to consolidate the objectives of the Union policy in the field of development cooperation, laid down in Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in particular the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable economic, social, and environmental development and good governance in the developing countries. It is to comply with World Trade Organisation (\u2018WTO\u2019) requirements, in particular with the Decision on Differential and More Favourable Treatment, Reciprocity and Fuller Participation of Developing Countries (the \u2018Enabling Clause\u2019), a dopted under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (\u2018GATT\u2019) in 1979, under which WTO Members may accord differential and more favourable treatment to developing countries.

Thereafter, the GSP should continue to apply for a period of 10 years from the date of application of the preferences provided for in this Regulation, except for the special arrangement for the least-developed countries, which should continue to be applied without any expiry date. (5) The general objectives of the GSP are to support eradication of poverty in all its forms, in line with Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goal 17.12 and to promote the sustainable development agenda, while averting harm to EU industry\u2019s interests. T he 2018 GSP Mid-term Evaluation and the 2021 supporting Study for the Impact Assessment underpinning this Regulation concluded that the GSP framework under Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 has delivered on these main objectives, which were at the core of the 2012 overhaul of Council Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 15 . (6) Those objectives remain relevant in the current global context and they are consistent with the analysis and perspective of the recent Commission Communication Trade Policy Review \u201cAn Open, Sustainable and Assertive Trade Policy\u201d 16 (\u2018TPR\u2019). According to the TPR, the Union has a \u201cstrategic interest to support the enhanced integration into the world economy of vulnerable developing countries\u201d and it \u201cmust fully use the strength provided by its openness and the attractiveness of its Single Market\u201d to support multilateralism and to ensure adherence to universal values. For GSP specifically, the TPR notes its important role in \u201cpromoting respect for core human and labour rights\u201d and sets the objective for the GSP \u201cto further increase trading opportunities for developing countries to reduce poverty and create jobs based on international values and principles\u201d. Moreover, the scheme should assist beneficiaries in recovering from the COVID-19 impact and in re-building their economies in a sustainable manner, including with respect to international human rights, labour, environmental and good governance standards. Coherence should be ensured between the GSP and its objectives and the assistance provided to beneficiary countries, in line with Union\u2019s Policy Coherence for Development (PCD), which constitutes a key pillar of Union\u2019s efforts to enhance the positive impact and increase effectiveness of development cooperation 17 . (7) By providing preferential access to the Union market, the scheme should assist developing countries in their efforts to reduce poverty and achieve and promote good governance and sustainable development by helping them to generate additional revenue through international trade, which can then be re-invested for the benefit of their own development and, in addition, to diversify their economies. The scheme's tariff preferences should focus on those developing countries that have greater development, trade and financial needs. (8) The scheme sho uld consist of a basic arrangement (\u2018standard GSP arrangement\u2019), and two special arrangements, namely the \u2018special incentive arrangement for sustainable 15 Council Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 of 22 July 2008 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences from 1 January 2009 and amending Regulations (EC) No 552/97, (EC) No 1933/2006 and Commission Regulations (EC) No 1100/2006 and (EC) No 964/2007 (OJ L 211, 6.8.2008, p. 1). 16 COM(2021) 66 final, 18 February 2021 17 Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU concerning PCD reads: \u201c The Union shall take account of the objectives of development cooperation in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries \u201d.

        "EN 18 EN development and good governance \u2013 GSP+\u2019 and the \u2018special arrangement for the least - developed countries - EBA\u2019. It, therefore, continues the structure of the previous ten years, which is considered a success, as it focuses on the countries most in need and addresses the varying developmental needs of beneficiaries. (9) The standard GSP arrangement should be granted to all those developing countries which share a common development need and are in a similar stage of economic development. There is no definition of \u2018developing country\u2019 at the level of the WTO, and it is left to preference granting countries to determine the list of GSP-eligible developing countries. Countries which have successfully completed their transition from centralised to market economies, and are today powerful economies with a strong position in international trade, such as China, Hong Kong, Macao and Russia, should not be considered as developing countries in the context of the GSP, and should, therefore, be removed from the list of eligible countries. Countries which are classified by the World Bank as high-income or upper-middle income countries have per capita income levels allowing them to attain higher levels of diversification without the scheme's tariff preferences. They are at a different stage of economic development and do not, therefore, share the same development, trade and financial needs as lower income or more vulnerable developing countries. In order to prevent unjustified discrimination, they need to be treated differently; therefore, they do not benefit from the standard GSP arrangement. Furthermore, the use of tariff preferences provided under the scheme by high-income or upper-middle income countries would increase the competitive pressure on exports from poorer, more vulnerable countries and, therefore, could impose unjustifiable burdens on those more vulnerable developing countries. The standard GSP arrangement should take account of the fact that the development, trade and financial needs are subject to change and ensure that the arrangement remains open if the situation of a country changes. (10) For the sake of consistency, the tariff preferences granted under the standard GSP arrangement should not be extended to developing countries benefiting from a preferential market access arrangement with the Union, which provides at least the same level of tariff preferences as the scheme for substantially all trade. To provide, however, a beneficiary country and economic operators with time for an orderly adaptation, the standard GSP arrangement should continue to be granted for two years as from the date of application of a preferential market access arrangement. (11) The special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) is based on the integral concept of sustainable development, as recognised by international conventions and instruments such as the 1986 UN Declaration on the Right to Development, the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, the 1998 International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the 2000 UN Millennium Declaration, the 2002 Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development, the ILO Centenary Declaration for the Future of Work of 2019, the Outcome Document of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development of 2015 \"Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\", the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Consequently, the additional tariff preferences provided for under the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance should be granted to those developing countries which, due to a lack of diversification, are economically vulnerable, have ratified core international ",
        "EN 19 EN conventions on human and labour rights, climate and environmental protection and good governance, and commit to ensuring the effective implementation thereof. The special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance should help those countries to assume the additional responsibilities resulting from the ratification and effective implementation of these conventions. The list of conventions relevant for GSP should be updated to better reflect the evolution of core international instruments and standards and take a proactive approach to sustainable development in keeping with the Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2030 18 . In this regard, the following conventions are added: the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (2015) \u2013 replacing the Kyoto Protocol; the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD); the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OP-CRC-AC); ILO Convention No 81 on Labour Inspection; ILO Convention No 144 on Tripartite Consultation; and the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. (12) Countries graduating from the Least-Developed Countries (LDC) category established by the UN should be incentivised to continue on the path of sustainable development. For this purpose, the economic vulnerability criteria to qualify for the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance should be eased compared to Regulation (EU) No 978/2012, to facilitate access by a larger number of countries graduating from the least developed country category. (13) Preferences should be designed to promote further economic growth and, thereby, to respond positively to the need for sustainable development. Under the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, the ad valorem tariffs should, therefore, be suspended for the beneficiary countries concerned. The specific duties should also be suspended, unless combined with an ad valorem duty. (14) Countries that fulfil the eligibility criteria for the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance should be able to benefit from the additional tariff preferences if, upon their application, the Commission determines that the relevant conditions are met. (15) Countries that have been granted the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 should submit a new application within two years after the date of application of this Regulation. In order, however, to ensure continuity and legal certainty for economic operators, the tariff preferences under the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance provided for in Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 are to be maintained during the period in which their application is assessed. Requests for technical and financial assistance from applicant countries related to the ratification and implementation of the conventions can be looked upon favourably. (16) The Commission and where appropriate the European External Action Service should monitor the status of ratification of the international conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection and good governance and their effective 18 United Nations (2015). Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 25 September 2015, Transforming our World: the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development (A/RES/70/1), available at: https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld ",
        "EN 20 EN implementation, by examining the relevant information, in particular where available the conclusions and recommendations of the relevant monitoring bodies established under those conventions. Every three years, the Commission should present to the European Parliament and the Council a report on the status of ratification of the respective conventions, the compliance of the beneficiary countries with any reporting obligations under those conventions, and the status of the implementation of the conventions in practice. (17) For the purposes of monitoring of implementation and, where applicable, withdrawal of tariff preferences, reports from relevant monitoring bodies are essential. However, such reports may be supplemented by other information available to the Commission, including information obtained under bilateral or multilateral technical assistance programmes, and through other sources of information, provided they are accurate and reliable. This could include information from the European Parliament and the Council, governments, international organisations, civil society, social partners, or complaints received through the SEP provided they satisfy the relevant requirements. Shortcomings identified during the monitoring process may inform the Commission\u2019s future programming of development assistance in a more targeted manner. (18) In July 2020, the Commission appointed the Chief Trade Enforcement Officer with the role of enforcing trade rules. In this connection, in November 2020, the Commission launched a new complaints mechanism, the Single Entry Point (\u2018SEP\u2019), as part of its increased efforts to strengthen the enforcement and implementation of trade commitments. Through the SEP, the Commission receives complaints on various matters related to trade policy, including breaches of the GSP commitments. Such new system of complaints should be integrated within the framework of this Regulation. (19) The special arrangement for the least-developed countries (EBA) should continue to grant duty free access to the Union market for products originating in the least developed countries, as recognised and classified by the United Nations (UN), except for trade in arms. For a country no longer classified by the UN as a least-developed country, a transitional period should be established, to alleviate any adverse effects caused by the removal of the tariff preferences granted under that arrangement. Tariff preferences provided under the special arrangement for the least-developed countries should continue to be granted for those least developed countries, which benefit from another preferential market access arrangement with the Union. (20) As regards the standard GSP arrangement, the differentiation between tariff preferences for non-sensitive products and tariff preferences for sensitive products should be maintained, to take account of the situation of the sectors manufacturing the same products in the Union. (21) Common Customs Tariff duties on non-sensitive products should continue to be suspended, while duties on sensitive products should enjoy a tariff reduction, in order to ensure a satisfactory utilisation rate while at the same time taking account of the situation of the corresponding Union industries. (22) Such a tariff reduction should be sufficiently attractive, in order to motivate traders to make use of the opportunities offered by the scheme. Therefore, the ad valorem duties should generally be reduced by a flat rate of 3,5 percentage points from the 'most favoured nation' duty rate, while such duties for textiles and textile goods should be ",
        "EN 21 EN reduced by 20 %. Specific duties should be reduced by 30 %. Where a minimum duty is specified, that minimum duty should not apply. (23) Duties should be suspended totally, where the preferential treatment for an individual import declaration results in an ad valorem duty of 1 % or less or in a specific duty of EUR 2 or less, since the cost of collecting such duties might be higher than the revenue gained. (24) Product graduation should be based on criteria related to sections and chapters of the Common Customs Tariff. Product graduation should apply in respect of a section or sub-section in order to reduce cases where heterogeneous products are graduated. The graduation of a section or a sub-section (made up of chapters) for a beneficiary country should be applied when the section meets the criteria for graduation over three consecutive years, in order to increase predictability and fairness of graduation by eliminating the effect of large and exceptional variations in the import statistics. Product graduation should not apply to the beneficiary countries of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) and the beneficiary countries of the special arrangement for the least-developed countries (EBA) as they share a very similar economic profile rendering them vulnerable because of a low, non-diversified export base.- The tariff preferences provided for in this Regulation apply to products originating in the beneficiary countries in accordance with the rules of origin laid down in the Union Customs Code and the legal acts adopted in accordance with the powers conferred by that Code, in particular Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 19 . and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447 20 . Regional cumulation between countries of different regional groups and extended cumulation should be granted provided that the applicant beneficiary country brings sufficient evidence that cumulation responds to its development, financing and trade needs, thus leading, amongst others, to economic growth, elimination of poverty, diversification of exports and industrialisation, and provided that it does not impact negatively on the situation of other countries, especially EBA beneficiary countries. When assessing whether granting cumulation responds to the requesting country\u2019s development, financing and trade needs, the Commission should take into account the beneficiary country\u2019s dependency on the supplying country and future perspectives with regard to the products in question. (25) The reasons for temporary withdrawal of the arrangements under the scheme should include serious and systematic violations of the principles laid down in international conventions concerning core human rights (including certain principles of international humanitarian law enshrined in those conventions), labour rights, climate and environmental protection, and good governance,so as to promote the objectives of those conventions. Tariff preferences under the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance should be temporarily withdrawn if the beneficiary country does not respect its binding undertaking to maintain the ratification and effective implementation of those conventions or to comply with the 19 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 of 28 July 2015 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards detailed rules concerning certain provisions of the Union Customs Code (OJ L 343, 29.12.2015, p. 1). 20 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447 of 24 November 2015 laying down detailed rules for implementing certain provisions of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Union Customs Code (OJ L 343, 29.12.2015, p. 558 \u2013 893).

The temporary withdrawal should continue until the reasons justifying it no longer apply. In situations characterised by an exceptional gravity of the violations, the Commission should have the power to respond rapidly by adopting measures within a shorter timeline. Under the Union\u2019s zero tolerance approach for child labour the reasons for temporary withdrawal should include exports of goods made by internationally prohibited child labour, as well as forced labour including slavery and prison labour, as identified in the relevant Conventions in Annex VI. (26) Orderly international migration can bring important benefits to the countries of origin and destination of migrants and contribute to their sustainable development needs. Increasing coherence between trade, development and migration policies is key to ensure that the benefits of migration accrue mutually to both the origin and destination countries. In this respect, it is essential for both origin and destination countries to address common challenges, such as, stepping up cooperation on readmission of own nationals and their sustainable reintegration in the country of origin, in particular in order to avoid a constant drain in active population in the countries of origin, with the ensuing long-term consequences on development, and to ensure that migrants are treated with dignity. (27) Return, readmission and reintegration are a common challenge for the Union and its partners. In particular, every State has the obligation to readmit its own nationals under international customary law, and multilateral international conventions such as the Convention on International Civil Aviation signed in Chicago on 7 December 1944. Improving sustainable reintegration and capacity building would significantly strengthen the local development in the partner countries. (28) Under Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 and its predecessors, tariff preferences have been withdrawn in respect of imports of products originating in Belarus (full withdrawal) and Cambodia (partial withdrawal) due to serious and systematic violations of the principles of certain human and labour rights conventions. The reasons justifying the withdrawal of preferences are still valid, therefore, the temporary withdrawal for Belarus and Cambodia should be maintained under this Regulation. (29) In order to achieve a balance between the need for better targeting, greater coherence and transparency on the one hand, and better promoting sustainable development and good governance through a unilateral trade preference scheme on the other hand, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amendments to the Annexes to this Regulation and temporary withdrawals of tariff preferences due to serious and systematic violations of the principles set out in the relevant conventions with respect to human and labour rights, climate and environmental protection, and good governance and other relevant grounds set out in this Regulation, as well as procedural rules regarding the submission of applications for the tariff preferences granted under the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, the conduct of a temporary withdrawal and safeguard investigations in order to establish uniform and detailed technical arrangements. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert ",
        "EN 23 EN level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making 21 . In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. In order to provide a stable framework for economic operators, the power to adopt an act in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of repealing a decision on temporary withdrawal under the urgent procedure before that decision to temporarily withdraw tariff preferences becomes applicable, where the reasons justifying temporary withdrawal no longer apply. The Commission should also be empowered to adopt delegated acts to postpone the date of application of an act imposing the temporary withdrawal, or to modify its scope, for reasons related to a global sanitary emergency or other exceptional circumstances. (30) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 22 . (31) The advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts on suspension from the tariff preferences of certain GSP sections in respect of beneficiary countries and on the initiation of a temporary withdrawal procedure, taking into account the nature and impact of those acts. (32) The examination procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts on safeguard investigations and on suspension of the tariff preference arrangements where imports may cause serious disturbance to Union markets. (33) In order to ensure the integrity and orderly functioning of the scheme, the Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to temporary withdrawals due to non-compliance with customs-related procedures and obligations, imperative grounds of urgency so require.
