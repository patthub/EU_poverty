        "4 1 Introduction The Smart Specialisation Strategies Platform (S3P) assists the European Union Member States and the EU regions to design, develop and implement research and innovation strategies and policy portfolios to enable smart specialisation. The Platform was initiated in 2011 to provide information, methodologies, expertise, peer-reviews and advice to national and regional policymakers, as well as to promote mutual learning, trans-national co-operation and to contribute to academic debates around the concept of smart specialisation. These strategies set priorities at national and regional levels to build competitive advantage by developing and matching research and innovation (R&I) own strengths with business needs, to address emerging opportunities and market developments in a coherent manner, while avoiding duplication and fragmentation of efforts. The strategies developed can also concern the transition to a low-carbon economy through the implementation of energy efficiency measures and sustainable energy sources. The EU has set five ambitious EU level objectives for 2020 on employment, innovation, education, social inclusion and climate/energy 1 , and Member States have adopted their own national targets in each of these areas, which must be underpinned by implementation strategies and actions at national and sub-national level. The role of the S3P is to link in regional authorities across Europe viand help them to design smart specialisation strategies promoting the entrepreneurial discovery process, using the European Structural Investment Funds (ESIF) efficiently and building synergies between different EU, national and regional policies, as well as public and private investments 2 . In this context, the initiative on Heating and Cooling aims at helping regions to develop their strategies on this specific energy theme. One of the major activities planned is the organisation of a regional workshop. The Workshop on Smart Specialisation on Heating and Cooling was organised by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, with the support of DG ENERGY and DG REGIO, and held in Brussels in the Conference Centre Albert Borschette, between May 30 th and June 1 st 2018. The Workshop was focused on two key topics: \u25cf Regional heating and cooling priorities from technology and energy planning perspectives; \u25cf Heating and cooling financing. The aim of the workshop was: \u25cf To understand the current state-of-play and the expected future of the heating and cooling (H&C) sector across EU regions; \u25cf To discuss the role of regional authorities and their cooperation with national and EU entities on how to uptake the ESIF funds to decarbonise the heating and cooling sector \u2014 including barriers, opportunities and challenges. \u25cf To support the efficient uptake of the cohesion funds by sharing knowledge and experience from regions and experts in H&C topics; \u25cf To disseminate information about useful tools and methodologies for planning, implementation and monitoring; \u25cf To foster the cooperation among regions; creating long\u2014term partnerships (i.e. Vanguard initiative / Partnerships in the S3P-E) (1) Europe 2020 strategy https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy- coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/european- semester/framework/europe-2020-strategy_en ( 2 ) Factsheet on Cohesion Policy 2014-2020.

        "6 2 Regional heating and cooling present and future The Workshop on Smart Specialisation on Heating and Cooling looked at policy, technical, business and financing aspects of regional heating and cooling strategies/planning and implementation. The participants stated their interest in the S3PE, as well as in the Workshop. They listed a large number of topics of interest, such as to understand implementation practices at the local level, to implement monitoring of programmes, to design local H&C strategies, how to integrate energy strategies with decarbonisation aims, how to utilize the RES potential for H&C, how to integrate biomass usage, how to integrate with sustainable construction concepts, what smart technology/smart buildings means for H&C, to find business models to develop H&C and other energy projects, and especially through combining energy efficiency and RES, how to combine different funding mechanisms, etc. The following section gives a review of the most important issues that were raised by the presentations and the following discussions. 2.1 Strategies, priorities, and technology solutions in the EU regions The EU has a comprehensive energy legislation to achieve energy efficiency and renewable energy legislation goals. The EU energy efficiency, renewables, climate, as well as employment and housing policies are fitted into the framework of the Headline Targets of the European Council ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. European Council Headline Targets Source : Eva Hoos presentation The EU energy and climate headline targets are the means to achieve overall policy goals set at the EU or at International level, namely the European Energy Union and the Clean Energy Package, as well as the 2015 Paris Agreement. (Eva Hoos) The 2020 targets are still challenging for some countries, although time is getting short to comply with them. The average energy efficiency target for the EU is on track, although there are also Member States that need improvement (e.g. Romania, Slovenia, Poland, Italy, Hungary, Spain, Greece). Energy consumption has been growing in most of the sectors and most of the countries (Juan Pablo Jimenez Navarro). ",

See Abbreviation section (page 60) for the Member State codes. 2.1.1 Status of Heating and Cooling Heating and cooling makes up half of the total final energy consumption in the EU or ca. 6 500 TWh, with space heating responsible for 27 %, process heating 16 %, space cooling 1 %, and hot water 4 % of total final energy consumption % (Eva Hoos and Juan Pablo Jimenez Navarro) (see Figure 3 ). Around 75 % of heating and cooling demand is supplied from fossil fuels 4 , making an important source of CO 2 emissions and air pollution this sector a. The residential sector is the most prominent user of H&C, and accounted for 54 % of final energy heating and cooling consumption in 2015, followed by services\u2019 share of 21 % and industry's of 24 %. (Juan Pablo Jimenez Navarro). In general, the heating and cooling sector is characterised by low efficiencies, and large amounts of waste heat. Figure 3.

        "8 The H&C sector features large saving potentials due to the inefficiencies in the systems (Eva Hoos): \u2014 75 % of EU buildings are inefficient and obsolete, and large part will need energy renovation; \u2014 Around 50 % of the heating equipment is beyond its technical lifetime and will need to be replaced in the next 5-10 years; \u2014 The share of district heating varies widely across countries from cs. 65 % in Latvia to practically 0% in Malta, Cyprus, Ireland and Spain. (2013 data); \u2014 District heating has a high potential to incorporate renewable energy sources, nevertheless in 2012 the main fuels were natural gas (40 %), coal (29%), while renewable source other than %), and biomass (16 %) are marginal (below 1 %). The share of cooling demand within the H&C energy demand is quite low at the moment across Member States, but naturally varies widely, reflecting the climate conditions ( Figure 4 ). (Sibylle Braungardt) Figure 4. Final energy demand for heating and cooling in EU Member States Source: Sibylle Braungardt presentation The participating regions have different heating and cooling degree day profiles due to different climates, nevertheless heating constitutes around 50 % of the total final energy demand in all regions.

Source: Juan Pablo Jimenez Navarro presentation 2.1.2 Policy foresight Energy efficiency is the most cost-effective way of achieving Energy Union objectives. Policy conclusions for 2030 are (Timoth\u00e9e No\u00ebl): 1. Building renovation has to do more. 2. Financing has a more important role to play. 3. Digital/ICT has a big potential to contribute. The key EU directives are under revision, to strengthen the efforts in Member States. The EPBD revision includes stronger long term renovation strategies for Member States, aiming at decarbonisation by 2050 and with a solid financial component. A \u201cSmart Readiness Indicator\u201d is introduced, to be implemented through a combination of delegated and implementing acts. Requirements for ducting to allow cables for charging points for electric vehicles in new and refurbished buildings are introduced with (a few) electric vehicle charging points in all non-residential buildings. Member States will have to express their energy performance requirements in ways that allow cross-national comparisons. New provisions are foreseen to promote building automation, room temperature controls, heating systems that are effective at part load conditions, and the inspection of ventilation systems. Furthermore, a greater role for automation is provided for under Articles 14 and 15, and on self-regulating devices in Article 8(1). (Timoth\u00e9e No\u00ebl) The review of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) , Article 7 will extend the energy saving obligations post 2020 (1.5 % per year), based on simplified and streamlined rules with strengthened social dimension and in coherence with the EPBD. The overall aim is to attract private investment and to boost the renovation rate of buildings, and thus to contribute to all climate and energy targets for 2030. (Timoth\u00e9e No\u00ebl) The European Commission has proposed a Renewable Energy Directive recast to set us on track to achieve the proposed at least 27% RES target for 2030 , as compared to the currently foreseen 24.7 % business-as-usual scenario. The proposal builds on the ",
        "10 current directive (2009/28/EC), by strengthening and complementing the current provisions (see Figure 6 ). In particular the proposed heating and cooling Articles (23 & 24) aim to ensure that the largest energy using sector is addressed within the post-2020 renewable framework and contribute to the EU renewable target. (Eva Hoos) Figure 6. New provisions and revisions in the recast Renewable Energy Directive Source : Eva Hoos presentation The RES directive covers both heating and cooling, however a methodology to account for RES used for cooling is not yet developed, as was explained by Sibylle Braungardt. In her presentation a technical solution was recommended to make up for this lack of methodology. According to Ms. Hoos, the aim of the proposed Renewable Energy Directive is to ensure that in the future energy system, the consumer will play a central and more decisive role. The European Commission proposal foresees more prosumers, i.e. users to be empowered to produce their own energy. But the consumers, as private investors are the means to mobilise private investments, too. These will ensure that citizens can take critical role in the energy transition. The European Commission proposed a new Action plan on sustainable finance in March 2018 to reorient capital flows towards sustainable investment, in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, manage financial risks stemming from climate change, environmental degradation and social issues, and to foster transparency and long- termism in financial and economic activity (Timothee Noel). 2.1.3 Past and present: barriers and enablers The EU Strategy on Heating and Cooling (COM(2016) 51 Final) places particular emphasis on efficiency improvement, deployment, as well as incorporation of more renewable energy sources in the heating and cooling sector as a priority for the EU. It also underlines the possible benefits of linking heating and cooling with the electricity sector as this could enable realising synergies in terms of energy and cost savings in buildings and industry. The Smart Specialisation Strategies Framework is a fact-based, dynamic entrepreneurial discovery process, involving all forms of innovation (social, business, etc.), and has an ecosystem approach. The specialization aspect is seen in differentiation, concentration, synergies, and place-based economic transformation. (Juan Pablo Jimenez Navarro) This can for example consist of collaboration between two or more regions on ",
        "11 developing new technologies, which should improve skills and eventually create job opportunities. The S3P-E regions have implemented H&C projects in different domains, and have experience with almost all types of relevant projects: building retrofits, thermal works, decentralized energy production, campaigns and trainings, and demonstration projects. They have participated in a number of international/interregional projects related to the heating and cooling topic: see Figure 7 . Figure 7. Flagship projects Source : Juan Pablo Jimenez Navarro presentation There are many challenges as well as opportunities associated with the H&C sector, which were reviewed by the JRC (Juan Pablo Jimenez Navarro). 1) The progress on energy efficiency and renewable energy deployment in many Member States still shows a gap towards the 2020 targets. 2) A significant increase of demand is expected especially in cooling needs. 3) Technological challenges are faced by the Regions. Some of the technologies may need large investments, significant infrastructural changes/modifications and the adaptation of user behaviour especially for energy district level solutions. Thus for example the implementation of a district heating network requires: i. a high upfront investment mainly related to the thermal network, ii. the replacement of conventional end user heating systems (i.e. individual boilers) by the heat exchange station per building or user. 4) Energy poverty was mentioned by a number of presenters, because this is closely linked to the status of the H&C sector. When it comes to the design of regional energy planning, regional authorities have to ensure the inclusiveness of the future energy solutions. A few indicators are shown in Figure 16 . A sustainable project should take into consideration the human dimension (e.g. health), the social dimension (e.g. increased value of the property), and the environmental dimension (including embodied energy). (Andreas Hermelink). Heating and cooling, as well as the building system as an end-use place is challenged by the Human dimension. The number of unhealthy buildings in 2014 was shown by Andreas Hermelink ( Figure 8 ). Almost twice as many Europeans report poor health when living in a damp home. 1\u00bd times as many Europeans report poor health when living in a dark home. 5) The economic value of a renovated house can significantly increase as opposed to a building that has not been renovated making the energy investment more attractive not only in terms of energy performance but also from real estate market perspective. ",
        "12 6) Significant difficulties were reported by the Regions to the JRC in a survey in relation to funds and funding schemes (most of which are in line with other similar reviews), including: a. Too complicated procedures, rules are unclear; b. Too many documentary obligations; c. Need for a clearer and more complete classification of actions; d. Lack of pre-finance: need for finance and technical support at the design and feasibility study stages; e. Lack of coordination among administrations, in particular lack of clarity in division of tasks between national and regional authorities, or changing roles; f. Lack of competences and dedicated staff; g. Capitalisation of the projects results: e.g. dissemination of monitoring visits and audits as a source of knowledge-sharing h. Need to explore new financial mechanisms The survey was filled in by participating regions in the workshop (8 regions) as a preparatory activity to facilitate further discussions during the workshop. Figure 8. Number of unhealthy people due to low quality indoor comfort Source : Andreas Hermelink Suggestions to overcome some of the above barriers were discussed repeatedly. A collection of them as follows: 1) Local/regional level: a. Mainstream H&C strategies in local planning and strategies; b. Participate in networking, develop partnerships; c. Collaborate internally and with the national administration; d. Identify local problems and communicate them to higher levels (national, EU); e. Set targets at achievable yet ambitious levels; f. Local targets and achievements will encourage others; g. Select the appropriate sequence of actions, e.g. energy efficiency first, or decentralized systems first, and size DH systems to the lower demand. 2) EU level: a.

Reflect on shared local problems, e.g. on technical or financial issues. 2.1.4 Future scenarios: heating and cooling forecast Scenarios about the future of energy demand, including the H&C demand have been developed by many models, e.g. at the Technical University of Vienna (TUW). Based on the results of the Invert/EE-Lab model in Hartner et al. (2018) 5 , a 28 % decrease in final energy demand for heating and cooling can be expected from current policy, and 38 % in ambitious policy scenario is possible by 2050, with a parallel 3-fold increase in final energy demand for space cooling ( Figure 9 ). The total demand change for heating vs. cooling was also forecast by Fraunhofer ISI for 2030, and the strong growth of space cooling can be seen in Figure 10 . (Lukas Kranzl, Sibylle Braungardt) These scenarios are realisable with technological advancements, including an increase in the penetration of heat pumps, solar thermal and biomass, and an increased market share of district heating ( Figure 11 ). (Lukas Kranzl) However, even the ambitious scenario, resulting in a 73 % reduction of carbon emissions from the H&C sector in 2050, is not enough to reach the Paris target. Figure 9.

Technological transition in the BaU and the ambitious policy scenario of the Invert/EE- Lab model in the EU28 Source : Lukas Kranzl presentation In order to achieve decarbonisation of the H&C sector, the TUW found that there is a need to: \uf0b7 Increase building refurbishment and efficiency improvements (~40 % to >50 % reduction of heat demand 2015-2050, EU-28); \uf0b7 Increase the share of decentralised renewables: biomass, heat pumps, solar should make up 40 %-60 % of H&C demand in 2050, EU-28; \uf0b7 District heating needs to expand and achieve high connection rates (~15 %-40 % of H&C demand, EU-28); \uf0b7 Share of renewables in DH should be up to ~80 %-95 % in 2050, EU-28; \uf0b7 DH needs to use excess heat integration; ",

According to Eva Hoos, the new technical systems are underlined by: \u25cf new fuel mix for H&C; \u25cf new types of appliances that meet the new standards; \u25cf this can bring about changes to the supply chain, and a changed infrastructure, e.g. heat networks and electricity network; \u25cf while the solutions have to be adapted and brought closer to the consumers, making the reliable, affordable, and understandable; \u25cf buildings as a whole can become more flexible and adaptable both at construction and planning phase (integrating EE and RES) and at the use phase. Participants at the workshop emphasized the difficulty to realize the integration of RE and EE in real life projects, because investments are often led by cost minimization. \u25cf focus on building retrofits has to be increased across Europe. To achieve these technical and policy goals, appropriate policies at local level and coordination with the actors is necessary. Investments require both public and private funding (see more in Section 2.2). The national and local priorities have to be brought in line. The future energy system will not be one-directional as today, but more flexible and more diverse, with a lot of possibilities for combinations. 2.1.5.1 Heating technologies Several presentations and the following discussions compared and contrasted various technological solutions available for the regions for heating. These can be small or large scale. Lukas Kranzl showed forecasts about the potential impact of various technologies on local energy demand volumes. Building renovation, district heating, RES, heat pumps The TUW looked at alternative energy system development scenarios in the case of the city of Herten (Austria) by 2030. Depending on the type of investments, such as renovations only, decentralized or centralized (district heating) investments can bring about around 60 % final energy demand savings compared to BaU, but the technology mix will be very different depending on the choices ( Figure 12 ). ",
        "16 Figure 12. Forecast of the final energy demand and the technology mix in Herten in 2030 Source : Lukas Kranzl presentation Solar district heating and heat pumps The combination of a large solar plant and heat pumps has been considered for the city of Graz (Austria). Heat costs for heat pump based solutions were projected to be in the range of those solutions with natural gas. Combining with heat pumps had the advantage to lower the final energy demand that had to be supplied by solar sources. (Lukas Kranzl) District heating Using the TUW scenarios, it can be determined that the distribution costs of DH can be reduced by renovation, especially by achieving high connection rates, e.g. from 45 % to 90 % could mean a reduction of costs in the range of 2-4 times. (Lukas Kranzl) Paradoxically, countries with the highest buildings efficiency are also those where DH grids are most developed: this is the case for Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and to a lesser extent Germany and Austria. (Cyril Roger-Lacan) In other cases, such as social housing in Eastern and Central Europe, jointly upgrading district heating and buildings could provide better business cases than \u201conly\u201d building refurbishment. (Cyril Roger-Lacan) Cyril Roger-Lacan and other participants emphasized that the modernization of DH models is necessary ( Figure 13 ). 11% 29% 58% 59% 61% 62% 59% 58% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% - 100.000 200.000 300.000 400.000 500.000 600.000 C O 2 e m i s s i o n r e d u c t i o n F E D f o r S H a n d D H W [ M W h ] DH heat pump DH biomass boiler DH solar thermal DH waste incineration DH coal boiler Individual solar thermal Individual heat pump Individual direct electric heat Individual biomass boiler Individual oil boiler Individual coal boiler Individual gas boiler ",
        "17 Figure 13. The main differences between traditional and modern DH systems Source: Cyril Roger-Lacan Heat pumps As the energy demand for heating decreases due to building renovation and high efficiency buildings, the cooling demand is expected to rise significantly, and thus the required electricity demand, too. By 2050, TUW forecasts a 200 % increase of cooling electricity demand. The electricity grid in this case has to cope with the load from the heat pumps. This is possible as long as the building refurbishment has gained momentum reducing energy demand and indoor temperature levels, therefore heat pumps are applied in suitable buildings (i.e. buildings requiring moderate inlet temperature levels of the heating system) to allow efficient operation with acceptable COP. Heat pumps, due to their flexible operation, reduce systems costs by around -0.5% compared to the 2015 base case scenario due to the lower heat generation costs of heat pumps is about EUR 6/MWh. 2.1.5.2 Cooling Currently space cooling demand is mainly provided by electricity-driven vapour compression systems, however several low-carbon cooling technologies based on renewable sources are available. The basic concepts of supplying space cooling were presented by Sibylle Braungardt (see Figure 14 ). Some of the technologies were explained in details. ",
        "18 Figure 14. Overview of cooling technologies Source : Sibylle Braungardt presentation For electricity-driven vapour compression cooling systems as well as cooling systems driven by heat, the main strategies towards low-carbon cooling are to increase the efficiency of the cooling system and maximizing the share of renewable electricity. (Sibylle Braungardt) Free cooling systems using natural heat sinks can reduce CO 2 emissions for space cooling. (Sibylle Braungardt) Interestingly there is not much known about passive cooling and shading. The envelope has been shown to reduce heating demand, but not enough similar data are available for cooling demand. TUW includes shading in models, and has shown that these can have large impact. Furthermore, the European Solar Shading Association has done some studies. (discussion) 2.1.5.3 Local technology portfolio The workshop included a lot of discussions on which technology fits best in the regions, and depending on the local circumstances, how to select among them. This is a critical issue when local plans have to be designed. Clearly, there is no silver bullet. The examples presented have shown the benefits and challenges underlying different options. Decarbonisation of the H&C system is an opportunity and a challenge, and to achieve it all ingredients (technologies and planning) will be required. The examples of combining technologies show that the benefits of several technologies can be reaped at the same time. (Lukas Kranzl) 2.1.6 Exemplary development projects A rather large number of examples of technological solutions \u2013 from district heating, through heat pumps, geothermal cooling systems and comprehensive building refurbishments \u2013 were presented with the presentations and during discussions. These are summarized below. ",
        "19 2.1.6.1 Refurbishment of a multi-family building using passive house elements in Duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros (Hungary) The EU-supported SOLANOVA project was the first renovation of a multi-apartment building with passive house components in Eastern Europe (Hungary). The project has won a number of awards. The local stakeholders and the developers decided together how \u201cdeep\u201d to go. A 30 kWh/(m 2 a) threshold of target heat demand was set as a tipping point between renovation and demolition. Furthermore, embodied energy was taken into consideration, not only direct energy efficiency. The social dimension was also treated in the project, e.g. through surveys before and after the renovation. Concerns were with summer overheating, therefore the project had to install passive shading to overcome these. (Andreas Hermelink) 2.1.6.2 District heating and cooling networks in Barcelona (Spain) Barcelona aims to improve into a self-sufficient city. In recent years, two neighbourhoods were revived based on the implementation of locally designed DH and DC networks. DISTRICLIMA is the revitalization of the East Neighbourhood of Barcelona, which used to be an old industrial area, building on \u201cthe Knowledge Economy\u201d. Discussions started in 1998, and the project was implemented by 2010, and extended in 2015. The implementation is a complex urban development plan, including mobility plan, public space renewal, new energy networks, etc. Waste is used to produce steam (DH and DC) and electricity. In the West Neighbourhood, the ECOENERGIES project was implemented in a similar manner, in an industrial area called \u201cLa Marina\u201d before. The heart of the area became the natural gas processing plant in the Harbour of Barcelona, where biomass from parks and gardens of Barcelona are fed into taking advantage from the waste to be a self-sufficient city. Barcelona also depends a lot \u2013 in the energy system development \u2013 on solar and wind energy, and plans to multiply its local energy production and reduce external energy dependency. They have advocated less regulation; therefore joining the network is voluntary, but successful as proven by the increase in the network length (more than 18 km) and number of building connected (100). The business model is always locally adapted, therefore can be PPP, Special Purpose Vehicle, Energy Service Company (ESCO), or Customer-owned Cooperative. (Manuel Torrent) Type of project : Renovation of a multi-apartment building (42 apartments) Energy savings : winter heating demand reduced from 120-180 kWh/m 2 to 15- 50 kWh/m 2 Investment cost : 225,200 EUR \u2013 European Union, 238,000 EUR \u2013 Hungarian Ministry for Environment, 120,000 EUR \u2013 Local Government of Duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros, 160,000 EUR \u2013 Water, Sewage and Heat Supplier of Duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros, 50,000 - owners Financing sources : EU FP5 (for the research and demonstration part), national, local and supplier sources combined with a very low rate of owners\u2019 contribution.

        "20 2.1.6.3 District heating and cooling in Querfurt (Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany) An example of reviving an ageing, partly obsolete DH infrastructure through a comprehensive holistic concept. (Cyril Roger-Lacan) At start the DH grid was an ageing, gas fuelled, inherited DH grid, with gradual disconnection of large customers moving to standalone solutions. With much of the demand leaving, the common costs were left on fewer and fewer users, above all they were social housing customers. This made a system upgrade impossible, too. A holistic project was designed. Conception and construction took place between 2011- 2015, and the grid started operation in 2015. Building on the city\u2019s fundamental scenarios (demographics, city development, economic development), a large variety of options and potential projects were considered. A key design element was the close connection with local stakeholders. Benchmarking of potential alternatives considered economic/environmental/social welfare criteria established with the municipality. As the project outcome was a complete reengineering of the DHC concept. A new methanisation plant from local agricultural waste + cogeneration provides most of the heat. As a result 40 % CO 2 reduction in the DH system, and 30 % heating bill average reduction compared to BAU scenario was achieved. A 25 % return on equity for city investment was also achieved. 2.1.6.4 Smart Heating and Cooling network of Paris Saclay Paris Saclay is a major scientific, economic and academic cluster, and urban development project at the outskirts of Paris. (Cyril Roger-Lacan) The development : 1 740 000 m\u00b2 to be built between 2015 and 2028 with associated infrastructure. The total costs of investment are foreseen to be EUR 1.5 billion for real estate projects, and EUR 1 billion for laboratories, scientific facilities and collaborative Type of project : Implementation of District Heating and District Cooling Networks Energy savings : Key benefits of the district heating and cooling systems is the reduction of CO2 emissions (more efficient system), and the improvement of the local living and working conditions (noise, dust, heat island effect reduction) Investment cost : Financing sources : Public-private partnership (PPP), Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), Energy Service Company (ESCO), Customer-owned Cooperative.

        "21 institutes. The development of a DH and DC systems is involved with the size of investment around EUR million50 million for 10 km district heating and cooling network. The grid is built on the two geothermal drills and 1 200 000 m\u00b2 space connected to the network by 2021. The result of the project is foreseen on several levels. Due to the locally available geothermal, i.e. low carbon source, the system will run with 60 % local RES, and have an impact of less than 100g CO 2 / kWh. Balancing heating and cooling needs is solved between different purpose buildings (residential <-> offices <-> educational facilities). The DH and DC can be provided at a competitive price compared with natural gas price, with long term price stability. Possible electrical and heat demand response and real time optimization. 2.1.6.5 STACCATO project The S ustainable T echnologies A nd C ombined C ommunity A pproaches T ake O ff (STACCATO) project took place in Sofia (Bulgaria), Budapest (Hungary) and Amsterdam (the Netherlands). In \u00d3buda (part of Budapest), Hungary a block of 800 homes was renovated in just 6 months in 2009. Financial contributions from the European Commission and the National Government enabled an own private contribution of only 27 % of the costs. (Evgeni Atanasov) On the other hand, in Bulgaria the initially planned 5 panel buildings to be renovated had to be renegotiated. The buildings were in very poor condition and there was lack of agreement between the residents for general renovations, thus other partners and sources of co-financing had to be included. The project was redirected to monolithic old multifamily buildings in the area. Cooperation with the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Works (MRDPW) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) was established and a lot of communication took place. Around 150 buildings expressed interest. Technical inspections were made and a sociological survey was conducted on the needs, problems and readiness for financial participation. Conceptual projects for solar collector installations on 3 buildings were prepared. The first stage was completed in August 2011 with 3 renovated buildings. Combination of building refurbishment to improve energy performance and RES (solar thermal) were implemented. A second stage was added using a national support scheme, and in a third phase a hospital renovation was added. The challenges of STACCATO: \uf0b7 For the first time such project was done in Bulgaria; \uf0b7 There were no high-rise multifamily residential buildings with installed solar collectors in Sofia before; \uf0b7 The technology was yet to enter on the market and was not widespread and popular; \uf0b7 Required relatively higher initial investment. Type of project : Complex urban development project Energy savings : saving of 100g CO2/kWh Investment cost : 50 million EUR Financing sources : Local government and EU funds More information at : https://www.tilia.info/en/geothermy-based-smart-district- heating-and-cooling-grid-of-paris-saclay/ ",
        "22 Results: - The energy savings achieved by STACCATO were about 50-55 % per year; - Solar installations are paid for 8-10 years, which is 1/3 of their life; - The project not only improved the living conditions in residential buildings but also showed that the inclusion of RES in renovation of buildings significantly increases their energy efficiency. - 2.1.6.6 Community owned/shared projects The solar and seasonal water storage DH system project in Gram (Denmark) includes an innovative and flexible heat supply, enabling to integrate a higher share of renewables and surplus heat, and create synergies with the electricity sector and balancing services to the electricity grid. (Cyril Roger-Lacan) The components of the heat production and storage/distribution are: \uf0b7 44 000 m 2 solar thermal panels (62 %) \uf0b7 A 10 MW electric boiler (14 %) \uf0b7 A 5 MW e /6 MWth CHP gas engine (9 %) \uf0b7 A 5.5 MW gas boiler (7 %) \uf0b7 A 900 kW heat pump (5 %) \uf0b7 2 MW industrial surplus heat (3 %) The seasonal storage pit (122 000 m 3 ) enables to integrate complementary technologies and to optimise the generation in real time through an automatic control unit, based on technical and economic criteria (improved flexibility and cost-efficiency). This way it can also provide balancing services to the Danish and German TSOs. Above all, the governance is innovative: owned by the customers through a non-profit citizen-owned entity. 2.1.7 Communities The workshop focused much on community assistance and peer-assistance. It was actually organised in the framework of the Thematic Smart Specialisation Strategies Platform on Energy, or S3P-E. The S3P-E is the space where Member States, regions and energy stakeholders receive support for an optimal and effective uptake of European Structural and Investment Funds for sustainable energy. The S3P-E promotes activities at national, regional and local levels, for achieving a shared vision on knowledge-based energy policy, with the aim of better alignment of regional and local activities through the identification of the technologies and innovative solutions. Type of project : Renovation of multi-apartment buildings Energy savings : 50-55 % per year compared to BaU Investment cost : EUR 20 166 712 (in three cities: Sofia, Budapest, Amsterdam) Financing sources : Local government and EU funds More information at: https://smartcities-infosystem.eu/sites-projects/projects/staccato ",
        "23 The S3P-E allows its members to share experiences and activities on innovation and energy-related policies and establish partnerships between regions and Member States that have identified renewable energy technologies and innovative energy solutions as priorities in their S3. The European Commission and the Member States and their Regions are/can become participants of the Platform. Figure 15. Already existing Energy Partnerships under the S3P Source : Fernando Merida Martin The above shown Energy Partnerships have their own structures, members, and are very varied in their methods, sizes, and operational equipment. There are already a lot of lessons learnt from these partnerships. \uf0b7 There is a need for critical mass and peer learning at the regional level; \uf0b7 A joint initiative between European Commission and MS and regions is beneficial to pursue common interests; \uf0b7 The drivers of S3P implementation are primarily regional administrative capacity and strong leadership by regional actors; \uf0b7 The S3P fills in a gap by linking regional, energy and innovation policies; \uf0b7 The S3P is also important because promotes effective communication and collaboration between EU, MS and regional levels, which is otherwise very difficult and not prioritised; \uf0b7 Until now, it is clear that the functioning of this network is highly dependent on external support \uf0b7 There is a high participation amongst regions from most developed countries which led/co-led mostly of the activities, whereas less developed/eastern Europe regions are much less represented; \uf0b7 Partnerships experience difficulties in designing pilot projects, which is a very slow process; \uf0b7 Leading regions with well-defined projects and mature innovation clusters are unsure about how to engage or cooperate with others. Two partnerships also described their activities in more details: \uf0b7 Sustainable Buildings, which is the largest among them with 55 entities. Their chosen priority areas are: 1) Eco construction, bioclimatism and insulation of buildings, 2) Renewable energy integration in buildings, 3) Systems of maximum energy efficiency use in buildings and cities.

They aim to validate and demonstrate the sustainability of 2 nd generation bio-fuels. They have implemented a survey to identify regional capacities. The next step is to identify business demo cases. 2.1.8 Useful resources A number of various tools and methods were discussed during the three days of the workshop that are relevant either for the project managers, strategy and planning administrations or for acquisition of funding. 2.1.8.1 Heat Roadmap Europe The Heat Roadmap Europe (HRE) is a complex portal, with the basic function of providing and assessing data. Data are collected on building demand savings potential, the cost of saving energy, DH and DC potential, energy system potential. This is combined with GIS data and a specially available database can be accessed. Based on these, locally relevant energy system analyses are made. Technical reports, guidelines, and webinars are also available. Besides the data management, HRE actively communicates and disseminates information, aims to remove non-technical barriers to energy efficiency investments, and opens markets up. Regions can access for example a thermal atlas, which provides information about heat demand, biomass potentials, geothermal heat, and prospective supply areas. 2.1.8.2 Hotmaps The Hotmaps project develops a toolbox that supports heating and cooling mapping and planning processes. More information is available from www.hotmaps-project.eu Regions can access an open sources heating / cooling mapping and planning toolbox, which could help regions to analyse, model and map resources and solutions to supply energy within their territory. 2.1.8.3 European Energy Poverty Observatory Energy poverty is a critical problem linked to H&C. The European Energy Poverty Observatory was launched in January 2018 to step-up European efforts to fight energy poverty ( Figure 16 ), by improving the measuring, monitoring and sharing of knowledge and best practice.

The European Commission promotes the use of CBA for Structural Funds because they are objective and verifiable. CBA measures in money term all benefits and costs of a project for society. The basic rules of conducting CBAs are binding for all beneficiaries 6 . The structure proposed can be used for project proposal development. (see the presentation slides of Johan Carlsson). 2.1.8.6 Collection of financing and best practice examples The European Commission collects and published demonstration and example projects, for example those funded by ESIFs, and they are publicly available at: \uf0b7 https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/ \uf0b7 http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/EN/projects/ \uf0b7 http://ec.europa.eu/esf/main.jsp?catId=46 The De-risking Energy Efficiency Platform (DEEP) is an open source database containing real performance data of energy efficiency projects (> 10 000 energy efficiency projects). http://deep.eefig.eu . This forms part of the \u201cSmart Finance for smart buildings\u201d (SFSB) initiative (section 2.2.3.4). The IEA Annex 61 also collected examples of cost-effective measure bundles to reach deep-energy retrofits: \uf0b7 www.iea-annex61.org 2.2 Financing improved heating and cooling solutions Once there is an interest or even a decision to invest in energy efficiency improvement, raising the required funds is not easy. According to Paolo Bertoldi, interestingly, funding capacity is abundant, but bridging between financial resources and potential projects is missing. Financing energy efficiency projects (EEP) is difficult due to the traditions of the financing market. There is a disconnect between traditional asset-based lending to corporations and the necessary cash flow-based project financing to EEPs. The solution is difficult because energy efficiency markets are not developed enough to motivate local banks to invest in setting up an EEP lending infrastructure. EEPs funding is not attractive for Local Financial Institutions (LFIs) nor for International Financial Institutions (IFIs). For LFIs energy efficiency is perceived too risky and thus would only offer high interest rate and long-term lending, if any. Furthermore, LFIs offer traditional asset-based lending (which is around 70-80 % of the market), and are not open to extend to cash-flow based project financing. On the other hand, EEPs are typically too small for IFIs, and due diligence is too cumbersome. 6 Useful notes: \u2022 EC, 2014, Guide to Cost-Benefit Analysis of Investment Projects \u2022 EC, 2014, Best practices and informal guidance on how to implement the Comprehensive assessment at Member State level \u2022 EC, 2014, Background report on best practices and informal guidance on installation level CBA installations \u2022 EC, 2018, Cost development of low carbon energy technologies \u2022 EC, 2017, Techno-economic projections until 2050 for smaller heating and cooling technologies in residential and tertiary sectors in the EU \u2022 EC, 2017, Long term (2050) projections of techno-economic performance of large-scale heating and cooling in the EU \u2022 Member States, 2015-2016, National comprehensive assessments on energy efficiency potential in heating and cooling sector ",
        "27 2.2.1 Barriers and possible solutions Paolo Bertoldi gave an overview of key barriers that limit energy efficiency project financing by LFIs and IFIs: 1) Cash flow-based project financing is considered overly risky by financing institutions, as opposed to the traditional \u201casset-based\u201d lending. 2) LFIs do not recognize the cash flow generated by EEPs as a new asset to be valued in the financing structure (credit enhancement). 3) LFIs perceive EEPs with high-risks. 4) LFIs do not have the internal and technical capacity to properly evaluate EEPs. 5) LFIs are unwilling to invest the time and resources needed to develop lending infrastructure due to relatively small size of each EEP. 6) Commercially financing to EEPs is offered at high interest rates and short repayment terms. 7) Difficult to measure and prove achievements. Similar challenges were experienced in Lithuania at the local levels (Agn\u0117 Kazlauskait\u0117): o Slow start of financial instruments: raising public awareness and changing mentality requires a lot of information provision and time and security. A move from subsidies to loans/revolving funds was very challenging; o Challenge to \u201cgo first\u201d \u2013 must be brave and optimistic; o Assurance of on-going political support is imperative, which requires a thorough work with politicians; o Lack of legal assurance combined with complicated and detailed EC requirements as well as complicated national procedures result in non-attractive and lengthy way for final recipient to feel the benefit o Demand outweighing supply (for multi-apartments): a high sudden demand for refurbishment cannot be supplied with the previously available suppliers, and results in a lack of technicians and a threat of under-performance. o Reluctance of FIs to perform new administrative functions related to ESIF. o Low number of revenue-generating projects in other sectors \u2013 hard to establish FIs in some sectors. o Need for national reforms \u2013 respective strategic changes need to be done before the potential FIs could practically work in other sectors. Therefore, the following actions and structures could be considered to overcome the barriers: 1) De-risking, i.e. offering a guarantee of the cash-flow; 2) Valuing other values of an energy efficiency project; 3) Insurances; 4) Technical assistance to LFIs; 5) Pooling of small projects into a large and balanced project bundle; 6) Aggregators and facilitators; 7) Preparing the supply side, while continuously raising awareness among the demand side and also the politicians and decision-makers; 8) Standardization; 9) Independent verification and monitoring.

        "28 Furthermore, workshop participants emphasized the importance of communicating the multiple benefits of energy savings is imperative in acquiring more funding for EE. A large variety of EU regulatory developments are reviewed in Section 2.1.2. 2.2.2 Alternative financing options to be considered available for regions Based on the presentation of Paolo Bertoldi, even cash-starved municipalities can find investment alternatives for building and system retrofits. The following funding sources for Heating and Cooling systems, retrofits of projects have been reviewed: DEBT FINANCING \u2022 On-balance sheet financing \u2022 The first option to always consider is to finance new or renovated H&C systems from internal sources, because these are typically the cheapest. In case of a large city, saving a small fraction of the Operating Budget, can mean saving millions of euros per year. However, this usually does not work for most cities, and thus rarely considered.. \u2022 The Capital Budget can be used if \u201cenergy efficiency\u201d can become a \"line item\" in the budget on an on-going basis. This would set in stone that the city/region has to spend on EE or other energy programme on a yearly basis. Both of the above have mostly political limits. Using either operating or capital budgeting for energy efficiency leads to a \"crowding out\" effect of scarce internal capital when it could go to more pressing issues with more obvious political rewards. \u2022 Local governments can usually obtain long-term debt through the issuance of General Obligation Bonds (GOs). GOs represent the \"full faith obligation\" of the borrower, which can be the municipality, province, or region. \u2022 Loans are an obvious method for which municipalities could draw on available funds from eager financial institutions. Funders would look at the credit risk of the municipality and offer a rate of interest reflecting the cost of capital, swap costs to hedge interest risk, and a profit margin which varies depending on the lending institution, the municipal client, and the perceived risk. Loans are far more costly to local governments, and they put the municipal corporation directly at risk. Box 1. Security behind the loan (Source: Paolo Bertoldi) \u2014 Collateral - Assets pledged as security to assure repayment of debt obligations. \u2014 Loan guarantee \u2013 Partial guarantee facility with the objective of credit enhancement. \u2014 Bank guarantees \u2013 A guarantee issued by one bank (Issuing Bank) to another bank (Beneficiary) as security for general banking facilities given by the latter to a mutual customer. \u2014 Sovereign Guarantee - A governmental guarantee for fulfilment of obligations. \u2014 Insurance \u2014 In cashing rights - right for reclaiming repayments through access to bank accounts. \u2022 As part of a third-party financing scheme (TPF) , municipalities can undertake energy efficiency projects (e.g. building energy retrofits) by allowing someone else to provide the capital and to take the financial risk (or guarantee the technical risk). A higher cost will reflect the fact that the debt resides on someone else's balance sheet. \u2022 Lease payments tend to be lower than the loan payments. It is commonly used for industrial equipment. ",
        "29 \u2022 Capital leases are instalment purchases of equipment. In a capital lease, the lessee owns and depreciates the equipment and may benefit from associated tax benefits. A capital asset and associated liability appears on the balance sheet. \u2022 In operating lease, the lessor owns the equipment and rents it to the lessee for a fixed monthly fee. It shifts the risk from the lessee to the lessor, but tends to be more expensive to the lessor. Unlike in capital lease, the lessor claims any tax benefits associated with the depreciation of the equipment. The non-appropriation clause means that the financing is not seen as debt. \u2022 ESCO \u2013 Energy Service Company takes charge of (i) project identification, (ii) engineering, design, and permitting, (iii) construction, (iv) operation and maintenance, (v) administration of billing, (vi) and organization of financing for the above. \u2022 Some alternative versions: Energy Performance Contract (EPC) / Chauffage / Energy Savings Agreements (ESA) / Managed Energy Savings Agreements (MESA) / Metered Energy Efficiency Transaction Structure (MEETS) / Lighting as a Service (LaaS) / Paying for Performance (P4P)/ \u2022 Public Internal Performance Commitments (PICO) are provided by a department in the public administration who acts as a unit similar to an ESCO in function for another department. The ESCO/PICO department organises, finances and implements energy-efficiency improvements mostly through a fund made up of municipal money, and using existing know-how. This allows larger cost savings and implementation of less profitable projects, which would be ignored by a private ESCO. However, these projects lack the energy savings guarantee, because there are no sanction mechanisms within a single organisation (even though PICO includes saving targets). This model has been mainly implemented in Germany. \u2022 Forfeiting - The supplier forgoes its accounts receivable to the benefit of the bank or financial institute, which in return assumes associated risks, and passes up its right of reclaims. Forfeiting is used for medium and long term outstanding receivables or annuities. \u2022 Public Private Partnership \u2022 BOO(T) - Build, Own, Operate and Transfer of infrastructure projects, promoted and financed by the private sector, whereby the promoter builds, owns and operates the project and transfers the ownership back to the public sector only after a specified number of years. \u2022 Concession - An understanding between a company and the host government that specifies the rules under which the company can provide service locally. \u2022 Energy cooperatives play an important role for consumers who want to take action but are not confident or interested in acting alone. Different types of energy cooperatives exist. Some operate their own generation assets (such as wind or solar parks), others can act as aggregators or intermediaries , ensuring optimal operation and management of their members\u2019 generation installations (such as roof- top PVs on houses), others can act as financial actors , helping to fund low-carbon renovation/construction works. They contribute to decarbonising electricity generation, they involve citizens who can easily understand and, hence, play a role in the energy market and help the energy transition. ",
        "30 \u2022 Yield-co \u2019s are companies that are formed to own operating assets that produce a predictable cash flow, primarily through long term contracts. Separating volatile activities (such as development, R&D, construction) from stable activities of operating assets can lower the cost of capital. They pay a major portion of their earnings in dividends. EQUITY FINANCING \u2022 Vendor financing occurs when a financier provides a vendor with capital to enable them to offer \"point of sale\" financing for their equipment. Under a vendor financing scheme there are two types of arrangements: one between the vendor and the financier; and the other between the vendor and the customer. \u2022 An Energy Efficiency Mortgage is a reduced rate mortgage that credits the energy efficiency of the building in the mortgage itself. There are two types of energy mortgages: \u2022 Energy Improvement Mortgage (EIM) - finances the energy upgrades of an existing home in the mortgage loan using monthly energy savings, and \u2022 Energy Efficient Mortgage (EEM) - uses the energy savings from a new energy efficient home to increase the home buying power of consumers and capitalizes the energy savings in the appraisal. An EIM is used to purchase existing homes that will have an energy efficiency improvement made. In the US both EEMs and EIMs require a home energy rating to provide the lender with the estimated energy savings. \u2022 On-bill financing integrates loan payments with energy bills , allowing utilities to cut off energy supply to defaulting customers. This has the potential to lower collection costs and enhance credit quality of the financing scheme, thereby lowering financing costs. Payment via utility bill reduces risk of credit default and lowers collection risk. 2.2.3 European funds and initiatives 2.2.3.1 European structural and investment funds (ESIF) Over half of EU funding is channelled through the 5 European structural and investment funds (ESIF) 7 (see Figure 17 ), which are particularly relevant for regions and municipalities. The Cohesion Policy regulates the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF) (Gergana Miladinova). The ERDF aims to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the European Union by correcting imbalances between its regions. The ESF invests in people, with a focus on improving employment and education opportunities across the European Union. It also aims to improve the situation of the most vulnerable people at risk of poverty. The Cohesion Fund is aimed at Member States whose Gross National Income (GNI) per inhabitant is less than 90 % of the EU average. It aims to reduce economic and social disparities and to promote sustainable development. Eva Hoos explained that EUR 4.6 billion is available for RES and EE, with a focus moving towards EE. In the future, 25 % of the future funding will be earmarked for energy transition. 7 Information from the presentations was complemented with information from: https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes/overview-funding- programmes/european-structural-and-investment-funds_en ",
        "31 Figure 17. System of EU funding alternatives Source : Paolo Bertoldi presentation The three Funds spend EUR 352 billion over 2014-2020 concentrated in less developed regions, aiming to reduce disparities between Europe's regions strengthening economic, social and territorial cohesion, and to contribute to the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. (Gergana Miladinova) There is no minimum size for projects, which is also important at regional and city level. What counts is the European added value of an investment, their impact on employment, their innovative nature and whether they contribute to the region's economic competitiveness. (Gergana Miladinova) Synergies can be built up between various funding schemes, e.g. European Fund for Strategic Investments or Juncker Fund (EFSI) 8 , H2020, TAs, etc. It is important to know that synergies between policies and funding must be respected. For example, when an EU Directive is not yet transposed, related project cannot be funded from the Cohesion Policy funds in order to concentrate on the added value. Emphasis is on new financial instruments instead of grants (even though grants are still available). (Gergana Miladinova) In the new funding period (2021-2027), the total available budget is foreseen to decrease by around 10 %, and the thematic objectives have been revised. Thematic ear- 8 The EFSI and EFSI 2.0 (Juncker Plan) are the central pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe, managed by the EIB Group to provide a guarantee to cover a first loss protection, in order to establish financing to higher-risk projects than the market would normally take up. It aims to tackle the lack of confidence and investment which resulted from the economic and financial crisis, and to make use of liquidity held by financial institutions, corporations and individuals at a time when public resources are scarce. It also helps small businesses to start up, to grow and to expand by providing risk finance. ",
        "32 marking will increase to 30 %. Further change is a decrease in co-financing (50-85 %) to enlarge the leverage factor. Political agreement is foreseen in spring 2019. (Gergana Miladinova) Due to its focus on environment, sustainable growth and regional development, the ESIF Funds are available for the improvement or installation of H&C technologies and systems. Based on the survey results by the JRC, presented by Juan-Pablo Jimenez, the allocation of ESIF funds in energy related topics remains below 10 % for all regions, ranging from 4.5 % (ITF4 and BG) to 9 % (HU33). Public infrastructure and building renovation attract around 60 % of the total ESIF fund allocated (Juan-Pablo Jimenez) (see Figure 18 ). Figure 18. ESIF fund allocation per thematic objective Source : Juan-Pablo Jimenez presentation 2.2.3.2 European Local ENergy Assistance The European Local ENergy Assistance (ELENA) (see Figure 17 ) was established in 2009, originally to support local energy projects, but has been expanded since. It is based on an agreement between the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Commission, managed by the EIB, and financed by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research & Innovation. Funds are available in grant form for preparation (not implementation) of investment programmes. More than EUR 100 million has been already awarded to projects supporting approx. EUR 3.8 billion investments. The grant covers up to 90 % of costs related to project development support, and the leverage factor is a pre-requisite (10-20 depending on the type of project), and the grant can be clawed back if this is not achieved. The grant is provided in a first come, first served principle. (Reinhard Six) ELENA KfW (see Figure 17 ) is a financial scheme that supports local and regional authorities and other public bodies. The focus areas are energy efficiency in public and private buildings and street lighting, integrated renewable energy sources (RES), energy ",
        "33 efficiency and integrated RES in urban transport including freight logistics in urban areas, local infrastructures for energy efficiency and municipal waste-to-energy projects. KfW- ELENA consists of two elements, ELENA grant from the European Commission for Project Development Services and global loans to local participating financial intermediaries (PFIs) in order to target smaller investments (volume up to EUR 50 million). (Paolo Bertoldi) 2.2.3.3 European Energy Efficiency Fund (EEEF) The European Commission\u2019s European Energy Efficiency Fund (EEEF) (see Figure 17 ) has a new assistance scheme to support ambitious public beneficiaries in developing bankable sustainable energy investment programmes. These projects shall relate to the energy efficiency sector, small-scale renewable energy and/or urban public transport. The technical assistance facility aims to bridge the gap between sustainable energy plans and real investments through supporting all activities necessary to prepare investments into sustainable energy projects. (Paolo Bertoldi) Further sources for financing various aspects of energy efficiency improvements, buildings, heating and cooling and network improvements were listed by Eva Hoos: - the new Research Programme (Framework Programme 9); - Invest EU Fund \u2013 to de-risk, reduce interest loans; - NER300 (emission allowances); - the renewed Connecting Europe Facility, providing a strong element for cross- border support. 2.2.3.4 Smart Finance for Smart Buildings The new \u201c Smart Finance for Smart Buildings \u201d initiative is created to unlock private financing. The initiative has three key components: effectively use public funding, assistance and aggregation, and de-risking ( Figure 19 ). The initiative carries on earlier efforts such as within the EFSI and ESIFs (Timoth\u00e9e No\u00ebl). Figure 19.

De-risking energy efficiency investments Change the risks perception related to energy efficiency investments - in collaboration with the Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG) through providing similar examples, i.e. benchmarks. An Underwriting toolkit on the value and risk appraisal of energy efficiency investments has been developed by the EEFIG group to assist the market: (released on 22 June 2017) \u2013 see http://valueandrisk.eefig.eu 2.2.4 International bank loans Acknowledging the difficulties for energy efficiency projects, and thus projects in the area of Heating and Cooling in attracting financing, international financing institutions have been on the look to design their funding policies to match these needs in addition to traditional IFI financing targets. At the workshop, Greg Gebrail, Principal District Energy Specialist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Reinhard Six from the Energy Efficiency Division of the European Investment Bank (EIB) presented the banks\u2019 strategies towards district heating financing. The EBRD provides funds to public and private investors. At the national or sectoral level funding is available through \u201cnational framework agreements\u201d or through \u201ctechnical cooperation projects with government agencies\u201d. At the company level, both private and public organisations are eligible to use the funds for both supply and demand side improvements, for example for energy efficiency improvement, meter based billing and improved standards of service. Companies can get sub-sovereign loans often co-funded by donor grants. The EBRD adopted its Green Economy Transition approach in October 2015, with targets to direct 40 % of EBRD\u2019s annual business to be Green by 2020, which is equivalent to ca. EUR 4 billion. Since 2006, EBRD has provided over EUR 22 billion in Green finance (including 2016). The EIB is the natural financing partner for the EU institutions since 1958, and around 90 % of lending is within the EU. The EIB offers lending, blending and advising. In 2017, almost 60 % of all lending was given out to RE and EE projects, reflecting around EUR 50-100 million per year for district heating and cooling. (Reinhard Six) EIB offers three main types of support: \u201clending\u201d, \u201cblending\u201d, and \u201cadvising\u201d. Lending is long-term, available for financing projects, and has specific tools, namely the SFSB, EFSI, and PF4EE. In blending, the loan combines EIB finance with EU budget (e.g. ESIF), and the typically higher risk projects e.g. for innovation fit here well. (Reinhard Six) The EIB invests in 450 projects each year in over 160 countries. The energy project funding has grown by about 50 % and mostly focused on energy efficiency, RE and DH ( Figure 20 ). ",
        "35 Figure 20. EIB Energy Lending 2012-2017 (in billion EUR). Source : Reinhard Six presentation The countries where IFI investments are usually directed at, typically have an outdated, old DH system that requires a general and overall refurbishment not only on the energy side. Therefore, the loans provided by the IFIs, e.g. through a framework contract in Kazakhstan by EBRD must be matched with a local/national grant to leverage a complex deep-refurbishment. In this case, the loan covers around 40 % of the total investment and is available with an interest rate of 5.8 % (Greg Gebrail). The example projects presented by EBRD and EIB at the workshop are described in Section 2.2.6. 2.2.5 Business models: EPC The European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC) has been monitoring the European Energy Services (ESCO) market since 2005, publishing regular updates every 2-3 years, Paolo Bertoldi presented. The concept of an Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) is that the energy cost savings cover the up-front investment and the operation of a new/renovated equipment of site. The third-part or contractor implements the energy efficiency and takes over technical and/or financial risks. Its remuneration is linked to the success of the project and the level of energy savings achieved.

        "36 Figure 21. The basic EPC scheme Source : Transparence project 2015 quoted by Paolo Bertoldi The size of the EU ESCO market was estimated by Navigant as USD 2.7 billion to USD 3.1 billion, the EC-JRC as EUR 2.7 billion, and the Economist as USD 56 billion (Simone Alessandri). The JRC analysed the EPC potential in the EU public sector. The number of buildings and floor area of different public buildings were first estimated (see Figure 22 ). Based on this, it was determined that EPC renovation measures are applicable to the 60 % of existing public buildings, resulting in an estimate of 34 and 58.5 TWh can be saved in the EU public buildings of sizes larger than 1000 m 2 and 500 m 2 respectively. This would result in economic savings of EUR 2.7-5 billion at European level. To achieve this, a total investment of EUR 21.3\u201339.4 billion is needed. This total amount can be translated in an average renovation cost per building of about EUR 27 000 and an average cost per square meter of around EUR 17.5/m 2 (Paolo Bertoldi). ",
        "37 Figure 22. The share of number of buildings and floor area in different building types Source : Paolo Bertoldi presentation Buildings owned and/or managed by the public sector make up more than 10 % of the overall EU building stock. Very often public buildings also need maintenance, refurbishment and have a low efficiency. The public sector proceeds slowly in improving energy efficiency due to a number of barriers, including limited financial resources, limited human resources in numbers and in profession, split incentives, etc. The sector is an excellent target for EPC, because EPC brings in private funds for financing a public project. The picture of the current status of using EPC in the public sector is very diverse. There are only a few countries, where a well-developed EPC market could be identified in the public sector (Denmark, Germany, UK), and several which are well advanced (Finland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands). France is special case, with a moderately advanced EPC market in the public sector, because the EPC definition actually misses the core EPC value, i.e. repayment from the savings, as a result of the French legislation. The outlook for the EPC market in the public sector is good. Most of the markets are expected to grow in the near future, even those that are still in a preliminary phase. The European System of National and Regional Accounts (referred to as ESA 2010) entered into force in September 2014, and raised concerns about how to treat EPC in public accounts. After long deliberations between Member States, industry representatives and EUROSTAT, a resolution was passed only recently. (Paolo Bertoldi and Simone Alessandri) The EPC market was boosted by the European Code of Conduct for EPC, developed by the Transparence project, setting up industry-driven values and ethics. Currently there are 149 EPC Providers, 70 EPC Facilitators, and 15 Associations of EPC signatories, most of them in the Netherlands (41), Spain (19), Czech Republic (17) and the UK (17). eu.ESCO and European Federation of Intelligent Energy Efficiency Services (EFIEES) are jointly the European administrators. (Simone Alessandri) 2.2.6 Business models: how to achieve deep-energy retrofit? During the question and answers sessions about EPC, workshop participants discussed about the difficulties and potentials of ESCO projects to go beyond the \u201clow-hanging- fruits\u201d. Since EPC works on a market basis, energy savings usually achieve up to 30 %, locking in major potentials. It was agreed that a combination different financial schemes, ",
        "38 e.g. EPC combined with grants for the respective parts of the projects (social vs. private benefits) should be considered. This was followed by a presentation by R\u00fcdiger Lohse about the IEA work and ACE project about the assessment of deep retrofit financial strategies. The IEA Annex 61 \u201cBusiness and Technical Concepts for Deep Energy Retrofits of Public Buildings\u201d project (2014-2018) was aimed at the R&D of innovative and highly cost- effective bundled packages of Energy Conservation Measure Bundles (ECMBs) of H&C and thermal envelope. Annex 61 aimed to develop and demonstrate innovative, highly resource-efficient business models for refurbishing buildings using appropriate combinations of public and private financing and to support financiers and decision makers in evaluating the efficiency, risks, financial attractiveness, and contractual and tendering options conforming to existing national legal frameworks. The ACE project (2017-2019) was funded by the German Department of Energy to develop standardized financial and technical evaluation routine for standard energy efficiency investments from the perspective of financiers. Furthermore to create a \u201cBundling Platform\u201d, where standardised approach is promoted for the evaluation of EE projects by financiers and ESCOs, as well as to develop a \u201cBest Practice Platform\u201d to display evaluated EE projects. Finally, a proposal for aligned subsidy programs was requested. An issue is the lack of reliable data on implemented deep-retrofits. The above projects succeeded to collect 26 well documented and evaluated projects in Europe, US and China in a \u201cBest Practice\u201d guide. While the data on costs was the biggest issue, from the few projects that provided this, an average incremental costs for deep-energy retrofit in comparison to national minimum requirements was calculated at EUR 150-600/m\u00b2. Another issue, which increases indirect costs was found to be the investment risk, which was partially due to the perceived risk by building owners and financiers. There should be programmes and solutions that can mitigate this. A \u201cTechnical Guideline\u201d was prepared to decrease the perceived risk through providing a description of cost- effective deep-energy renovation measure bundles for different climate zones. 2.2.7 Best practice examples 2.2.7.1 Multi-apartment buildings and public buildings Lithuania Sustainable energy goals and measures in Lithuania are framed by EU legislation. Equally, the bulk of the funding stream originates from the EU in the form of Structural Funds (see Figure 23 ). Energy efficiency is considered in its multi-benefits in Lithuania: it contributes to increasing energy supply security, decreasing greenhouse gases and other pollutant emissions, and it also helps in the transition to a resource-efficient economy. To comply with the EED provisions, Lithuania has set a target of cumulative 11.67 TWh of energy savings by 2020. Furthermore, an Energy Efficiency Obligation Scheme draft is being prepared, and the promotion of faster development of Energy Service Companies is planned, as well as the speeding up of the rate of public and multi-apartment building renovations and modernization of street lightning.

Energy efficiency goals and financial conditions in the EU and in Lithuania Source : Presentation by Agn\u0117 Kazlauskait\u0117 It is a top priority to place the consumer at the centre of green energy future. Although the efficiency of Lithuania's energy consumption has decreased steadily during 2010-2015, it is still 57 % higher than the European Union average. By the end of 2014, The Government of Lithuania adopted the program for the improvement of energy efficiency in public buildings. The program aims to renovate public buildings (total area of 700 000 m 2 , of which 470 000 m 2 belong to the state and 230 000 m 2 are owned by municipalities) and to achieve 60 GWh savings of final energy by 2020. The Public Buildings Energy Performance Improvement Program involves public buildings with building energy efficiency classes D, E, F, managed by budget state institutions and institutions. The program sets the main requirement for renovation of buildings - Public building after renovation must achieve a class C energy efficiency class not less than C. An Energy efficiency fund was established on 18 February 2015 using the European Structural and Investment Funds to achieve building renovation and the modernization of street lightning, with 79 million EUR allocated funds. Two financial products will be introduced: \uf0b7 Loans for central government owned public buildings modernization (ESCO); \uf0b7 Guarantees for street lighting projects. About 100 000 luminaries will be refurbished. Public buildings renovation measures were prepared by VIPA and the Ministry of Energy in 2014, but no public building has been renovated until today. The Ministry of Energy is preparing the necessary changes to bring about 25 000 m\u00b2 of the most inefficient central government buildings to be screened this year and in 2018. Lithuania also has a multi-apartment modernization program: the goal of the program is to reduce the costs of heating in multi-apartment buildings by at least 20 %, that is, at least 1 000 GWh/p.a. through upgrading at least 4 000 apartment blocks by 2020. As of 2013, 1046 multi-apartment buildings have been renovated, and EE in buildings increased by 65 %. There are programmes also for transport and industry in a similar size.

        "40 Consumer information agreements obligations have been introduced to complement financing programmes. These oblige all energy providers to raise awareness among consumers about the potential of saving energy and changing their behaviour. About 40 agreements have already been concluded. Energy suppliers will be required to inform business consumers, to enter into agreements with energy companies (ESO, Ambergrid, Litgrid) on energy savings. The program is expected save an annual 14 000 tonnes of greenhouse gases. SME financing has been based on ERDF funds. As of 2013, 3886 loans/portfolio guarantees were granted to SMEs, 3089 individual guarantees granted to SMEs, and 100 venture capital investments made. The EUR 80 million public fund has leveraged more than EUR 460 million. The multi-apartment renovation programme and the public sector renovation programme make use of various complementary funds (see Figure 23 and Figure 24 ). Figure 24.

        "41 Latvia: the Latvian Baltic Energy Efficiency Facility (LABEEF) The previous EPC+ structure combined with an ecosystem approach became the \u201cESKO EKOSYSTEM\u201d construction. It considers environmental, social, and governmental aspects of energy efficiency improvement of multi-apartment buildings. The target is to deal with the legacy of 3 billion m 2 floor area that needs energy and structural renovation. Besides improving the energy performance, Latvian homes need a serious improvement of comfort and security. One key challenge is to disseminate information because the expressions and taxonomy used is often very varied by different stakeholders. Other key challenges relate to the change management, because the LABEEF offer is disruptive to existing business models. There is a lack of understanding and a general fear of change. LABEEF: \u2022 Focus on quality (20Y guarantees) \u2022 Separating execution and payment risk \u2022 Separating short term and long term funding and financing base \u2022 Enable scale through standardisation and online platform \u2022 Introducing aggregation mechanism \u2022 De-risking \u2022 Introducing self-sufficient and sustainable financing instrument LABEEF signed agreement with EBRD in December 2016 to leverage EUR 7.5 million to implement renovation of 6 buildings. The ESCOs and LABEEF ecosystem were also supported by 2 Horizon2020 projects \u2013 Sunshine and Accelerate Sunshine (EUR 3 million in total). Sunshine and Accelerate Sunshine aim to generate around EUR 50M in projects LABEEF motivated the supply side, and a number of large local players are interested to start the ESCO business when LABEEF starts operations, targeting the potential in public EPCs. The next steps for LABEEF are scaling up operations by attracting additional equity/debt financing. Milan: social housing Milan has a number of complex and complementary action plans and strategies. Milan is a partner in the C40, a signatory of the Covenant of Mayors, and the Compact of Mayors. The average temperature in Milan has increased by 2\u00b0C between 1901 and 2017, and the heat island effect has a large impact on the wellbeing of the city. Therefore the City of Milan has set out targets in the area of soil usage, biodiversity, water, climate, energy transition, and has adopted measures to establish a circular economy. Actions and demo-projects have been initiated for green roofs, for water saving and pumping, and energy improvements in social houses. A new building code has been adopted that sets minimum energy performance requirements for new buildings and provides incentives (in terms of increased building volume) for new and retrofitted buildings respecting specific parameters concerning energy performance and sustainability. 2.2.7.2 District heating The EBRD has invested in over 60 district heating and cooling projects 16 different countries (Greg Gebrail). ",
        "42 Jordan District Energy The Jordan District Energy , a PPP company for the provision of district energy services, received a loan of EUR 26.6 million from the EBRD (for a EUR 42 million EPC contract) to construct a large thermal store that significantly reduces peak electricity demand. The storage works as a 100 MW heating and a 110 MW cooling facility, using ammonia as coolant. Jordan has sharp night-time drop in temperature, while there is a serious water scarcity, requiring a special cooling innovation. Savings are in the range of ca. 15 000 tonnes CO 2 per year, and around 40 % of lower energy demand than individual air tempering (Greg Gebrail). DH in Banja Luka (BA) The EBRD also supported the City of Banja Luka , in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a loan of EUR 8.35 million to help in the purchase of an equity stake in a new district heating company. The DH company will convert expensive and polluting heavy fuel oil boilers to biomass boilers. As a result 14 200 tonnes of CO 2 eq/yr were saved. In Prijedor a loan of EUR 7.0 million and a grant of EUR 2.0 million was provided to cover the costs of a new biomass boiler and CHP plant and to combine these with demand side measures (Greg Gebrail). Kyrgyz Republic In the Kyrgyz Republic a loan of EUR 6.4 million and a EUR 3.5 million grant was provided by the EBRD to aid the reconstruction of municipal network pumping stations and to help with the new network control system (SCADA). DH systems in the area are a legacy of the Soviet system, and are very old and obsolete, have not been properly managed and were not regularly maintained. The population has been increasing steadily, but the DH size has not been growing and the customers at the end of the line did not get good service. Therefore, the result of 18 900 tonnes of CO 2 eq/yr saving was achieved as opposed to individual thermal control. DH in Krakow and Skawina A project co-financed by the EIB and with European Structural and Investment Funds in Poland concerns the improvement and extension of the district heating network in the city of Krakow and Skawina municipality in Poland including 1) the extension and densification of the network to replace existing solid fuel based heating systems, and particularly coal stoves, 2) the renovation and replacement of piping and related network equipment, 3) new substations replacing old, inefficient ones, and 4) extension of the DH network to newly developed areas of the city. The project is based on pooling small scale projects to make them bankable for EIB loan. The loan amount is EUR 46 million, into a total project cost of EUR 117 million. (Reinhard Six) DH and DC renovation in France A complex renovation of both DH and district cooling in France is supported with an EIB loan of EUR 260 million within a total project cost of EUR 360 million. The project consists of a refurbishment programme of heat distribution pipes and the extension of pipeline networks to new customers as well as of building new renewable heat/cooling- generation capacity. Individual projects spread all over France in cities, where Engie France R\u00e9seaux, the investor, is concessionaire of DH or DC networks. (Reinhard Six) DH and electricity from waste in Sofia The EIB supports the Sofia municipality with a loan of to carry out the Phase III of Waste Management Programme between 2018-2022, whereas district heat and electricity will be produced from refuse derived fuel (RDF). A grant funding from the EU Structural Funds is foreseen to be combined, and the municipality uses a wide range of technical assistance to complete a pre-feasibility study, feasibility and CBA, the grant application, and capacity building. The combined sources are from ELENA, Jaspers, European Investment Advisory Hub, the Municipal Project Support Facility for Eastern and ",
        "43 Neighbourhood states, and the Economic Resilience Initiative for the Western Balkans and Southern Neighbourhood. (Reinhard Six) More examples for the development of DH systems in Barcelona, Austria, Germany, Bulgaria were described in Section 2.1.6. 2.2.7.3 Complex projects with EPC Three example projects were presented by Simone Alessandri (eu.ESCO) that successfully used EPC to implement municipal building renovation. The savings targets and guarantees were set up in cost (financial) savings and not in physical energy savings. City of Berlin The City of Berlin renovated 164 municipal buildings (research centers, day-care, sport facilities) in an EPC contract with a duration of 12 years. The following technical solutions were implemented: \u25cf Development and realization of an energy efficiency concept; \u25cf Regulation of heat generation/distribution; \u25cf Renewal of air conditioning and ventilation technology; \u25cf Replacement of lighting systems; \u25cf Installation of water technology; \u25cf Controlling, monitoring and maintenance measures.

        "45 3 Conclusions Energy efficiency is the a cost-effective way of achieving Energy Union objectives, and there are strong EU policies. To support policy commitments, many different funding sources are available designed to support energy efficiency in heating and cooling, and a lot of exemplary projects can be capitalised. While overarching decisions and directions are made at EU and national levels, the local level, i.e. regions and cities, have the on-the-ground experience and thus the responsibility and capacity to make these happen. They must also have a growing role in collecting, interpreting and transferring the needs and preferences of the users and other local stakeholders to the higher decision-making levels. This way, the local administration must be now empowered to place the user at the centre of the energy system. In this context, a three-day workshop was held in Brussels organised by the JRC under the auspices of the Smart Specialisation Strategies Platform on Energy (S3P-E) on regional heating and cooling priorities, which gave the representatives of the regions an opportunity to discuss examples, methods, tools, strategies and funding opportunities to either engage successfully in an energy transformation in their territories, or stimulate the local economy by reinforcing a competitive edge in regions through new R&I projects. The workshop touched upon a lot of important aspects of H&C at the regional level that are summarized below. 3.1 Challenges and barriers H&C is the biggest energy demand sector in the EU and offers large saving potential. H&C is best to be tackled at local level, while national/EU levels should focus on providing a general framework. Therefore, it is key that local energy strategies with a focus on facing H&C aspects, or even separate local H&C plans are prepared. These strategies have to be embedded in national programs and aligned with them, but action and benefits occur at local level. It is imperative that the framing of the general policy directions is made with a strong knowledge and acknowledgement of the local situation, potentials and capacities. Key challenges, which have an impact on the wider distribution of efficient H&C technologies or an impact on the strategies, have been identified during the workshop, including: \uf0b7 diverging trends of decentralization/autonomy vs. centralization (e.g. DH), which seem to be competing and difficult to consolidate in a (local) strategy; \uf0b7 many technological options are available, and it is demanding for regions to prioritize or select from among them locally; \uf0b7 many decisions on local H&C systems imply long-term lock-in due to infrastructure investments and developments; \uf0b7 stagnation in the innovation rate of certain technologies; \uf0b7 some of the technologies need large investments and need a supplier profile change (e.g. restructure offers of gas-based heating to district heating and cooling or to a combination of large scale renewable based heating and cooling), or significant infrastructural changes; \uf0b7 competing important public issues (e.g. poverty); \uf0b7 complexity of the H&C sector in terms of sustainability, which should take into account the human, the social and the environmental perspectives; \uf0b7 impact on the economic value of individual properties. From the user perspective, those with sufficient resources could improve the value of their properties lagging ",
        "46 behind those that cannot benefit from local H&C projects either because of lack of financial resources or social barriers. This makes a public affairs decision difficult. \uf0b7 difficulties to engage the users, and difficult to cooperate with financiers; \uf0b7 difficulty in raising enough funding. Local and regional administrations need to (or put it different have an opportunity) deal with other related issues, when designing strategies for heating and cooling, in particular in the areas of: \uf0b7 GHG emission reduction; \uf0b7 energy efficiency; \uf0b7 energy security; \uf0b7 affordability and housing; \uf0b7 urban planning; \uf0b7 job creation; \uf0b7 democratization; \uf0b7 smart democratization of the energy sector; \uf0b7 smart integration; \uf0b7 energy poverty; \uf0b7 health improvement; \uf0b7 end-user engagement; \uf0b7 to name a few. There are many challenges in the H&C sector and while (financial) resources are available, better coordination and simplification are required to access them more effectively and connect the demand and supply sides better. The coordination and simplification have to be achieved across all the different levels namely; local, regional, national and European levels. 3.2 Policy directions According to Eva Hoos, \u201cconcrete and decisive action in the H&C sector is paramount for a cost-efficient achievement of the 2030 target. The proposed heating and cooling Articles (23 & 24) of the recast Renewable Energy Directive aim to ensure that the largest energy using sector is addressed within the post-2020 renewable framework and contribute to the EU renewable target.\u201d The EU aims to achieve integrated goals with the recast RES Directive, which is expected to ensure around 1 percentage point (indicative) yearly increase in RES between 2020 and 2030, modernise district heating systems and ensure it becomes a vehicle to deploy RES and EE in heating. It is also imperative that energy efficiency and RES are addressed jointly to take advantage of their potential synergies. The current and the foreseen EU level policy framework seems to provide a solid basis for action. Revisions of the EPBD, EED or the new and renewed funding schemes (e.g. Cohesion Policy) and new mechanisms, such as the \u201cAction plan on sustainable finance\u201d and the \u201cSmart Finance for smart buildings\u201d were discussed in detail. Placing the consumer at the centre of H&C systems is a common characteristic of new developments. Another goal of the changes is to increase \u201csmartness\u201d across the system. There is more focus on renovations than before and financing energy efficiency has been placed in focus. Renewable H&C technology solutions are also prioritised. Flexibility (of choices, in the electricity system and in implementation) is promoted. Finally, the local level and its connection to higher administration is imperative for the overall success. ",
        "47 3.3 Data availability Heating and cooling makes up half of the total final energy consumption in the EU or ca. 6500 TWh, with space heating consuming 27 %, process heating 16 %, space cooling 1 %, and hot water 4% of total final energy consumption. Around 75 % of heating and cooling demand is supplied from fossil fuels, making it a dirty energy demand sector. There are some scenarios about the future development of the energy demand, of which TUW and Fraunhofer results were presented. While heating energy demand seems to have peaked, cooling demand is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years (around 40 % increase by 2030 compared to 2012 levels). This will increase the pressure on the electricity systems. The German ACE project and the IEA Annex 61 project concluded that it is very difficult to collect data on EE projects, because investors are reluctant to share data that are perceived sensitive (e.g. costs and savings), and/or which are labour-intensive (technical solutions, performance, lessons learnt), therefore a lack of reliable reference data for implemented deep-renovation projects is a huge issue (R\u00fcdiger Lohse). 3.4 Examples of local H&C experiences The workshop opened up the opportunity to share experience and therefore many local examples were presented and analysed. Some of the key lessons learnt from them were collected by the participants: \uf0b7 Barcelona: urban development kicked-off by two DHC system developments. Successful example of long-term policy commitment and cooperation between different administrations (local and regional). \uf0b7 Complex, low-energy refurbishment projects of large multifamily buildings were demonstrated in Dunaujvaros (Hungary) and in Sofia (Bulgaria) in the SOLANOVA and the STACCATO projects respectively. These could showcase that deep renovation and the integration of energy efficiency improvement and RES were possible and taken well by the inhabitants. It is possible and rewarding to work closely with the local stakeholders and involve them deeply in all phases of the renovation project. \uf0b7 Social policy can be implemented through renovation of buildings, and thus by lowering the bills and/or improving comfort, as shown by the case of Milan. \uf0b7 Small and medium sized cities, such as Querfurt (Germany), Graz (Austria), and Gram (Denmark) are more suitable for modern DH systems, whereas large part of the DH supply is produced from renewable sources (geothermal, solar, heat pump, etc.), and combined with other RES and/or traditional boilers. Comprehensive district heating and/or cooling systems have featured a combination of technological solutions (e.g. Querfurt, Paris Saclay, Gram). Even large solar integration is possible into DH, e.g. Graz. The combination of DH and DC with other technologies (new and old) against standalone solutions at building / site level proved to be more sustainable and reliable; \uf0b7 Buildings are to be considered as part of a large system, which implies interactions both with others services as the case of transport via the integration electric vehicle station in building and with the building sector itself via the operation of several building under a common energy strategy. \uf0b7 A holistic assessment of local challenges, encompassing demographics and urban dynamics, local energy sources, social acceptance and local skills and expertise, is critical to design solutions, but also the most relevant local source and flexibility had to be considered. Local knowledge is essential, e.g. in North-East Region Romania the largest biomass/biogas plant was built with local expertise, taking into account the local energy mix, and working closely with local stakeholders; ",
        "48 \uf0b7 Benchmarking against a broad range of alternatives, which relies on long term life cycle criteria including market forecast and pricing of environmental externalities, was proven to be beneficial, such as the methodology employed in Solanova and STACCATO projects; \uf0b7 There are many types of business models even for large scale and complex DH implementation, potentially combined with urban development. One of them is a local cooperative, whereas the users will fund, develop and own the grid/distribution systems (e.g. Gram). Three main messages should be highlighted for the success of future projects: 1) Cross fertilization is an effective way to do more and successful projects. This means that learning from peers is one of the most effective ways to succeed. 2) Placing the user/tenant/owner at the centre of any initiative is more and more widespread and required. Their needs define the goal of the initiative, and their participation defines success. Thus, deep involvement of local stakeholders at all stages is critical, and many of them may even become active project partners as a consequence. 3) It is the local authorities that are closest and have the best position to link the users and the decision-making actors together. 3.5 Funding schemes A large number of funding schemes are available and have been reviewed at the workshop. These have greatly improved over the last years, but still need adaptations in order to respond to market needs and increase investment implementation. When technologies and strategies are implemented at local level, which is mostly the case of H&C, the national facilitation and support is important, but a more empowered administration at the regional and local level is essential. This level is close to the public and to the actual implementers, i.e. to the consumers and to the suppliers, too. Local and regional levels are directly attracted to a number of loan and grant programmes that were reviewed during the workshop, e.g. ELENA, Jaspers, EIB and EBRD funds, which are available to support the implementation and to help projects through technical assistance. For examples, the EIB strategy includes the support to increase energy efficiency, to reduce GHG and to increase business opportunities in Europe by substituting imported fuel. Several of the schemes foresee that partners aggregate small scale projects to make them feasible in a large grant or loan (see e.g. the EIB grants in section 2.2.4.). The presented examples (especially by EIB and EBRD) show that it is useful to combine loans and grants to ensure that not only the energy related improvements happen, but a general complex renovation that goes beyond economically feasible (as done in e.g. in the reconstruction of municipal network pumping stations in the Kyrgyz Republic). The same conditions were experienced in Latvia that the energy cost savings are enough to cover the strictly energy-related improvement measures, however very often refurbishment projects include changes and improvement that are not economic, but related to aesthetics, comfort, health, general structural improvement, whose value cannot be defined in economic means. These are personal or political investments, and should be covered from private budgets or from grants. Technical assistance is available and useful in many stages of a H&C project, including feasibility studies, grant preparation, communication activities, capacity building etc. TA sources can be combined very successfully, e.g. the Sofia Municipality uses at least 5 sources to support the Phase III of the Waste Management Programme: ELENA, Jaspers, European Investment Advisory Hub (EIAH), the Municipal Project Support Facility for Eastern and Neighbourhood states, and the Economic Resilience Initiative for the Western Balkans and Southern Neighbourhood (Reinhard Six). ",
        "49 Grants and loans have an important quota, too. Targets and types of projects that are supported will have a major impact on what kind of projects are implemented. For example, if a grant/loan supports biomass project, it is the responsibility of the fund owner to make sure that the resulting projects are sustainable and will not deplete forest in return to gains through biomass CHP. The current and the reformed Cohesion policy is an important driver for low-carbon investments for the 2014-2020 period, and for the 2021-2027 period respectively. There is a clear political commitment to the role of regions in the development and implementation of high-quality projects, including H&C projects. 3.5.1 Perceived risk Mitigation of perceived risk has to be highlighted when talking about funding for energy efficiency and RES investments in H&C. A lot of effort has been tried out to overcome or mitigate high risk perceived by owners and financiers, and new ideas are being developed. Some examples have been discussed at the workshop. \uf0b7 A \u201cTechnical Guideline\u201d was prepared within the ACE project (see Section 2.2.6) to decrease the perceived risk through providing a description of cost- effective deep-energy renovation measure bundles for different climate zones. \uf0b7 The EIB managed EFSI has funds to provide guarantees to cover a first loss protection, in order to establish financing to higher-risk projects than the market would normally take up (see Section Error! Reference source not found. ). \uf0b7 The Energy Performance Contracting is another scheme that has energy saving guarantee functions and could contribute to mitigate the perceived risks. \uf0b7 De-risking through transposing the risk from the building owner to a dedicated entity, such as the ESCO or one-stop-shops. \uf0b7 De-risking through providing similar examples, i.e. benchmarks, as it is done by the De-risking Energy Efficiency Platform (DEEP), an open source database containing real performance data of energy efficiency projects (http://deep.eefig.eu). \uf0b7 Risk management can also been augmented by the combination of high-volatile (energy savings, energy prices) and low-volatile components (avoided maintenance) savings. The life-cycle cost approach can identify a number of additional values of an EE investment. Finally, the general approach to many energy efficiency projects, especially those aiming at deep-energy retrofits should depart from a least-cost approach from the investment vs. energy cost saving tangent. There is a need to monetize additional values and to consider the social/health/aesthetics, etc. benefits. ",
        "50 4 Future perspective, key messages The city of the future and thus the energy system of the future will be different from what we are used to now. They will be smarter cities, which will be inclusive and efficient, and will rely on flexible infrastructure. To achieve this, multi-purpose technologies, buildings, and services have to be widespread and normal (e.g. a car recharge station device can deliver smart charging information, but also provide flexibility and balancing services to the grid, and traffic related information to users). The potential combination of various scales of infrastructure into a globally efficient pattern is foreseen. An example of In line with this idea, waste water treatment project, which was presented by the Romanian region at the workshop, where workshops, represents an example on how a small-scale solution boosts the overall efficiency of centralised grids. by treating toxic effluents. Service is becoming the centre of attention and the way of measuring the success of the energy transition. The energy sector is moving towards its digitalisation in order to gain transparency and thus providing evidences of the quality of the energy service. To monitor the effectiveness of new energy services a new set of equipment and business models are required. The trends show that smaller scale solutions prevail (e.g. decentralized energy supply), but the workshop has shown and discussed that there is a strong future of large scale solutions , such as district heating. While the benefit of large scale solutions is the lowered unit cost (among many others, such as no need for technical knowledge or attention by the user), the challenge is to ensure a sizable customer base to make it cost-effective. Another trend is automation . The scope for autonomy rises in all main fields of infrastructure: models of autonomous houses with respect to waste recycling, water cycle, energy production and consumption are technically at hand, and question the relevance of large scale grid infrastructure. The user/consumer will be at the centre of the energy system. Decisions and flexibility will depend on the user. Local and regional authorities are closest to the user and thus will gain more power and responsibility to satisfy the needs of the user and empower them to sustainably develop. In the same lines, the role of buildings and energy communities in the regional energy ecosystem increases and should be taken into account when planning. 4.1 Messages for EU and national level The policy framework seems to be strong with a number of overarching energy efficiency and RES targets and strategies. These include technical, specific and holistic regulations, as well as technologies for heating and for cooling, and for buildings. Many of them are under revision. The changes to the EPBD and the RES directive were considered as promising by the workshop participants at EU and national level. A few recommendations announced at the workshop are: \uf0b7 set realistic, but ambitious targets; \uf0b7 foster partnerships; \uf0b7 promote dissemination of experiences, demonstration projects; \uf0b7 reflect on shared local problems, e.g. on technical or financial issues; \uf0b7 improve collection of data and modelling not only at aggregate (MS) level, but more effort is needed at the local scale, and more effort to know more about cooling; \uf0b7 simplify funding procedures and documentation burden; ",
        "51 \uf0b7 provide help in fund mining (assistance, tools, training); \uf0b7 a move from grants towards new financial instruments is already being made and should be supported also at the local level; The success factors of EE financing schemes in Member States were: \uf0b7 robust ex-ante assessment, understanding ex-ante conditionalities; \uf0b7 use of \"trigger points\" to unlock investments; \uf0b7 preparing the supply chain; \uf0b7 planning a piloting phase; \uf0b7 effective communication with the target audience; \uf0b7 allowing flexibility in the funding scheme design; \uf0b7 monitoring of progress; \uf0b7 project champions; \uf0b7 technical assistance. 4.2 Messages for other regions Planning and strategies Local planning should be developed either to specifically cover heating and cooling, or have it mainstreamed in overall energy system planning. These decisions must be made consciously, and technical and financial support should be designed according to the goals pursued. Technical assistance is available from various sources, as discussed and presented at the workshop, and these should be wisely used for local purposes. Project Development Assistance (PDA) facilities and local one-stop-shops are expected to boost local H&C strategy implementations/assistance to turn plans to implemented projects. These have the potential to turn bankable, technically feasible, but owner- activity limited projects to realize. Even though, regional strategies may have different objectives or priorities, strategies should be developed together or in close consultation between local and national administrations. Sharing of experiences among different regions and locations is imperative, as the planning stage is critical for a long-term commitment, as the heating and cooling decisions are. Technologies There is no silver bullet. A lot of technologies (innovative and traditional) were discussed at the workshop during the presentations and question and answer sessions. Decarbonizing the individual technology solution as well as the system is clearly the way forward. The system has to be prepared to deal with flexibility and varying load, but this has been shown to be possible. A combination of technologies seems to be most appropriate in almost all cases, because they can overcome the challenges that one technology entails, and/or this way the demand is lowered before a supply system is designed at an adequate size. Select the appropriate sequence of actions, e.g. energy efficiency first, or decentralized systems first, and size DH systems to the lower demand. ",
        "52 Financing The Lithuanian and Latvian experience in launching wide-scale and multi-sectorial energy efficiency programmes provides valuable insights in how to prepare successfully for an energy transition, using EU and private funding. It is better to slow start financial instruments, which can be preceded with raising public awareness and changing mentality. Other Participate in networking and develop partnerships. Peer example can be very helpful. Local targets and achievements will encourage others. Often there is need for national reforms before local action can be taken. Building the foundations for a consistent and long-term cooperation between local and national administrations should be pursued. Raising public awareness and subsequent change of mentality require a lot of information provision and time and security. A move from subsidies to loans/revolving funds was/is challenging. It is challenging to \u201cgo first\u201d, and there is a higher risk of failure. These should be compensated by public support. Assurance of on-going political support is imperative, which requires a thorough work with politicians. In large scale initiatives, it may happen that demand outweighs supply (e.g. in Lithuania for multi-apartments): a high sudden demand for refurbishment cannot be supplied with the previously available suppliers, and results in a lack of technicians and a threat of under-performance. Finally extend your impact. Identify local problems and communicate about them to higher levels (national, EU). ",

European Commission, DG Energy Contact: Tudor.CONSTANTINESCU@ec.europa.eu Contact: https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/home Brief content: Mr. Constantinescu welcomed the workshop participants. He outlined the EU energy policy framework for heating and cooling and emphasized the underpinning role of the local and regional levels. He stressed how a close cooperation of the EU and national levels with the regional and local level is imperative to achieve the goals. Thus, considering that the Heating and cooling sector is responsible for 45-46 % of total energy consumption in Europe, smart strategies and smart solutions at local level are needed. 5.1 Strategies, priorities, and technology solutions in the EU regions The first part of the workshop took place during May 30, and the morning of May 31, 2018.

        "54 The presentation reviewed the status of MSs and Regions in terms of overall energy efficiency and RES targets, as well as their energy consumption and H&C trends. The forecasts for H&C development and related technology development was discussed. Energy poverty as a key local and social issue was highlighted, and the link to the European Energy poverty Observatory was made. Barriers to effectively deal with H&C demand were collected in the JRC survey. Types of projects implemented at local level were shown. Features and potentials of regional energy systems were discussed, along with barriers and experiences. Presentation 5.1.3 Renewable heating technology solutions including heat pumps Author: Lukas Kranzl, TU Wien Contact: Lukas.Kranzl@tuwien.ac.at Brief content: The results of the Invert/EE-Lab related to heating and cooling scenarios were described. A 28 % decrease in final energy demand for heating and cooling using current policy, and 38 % in ambitious policy scenario is possible by 2050, with a parallel 3 fold increase in final energy demand for space cooling. Alternative examples of H&C decarbonisation projects were presented: increasing the share of RES in the district heating generation portfolio (example of Herten), large solar installation for district heating with or without heat pumps (example of Graz), electricity to heat options (heat pumps), refurbishment, etc. The issue of the impact of heat pump loads on the electricity system was discussed.

The size and complexity of the ESCO market has been growing continuously in MSs, however remains way below its potential. The public sector in cities and regions is a key client of EPC. The status of EPC in the public sectors in MSs varies widely. The European System of National and Regional Accounts (referred to as ESA 2010) entered into force in September 2014, and raised concerns about how to treat EPC in public accounts. After long deliberations between Member States, industry representatives and EUROSTAT, a resolution was passed only recently. Presentation 5.2.7 Region Experience Author: Tomasz Harkot, Lubelskie region (Poland) Contact: tomaszharkot@interia.pl Contact: tomasz.harkot@lubelskie.pl Brief content: The management of H&C and DH in the region was explained. The region has no specific H&C strategy, but the topic is well integrated in the energy efficiency and the Urban strategies, therefore H&C is somewhat hidden. Municipalities have created plans for low carbon development. Thermal power plants are fired with hard coal in Lubelskie, which causes environmental and health issues, and a desire to move towards more sustainable solutions and promote district heating. Financial support is available from the Structural Funds for developing RES use for heating of buildings or to replace biomass boilers by solar collectors and local small energy sources, among others.
