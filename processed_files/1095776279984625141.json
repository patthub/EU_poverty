        "FOREWORD 3 Foreword H.E. TUNG-LA\u00cf MARGUE Ambassador of the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives The devastation of three decades of conflict added to the destruction caused by the 2004 tsunami leaving hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans homeless. As a response, between 2006 and 2016, the European Union (EU) has supported more than 80,000 internally dis- placed people (IDPs) reconstruct their houses in North and East Sri Lanka. This has been funded by the generous tax contributions of European Union citizens and channelled through the Eu- ropean Commission\u2019s regional facility for Asian countries called Aid to Uprooted People (AUP). I am pleased that this evaluation report will make important lessons learnt availa- ble on-line via the European Union\u2019s Publications Office. The aim is to help future similar programmes build on learnings, better address the identified shortcomings and satisfy the curiosity of tax payers who seek to understand how their money is spent in the con- text of international development cooperation. This evaluation reminds us again of how important it is to conceive \u2018housing\u2019 interven- tions as processes involving people\u2019s empowerment, something that is more than the mere reconstruction of \u2018houses\u2019 as \u2018brick and mortar\u2019 only. In the jargon of our pro- grammes, \u2018housing\u2019 reconstruction works best if complemented by an array of \u2018flanking measures\u2019 that help sustaining households\u2019 livelihoods. Accordingly, the EU will have not only assisted in the reconstruction 20,000 houses (half in the East and half in the North) but also helped regularise the land tenure of at least 6,000 households, improved local capacity of villages to plan their development, trained beneficiaries to lead the recon- struction process of their houses under the Home Owner Driven (HOD) approach and provided grants for basic community infrastructure such as water wells, schools, health centres, community centres and tertiary roads. Housing reconstruction that tries to pro- mote a \u2018habitat\u2019 approach has been positively reported upon by beneficiaries, praised by independent evaluations, appreciated by Governments and, in Sri Lanka, it has grown into a model of successful conflict-sensitive international development cooperation. Based on three decades of successful implementation in Sri Lana since the international- ly acclaimed Million Houses Programme, the practice of assisted \u2018Home Owner Driven\u2019 (HOD) reconstruction will be continued. This evaluation recommendations include: giving even more voice to communities in the tough process of beneficiary selection; and allo- cating more funds to these \u2018flanking measures\u2019, for instance through not only training beneficiaries in cost-effective technologies but by taking it a step further and supporting the local production of construction materials and low-cost housing services. Promoting ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 4 entrepreneurial initiatives out of those accrued skills can contribute to the local economy and to self-reliance of the local construction supply chain. Also, advocating for house- types that better accommodate the specific needs such as incremental growth, can allow for substantial increases in the utility and value of houses over time. Capacity building on the life-cycle management of houses and of scarce environmental resources is a proven driver of savings and of long-term livelihood viability. In addition, financial literacy needs to be provided to beneficiaries to sensitise them about the risks of excessive indebted- ness. Accordingly, by investing a little more on \u2018flanking measures\u2019 it might be possible to build cheaper houses, more people could benefit from an improved construction supply chain and beneficiaries could benefit from additional developmental prospects. On behalf of the European Union Delegation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, I would like to thank European Union citizens, the Sri Lankan beneficiaries for their exemplary contributions to leading their own house reconstruction, the Sri Lankan Government for its unconditional support, the implementing agencies: UN-Habitat, the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC), Habitat for Humanity and World Vision; as well as our co-donors involving the governments of Switzerland and Australia.

        "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 5 Acknowledgements The authors of this report were assisted by numerous individuals and organisations while they were carrying out the evaluation and baseline study. We would like to thank the AUP-2012 Implementing Partners, UN-Habitat (in Colombo, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Batticaloa) and SDC (in Colombo and Jaffna) who explained so much to us about the AUP programmes and their own work in them as well as introducing us to other key contacts and organisations. A special word of gratitude should go to UN-Habitat, Kilinochchi. Staff numbers had been depleted since the mid-term evaluation in September 2014 because the programme was closing down and UN-Habitat was not awarded the contract for AUP-2014. However, its Manager, Mr. K. Pathmananthan, remained a generous source of information and an outstanding facilitator for the evaluation team. As eighteen months earlier, it was also a pleasure to be with him during the fieldwork period. Habitat for Humanity International and World Vision Sri Lanka were still setting up their operations for AUP-2014 when the evaluation team arrived but extended all the support that was necessary to make the baseline study possible in Batticaloa, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu. Thanks are due to them in particular because they marshalled their scarce and already committed staff resources to attend the Kilinochchi workshop on resistance to non-conventional building materials and make it a success despite having been given only a few days\u2019 notice. Communities and individual families patiently gave of their time, knowledge and opinions so that the evaluators could carry out focus group discussions, observations, case studies and the household survey. In this respect the field survey team, under Mr. Mohammed Jiffry, is also acknowledged; it carried out its work under unexpected constraints and reduced time, which did not prevent it from completing its task. The constraints were even greater this time than during the 2014 mission because the sample household list for AUP-2014 could not be drawn up until quite late, thereby delaying the start of the surveys, because the weather was unusually hot and the total number of households to be surveyed had risen from 600 to 700. Finally, the team would like to thank the Delegation of the European Union to Sri Lanka & the Maldives based in Colombo, for its willingness to assist wherever possible and for its suggestions and ideas which demonstrated a commitment to the evaluation and baseline which is not to be found in all commissioning organisations.

        "ExECUTIVE SUMMARY 15 Executive Summary This report is structured in two parts, each covering an owner driven housing reconstruc- tion programme in Sri Lanka mainly funded by the European Union\u2019s (EU) Aid to Uproot- ed People (AUP) regional facility ( 1 ): 1. Part I is the Final Evaluation of the Improving Living Conditions in Returnee Areas of Sri Lanka through Housing programme implemented from January 2013 until June 2015 (hereinafter called AUP-2012) implemented by UN-Habitat and SDC. It received EUR 11.8 million from the EU and a combined amount of EUR 5.86 from the Australian Government, through the Agency for International Development (Au- sAid) ( 2 ), and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). It covered the northern districts of Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar and the eastern district of Batticaloa. 2. Part II is the Baseline Study of the Homes not Houses: Building a Sustainable Future Together programme implemented since December 2015 and due to be completed by December 2018 (hereinafter referred to as AUP-2014) is being jointly implemented by Habitat for Humanity International and World Vision Lanka. AUP- 2014 benefits from an EU contribution of EUR 14 million and EUR 0.7 million in co-fi- nancing from Habitat for Humanity International (Nadacia). AUP-2014 focuses on Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu in the North and on Batticaloa in the East. Since 2005, the EU-funded housing programmes in Sri Lanka under the AUP regional facility have targeted war-displaced households to assist them rebuild permanent houses on their own lands. This was done through a combination individual sub-grants to households accompanied by technical assistance aimed at helping them manage the reconstruction process. Programme after programme, this approach to Home Owner Driven (HOD) reconstruction process (also termed Owner Driven Recon- struction\u2014ODR) has increased its emphasis on the so-called \u2018flanking measures\u2019 (e.g. minor allocations to livelihood support ranging from securing land tenure, commu- nity infrastructure to skills training for community building). The evaluation team comprises Dr Reinhard Skinner (Team Leader and Sociologist/Hous- ing Expert), Mr Mario Martelli (Architect) and Dr Mano Kumarasuriyar (Urban Planner/ Architect). The field study was conducted during March and April 2016. All stages of the evaluation have been critically assessed by Mr Jaime Royo Olid (Architect) programme manager from the EU-Delegation to Sri Lanka. The methods adopted for the evaluation and study included documentary analysis , a household survey of 400 beneficiaries of the AUP-2012 and 300 potential bene- ficiaries of the AUP-2014, 11 focus group discussions, 20 semi-structured inter- ( 1 ) There were also a number of bi-lateral donor agencies and INGOs contributing to post-tsunami housing in Sri Lanka (e.g. JICA, GTZ, AusAID, SIDA, ICRC, IOM) ( 2 ) In 2013 the Agency for International Development (AusAID) ceased to be an executive agency and was incorporated into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 16 views, 19 case studies of households and 30 non-participant observations as an audit of the design and construction processes . The evaluation team concludes that the AUP-2012 programme has been successful. AUP-2014 had not started field implementation when the baseline study was being carried out so no conclusive judgement can yet be made at this stage. However, the programme design contains many features which are promising, including many of the recommendations made in the 2015 report on the mid-term evaluation of AUP-2012 carried out by this team. UN-Habitat and SDC have performed impressively on several fronts . The evaluation revealed that the AUP-2012 programme has had a significant and positive impact on 17,436 direct housing beneficiaries. From an outcomes perspective, according to the survey, 100% of AUP-2012 beneficiaries felt that the housing programme had im- proved their standard of living. 90% of beneficiaries also felt that their relation- ships with other community members had improved substantially as a result of the housing programme. This suggests that the programme has gone well beyond merely sheltering the homeless and has contributed to building cohesive communities. These are important achievements with respect to the EU\u2019s objective to ultimately con- tribute to peace and reconciliation . From a perspective of outputs, the programme has delivered many more full house equivalents (FHEs) than originally contracted : AUP-2012 delivered 4,251 which is 10% more than the target. This improved level of output can be attributed to foreign exchange rate gains, savings on operations costs and increased beneficiary contributions. In agreement with the European Union Delegation (EUD) to Sri Lanka the evaluation report focuses on areas of work where improvements can be most usefully made. This is intended to provide guidance for forthcoming housing programmes, housing re- construction policy and development planning in rural Sri Lanka at large. For instance, with regards to the intended improvement in social cohesion, certain as- pects of the beneficiary selection process are strongly disputed not only by those not selected but also by many beneficiaries. They claim some criteria disregard prevalent cultural norms and values. The evaluators found this first during the mid-term evalua- tion in September 2014 and recommended in their report that the scoring system be reviewed with the participation of the target communities to improve its accept- ance and to improve a sense of fairness. While this came rather late in the AUP-2012 programme, and was not implemented, it was taken up in the design of the subsequent AUP-2014 programme. Some other problems which have been confirmed by our field mission and surveys and addressed in this report, such as dependency syndrome and indebtedness, have not been caused by the implementing partners \u2013 though they may be unintentional contributors \u2013 but have been largely brought about by the historical context in which livelihood and housing assistance have been provided for separately. The implementing partners have been required to work sectorally to deliver housing reconstruction as a ",
        "ExECUTIVE SUMMARY 17 complement to livelihood support programmes that most often involved different beneficiaries and locations. Though often adjacent, their complementarity has not al- ways materialised geographically. The housing types and construction standards are somewhat rigid and beneficiary expec- tations high as a result of two financially generous waves of post-emergency reconstruc- tion assistance (i.e. post-tsunami and post-war). Technical specifications and expectations have not been sufficiently adapted to changes such as prohibitive inflation of construc- tion costs (both labour and materials). Emerging developmental needs such as the need to ensure locally-sustained livelihood and income opportunities beyond reconstruction are becoming more pronounced and will need to be addressed in order for households to be viable in the long-term. Again, these are addressed in the design of the new AUP- 2014 programme. In trying to break away from assistance dependency syndrome among the beneficiary communities home owners have increasingly been required to provide in-kind contributions and unskilled labour. This has improved ownership of the housing process but has also tied them to the house construction often de- nying them the opportunity to work to cover day-to-day expenses. In Chapter Six, it is argued that the combination of dependency, lack of financial literacy and interruptions in income generation through the reconstruction process undermines the otherwise sat- isfactory sustainability of the programme. Allocating either, a full house, a repair, or nothing, translates into either, huge gains for beneficiaries or nothing for those left out. Towards achieving a broader spread of ben- efits, three alternatives and cheaper incremental housing designs were recommended in this mid-term evaluation. These are to be understood as indicative house types to be further adapted to local norms, regulations, and cultural sensitivities through owner-driv- en processes and not as blueprints. The designs proposed then were smaller than the current standard ( 1 ) full house equivalents (i.e. 550 sq. feet, lockable house with toilet, high-pitched roof) but are fully functional houses with potential for expansion. It was already recommended in the mid-term evaluation of AUP-2012 that an \u201cincremen- tal housing\u201d approach be introduced in future programmes in which lifecycle de- mands of house owners are anticipated. Providing completed houses, perhaps smaller than the current 550 sq. feet, but with clear potential for expansion could free up funds to include more beneficiaries and to provide more livelihood support and training activi- ties. Gradually phasing in non-exploitative loans through sound financial mechanisms cre- ating financial discipline among beneficiaries and other actions to mitigate dependency are presented in Chapters Five and Eleven. These mid-term evaluation recommendations have all been incorporated in the design of AUP-2014. Managing the above is important for housing reconstruction not to add to the gener- al tendency to get deeply indebted. Spending on the house far above what the AUP grant allowance must be proactively discouraged in order to sustain manageable levels of household debt. SDC\u2019s study on indebtedness (Romeshun, K. V.

        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 18 Munas, 2014) and housing documents the importance of debt for completing house reconstruction but underlines that no causality can be directly established between hous- ing reconstruction and unsustainable debt which is mainly caused by structural factors (e.g. exploitative credit lending to up to 30% interest rate taking advantage of lack of financial literacy, alcoholism, drought and flooding, etc..). This evaluation confirms that 93% of AUP-2012 beneficiaries borrowed to complete their construction and that in such circumstances 72% of them found debt was causing them problems. In order to address unsustainable indebtedness it was recommended in the mid-term eval- uation of AUP-2012 that future grants build in stronger livelihoods and training components. This was too late for the AUP-2012 programme to do but AUP-2014 has done so. A particular concern in the construction process is that, while the overall quality of the houses in both programmes implemented by UN-Habitat (AUP-2010 and AUP- 2012) has been generally good, the duration taken for completion is considered too long . The need for households and their family members to carry out seasonal work (e.g. fishing and farming) and other occasional priorities, together with a serious short- age of skilled labour and sometimes of construction materials in the districts, are the main causes. Proposals are made in Chapter Eight to reduce this time. Those two AUP programmes incorporated beneficiary financial and physical participation as well as community participation in the collective/bulk procurement of building materi- als through the specially created Village Reconstruction Committees (VRCs). However, the potential contribution of existing CBOs was found not to have been sufficiently exploited. The AUP-2014 should take this finding on board. In the mid-term evaluation the team looked at the visibility of the programme and con- cluded that, though some aspects are covered well enough, the then deliberate low-pro- file approach could be considered as falling short of donors\u2019 expectations. This has since been improved. There remains over 100,000 very vulnerable households, who will struggle to ever afford a house and face a high risk of remaining in poverty. In our previous report and with regards to the donor\u2019s exit strategy from a situation of donor-dependency in ad- dressing the post-war housing reconstruction gap, an abrupt disengagement was discouraged and the facilitation of a smooth transition to a local non-exploitative housing market encouraged. Since then, the Government has changed and housing has become again a central social and economic objective. The current Government is committed to delivering subsidised housing for both war victims in the North and East, for most vulnerable communities in Central and Uva provinces and concessionary loans countrywide. Amid these good intentions however, the tentative programme of 65,000 prefabricated houses which were to be built and imported by steel giant Arcelor Mittall at a cost of some USD 1 billion has raised many questions in various sectors. Civil society has alleged a lack of fair competition in procurement process and evaluation where the winner was ",
        "ExECUTIVE SUMMARY 19 said to have been pre-decided. But more importantly, given the availability of nation- al solutions, this shows a disappointing disjuncture between thirty years of successful owner-driven housing in Sri Lanka and the lack of appropriation of the same by the new Minister of Resettlement ( 1 ). The present report argues that, since no affordable market mechanism is yet in place, the housing reconstruction gap must continue to be addressed through public intervention and policy which builds on lessons learnt such as the AUPs. The EU and other experienced implementing partners are today in a privileged position to facilitate key capacity build- ing and knowledge transfer for a much needed \u2018national housing policy\u2019. While owner driven practices integrating livelihood support have become a best-practice there is still ample room for improvement such as by including incremental housing, non-exploitative finance, certified vocational training and the strengthening of CBOs. A Sri Lankan housing policy should include local value-added enterprise development in the North and the East that diversifies the construction supply chain and that provides for low-cost solutions. The extent to which the AUP-2014 programme, manages to illustrate the way forward will determine its success. ( 1 ) Other criticisms are a) a lack of user input in the design and implementation of the programme; b) the high cost per unit, which most felt would be more than adequate for two units; c) a totally inappropriate technology for the target areas and d) a lack of post-construction maintenance arrangements.

        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 22 1 Introduction Sri Lanka\u2019s two decade long internal conflict, mainly in the north and the east of the country, coupled with the tsunami disaster of December 2004, which had the sever- est impact along the north-east and the eastern coastal belt of the country, left about 365,000 houses fully or partially damaged. The European Union\u2019s support for the reconstruction of social infrastructure, livelihoods and damaged houses in the affected areas has involved over \u20ac674 million between the initial intervention in 2005 and 2015. Loans (European Inverstment Bank) \u20ac 250 million Grant Aid to livelihoods (EuropeAid) \u20ac 240 million Grant Aid for IDPs through Housing reconstruction (EuropeAid) \u20ac 50 million Grant Aid Humanitarian Assistance (ECHO) \u20ac 134 million Figure 1: EU aid to Sri Lanka from 2005-2015 (Source EU-Delegation to Sri Lanka) 1.1 EU\u2019s Aid to Uprooted People (AUP) regional facility applied to Sri Lanka A regional facility of the EU \u2013 Aid to Uprooted People (AUP) \u2013 was employed to finance housing reconstruction complementing other EU-funded bilateral humanitarian aid, grant aid to livelihood rehabilitation programmes and soft loans in areas where internally dis- placed persons from the civil war were to be found. In the first two AUP interventions in 2005 and 2006, a total of \u20ac16 million was committed to the World Bank-led North East Housing Reconstruction Programme (NEHRP). It was followed by a third AUP contribution of \u20ac12 million in 2008 towards emergency housing implemented by ASB in Vavuniya complemented by ZOA and Practical Action responsible for the so-called \u2018flanking meas- ures\u2019 components ( 1 ). ( 1 ) Flanking measures are small-scale supports to beneficiary communities in the areas of infrastructure and livelihoods. ",
        "INTRODUCTION 23 Figure 2: NEHRP permanent house next to transitional shelter, Ampara District, 2007 In 2010, as the internal conflict-related emergencies added on to the backlog of tsunami housing programmes, the EU responded through the AUP facility with a commitment of \u20ac12 million towards Support to Conflict Affected People through Housing Programme, implemented by UN-Habitat and SDC. It is referred to by the EUD as AUP-2010 and by UN-Habitat as Phase I. An additional \u20ac4 million was sourced through AusAID/DFAT and SDC (the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation). The global objective of AUP-2010 was \u201cto contribute to a sustainable resettlement in the place of origin for the returnees and their host communities in North Sri Lanka\u201d and its spe- cific objective \u201cto improve the living conditions and social cohesion of displaced people, re- turnees and their host communities in the North through provision of permanent housing\u201d. The AUP-2012 or UN-Habitat Phase II was a replication of the AUP-2010 programme im- plemented with the same partners \u2013 UN-Habitat, AusAID/DFAT and SDC, but adopting a theme of \u201cImproving Living Conditions in Returnee Areas of Sri Lanka through Housing\u201d by targeting 3,000 fully damaged houses for reconstruction and 1,000 repairs to those partially damaged. Its global objective was \u201cto address medium term rehabilitation needs of returnees and their host communities in the North and East of Sri Lanka\u201d and its specific objective \u201cto improve the living conditions and social cohesion of displaced people, re- turnees and their host communities in the North and East through provision of permanent housing\u201d. The funding breakdown among the partners remained similar to the AUP-2010 pro- gramme \u2013 EU providing \u20ac11.8 million and the combined AusAID (which later became DFAT)/SDC contribution being approximately \u20ac5.86 million. The programme aimed to reach 100 villages in the four targeted districts in the north \u2013 Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Mannar, as well as 1,000 households in the Batticaloa district in the east. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 24 1.2 The present evaluation By the end of the present evaluation in April 2016 the AUP-2010 and AUP-2012 pro- grammes had produced 7,028 completely new, rebuilt houses (\u201cfull houses\u201d in the pro- gramme\u2019s terminology) and 2,609 repaired houses. In addition there were other outputs such as community infrastructure, training and support in obtaining land titles (all of which are detailed in this report). Although the programmes have delivered substantial benefits, which are described in the present report, the EU\u2019s intention through evaluation is to further improve ongoing programme performance for better and greater impact and to extract lessons learnt for future housing reconstruction actions. Figure 3: Completed house under AUP-2012, Eravurpattu Village, Batticaloa District (23 March 2016) When the present evaluation was commissioned in January 2014 the shortfall in housing in the north (houses destroyed during the war which needed to be reconstructed) was not openly known but estimated by UN-Habitat to be in the range of 30,000 \u2013 60,000 with an additional 5,000 \u2013 12,000 for the eastern Batticaloa District. The new Govern- ment under president Maitripala has reinstated housing as a priority and estimates the gap at above 100,000. Housing programmes would have to be scaled up significantly if this need is to be met. Accordingly, the new Government has committed itself to various housing schemes: grant-based for war-affected people and concessionary loans for other social housing. For war-affected people, the approaches diverge however: on the one hand a 10,000 owner-driven housing programme has been launched under the leadership of the districts building on lessons learnt from previous owner-driven pro- grammes. On the other, a 65,000 house project of prefabricated houses was awarded to international steel giant ArcelorMittal. The latter has caused dismay among potential beneficiaries, local contractors and the donor community ( 1 ). In addition, it was observed ( 1 ) The AUP beneficiaries felt that it was unfair that, while they were struggling to complete their houses within a budget of Rs.550,000, some new beneficiaries were to get houses and contents worth Rs.2.1 million. This was definitely going to cause a lot of friction between the two groups of beneficiaries if they happened live in the same village. ",
        "INTRODUCTION 25 or suspected that several problems were constraining home ownership or home improve- ment. These included landlessness, inflation in building materials and labour costs and political intervention in beneficiary selection. It is against this backdrop that the final evaluation of the AUP\u20132010 programme and mid- term evaluation of the AUP\u20132012 programme were undertaken. The report delivered at the end of the two evaluations, it was hoped, would contribute substantially in helping the AUP-2012 programme make modifications to improve on its already impressive per- formance and for future programmes to be designed and implemented to perform even better. In this way, they would be able to benefit the as yet unserved populations in the north and east of Sri Lanka. The present evaluation, led by IBF International Consulting, was carried out in March and April 2016 and comprises the final evaluation of AUP-2012 and baseline study of the new AUP-2014. The latter was designed taking into account many of the recommendations of the mid-term evaluation of AUP-2012. The global objective of the AUP-2012 final evaluation and baseline study is to: Empower key stakeholders involved in EU-funded housing reconstruction programmes in Sri Lanka with knowledge or skills identified through programme evaluations necessary to undertake well-informed decisions, corrective measures or complementary activities to better attain EU development cooperation objectives. (Evaluation TOR: 4) Specific objectives are to: 1. identify relevant areas for potential improvement as well as examples of good practice in the implementation and design of the programmes concerned; 2. disseminate the relevant findings in the form of practical and feasible recommenda- tions; 3. mainstream, to the relevant stakeholders, practical methods, skills or approaches to follow up on the recommendations. (loc. cit.). 1.3 The structure of the report The present report is in two parts: the first part covers the final evaluation of AUP-2012 and the second the baseline study of AUP-2014. It was decided to separate the two because they are different in too many ways to make it possible to report on the side-by- side as was done with the mid-term and final evaluations of AUP-2012 and AUP-2010 respectively ( 1 ). The first part of the report is a final evaluation of the AUP-2012 programme for which the same team of evaluators carried out a mid-term evaluation eighteen months earlier. It is unsurprising then that we adopted the same structure in both. This allows for conclusions ( 1 ) For example, the baseline questionnaire is very different from that of the final evaluation and their results could not be compared as could the previous evaluations. Nor could key issues related to beneficiary satisfaction be compared, for obvious reasons. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 26 in the final evaluation to be compared with those of the mid-term evaluation though the majority of the conclusions reached are the same, albeit using more recent additional data. The second part of the report is completely different from the previous report. As with the previous evaluation report the evaluators agreed with the EUD to present their findings focusing on learning issues, i.e. those where the team felt most innovation and modification could usefully be made. This is in contrast to a more conventional pres- entation which consecutively presents the findings for each of the OECD-DAC evaluation criteria. This said, the OECD-DAC and the EC\u2019s criteria have been fully addressed in this report, most comprehensively in Annex 5 (the Evaluation Question Matrix and Summary Answers) ( 1 ). It is understood that focusing on areas where most change is suggested may emphasise less successful areas of the AUP-2012 programme and understate its successes. The eval- uation team wants the reader to be aware that AUP-2012 has been a very success- ful programme. For this reason, in addition to Annex 5, the report contains references to the Evaluation Matrix and OECD/DAC criteria at certain points, which it is hoped will provide the necessary balance to the identified areas of proposed improvement. At this point, however, we present the summary of project achievements from UN-Habitat\u2019s final report on AUP-2012 which gives a flavour of what has been accomplished (UN-Habitat, 2016: 9) ( 2 ). Most of the outcomes listed are discussed at various points in this report, in particular in Annex 4 of Part I.

        "METHODS 27 2 Methods The methodology employed in the final evaluation of AUP-2012 is very similar to that employed for the mid-term evaluation of the same programme. The method employed in the baseline study is different and is presented in the second part of this report. The following summarises the methods used in the AUP-2012 final evaluation. Evaluation criteria had been given in the evaluation\u2019s Terms of Reference (ToR). These were relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, impact, coherence and community value added . From these the evaluation team drew up evaluation questions and compiled them in the Evaluation Question Matrix, which appears in Annex 4. This shows the criteria, questions, likely sources of information and the most appropriate evaluation method to be employed to answer the questions. The ToR required that the evaluation be both qualitative and quantitative and that household surveys be carried out with each respondent\u2019s house being photographed and geo-referenced. The other methods (documentary analysis, focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation) were selected by the evalu- ation team. 2.1 Documentary Analysis The evaluation requires that the AUP programmes be evaluated at different levels ranging from the global (e.g. their contribution to national development) to the very specific (such as the timely payment of grant instalments). The best source for this data is existing doc- umentation. Strategy level documents provided the answers to the first type of question (e.g. the National Development Plan and the \u201cAwakening the North\u201d regional develop- ment strategy) while programme documents address the second. In addition the team has made use of a range of other materials such as the AUP Operations Manual, Annual and Final Report of AUP-2012 which ended on 30 June 2015, specific research studies (e.g. on indebtedness and vulnerability) as well as academic articles. 2.2 Household Survey A local survey team was sub-contracted to carry out a household survey. It carried out a total of 723 interviews with householders . These comprised 364 beneficiaries of the AUP-2012 programme (the final evaluation) and 259 potential beneficiaries of AUP-2014 (the baseline study). In addition, 50 interviews were carried out for each programme as pilot surveys. Those surveyed for the final evaluation of AUP-2012 were beneficiaries of a full house or repaired house. They were randomly selected from a database maintained by UN-Habi- tat. The method used for the selection of respondents for the AUP-2012 baseline study is explained in the corresponding section of the second part of this report. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 28 The questionnaires used by the survey team for the final evaluation of AUP-2012 are attached to this report (Annex 8) and the way in which the survey sample was drawn is described in Annex 6. The corresponding information for AUP-2014 is given in the sec- ond part of this report. 2.3 Focus Group Discussions As for the mid-term evaluation of AUP-2012, focus group discussions were held with community members in groups intended to number 10-12 persons. Members included VRC representatives and other key actors in each of the villages. These included repre- sentatives of such community based organisations as Rural Development Societies, Wom- en\u2019s Rural Development Societies, elderly citizens groups, and fishermen\u2019s and farmers\u2019 associations. Figure 4: Beneficiaries preparing for the start of the focus group in Vivekanandanagar village, Kilinochchi (28 th March 2016) In reality the number and composition of discussants was not as methodically determined as this. In a village a meeting like this can be a significant event and uninvited people often drifted in so that in most cases the group\u2019s membership was twenty or more and in some cases had swollen to approximately double that figure. Clearly there is no way the evaluators could or would have attempted to remove anybody. ",
        "METHODS 29 Six focus groups were convened for the AUP-2012 evaluation (five more were held for the baseline study). Two of these were held in Batticaloa District, two in Kiinochchi, one in Mannar and one in Mullaitivu. 2.4 Semi-Structured Interviews and Case Studies Semi-structured interviews were used to complement the household survey by probing fewer key evaluation questions in depth and aiming thereby to reveal ideas and experi- ences that may not have been considered or hypothesised when designing the Evaluation Question Matrix. They also allowed a closer interrogation of important issues which were raised during the course of the evaluation. Figure 5: Case Study in Uthayanagar West, Kilinochchi (12 September 2014) Not all interview questions were formulated in advance. While the Evaluation Matrix specified key questions semi-structured interviews should address, other questions were created during the interviews as the interviewer uncovered new avenues of enquiry sug- gested by the answers received from the interviewee. Interviews held were mainly with representatives of donors, implementing partners and government agencies. In mid-term evaluation of AUP-2012 members of the private com- mercial sector were also interviewed. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 30 Programme beneficiaries were not included. However, the evaluation team considered that a more in-depth view of the situations of individual households would provide val- uable insights and decided that, in addition to the data which it is already committed to providing, it would develop a number of household case studies. In total 36 case studies were carried out (19 for the mid-term evaluation and 17 for the final) and 20 semi-structured interviews held, which are not easily categorised into AUP-2012 or AUP-2014. A list of final evaluation interviewees is given in Annex 9. 2.5 Non-Participant Observations Twenty-one observations were made for AUP-2012 and nineteen for AUP-2014 making a total of 40. Three of the AUP-2012 observations were return visits to houses already visited during the September 2014 mid-term evaluation mission and fourteen were new observations. These are indicated at the top of the corresponding observation sheet in the annex. The observations were intended to show how houses have been constructed and mod- ified and to identify problems and interesting innovations. They also show how the con- struction was carried out, by whom, what difficulties were faced and what solutions were found. In addition, consideration was given to the health and safety procedures and / or regulations which were followed and potential environmental impact of the works. Figure 6: Observation of roof structure, Ganashapuram Village, Kilinochchi (29 th March 2016) The houses chosen for observation were mainly those interviewed by the household survey team. This allowed the results of the survey to be complemented with technical detail. In addition, some cases were included which the survey team did not cover, such as child-headed households. ",
        "METHODS 31 The houses built under AUP-2012 were checked with respect to their technical perfor- mance after an average of 18 months since their completion. Satisfaction of home own- ers was also analysed ( 1 ). The technical audit gave special attention to possible settlement of foundations, causing in turn possible cracks and further defects. This is particularly likely on sandy soil because of sand\u2019s tendency to absorb/release water \u2013 both rain and soil water \u2013 and to alter its volume. All observations for both AUPs are listed in Annex 12. Here one can easily see the tech- nical findings which have been recorded for each case and compare cases. Results have been analysed and some significant pictures included in each case to illustrate the find- ings. This method included a desk review of relevant documents (e.g. to check the accuracy of drawings), site visits and interviews with householders, geo-referenced photographs and measurements. Technical details were documented and appropriate non-destructive tests were carried out. All case studies carried out for the final evaluation of AUP-2012 appear in full in An- nex 13. ( 1 ) One to two and a half years is a fair time to audit a house built under an ODA programme which is partially built by non- professionals with a possible lack of construction skills and knowledge of the materials used.

        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 32 3 Beneficiary Selection System (AUP \u2013 2012) As was highlighted in AUP-2012 Mid-term Evaluation Report (MTE), the selection of ben- eficiaries has played an important role in the successful progress of the implementation of AUP-2012. The AUP-2012, attempted to introduce objectivity in the selection process through a scoring system as adopted in the Indian Housing Project (IHP). Though intended to build in a level of transparency in the selections, the scoring system did not receive the expected levels of acceptance from the target community. Criticisms of the system were perhaps mainly due to the community at large, particularly those not selected, tending to feel aggrieved as every single person in the target groups, rightly, considers himself or herself to be an \u201cuprooted person\u201d at whom the AUPs were tar- geted ( 1 ). Apparently, the community considered the criteria and the relative weights assigned to each in the scoring system to be very subjective and unfair. Though well-in- tended, the scoring system had the tendency to discriminate against one of the most vulnerable such as those who had lost several members in the war, which reduced them to a small family who now may not be eligible for a house due to the scoring system\u2019s bias towards larger families. However, despite the efforts of the implementing partners and all others concerned to ensure a high degree of fairness, transparency and accountability when selecting the beneficiaries, it was observed in the MTE report that a small but significant number of applicants had missed out being selected even though the general consensus was that that they should have. The bone of contention was that the selection criteria had been indifferent to certain local cultural norms and ground conditions. On the basis of this observation it was recommended in the MTE report that the selection criteria be re- viewed and revised appropriately. For example, selection criteria should take into account what communities considered appropriate criteria. Another example, proposed here by the evaluation team, is that criteria do not discriminate against households with female members who are over 18 and unemployed as was the case in the AUP-2012 beneficiary selection process. However, by the time the MTE was concluded and the report with rec- ommendations was released to the Implementing Partners all selections had been done, the houses constructed (except for a few) and were in occupation. It is now hoped that the beneficiary selection process for AUP-2014 would take due note of the AUP- 2012 MTE conclusions and recommendations. Despite the selection process formerly allowing for redress of grievances (UN-Habi- tat Operational Manual 2013-2015, p6), almost 40% of non-beneficiaries surveyed for the MTE had claimed that they were unaware of the reasons why their appli- cations were rejected and almost 60% felt that their disqualification was unfair. ( 1 ) In most of the focus groups the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries understood why the non-beneficiaries had not been selected for a grant but also felt this was unfair.

        "BENEFICIARY SELECTION SYSTEM (AUP \u2013 2012) 33 Beneficiaries surveyed in this evaluation (AUP-2012 Final) were also critical of the time taken for processing the applications, announcing the outcome and releasing of the first instalment of the grant for the commencement of constructions. Only 1% of the beneficiaries said that they received the first instalment within two months of making the application (See Annex 7 \u2013 Table 1.2.2) and 15% claimed that it took more than 6 months. District wise, Batticaloa was the slowest to process applications with 24% of the beneficiaries having had to wait for more than 6 months and Mannar having only 7% having to wait for than six months. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 34 4 Dependency The present chapter is largely as it appeared in the AUP-2012 mid-term evaluation report since the issues and conclusions remain the same. However, some updates are made using information gathered during the final evaluation mission in March and April 2016, especially in the section on recommendations at the end. Both the AUP programmes have adopted an approach which aims to place control in the hands of the home owner \u2013 the \u201cHome Owner Driven\u201d (HOD) approach also referred to in academic literature as \u201cOwner Driven Reconstruction\u201d (ODR). The mid-term evaluation of AUP-2012 pointed out that this has had notable success in the sense that most house plans have been adapted to a certain extent by the home owners and they have been responsible for organising their own construction process. They have also contributed to the construction themselves in kind and to the monetary costs through loans they have made where the AUP grant was not (considered) sufficient for the size of house they wanted. Lyons (2009, 395) has compared owner-driven and donor-assisted approaches to post-tsunami housing in Sri Lanka and concludes: The findings clearly demonstrate that the Owner-Driven Programme in Sri Lan- ka (ODP) performed better than the Donor Assisted Programme (DAP) on both quantitative and qualitative criteria (Cernea, 1997, 2000). The ODP produced more houses, more quickly, of better construction quality, and at less cost. Space standards were generally better, and the designs, layouts, and locations were more acceptable to beneficiaries. Infrastructure, services, and amenities were more readily provided to ODP sites. She explains that DAPs also produced dependency amongst beneficiaries: Far more than the ODP, the DAP fostered a culture of dependency among ben- eficiaries, arising from long periods in transitional shelters, often away from both original and final places of abode, with no active role for beneficiaries to play in the development of their own futures. In contrast, the ODP fostered (re) development of a cooperative local social fabric and institutions achieved only exceptionally in the DAP and, as a process, met a range of human rights needs generally neglected by DAP [\u2026]. It created opportunity for integrated develop- ment (Cernea, 1997, 2000), built on beneficiaries\u2019 energies (Oliver-Smith, 1991) and enhanced resilience of individuals and communities (Schilderman, 2004). The AUP programmes have adopted the ODP approach and appear to have captured many of the benefits described by Lyons. Ironically though, it seems also to have rein- forced the dependency she found in the DAP approach which was adopted by some agencies in the post-tsunami housing programmes. The AUP programmes, except where they have been implemented by SDC, have not significantly fostered the redevelopment ",
        "DEPENDENCY 35 of a cooperative social fabric and institutions or created opportunities for integrated de- velopment and enhanced the resilience of individuals and communities. The UN-Habitat managed programmes have: (a) By-passed existing CBOs in favour of VRCs ( 1 ) which have no chance of being regis- tered and therefore representing an institutional future for communities\u2019 develop- ment. The programmes have created a new organisation instead of strengthening the legitimacy of existing ones. However, it should be noted that during the final evaluation of AUP-2012 it some villagers expressed their intention to continue using the VRCs even after the end of the programme. This reflects a generally positive ap- preciation of the VRCs\u2019 work during focus group discussions. The question remains that, if they do continue how far does their lack of official recognition restrict their future development role? (b) Implemented a Settlement Improvement Planning process by means of which prior- ities are listed but most remain unattended. Of course, AUP cannot meet all needs but communities are left with a list of priorities with which they do not know how to deal. A valuable planning process has been left incomplete. Focus groups told the evaluation team what the unmet needs were and were looking for external assistance to meet them. (c) Adopted a sectorial approach too focused on housing rather than an integrated approach which would better develop resilience within communities ( 2 ). This was brought home in almost all focus group discussions in the mid-term evaluation where participants were extremely pleased with their houses but were worried that they had little or no income to cover daily expenses let alone repay the debts many of them had incurred as part of the housing process. The time many beneficiaries had spent as IDPs in camps and transitional shelters no doubt contributed to a culture of dependency. Unfortunately, the design of the AUP programmes only exacerbated this through the granting of, by rural Sri Lanka stand- ards, enormous amounts of money to build or repair their houses. The decision by many beneficiaries to build their house design or specification beyond the minimum standard has driven many of them to take on debts they cannot repay (see Chapter Eight) and increased even further their likely future dependency ( 3 ). ( 1 ) Some of these were established under the NEHRP programme and UN-Habitat has simply continued to use them instead of other CBOs. ( 2 ) It should be said that this sectorial approach was a response to the requirements specified by the EU. The guidelines for grant applicants for AUP 2010 stated \u201cThe programme will seek to promote returns of populations to their place of origin by prioritising permanent housing, in addition to previous EU investments in reconstruction notably in the housing sector through the North East Housing Reconstruction Programme (NEHRP).\u201d It goes on to state that whilst funding for flanking measures is not foreseen within this programme, strong coordination with other EU supported actions will be promoted. AUP 2012 continued this approach. The evaluators are grateful to UN-Habitat for pointing this out. Nor is it the case that there are no \u2018flanking measures\u2019 (e.g. community infrastructure) incorporated by the programme. The point is that these investments have been too small compared to those made in housing. ( 3 ) It has been said in this respect that this is the beneficiary\u2019s choice (the peoples\u2019 process is all about people making their own choices) which seems to the evaluators to be irresponsible. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 36 This dependency is reflected in the replies given by most of the focus groups to questions about who would maintain common assets such as improved internal roads or drainage channels. They expected UN-Habitat, the District or NGOs to do it ( 1 ). This was despite the fact that most of the communities in which the focus groups were held had CBOs, such as RDSs and WRDSs, which had carried out such activities as providing organised labour for the road improvements, digging drainage channels, setting up small savings and loan programmes and digging foundations for pre-schools including contributions to UN-Hab- itat implemented projects through community infrastructure projects ( 2 ). They have the potential to become a development force in their communities but this has probably not been developed within the AUP programmes as much they could have been. 4.1 Recommendations 1) AUP-2012 has included a component of CBO strengthening (leadership training) which until now has not yet created the self-confidence to enable communities to tackle their own needs ( 3 ). The MTE recommended that this component be continued and reinforced in any subsequent phase of AUP and the proposal for the AUP-2014 incudes a sub-programme specifically aimed at strengthening community organisa- tions and reducing the culture of dependency. Part of the strengthening of CBOs should consist of training in how to follow up on those aspects of the Settlement Improvement Plan (SIP) process that AUP cannot (and should not) attend. This would include the preparation of plans and identifying development partners ( 4 ). 2) The MTE recommended that incremental (yet fully functional) housing should be pro- moted. This would establish a development model in which it is clear that a major part of the responsibility for completion of the house is the home owner\u2019s. AUP-2012 did not incorporate this recommendation after the mid-term evaluation. UN-Habitat say the reason for this is that the MTE report was finalised in February 2016 and the programme due to end five months later so there was insufficient time. In fact, the proposal was made during the first evaluation mission in September 2014, leaving a full nine months to implement changes. The evaluation team accepts that the official version of the recommendation did indeed arrive later but feels that some efforts could have been made nevertheless ( 5 ). ( 1 ) In Iranapallai, the first reply to this question was \u201cthe next NGO that comes along\u201d. They then corrected themselves: \u201cWe are confident we can do it ourselves\u201d followed by \u201cI think that is the right answer\u201d. Communities are aware of the large resources available from which they can benefit but are also savvy to what development agencies want to hear. ( 2 ) Community infrastructure contracts, signed directly with CBOs, require CBOs to contribute to construction, financial management and the contribution of organized labour. UN-Habitat provides training on finance and construction issues. This has happened in close to 100 community contracts implemented under Phases I and II. ( 3 ) The programme\u2019s final report explains that \u201dAll members of the 66 VRCs established under the project have undergone training in leadership, CBO management, basic accounts, and book keeping conducted by UN-Habitat, SDC and external resources persons.\u201d (UN-Habitat, 2016: 22) ( 4 ) The reader should bear in mind that, in comments on a draft of this report, UN-Habitat stated that \u201cVRCs were formed exclusively of beneficiaries to ensure a high degree of interest and focus on house construction and other project activities. Engagement of other CBOs with different mandates and consisting of non-beneficiaries may have diluted the interested and focus due to other agendas. The political situation prevailing in project areas was not conducive for registration of new CBOs.\u201d ( 5 ) In comments on the draft version of this report UN-Habitat point out that \u201cOnly 177 new houses were commenced since the MTE, and thereby very little of the recommendations could be incorporated into the programme.\u201d ",

        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 38 5 Sustainability The present chapter is largely as it appeared in the AUP-2012 mid-term evaluation report since the issues and conclusions remain the same. However, some updates are made using information gathered during the final evaluation mission in March and April 2016 as well as from the programme\u2019s Final Report which was published in May. Sustainability [in evaluation] is concerned with measuring whether the benefits of an activity are likely to continue after donor funding has been withdrawn . (DAC, 2008, parentheses added). In the AUP programmes the relevant benefits are their outputs, services and outcomes. The kind of sustainability envisaged is the maintenance of houses and community ser- vices as well as any improvements in community organisational capacity and social cohesion . Various researchers, consultants and practitioners have discussed the different dimen- sions of sustainability and how to achieve it (WASH, LinkedIn online, numerous discus- sants; Roberts & Williams, 2008). From this work we can identify five generic types or components of sustainability as follows: 1) Financial sustainability (attained through funding); 2) Institutional (the delivery of benefits is taken up by government as part of its policy, strategy, legal framework, procedures or training programme); 3) Environmental (natural resources are managed in such a way that, to the extent that they are needed for the delivery or maintenance of benefits, they will continue to be available and, in any case, will not be depleted to an extent that threatens their future existence); 4) Technical (the benefits are technically replicable when the programme ends; the tech- nology needed for the continued delivery of benefits is maintained, repaired and replaced); 5) Social (the benefits are valued by beneficiaries and are \u2018owned\u2019 by them); The following table shows how these types of sustainability apply to the AUP-2012 pro- gramme. ",
        "SUSTAINABILITY 39 Type Applicability of Type to AUP-2012 Possible Strategies to Strengthen Sustainability F I N A N C I A L Home owners value their new houses highly. They are likely to maintain them as far as resources allow. However, incomes are very low and indebtedness will restrain some. Develop community livelihoods strategies (e.g. community contracting for government) which are not project bound but are open-ended (e.g. road repairs and drainage clearance) I N S T I T U T I O N A L Sustainability of community assets, such as roads and pre- schools, is in doubt as local authorities struggle with limited financial resources ( 1 ) Strengthen CBOs so that sustainability of common benefits becomes an accepted communal responsibility. If possible, establish community \u2013 government partnerships for this. E N V I R O N M E N T A L The programme is environmentally sustainable. There have been problems such as damaging sand quarrying and Illegal logging in Kilinochchi but according to the GA these are now under control. The AUP-2010 Mid-Term Evaluation identified Palmyra tree depletion as a problem without providing data. The present evaluation did not measure this either but had an impression, no more, that the problem was not catastrophic. It is probably best to err on the side of caution. The present evaluation team also feels that placing limitations on sand mining for housing is of questionable benefit (see Chapter Four of part II of this report) GAs should continue the policy of requiring applications to cut down Palmyra trees and IPs should make beneficiaries aware of the alternatives ( 2 ) T E C H N I C A L The construction technology is replicable using local skills. Home owners can extend their houses or build new houses with / for others in the village or outside. However, the main demand for their service will be during the life of the programme ( 1 ). S O C I A L Home owners value their houses but, because of the dependency generated during the AUP programmes, expect the maintenance of community facilities to be carried out either by government or other development programmes or NGOs. The VRCs, as sustainable CBOs will have little, if any, role to play in sustaining the benefits of the programme. They were established solely for the programme and, although they have had significant success, they lack legal recognition. ( 2 ) Strengthen CBOs and create awareness of communities\u2019 responsibility for sustainability. ( 1 ) It is intended that community infrastructure be handed over to District Councils, Divisional Secretariats, Zonal Education Offices and communities. These, however, have financial constraints which make it unlikely that they will be able to maintain it. ( 2 ) The mid-term evaluation mentioned some alternatives which should be examined: \u201cFor structural work the beneficiaries tend to use Grandis ( Eucalyptus grandis ) as an alternative to Palmyra and in a small number of cases Palu is used. Traditionally Satinwood is preferred for front doors and Kohomba/Margosa, which has cultural significance, is used for door and window frames. Some beneficiaries proposed using Ginisapu, and subsequent investigation has suggested that it may have possible structural uses\u201d(p. 113). ( 3 ) The mid-term evaluation (MTE) of AUP-2010 concluded, in addition, that \u201cmost of the beneficiaries will not use their basic construction skills after their house is completed, as they will attend their main livelihood activities, such as fishing and agricultural work\u201d (pp. 57-58 ) In this sense technical sustainability will not be achieved. ( 4 ) The AUP-2010 MTE team were of the same opinion: \u201cThe VRCs that have been established by the project are likely to be temporary groups only. Whereas they are highly functional and useful during the construction process of houses for resettled households, they have neither the funds nor the sufficient organisational basis and objectives to continue functioning after the project ends.\u201d However, UN-Habitat have commented that \u201cBuilding capacities of the VRCs have not been wasted as these members also serve on committees of other CBOs, thereby contributing their knowledge and skills gained from capacity building programmes for the overall development of their communities.\u201d ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 40 The main strategies presented in the table, concern livelihoods and strengthening CBOs. It was reported the AUP-2012 MTE that work on these strategic areas was weaker than it should be. One important overarching constraint on sustainability is the dependency of local communities (see Chapter Four). As long as this remains, a strong community role in guaranteeing sustainability is unlikely. The mid-term evaluators of AUP-2010 extended the analysis of sustainability into the issue of sustainable resettlement as such. They argue that this requires more than the delivery of houses: \u2026 if only houses are built in villages and other facilities are inadequate or un- available, the chances for a sustainable resettlement in the place of origin are certainly reduced. Therefore, sustainable resettlement will to a large extent depend on the success in coordinating and providing complementary infra- structure and services . [\u2026 ] the absence of an integrated process may result in a delayed or weakened socio-economic response and recovery by the commu- nity. Several villages were visited where limitations on resources, such as water and schools, strained the social fabric. (Meindertsma and Nixon, 2012: 55-56). The authors went on to tell of a village where some 100 families had left because of the lack of schools and drinking water. In the focus group discussions for the mid-term and fi- nal evaluations, one of the recurrent expressed needs of the beneficiary villages remained water supply. AUP-2012, though UN-Habitat and its partner SDC, installed 16 community wells and 4 tube wells. They also built 19 pre-schools (UN-Habitat, 2016: 57-60). These are all important but coverage of all programme locations is far from complete. This is not a criticism of the Implementing Partners but rather an indication of design changes that could usefully be incorporated in future housing programmes ( 1 ). In almost all the focus group discussions in both the AUP-2012 MTE and the final eval- uation it was found that CBOs - in particular, the RDSs and WRDSs - had organised and carried out common activities to the benefit of the community. However, it was equally evident that they did not expect to maintain the benefits of the AUP programmes. ( 1 ) AUP-2014 incudes water as one of its areas of intervention though it seems to be mainly in the areas of irrigation and conservation than drinking water supply (HfH & WVL, 2015). There appears to be no specific (pre-) school component. ",
        "SUSTAINABILITY 41 Figure 7: Pre-school in Vivekanandanagar, Kilinochchi District, provided by the programme.The RDS helped build it, but will it maintain it? (28 th March 2016) In summary, it can be stated that: \u2022 Houses will be maintained by home owners; \u2022 Pre-schools, roads, wells could be maintained by communities if technical support arrangements were put in place (with local government); \u2022 Low incomes and indebtedness threaten capacity for continued individual and com- munity improvement; \u2022 CBO capacities have strong potential but have not been sufficiently developed. Recommendations made by the MTE team: 1. Establish community \u2013 local government partnerships; 2. Increase the livelihoods development component in marketable and income generat- ing trades (not only those with a fixed life span, like construction); 3. Strengthen CBOs and emphasise community responsibility for the sustainability of programme benefits. UN-Habitat responded to the first and third of these by recruiting a Community Consoli- dation Specialist at the end of the project \u201cto ensure the sustainability of the VRCs and link them with the relevant development partners at ground level\u201d (UN-Habitat, 2016: 22). The final evaluation team was unaware of this welcome measure until the programme\u2019s ",

The final report does not detail what the new Specialist would do. The recommendations were also taken up in the new AUP-2014 proposal which includes components which specifically address the second and third of these. It is unclear wheth- er the first recommendation will be incorporated ( 1 ). ( 1 ) UN-Habitat provided the following interesting information in September 2016 after the draft report had been written and, of course, after the fieldwork period: \u201cA CBO capacity building programme was continued after the end of the project to build capacities of the community to ensure the operation and maintenance of the completed infrastructure interventions. In addition all completed infrastructure was officially handed over to the respective line ministries and local government authorities for operation and maintenance and inventorization \u2026.. Two District level workshops were conducted in Killinochchi and Mullaitivu in early September 2016 for government officials to ensure sustainability of completed infrastructure implemented by UN-Habitat during their total reconstruction programme.\u201d ",
        "LIVELIHOODS AND TRAINING (AUP \u20132012) 43 6 Livelihoods and Training (AUP \u20132012) The AUP-2012, following on from its predecessor AUP-2010, had been implemented in the development mode rather than in the emergency recovery mode as was observed in the MTE report. This being so, while the provision of shelters for the homeless refu- gees was a priority of the programmes, it was also critical that the housing programmes were sustainable. Towards this end, it was felt that beneficiary households should be provided with adequate income earning opportunities to be able to afford the difference between the AUP grant (Rs.550,000) and the actual cost of construction, which tended to be higher than the grant. Long gone are the emergency circumstances under which quick-fix solutions were sought to address basic needs of the affected population. In the development mode, while addressing a basic need, its sustainability has also got to be considered (see also Chapter Five on Sustainability). It is in this context that this evaluation has considered livelihood and training programmes available to, and taken up by, the beneficiaries to be essential elements of the AUP programmes. The findings of the study in this respect are presented below. 6.1 Starting Life from Scratch Most uprooted people appear to have lost all they had as sources of livelihood along with whatever movable assets they had accumulated over generations. Having resettled on their own land with almost nothing but the housing assistance from the AUP pro- grammes, they are struggling to start afresh. Most are totally dependent on casual daily wages, when available, to meet their day-to-day living expenses. Under such circum- stances, a grant for the construction of a full house to replace the house lost in the war or to repair a partially damaged house is received with immense gratitude. However, unless there is a supplementary component to provide adequate and appropriate livelihood and training opportunities to increase household incomes, the housing programme could turn out to be not only unsustainable but also a burden on households, especially those in relatively lower income groups. Amongst the beneficiaries there were those who had regular sources of income, but which were inadequate to support supplementary expenditures, such as housing related expenses. There were others who had, at best, irregular, casual or seasonal income which drove them to borrowing at any cost rather than exploring opportunities to increase their income levels. The chapter on Indebtedness elaborates on these conditions. This study examined some factors inhibiting beneficiary households from engaging in activities to improve their income levels, particularly, their tendency not to capitalise on the various training programmes for skills development and/or participating in any liveli- hood enhancement programmes that may have been available to them. According to the household survey, only 1% of the AUP-2012 beneficiaries have been involved in formal construction training programmes (See Annex 7 \u2013 Table 1.2.20), 65% received \u201cinformal on-site training under skilled artisans\u201d while their respective houses were under construc- ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 44 tion, and 33% received no training of any sort. The 1% that received formal training had gone on to get employed in the construction trade as well. It is rather unfortunate that more beneficiary households had not taken advantage of this opportunity. It is also inter- esting to note that, while more than 80% of the beneficiaries in Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Batticaloa claimed that they had at least the informal onsite training, almost none of the beneficiaries in Mannar had been drawn to even the informal training on their building site. As a part of livelihood enhancement 20% of the beneficiaries had received some support towards agricultural crops, but 86% of these were from Batticaloa district (Table 1.2.27). It was also evident that beneficiaries regard livelihood assistance as a significant need, though only for a minority, in any housing programme. When asked what other support they would have desired to be incorporated in any future housing programme, 28% called for more livelihood assistance while only 4% wanted the quantum of the assis- tance increased and 68% had no opinion (Table 1.2.33). In terms of what additional benefits they would have desired in the current programme, more than a third opted for livelihood assistance (agricultural crops 5% and livestock 30%) while the rest voted for community based flanking measures (Table 1.2.32) In order that future housing programmes mitigate stressful financial experiences of the target groups, adequate and appropriate considerations need to be given to the liveli- hoods of beneficiaries. For example, a certain percentage of the housing grant could be set aside to support livelihood development programmes in which interested members of households could participate to receive training and other support. Since the com- mencement of the AUP programmes, there has been a strong effort to provide training in masonry, carpentry and other vocations to members of the beneficiary households. How- ever, the serious shortage of skilled labour in the target villages on the one hand and the fact that beneficiary households are struggling to make ends meet, on the other, means that the skills training programmes being implemented have fallen short of expectations. It would perhaps be necessary to conduct a focussed study to ascertain why the expected outcomes have not been achieved in these training programmes. 6.2 The AUP Programmes\u2019 Approach to Livelihood and Training Most of the EU\u2019s Multi-annual Indicative Programmes (MIPS) for Sri Lanka since 2008 have been dedicated to livelihood development. An exception is the AUP regional fa- cility which has been used solely to address housing needs and was not integrated into the MIPs. The possible justification that AUP-funded housing interventions have com- plemented EU livelihood interventions has not been borne out in reality as there is little geographical overlap between the two types of programme. This lack of EU programme integration has constituted a challenge for EU housing implementing partners who have been mandated to focus on housing. Since NERHP (AUP-2005 and AUP-2006) the need to include livelihood support measures within the housing programmes has been in- creasingly acknowledged by all parties. However, when it came to a decision on how to allocate funds between houses and livelihoods the EU Delegation seems to have taken ",
        "LIVELIHOODS AND TRAINING (AUP \u20132012) 45 the view that Sri Lankan authorities strongly preferred to dedicate AUP funds to maxim- ising house construction with an understanding that GAs would take care of livelihoods. Among the livelihood support measures training has been central. In conceptualising the Technical Assistance Package offered to the beneficiaries, skills training has in prac- tice been considered in earnest (UN-Habitat Operations Manual 2013-2015). Under this scheme, local artisans and youth were to be offered: \u2022 Training in masonry and carpentry (conducted in collaboration with NAITA and GIZ) \u2022 Skills upgrading of skilled construction labour \u2022 Joint effort in finding ways for cost-reduction and improved quality. Such training was intended for beneficiaries (or members of their households) with an interest in developing the skills required to complete their houses cost effectively. Once the skills were acquired, recognised and certified, they should be a source of livelihood generation. However, less than 4% in either of the programmes had attempted to make a career out of the skills they had acquired . Further, the non-availability of skilled and competent labour has often been cited as reasons for delays in completing the house constructions in the two programmes, which illustrates the demand for such skilled labour in the districts where the programmes are operational. The beneficiary survey conducted for this study found that 77% of AUP-2010 beneficiar- ies and 91% of those in AUP-2012 have claimed that they received training, of whom, 63% of AUP-2010 and 87% of AUP-2012 received training in construction related ac- tivities. There were instances of beneficiaries having acquired skills while in the refugee camps. Those who had been traditional farmers from Mannar district when relocated around the fishing villages of Kalpitiya in the Puttalam district had acquired fishing skills and on return to Mannar had engaged in fishing for a livelihood in addition to agriculture (Case Study 10). Some others had not been able to use these skills productively either in their house construction or in generating an income (Case Study 15, in the second part of this report). 6.3 Life Beyond the Construction Phase As is explained in Chapter 7 on Indebtedness, a large majority of beneficiaries in the north and some in Batticaloa are carrying significant post-construction debts, which could only be settled if there are flows of steady incomes to the beneficiaries. A general attitude of the beneficiaries towards these debts is that \u201c\u2026help would arrive from some- where someday\u2026.will wait for such a day\u2026\u201d \u2013 a clear case of dependency syndrome (see also Chapter Four on Dependency). Future programmes should be conceived to avoid such levels of dependency on external assistance. On a positive note, a very few have taken the debt burden seriously and have already sought and got employment in other parts of the country and overseas, mainly in the Middle East. However, for there to be more such job seekers among the beneficiaries, adequate skills are required and/ or placement counselling should be in place. In this regard, there are a few constraints to overcome. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 46 6.4 Lack of Vocational Skills Training Vocational skills such as masonry, carpentry, plumbing and electrical works are in great demand, but there are inadequate formal training opportunities (other than the afore- mentioned training on the house the beneficiaries construct) and/or awareness among the target communities for making a vocation and livelihood from these demands. Other vocations in perpetual demand and for which training could be provided are sewing, housekeeping (for overseas markets), computing (data entry), motor mechanics, poultry farming, animal husbandry and many more. The evaluation team interviewed the Batticaloa District Manager of NAITA and the Of- ficer-In-Charge of the Kallady Vocational Training Centre (VTC) in the same city. NAITA has training centres located around the District but unfortunately does not provide mo- bile training to villages. This would be an expensive training option for villagers who would have to meet transport and accommodation costs, if they were expected to travel to these training centres. Kallady VTC, however, is one of fourteen Rural Vocational Training Centres (RVTCs) in Batticaloa District which take training to the villages. Courses lead to certificates which are nationally recognized so can be used in applying for jobs. After six months\u2019 training trainees are required to carry out six months on-the-job training with an employer near the village which has been found by the RVTC. Moreover, trainees receive Rs.2,000 per month as a stipend and when training on-the-job the employer is expected to provide payment. There are no fees for construction-based courses (although other courses cost Rs.8,000 per month). 6.5 Post-training investments for livelihood development When asked why no members of the family had sought any kind of training, a typical answer was that with such big debts to carry there is no way that they would be able to pay for training as well. Some had cattle and/or poultry before they were displaced by the war and would be interested in continuing with such livelihoods, but they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to buy new livestock while burdened with current debts. Even those with interests in sewing or computing as careers, the mere thought of having to invest on sewing machines or computers after the training constrains them from considering these vocations. 6.6 Recommendations 1. Housing grant packages need to consider an element of livelihood development in consultation with beneficiaries. These could be for formal vocational training (as op- posed to the current scheme of training offered in each beneficiary\u2019s own house construction) or setting up a home based livelihood activity; 2. A focussed review of all AUP programmes linked to formal as well as informal training schemes need to be conducted in order for future housing programmes to be better designed to increase livelihood development while addressing the labour shortage; ",
        "LIVELIHOODS AND TRAINING (AUP \u20132012) 47 3. Opportunities should be sought to collaborate with Rural Vocational Training Centres such as those in Batticaloa District and described above for formal vocational training; 4. Where households are able to nominate one or two members for vocational training, they could be given bonus points in the selection process; 5. Those being sent on training could also draw a nominal allowance during training, except where these are already provided by the training organisation, such as RVTCs, to motivate more to take up the opportunity. The allowance could be, at least, equiv- alent to average daily wage they would normally earn; 6. If this allowance is considered unsustainable because of the numbers involved, it could be disbursed as a training loan to be paid back after a certain period on becom- ing gainfully employed. The loan could be from a revolving fund to be set up by the state or NGO or a partnership of the two facilitated by one or more IPs; 7. For those households who prefer to pursue a livelihood activity such as cattle farming, poultry farming or to set up a small enterprise like a tailoring shop an appropriate grant plus loan scheme could be built in to the housing programme. For such a scheme to be introduced, a clear understanding of all related aspects needs to be comprehended; 8. An awareness campaign on the benefits of livelihood development/vocational train- ing should precede the selection process. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 48 7 Indebtedness The MTE cited a Centre for Poverty Analysis (CEPA) study conducted in three northern districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu, which suggested that the housing pro- grammes had significantly increased indebtedness of beneficiary households (Romeshun, et al, 2014). This finding, however, has been contested at various fora because unsus- tainable debt involves many other factors (e.g. while borrowing to build a house is a fun- damental practice in any economy, having intermediaries lending at up to 30% interest rates is not and is exploitative). What is perhaps relevant to this evaluation is not whether the housing programmes caused indebtedness (and the study is careful to state that there is no direct causality) but the impact of high levels of indebtedness on the sustainability of the housing programmes and the overall living conditions of the beneficiaries. 7.1 Extent of indebtedness According to the CEPA study, 85% of all households reported indebtedness with an av- erage of Rs. 150,871. However, as this sample included those who had not commenced construction, not all the debts could be attributed to the housing programme. The MTE, on the other hand, found that the debt situation had improved between AUP-2010 and AUP-2012. The beneficiary survey done for the MTE revealed that from among the AUP-2010 beneficiaries, 83% were found to be carrying debts, all related to house con- struction, while there was a marked drop among the AUP-2012 beneficiaries at 68%. However, in the survey done for the current AUP-2012 Final Evaluation 93% of benefi- ciaries had claimed to have borrowed for the construction of their house but only 72% find it to be a problem (see Annex 7 \u2013 tables 1.2.34 and 1.2.35). What was hypothesised in the MTE has proven correct according to the current survey: while the AUP-2010 sam- ple contained all those who had completed their houses, the lower percentage of debt- ors in the AUP-2012 sample then included beneficiaries of houses still in progress, some of whom may have not reached the stage in construction requiring funds in excess of the instalments from the housing grant. The current survey done on a sample of AUP-2012 beneficiaries who had all completed the construction shows a much higher percentage of indebtedness. A scientific study exclusively on indebtedness among AUP beneficiaries would perhaps shed light on specific causes and the nature in which indebtedness occurs within communities. However, what is relevant to this study is not such specifics but the revelation of a borrowing trend emerging amongst the beneficiaries, which, if not taken into consideration and appropriately addressed in the programme design, may dilute the positive outcome of the AUP. There have been instances of relatively debt-free, highly disciplined construction practices as presented in Case Study 1. These examples need to be documented and presented to potential beneficiaries to demonstrate what can be achieved through the exercise of discipline during the construction process ( 1 ). ( 1 ) In their comments on a draft of the present report UN-Habitat informed the evaluation team that \u201c..it also needs to be noted that SDC in its studies found that despite participatory budgeting and financial counselling for the beneficiaries, they could not prevent beneficiaries building beyond their means\u201d.

        "INDEBTEDNESS 49 Figure 8: This beneficiary in Batticaloa District completed the house according to plan and within the grant amount. He did borrow to add a petty shop to the front of the house, which gives him sufficient income to pay off the loan and complete the plastering of walls still outstanding. (see Case Study 1) The mid-term evaluation also showed that the AUP programmes may have caused stress to beneficiary households for the following reasons. \u2022 A requirement of the programme that beneficiaries contribute to the housing pro- cess through the offer of their mostly unskilled labour, though well intended, may compete with the time necessary to go out and earn a living for the period of house construction, especially for those dependent on casual labour opportunities; \u2022 When income is reduced, some are driven to taking loans to cover living expenses, which are compounded when construction loans are added on; \u2022 When the house construction is complete, beneficiaries are dependent on the mea- gre income from whatever irregular casual labour is available to settle all outstanding debts in addition to spending on the family\u2019s daily living needs; \u2022 Despite having completed the house to the level required to receive the full grant, there are still houses with some incomplete features such as plastering of walls and fixing doors and windows. Only a steady income which is enough to allow saving beyond living expenses would see these features completed. This study found the conditions leading to formal as well as informal borrowing at ex- orbitant interest rates ( 1 ) affect the majority of AUP beneficiaries to varying degrees. The beneficiary survey found that, while the acquisition of a permanent home brought a lot of joy to the beneficiaries, the indebtedness had caused substantial anxiety, anguish and ( 1 ) Households interviewed for the case studies indicated borrowing at 3% per month from local money lenders.

        "THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS 51 8 The construction process 8.1 Overall consideration: high quality of houses The MTE found that overall quality of the houses within AUP-2012 was good and this is confirmed in the 17 additional observations made during the final evaluation mission. The reasons for this are the same as given in the MTE ( 1 ). In addition, evaluators were pleased to hear from beneficiaries\u2019 family members about their high level of satisfaction with living in the new houses, in terms of sense of security, sense of good investment for the future, houses perceived good quality and robustness, beauty (providing social estimation), technical resilience ( 2 ). 8.2 Supervision of construction Observations made in the final evaluation also revealed some insights into how IPs and beneficiaries worked together. In one of the observations it was noted that all the houses built in Puthuvely village (Mannar district) ( 3 ) have some interesting common features such as the main door being on the gable wall (which is a good option in case the house is expanded). Here Vashtu prescriptions are not followed (because of the beneficiaries\u2019 Muslim faith) so that the internal organisation of space is free and independent of the imposition of measures and proportions. In a second case, in another district, the IP lost control of some beneficiaries\u2019 construction in terms of layout, design and technical actions. The reason for this is unclear. One case is especially alarming ( 4 ). Here the proposed design was completely changed by the benefi- ciary, who decided instead on an over-ambitious \u2018dream house\u2019 which resulted in failure and leaving the house in an incomplete state ( 5 ). In addition, certain Vashtu prescriptions are currently dramatically inhibiting the daily use of the kitchen (with unexpected and undesirable consequences in a family with children) and the internal toilet (accessible through an unnecessary corridor) which is highly malodorous. External doors are also missing and the log-book was not available at the time of the visit. The evaluation team does not know how or when this lack of proper technical guidance was allowed to occur, who allowed it, who failed to warn the beneficiary of the impracticality of their prefer- ence and who failed to prevent or mitigate this action. Unfortunately, this vindicates one of the more critical technical comments made in MTE report which stated: ( 1 ) From MTE (page 48): \u201cDrawings and technical specifications provide a sufficient set of details; The beneficiaries fully trusted both the Engineers and T.O.\u2019s recommendations and duly followed their instructions and technical explanations\u201d. ( 2 ) More information on satisfaction with the programme is given in Chapter Nine ( 3 ) See Observations nos. 22, 23, 24 ( 4 ) See Observation no. 17 ( 5 ) It is especially painful to point out that this house was considered \u201ccompleted\u201d in January 2016 (actually it is very much still in progress) and the MTE recommendations should have been applied in timely manner. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 52 beneficiaries have been left with excessive freedom of decision over technical aspects whereas engineers\u2019 opinion should not be amendable ( 1 ) This should serve as a clear word of warning to AUP-2014 IPs. Another significant observation was the almost total rejection of pre-cast doors and win- dows frames, mostly due to Vashtu prescriptions. All of those interviewed during the 2016 mission, both the AUP-2012 beneficiaries and the potential applicants for AUP- 2014, believe such materials should not be used in a permanent private house and should only be used for public buildings or experimental houses. It was confirmed, during all observations made, that construction follow-up from IPs\u2019 Technical Officers, Engineers and Community Mobilisers was timely and complete. They visited each and every site at least twice a week, which was generally sufficient to ensure good implementation (leaving aside the slow overall rate of construction ( 2 )). The obser- vations found that TOs and Engineers were still very warmly welcomed by all beneficiaries even after some time after completion. Beneficiaries stated they had been very proactive and technically supportive during the procurement and construction phases. One minor defect reported in the MTE report ( 3 ) was an unfinished floor; this has since been rectified according to minimum requirement standards (see photographs below): Figure 9: Observation 2 (ex MTE 29) \u2013 an unpaved floor rectified between evaluation visits according to minimum standards ( 1 ) MTE, page 50 ( 2 ) See MTE, pages 54-55 ( 3 ) See MTE, pages 48-49 and illustration no. 7 (Obs. no. 2) ",
        "THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS 53 8.3 A future mezzanine option A point which the evaluation team made in the MTE report (pp. 50-51) and which it reiterates after the final evaluation mission is that referring to the excessive height of the spine wall as well as, therefore, of the external walls. This recommendation remains technically reasonable and will lead to financial savings ( 1 ). Many beneficiaries justified the height of the spine wall ( 2 ) in terms of heat extraction. However, this was already refuted in the MTE report ( 3 ). Our position is that only a mezza- nine, designed in the future, could reasonably justify the excessive height. Unfortunately, for reasons which are unclear, beneficiaries are instinctively opposed to the idea of a mezzanine as an improvement to their houses ( 4 ). We reiterate our suggestion that the IPs carry out a technical study aimed at testing the immediate and financial benefits a mezzanine would bring to the basic house. The mezzanine must obviously make use of the high roof and not interfere with bedroom and shrine room privacy. As such, the natural expansion would be parallel to the spine- wall (sketch no. 1, below) along the living room, although a structural problem would arise, as it would be necessary to have a long concrete beam (section roughly: 30cm large, 40cm height), plus foundations and plinths. Given that this increase in structural elements will reduce the intended flexibility of incremental growth, this option should be abandoned. Figure 10: Sketch no. 1 \u2013 mezzanine not feasible ( 1 ) With special reference to Puthuvely village (Observations nos. 22, 23, 24 - Mannar district) implemented houses, we still observed an unnecessarily height of the walls, meaning more materials, frameworks, working days, technical troubles,... ( 2 ) Some 15\u201d; up to 30 block rows over the finished floor level ( 3 ) It seems redundant here to go back to those points ( 4 ) We urge IPs to investigate on this technical portion of the house volume to be developed and exploited ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 54 Alternatively (sketch no. 2, below), a small mezzanine, spacious enough to set up a desk ( 1 ) and a mat at night and to allow access to the slab above the corridor, and which would be useful as storage space, seems a worthwhile option to explore. It does not sig- nificantly need a structural increase and would provide the family with additional space which can be used in various ways. Figure 11a: Sketch no. 2 \u2013 mezzanine feasible ( 1 ) A desk space, especially dedicated to children\u2019s study, has been repeatedly mentioned and urged by many beneficiaries (AUP2012) and potential applicants (AUP2014) as one of the most important tools to directly improve and benefit families\u2019 life and social recognition ",

        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 56 8.4 Women and family members contributed to construction The final evaluation observations confirm the findings of the MTE that female family members contributed to the construction phases and played a crucial role; no major differences was reported in the kind of contribution made during the last phases of AUP- 2012 and as such all positive findings noted in the MTE report are ( 1 ). In general, the more family members contributed to construction, the less money was spent on skilled and/or unskilled labour, confirming the programme\u2019s intentions in this respect. 8.5 Materials quality tests During the FTE mission no further strength compressive block tests could be carried out because of the absence of cement blocks available and suitable for testing (construction work had finished more than a year earlier). Evaluators asked the IP to provide them with official documents showing the results of tests spontaneously carried out during the con- struction period ( 2 ) but this request was unsuccessful. However, our numerous visual observations confirm the good results reported for the MTE ( 3 ). 8.6 Toilets It is confirmed that toilets have been one very significant improvement in the housing programme AUP-2012. It is important to partially revise what had been noted in the MTE: In the Kilinochchi e Mullaitivu districts (Full and Repair Houses) detached toilets have often been built many metres away from the house (a paradox, taking into consideration the danger of snakes and overall insecurity, especially during the night). This choice is due to the perception, rooted in the traditional thinking mainly among rural Sri Lankans, particularly of the Tamils and especially in the northern districts, that a toilet in any form is \u201cdirty\u201d and hence needs to be de- tached and located at a distance from the main house (4) (only the urban elites are comfortable with internal toilets) . By confirming these findings, the reason why such a preference is given should be recon- sidered, since many potential applicants of future AUP-2014 highlighted that \u201cdetached toilets would be preferable because of the hygienic justification, due to scarcity of wa- ( 1 ) From MTE, page 60: \u201cMany female family members carried out activities such as mixing concrete, moving water and blocks, casting blocks, treating wood elements, preparing meals for the labourers. No harassment or misconducts have been reported\u201d. ( 2 ) Refer to: emails dated 28-29/03/2016 ( 3 ) See MTE, pages 67-68 ( 4 ) A new house with an attached toilet should be introduced to new applicants through thorough capacity building sessions; people are now used to that and the presence of Public Health Inspector would help in winning over people\u2019s potential resistance ",

Figure 12: Different kinds of Toilet in AUP2012 implemented houses (left): attached with external access. Observation no. 04, Welikakandy village, Batticaloa District. (right): detached. Observation no. 21, Ganashapuram village, Kilinochchi District. 8.7 Verandas As mentioned whilst commenting on AUP-2012 findings and incremental expansion over the grant, verandas have likely been the most common improvement across the all dis- tricts. As mentioned in the case of the potentially proposed \u201cwashroom\u201d, verandas could be erected more or less appropriately and DRR-wise, technically speaking. Many Obser- vations carried on, show verandas made by proper and solid concrete poles, with fair tightness between vertical and horizontal elements, or through salvaged or raw materials (wood poles); the practical outcome being the same (protect from sun rays and rain; allow family to have a natural extension of the internal living space; giving the family the opportunity to develop a livelihood activity; giving the children a protected playground; etcetera), obviously the performances, the costs and the technical quality will be different according to the materials and the techniques used. Figure 13: Verandas in AUP2012 implemented houses: different kinds and technical alternatives:Left: Observation no. 4 (Veppavedduwan village - Batticaloa district) andRight: Observation no. 27 (Iranaipillai village - Mullaitivu district) ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 58 Verandas could also be seen (in an incremental housing perspective) a valid step to pre- pare the \u201clarger house of tomorrow\u201d. This can be done by erecting columns (with rele- vant plinth and iron bars, prolonged over the top in order to be ready to receive a beam later on) instead of poles, by digging proper trenches and filling them with rubble stones, to have a sort of pre-foundation ready. To effectively respond to DRR requirement and collaborate to the whole structure solicitation, core-house columns in the front should also be enlarged, to receive an increased charge and wind pressure; the below drawings displays a potential veranda, designed as part of the core-house, not intended to be \u201cstuck\u201d in the future: Figure 14: Veranda \u2013 if foundations are properly implemented, it might be used as a large incremental growth potential The costs related to such an element are not excessive, considering the very high poten- tial of the veranda as an important open volume to exploit in different manners. 8.8 Sanitation facilities Harvesting rain water for non-drinkable uses , was already explored within MTE (refer to pages 65-66): it was said that \u201cboth beneficiaries and local practice seem [to] discour- age this practice, therefore Indian Housing Project Model house displays a practical solu- tion to be explored\u201d. We insist that the proposed IHP Model House solution is a very good one, worthy to be replicated and broadly spread throughout the future housing scheme(s). ",
        "THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS 59 Figure 15: Rain-water harvesting for non-drinkable use (incomplete):Indian Housing Project Model House (Kilinochchi district) But unfortunately, again during the 40 observations carried out (for both AUP-2012 and AUP-2014) the majority of beneficiaries and potential applicants seemed not interested in this practice, as common reply was: \u201cwe have enough water during the rainy season, whereas during the dry season harvested water got rapidly deteriorated and hence not usable\u201d. The above points from people are correct and Evaluation Team does not state anything going opposite the practicality of a reasonable lifestyle. An alternative reservoir approach was identified on the way to Mannar which is described in the second part of the report (section on sanitation) as it has potential for incorpora- tion in the new AUP-2014. 8.9 Use of appropriate alternative technologies Within the last phase of AUP-2012, alternative construction materials and/or technolog- ical alternatives have been hardly used for the construction of the houses; as reported in the MTE, this has been mainly due to the extreme shortage of building material available that differs from the local customs, to the costs potentially linked to the transport, the possibly higher prices of new materials themselves and to the lack of specific technical knowledge ( 1 ) of the unskilled labour employed. Moreover, culturally, new material and/ ( 1 ) Fixing sashes needs some more technical skills and training than traditional wood frames ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 60 or technologies cause a certain level of mistrust and fear among the population, thus making the use of new elements difficult. Many amongst interviewed potential applicants under AUP-2014 showed a very high interest in bulk purchasing as much as possible of construction materials (such as: tiles, wood components, cement blocks, sand and cement), sharing transportation costs and optimising logistics; this witnesses about a solid social cohesion existing in the villages and a clear picture about purchasing bigger quantities at more competitive prices. 8.10 Recommendations and Lessons Learnt As mentioned in the MTE report, the overall technical quality of the houses is good, and all materials have been appropriately procured, treated, used and partly maintained. Some improvements have been observed, mainly concerning a new veranda in the main front (wood poles and tin-sheets), plastering and/or painting new house surfaces and power supplying by their own means or loaning further money. All beneficiaries highlighted the Technical Officers\u2019 (TOs) crucial role in orienting and sup- porting them during the construction period; their appreciation is very large and many stated that \u201cwithout TOs this outcome wouldn\u2019t be possible\u201d. TOs\u2019 role was not only supportive in technical terms (materials, techniques) but also from procurement and management side at large, by supporting and orient CBOs to organize bulk purchases, selecting suppliers, testing materials. Unfortunately, MTE technical recommendations (see particularly MTE report pp. 50-51 and 70-71) did not have a real impact and were not taken into any practical account; actually, engineers claimed that those recommendations were officialised only in January 2015, when the houses had been completed or in an advanced stage, however those technical recommendations (ridge height; cross ventilation; limiting beneficiaries\u2019 free initiatives beyond their possibilities; etc.) had been repeatedly urged during the many Observations, and discussed in detail during both the workshop held in Kilinochchi on 17/09/2014 and the debriefing held in Colombo on 25/09/2014 ( 1 ). Generally beneficiaries said houses are easily maintainable and nobody complained about it; also internal kitchen displayed a very good technical functionality (chimney is full per- forming in removing the smoke) and allowing women to cook and look after children at once, even during strong rains or during the night. A long-term vision (the house is expected to last for at least two generations) is largely notable throughout many interviewees; beneficiaries have returned after 20-30 years of continued displacement and a complete lack of roots (livelihood, social networks, homes, etc.) marks their lives. Since they display a fair knowledge of their future possibilities (ba- sically they do not expect great changes in their lives, unless restarting a fair job-income ( 1 ) In their comments on a draft of this report UN-Habitat stated \u201c\u2026 over 3,000 houses were well into wall construction of which almost 2,300 had commenced roof construction by September 2014. There was little that could be incorporated from these particular recommendations at this stage.\u201d ",
        "THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS 61 chain to stabilise their near future), they point out the house as the very element to bet on, to turn a brand new page in their family\u2019s life; any change regarding the house (new materials; restriction to Vashtu prescriptions; twinning the houses; etc.) are badly per- ceived as they potentially affect that abovementioned simple goal. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 62 9 The Participatory Process This evaluation looked for evidence on the nature of beneficiary participation in the AUP- 2012 programme. There was encouraging evidence of very high involvement of ben- eficiaries in the construction of their own houses as well as in those of others in the community. However, the study also concluded that there could have been and should have been greater participation in some other aspects of the programme discussed be- low. Being promoted as an \u201cOwner Driven Programme\u201d, it is expected that the AUP pro- grammes employ participatory strategies at all stages of the programme. Such an ap- proach would result in a greater degree of success in the programme as beneficiaries, as primary stakeholders, tend to take \u201cownership\u201d of the programme by actively involving in all aspects of the programme. This study has observed a great deal of beneficiary participation in three forms. Firstly, they have been involved in the design and construction of their own houses. When asked about their levels of satisfaction in this regard almost 90% rated it at 8 or above on a 1 to 10 scale with 10 being highest level of satisfaction (see Annex 7 \u2013 Table 1.2.12). The district of Batticaloa scored a high 98% at this satisfaction level while Mannar only had a score of 63%. It is unclear to the evaluators why there was such a variation between the two districts. The reason why such high average proportion of beneficiaries felt satisfied with their involvement was because they had the opportunity to see the plan of the house to be constructed (57% felt this was important) and all aspects of the construction was with their consent and cooperation (30%). Strangely, only 12% cited all aspects of the construction being as they desired as the reason for their levels of satisfaction (An- nex 7 \u2013 Table 1.2.15). Secondly, though not to a very great extent, they have voluntarily assisted in the construction of other houses in the village with a 62% participation rate (Annex 7 \u2013 Table 1.2.16). Of those who did not participate a significant 18% felt that it was improper to interfere in others\u2019 affairs. Thirdly, they have contributed their skills, time and labour towards various aspects in the overall planning and implementation of the programmes or in the planning and/or the construction of community infrastructure initiated through AUP programmes. Perhaps the only serious concern is the inadequate involvement of the beneficiaries in the beneficiary selection process and in the generation of model plans for beneficiaries to choose from. The theoretical \u201cownership\u201d that stakeholder participation is expected to bring to a pro- gramme was quite evident in the pride most beneficiaries expressed while describing their experiences. Some talked of how much they contributed in labour towards the ",
        "THE PARTICIPATORY PROCESS 63 construction. The relatively high levels of stakeholder participation in the housing process could be attributed to the involvement of the Village Rehabilitation Committees (VRCs). The VRC is a ten-member committee in each GN Division made up of AUP programme beneficiaries in each of those GN Divisions. Their roles have been varied \u2013 advocacy to facilitation of skilled labour hire and bulk material purchase to mobilising voluntary unskilled labour. In almost all VRCs there had been a tendency for members of other village level CBOs (Community Based Organisations) such as RDS (Rural Development Society) and WRDS (Women\u2019s Rural Development Society) to be voted in as members. This perhaps is a rural political phenomenon where persons acting with authority in an existing organisation are perceived to be influential enough in the village to be repeatedly voted in to take on any new position being created in the village. For this reason, doubts have been raised as to whether there is a real need for VRCs and if all activities current- ly carried out by them could not be assigned to existing CBOs. There is no doubt that the VRCs, formed exclusively for the housing programme, are performing well and have made significant contributions towards the positive outcomes of the AUP programme. It is doubtful that CBOs formed for other purposes and reporting to different agencies would be as conscientious as VRCs have been. Would these other CBOs, for instance, obtain quotes from local traders for the supply of various building materials and arrange for their purchase in bulk for groups of beneficiaries resulting in cheaper and better qual- ity building materials? Would they be able to bring in skilled labour when required by the beneficiaries and, most importantly, mobilise volunteers to provide unskilled labour to the most vulnerable in the village? 9.1 Recommendations \u2022 Housing designs need to be flexible enough to accommodate beneficiary inputs at a very early stage in the process. Ideally, workshops should be organised for potential beneficiaries at convenient locations to jointly generate the type plans. This would be a great opportunity, not only to draw in user inputs into the design of the type plans, but also to make the potential beneficiaries aware of the likely financial and other hardships to be encountered when deviating from the type plan. Case studies of good practices as well as bad practices with reasons for both need to be made aware of to all beneficiaries \u2022 A mechanism to solicit and include target group suggestions to improve the benefi- ciary selection process should be built into the programmes. This idea appears in the AUP-2014 proposal presented by HfH and WVL. \u2022 Regular workshops for community leaders (perhaps for groups of VRCs) with experi- enced facilitators should be scheduled to implement community action plans such as the SIP.

        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 64 10 Visibility If compared with MTE (field activities: September 2014), no significant changes are to be mentioned regarding visibility of AUP-2012 housing programme; still, some signboards showing the project\u2019s main information are present throughout many targeted villages. During the debriefing held in Colombo with the IPs (April 12 th , 2016) Evaluation team again asked why recommended clay-plaques ( 1 ) (small dimension) had not been placed (following AUP-2008 example) ( 2 ): accordingly, IPs representative insisted in their posi- tion, stating that such a plaques would increase a sense of dependence, whereas the newly acquired home should be considered as of their own entire property. However, plaques were installed at all infrastructure works carried out under AUP-2012 such as wells, community centres and pre-schools. This amounted to 47 plaques. Whilst understanding the abovementioned consideration, the evaluation team does not entirely agree with that, since many examples of donors\u2019 contribution are duly \u201csigned\u201d through those simple plaques, paying respect to people having contributed to that con- struction, moreover they show the help factually provided to affected people living so far away; the below illustration shows on the left a standard road-side board and on the right a possible, an example of a commemorative plaque of another EU-funded programme: Figure 16: (left) Typical signboard village under EU- AUP-2012; (right) Typical clay-plaque under EU-ACAP programme Prior to the field phase of the mission, the evaluation team received the UN-Habitat Final Report on AUP-2012 where it was reported that five \u2018visibility stickers\u2019 had been pasted on vehicle vehicles funded by the EU. Media tools as mentioned in the Final Report (page 26), such as: publication, video, pho- to galleries, are very comprehensive and of good quality and provide the viewer with a large (and touching, in some case) set of information ( 3 ).

UN-Habitat has informed the evaluators that it will discuss more specific, technical challenges of post-conflict reconstruction programmes, including AUP-2012, in a forthcoming report on good practices and lessons learned. This was in preparation at the time of writing (September 2016). ",
        "CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS 65 11 Conclusions & Recommendations 11.1 Introduction In this chapter we look at both the conclusions and recommendations of the evaluation. However, we shall not be listing or reviewing either. They are detailed and summarised in the forgoing chapters. Many are the same as presented in the report of the mid-term evaluation which took place in September 2014. Some of them have been adopted in the design for the AUP-2014 programme. Here, however, we wish to concentrate on the overall conclusions and recommendations - those which can be used to guide the future direction and design of the AUP programmes. 11.2 Positive Features of the AUP Programmes The global objective of AUP-2012 is \u201cto address medium term rehabilitation needs of returnees and their host communities in the North and East of Sri Lanka\u201d with the key indicators being: \u201cthe number of returnees benefiting directly from improved housing, flanking infrastructure, training in construction or tenure title regularisations as a result of the action\u201d. The target set for these indicators is 19,600 people which the programme easily surpassed with 71,489. The reasons the implementing partner gives for such a large difference in the figures are that it made foreign exchange rate gains, achieved savings on operations costs and required increased beneficiary contributions (UN-Habitat, 2016: 30). There are many positive features but the following are some of the most notable: 1. There is a very high-level of beneficiary satisfaction , not simply because they now have a permanent house instead of temporary dwellings but because of the technical quality of the houses. The field survey shows that 94% of beneficiaries were very sat- isfied with the programme; 2. As a result the EU, UN-Habitat and SDC are all held in very high regard ( 1 ); 3. There was a high-level of home owner participation but somewhat more in the construction than the design of the houses where shortcomings have been iden- tified in Chapter Eight. There has been an attempt to take local culture into ac- count though, as pointed out in parts of the report this is not everywhere the case. Toilets are a case in point. In some districts detached toilets have been built to ad- dress perceptions that toilets are \u201cdirty\u201d and must be at a distance from the main house; 4. There are parts of the programme where women\u2019s participation is clearly visible, most notably in the implementation and management of the construction process and in the leadership of the VRCs. UN-Habitat-provided leadership training which undoubtedly contributed to this; ( 1 ) Though AusAID/DFAT was a donor it was never specifically mentioned by discussants in the FGDs ",

Many process aspects of the programme are very good and several improved in AUP-2012 compared with AUP-2010 before it. For example, beneficiaries reported almost universally in the survey and focus group discussions that grant instalments were always paid on time and that Technical Officers and other field staff of the IPs were of much assistance in the procurement and construction process. At the management level the monitoring system is a detailed and systematic one providing regular progress updates. 6. There is evidence that social cohesion has been improved by AUP-2012. In the household survey some 90% of AUP-2012 beneficiaries believed that the relationship with other members of the community had improved greatly since the start of the housing programme.

An earlier version of the logical framework, which had been submitted as part of UN-Habitat\u2019s proposal to the EU, contained numerous indicators which were not SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound). The present version represents a significant improvement which allows for better tracking of progress (the same is true for the revised AUP-2010 logframe). The evaluators received the Quarterly Report for Quarter 3 of 2014 when they had already almost completed the draft evaluation report so were unable to incorporate much of its information. However, this final report does make use of them. ",

UNMEASUR- ABLE 11.3 Learning the Big Lessons In this section we consider how this positive performance can be taken into the future, such as in the AUP-2014 which was launched in December 2015 and future potential housing-related programmes. AUP has already gone through five phases and donors and implementing agencies have shown themselves capable of learning from the first when designing the following. Similarly, they are now keen to learn from the lessons of Phase II or, rather, from the combined lessons of Phases I and II ( 1 ). Below we present what we believe to be the most important of these. 11.3.1 General Considerations of the AUP Approach The preceding chapters have identified several important problems which have not been solved during the implementation of AUP-2012 or preceding programmes such as de- pendency, indebtedness and low sustainability. We believe that these can at least in part be traced to the model of home owner driven development as practised in the Owner Driven Model approach in Sri Lanka. We shall explain why and go on to propose how the model can be transformed to make use of its existing strengths while acquiring essential new ones. ( 1 ) In the workshop held in Kilinochchi with IPs the participants showed that they had numerous ideas of how to improve the AUP some of which coincide with the evaluation team\u2019s ideas. This is a positive sign demonstrating willingness to learn from their own experiences. ",
        "CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS 71 The Irony of the Home Owner Driven Approach In Chapter Four we argued that the home owner driven approach has largely failed to ex- ploit the development of a cooperative social fabric or created opportunities for integrat- ed development which could enhance the resilience of individuals and communities. This is because the approach adopted has been sectorial (i.e. housing) and has focused on individual household participation in the design and construction of houses rather than village approaches such as practised by SDC. Flanking work has provided some broader community benefits but little to make community actions sustainable (e.g. CBOs capable of community level planning, financing, implementation and maintenance). As explained in Chapter Four the focus on housing was required by the donor in the call for propos- als ( 1 ) with the reasoning that it complemented multiple parallel livelihood development projects in existence at the time. However, this complementarity is more theoretical than real in so far as they do not always coincide geographically. The Unwanted Consequences The home owner driven approach has not managed to overcome, and at times might have exacerbated, problems of unsustainable indebtedness, dependency syndrome and the low sustainability of community and possibly individual assets. This is not to say that the approach is the only cause but it has contributed to it. The way it has done so we present graphically as an interconnected process in the figure below. Home Owner Driven Approach Weak CBOs Individualistic development Low sustainability Indebtedness Low ownership of community assets Dependency Figure 17: The Interconnected Process of the Home Owner Driven Approach, Indebtedness, Dependency and Low Sustainability The emphasis on the home owner taking the lead in decisions about his/her house has unintentionally contributed to further indebtedness which home owners cannot manage. Meanwhile the individualistic house-centred approach leaves CBOs weak (though social cohesion is high) and ownership of community assets low. This results in a dependent attitude to the sustainability of the latter. ( 1 ) Source: UN-Habitat, response to the draft evaluation report ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 72 The Shape of Future Housing Assistance Programmes in Sri Lanka The MTE evaluation team believed that as AUP-2012 ended one should consider design- ing a different developmental model for future housing programmes. It would address the key problems of dependency and indebtedness and ensure that benefits are not only sustainable but more widely enjoyed as explicitly formulated in the Action Document for AUP-2014. An ideal approach places not the individual but the community at the heart, not hand-outs but partnership, not a programme which ends when the project closes, but which continues through strengthened community organisations. This model would be more holistic than in AUP programmes up to and including AUP-2012. Transition- ing from household to a form of integrated rural settlement development which would combine housing assistance with major components of livelihoods and micro-enterprise development would provide for a more balanced approach. The People\u2019s Process: a Community Driven Approach One can see this approach in the model of the \u201cPeople\u2019s Process\u201d which has been sup- ported successfully by UN-Habitat in many resettlement and reconstruction programmes in South and South-East Asia (Lankatilleke, 2009 and no date, UN-Habitat 2010e). It starts from the premise that while families need a house, they also live in communities and have a responsibility to each other. While households need houses communities need services such as water, sanitation, roads, power, civic facilities, child-care and el- derly-care support. Satisfying community needs requires collective, not individual, effort. This extension from the individual to the community is what is articulated as the People\u2019s Process of housing and settlement development. The figure below presents graphically how this approach would address indebtedness and contribute to sustainability. By strengthening CBOs and providing livelihoods-related training, internal organisational capacity and funds should be generated to both reduce indebtedness and make community asset formation feasible. CBOs would be strength- ened not only through leadership training but also through a concerted effort to develop community contracting. These would involve both contracts with local government to undertake construction and maintenance work but also in the non-construction indus- tries such as tailoring, metalwork or farm based enterprises. These trades would be de- veloped through a livelihoods programme. ",
        "CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS 73 Community Driven Approach CBO Strengthening High sustainability Livelihoods & Training Lower indebtedness, more disposable income Community assets produced Community ownership Community planning & implementation Figure 18: The Relationships between the Community Driven Approach, Indebtedness and Sustainability Because it is concerned with the whole village the community driven approach to ben- eficiaries is that all families need to benefit and not only some. This implies examining approaches to construction which are lower-cost (so that the available funds stretch fur- ther than they do at present and can reach even the extremely poor) and this leads to the consideration of incremental housing and lower-cost alternative materials. Both of these will require the inclusion of robust awareness programmes. It is unfortunate that the approach adopted so far, which has delivered relatively large complete houses through grants, is likely to have created resistance to the introduction of incremental housing and the use of lower-cost building materials. More Questions This raises the question of whether a grant or whole grant approach is desirable. The full grant approach is likely to create dependence rather than self-driven development ( 1 ). Alternative funding mechanisms should be sought which emphasise a partnership rather than donor-recipient relationship for households that can afford to put some savings aside. These could include part grant-part own savings arrangements (e.g. 80% - 20%). And it would also encourage home owners to look more favourably on lower cost solu- tions. The own saving contribution would be in addition to the present provision of home owner labour. The incremental approach to housing coupled with part-granting would reduce the amount of \u2018up-front\u2019 grant cash required by the programme for housing. This could be invested instead in livelihoods activities. ( 1 ) In an interview with Habitat for Humanity in Batticaloa we were told that the experience of grants, in the form of housing, as part of the post-tsunami reconstruction process, led to such dependency that many beneficiaries even stopped working as they came to expect that all their needs would be met by an external agent. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 74 In an interview with CEPA the team was asked whether housing was even the priority of beneficiary communities ( 1 ). The only way to be sure is to ask them, of course. We believe, however, from the responses received during our focus group discussions, that priorities are multiple and that as houses become less of a priority, others become more important. The community driven approach is well equipped to identify and address the range of community needs and priorities. A final thought, on the question of how broadly one should aim to spread the benefits of a housing programme, is this. One can consider spending almost another \u20ac160 million on solving the whole problem of remaining war-destroyed or damaged houses in the North and East based on the current approach. This would solve the problem for today, which would of course be laudable. However, it does little for future generations and the needs of newly formed households. As the children of present beneficiaries grow up and start their own families they will require housing. The AUP programmes can leave an important legacy if they establish a housing finance mechanism which is accessible to young households. For them houses will need to be affordable and they will not have the benefit of the grants their parents have had. This will probably mean they have to look for the kind of incremental housing promoted in this report, including the use of alternative building materials. It is recommended that in a future AUP programme part of the funding be set aside to establish such a financing mechanism. What are the prospects? The above recommendations were directed partly at AUP-2012 as it prepared to enter its last nine months but, because this is a short period in which to incorporate a wide range of recommendations, they were mainly aimed at future AUP programmes. Since the mid- term evaluation report was written a new programme, AUP-2014, has been established which started its activities in December 2015, although it had not yet begun field imple- mentation when the present evaluation and baseline study took place in March and April 2016. What does its project design tell us about the way in which it differs from previous programmes and the extent to which it incorporates the recommendations of the mid- term evaluation (largely restated in the present report)? Here we will briefly mention what we believe are the most significant design features ( 2 ). The beneficiary selection process has been identified as a source of dissatisfaction in this report largely because worthy applicants, as perceived by communities, have been declined a grant. AUP-2014 takes up this challenge and will introduce community par- ticipation in the selection process. It will also reconsider applicants above and below a preliminary cut-off level rather than automatically exclude those who fall below it. Both these correspond to recommendations made in the MTE of AUP-2012. ( 1 ) In a focus group discussion in Mulliwaikkal East (Mullaitivu District) on 5 th April 2016 participants were asked whether housing was a priority for them. There followed a heated discussion amongst participants, some of whom were arguing that if support were given to their current livelihoods problems they would earn more money than they would receive from the programme for housing. The village was a candidate for the AUP-2014 programme. ( 2 ) Fuller details can be found in HfH (2015). ",
        "CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS 75 A range of house designs (four) will be offered with differing levels of grant. The designs cover ten house types. In seven of these cases grants will be supplemented by loans of between 2.7% and 22% of the total house cost. This aims to reduce dependency while offering most grant support to the neediest. Loans will be available through a non-ex- ploitative micro-finance institution in an attempt to prevent indebtedness. Livelihoods support including skills training and micro-enterprise development (e.g. in the production of alternative building materials) also aim to ward off indebtedness as well as increase living standards. Many grants will be smaller and therefore five of the house types are for smaller houses. This is in an attempt to provide houses which match need rather than have one size for all, optimise the use of grants and provide a wider spread of benefits. The same intention lies behind having three of the four house designs incorporate alternative building mate- rials including sun-dried brick and compressed stabilised earth block. This will be a major challenge to implement as resistance will be high. As with previous AUPs, training will be provided to CBOs in order to strengthen local ca- pacity for sustainability which will also benefit from increased incomes of home owners. All the terms underlined were key focus areas of the mid-term evaluation of AUP-2012 which have been restated in the present report. The fact that AUP-2014 is addressing them, including using the recommendations made by the evaluation team, we think bodes well for the future. However, major changes bring with them major challenges which AUP-2014 will certainly encounter. The evaluation team believes AUP-2014 is set on the right track and expects it to add to the wealth of experience and good practices which have been built up so far by AUP-2012 and preceding AUP programmes.

BACKGROUND Until 2009, two decades of conflict left nearly 365,000 houses fully or partially damaged in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka. This further aggravated the conse- quences over populations previously affected by the Tsunami in December 2004 which also provoked massive destruction throughout most of Sri Lanka\u2019s coastline, notably in the East and North-East. After the declared end of the conflict in May 2009 the international community rein- forced efforts in assisting Sri Lanka reconstruct social infrastructure and livelihoods main- ly in conflict-affected areas. These have involved a new wave of permanent housing reconstruction led mainly by donors such as the EU, Australian Aid, Swiss Development Cooperation and more recently the High Commission of India. Housing reconstruction has been building up on experiences from the post-tsunami such as the \u201cHome Own- er-Driven\u201d approach earlier consolidated by UN-Habitat in Sri Lanka. Since 2005, EU support to housing reconstruction in Sri Lanka has already resulted in 16,000 houses benefiting over 64,000 people. Four programmes have involved the fol- lowing Implementing Partners in chronological order: the World Bank (2005-2008), ASB (2008-2013) and UN-Habitat (2010-2014 and 2013-2015). By 2015, the EU expects to have contributed to funding the reconstruction of 20,000 houses (approximately 10,000 in the North and 10,000 in the East). Other donor activities So far, the EU remains the donor having assisted reconstruct most houses in Sri Lan- ka, although the Government of India is currently financing the reconstruction of up to 50,000 houses ( 1 ) and hence will shortly take over. This is the largest ever development cooperation programme run by India and marks its emergence as an international donor. The most important allocation of the Indian-funded programme is being implemented by UN-Habitat also, which simplifies donor-coordination at the field level. Other Indi- an-funded implementing partners are the International Federation of the Red Cross in partnership with Sri Lanka Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity and the National Housing Development Agency of Sri Lanka.

        "ANNEx 1 \u2013 TERMS OF REFERENCE 79 From post-emergency to development In January 2010 the \u2018International Monetary Fund\u2019 (IMF) upgraded Sri Lanka to \u2018Middle Income Emerging Markets\u2019. And recently, the Government of Sri Lanka, has declared that the \u201chumanitarian phase is over\u201d. Accordingly, a number of humanitarian donors (e.g.: ECHO) and many INGOs have withdrawn and \u2018Official Development Assistance\u2019 (ODA) has been shifting focus from post-emergency (e.g. transitional shelter and WATSAN) to development (e.g. permanent housing and flanking measures). Development agencies such as DfID have recently withdrawn their permanent offices from Colombo. However, according to the \u2018Sri Lanka Human Development Report 2012\u2019: \u201cDevelopment oppor- tunities are skewed towards a few urban centres, resulting in migration to cities and poor living standards in several rural provinces. Prevailing inequalities and disparities have adversely impacted the growth potential as well as the equitable human development of all people living in the country\u201d. Growth and infrastructure development in the richer Western Province where almost half of the national GDP is accounted for, contrasts with progress in the North and the East. Whilst Government has committed to undertake large social permanent housing pro- grammes nationwide, low-cost housing reconstruction in the North and East remains mainly dependant on ODA and diaspora remittances. Despite international efforts, ODA will not cover the gap in housing needs on a \u201chouse-for-a-house\u201d basis estimated for 2015 to remain between 60,000 and 100,000 in the North only. UN-Habitat guesses that another 20,000 houses are needed in the Eastern District of Batticaloa. Community-build- ing, livelihood development and access to basic social infrastructure for the poorest in rural areas remain a crucial developmental challenge requiring local sustainable solutions. Current situation in the reconstruction sector Large-scale infrastructure (e.g. national roads and energy supply network) are quickly spreading in the South West and steadily reaching the North and East. Housing recon- struction for IDPs has also been determined as top priority for Government but ad- vances are yet to materialise. The wide-spread location of returnee villages throughout rural areas does not make it easier. Returnee immigration, such as many among the 50,000 Sri Lankan refugees in India, puts pressure on land resources. There are concerns over instances of interventionism in land dispute resolutions and the number of landless remains a serious challenge to be addressed. Whilst beneficiary selection has been man- aged with scoring systems accounting for vulnerability, the rise of political interventions and favouritism in allocations to particular communities needs to be carefully monitored. The recent elections of 21 September Northern, Central and North-West provinces have resulted in a representational victory of Tamil communities winning 30 out of 36 seats in the North. The practical implications of this are yet to be seen. Whilst ODA can claim humanitarian successes on many fronts in conflict-affected Sri Lan- ka, the combination of economic devastation caused by armed conflict with an accrued form of donor-dependency have not helped towards the creation of a local and reliable construction market nor of the industrial or entrepreneurial fabric necessary to supply low- ",

Implementing Partners involved in reconstruction have even struggled attract labour to the construction sector. In addition, construction resourc- es (labour and materials) inflation has led to prohibitive costs for individuals left without assistance. The average size of construction contractors remains small and their reliability low as compared to a more competitive and functional market in the South and West. The EU-funded \u2018Aid to Uprooted People\u2019 housing programmes in Sri Lanka The post-tsunami emergency context of 2005 led the European Commission to under- take major commitments to support social-infrastructure and livelihood projects. Housing reconstruction, in particular, has been financed under the EU\u2019s regional facility called \u2018Aid to Uprooted People\u2019 (AUP). The first two AUP programmes for housing reconstruction in Sri Lanka contributed with EUR 6,000,000 in 2005 and EUR 10,000,000 in 2006 to the \u2018North East Reconstruc- tion Programme\u2019 (NEHRP) led by the World Bank and Government. By that stage, the \u2018Home Owner Driven\u2019 approach had already been consolidated as the main implemen- tation approach. This programme set out clear standards ( 1 ) for housing construction partly as a reaction to the plethora of spontaneous housing projects that had emerged from international solidarity response to the tsunami. Whilst the respect of these stand- ards are a condition sine qua non for implementation, a critical analysis of the same in view of pointing at ways to upgrading them are necessary particularly in view of accom- modating more flexibly the remaining housing needs.

With a total joint provision of EUR 15,958,000 this programme has already led to the full re- construction of 2,830 houses and of 1,929 repairs (totalling 4,759 families), 3,111 ben- eficiaries assisted in resolving land tenure issues. AusAID/DFAT has placed additional EUR 1.4 million, which remain outside the Contribution Agreement contract, to build an ad- ditional 248 full houses.

Relevance \u2022 Extent to which the objectives of the development intervention are consistent with ben- eficiaries\u2019 requirements, country needs, global priorities and partners\u2019 and EC\u2019s policies. Effectiveness \u2022 Extent to which the development intervention\u2019s objectives were achieved, or are ex- pected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. ( 1 ) See http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/how/evaluation/methodology/index_en.htm ( 2 ) See page 27 of the \u2018Guidelines for project and programme evaluation\u2019 available at http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/ evaluation/methodology/examples/guide3_en.pdf ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 86 Efficiency \u2022 Extent to which the outputs and/or desired effects have been achieved with the lowest possible use of resources/inputs (funds, expertise, time, administrative costs, etc.). Sustainability \u2022 Extent to which the benefits from the development intervention continue after termi- nation of the external intervention, or the probability that they continue in the long-term in a way that is resilient to risks. Impact \u2022 Positive and negative, primary and secondary long-term effects produced by a devel- opment intervention, directly or indirectly, intended or unintended. Coherence \u2022 Extent to which activities undertaken allow the European Commission to achieve its development policy objectives without internal contradiction or without contradiction with other Community policies. Extent to which they complement partner country\u2019s pol- icies and other donors\u2019 interventions. Community value added \u2022 Extent to which the project/programme adds benefits to what would have resulted from Member States\u2019 interventions in the same context. The \u2018impact evaluation\u2019 component is to develop on the \u2018impact\u2019 component of the \u2018performance evaluation\u2019 and is to be addressed through randomised assessments as further specified below: a. Final Evaluation of the AUP-2010 programme (Phase-I) The programme was subject of a Mid-Term Evaluation in 2012 and hence the \u2018per- formance evaluation\u2019 of the Implementing Partners vis-\u00e0-vis the recommendations therein will have to be thoroughly assessed. The Consultants are invited to critically question those recommendations and add theirs as necessary. The Consultant is expected to undertake extensive field data collection in view to un- dertake a meaningful \u2018impact evaluation\u2019 addressing qualitatively and quantitatively the extent to which \u201cpositive and negative, primary and secondary long-term effects produced by a development intervention, directly or indirectly, intended or unintend- ed\u201d. Namely, whether the living conditions and social cohesion of beneficiaries and hosting communities have actually been improved, should be addressed. This will involve both a qualitative enquiry as to \u201cwhat is the good life for the beneficiaries\u201d and contrast it with usual development indicators, as well as a more quantitative survey and analysis of the factual conditions of the household prior and following the programme. ",
        "ANNEx 1 \u2013 TERMS OF REFERENCE 87 For the purpose of the tender, a commitment to survey at least 100 beneficiary households of AUP-2010 is expected. The more households the tender can commit to survey the more convincing it will be for the Contracting Authority when selecting the winning tender. The Consultant might consider subcontracting data collection in view to increase the sample size. In addition, a statistically relevant number of non-beneficiaries should be documented for comparison. Please note, that in the ab- sence of a baseline survey (implementation started in 2010), the Consultant is to find best possible relevant elements of comparison with non-beneficiaries (e.g.: house- holds under equivalent original circumstances) in order to appraise the incidence of the Implementing Partners\u2019 work (e.g. households could be grouped by typolo- gies and then equivalent non-beneficiary households associated to each typological group). Emphasis on gender issues will be considered important. Each household sur- veyed needs to be photographed and geo-referenced. A map and database with the geo-coordinates and illustrations of each household should be annexed to the report. The recommendations that might arise from the findings will be directed towards the replica Phase-II (e.g.: ways of overcoming shortcomings which could compromise the intended results, ways of furthering the environmental or cost-efficiency of construc- tion, testing improvements in community-building processes, needs for better main- streaming gender issues, potential adjustments to eligibility matrix, etc\u2026). b. Evaluation of \u2018Improving Living Conditions in Returnee Areas of Sri Lanka through Housing\u2019 programme (AUP-2012 housing, Phase-II): i. Mid-Term Evaluation (MTE) The first field mission being held in early 2014 many beneficiaries would not have started construction, offering the Consultant the opportunity to collect actual baseline data . A sample of 200 beneficiary houses should be surveyed in view of completing the \u2018 impact evaluation\u2019 for AUP-2012 in the later final evaluation report. As above, this part might benefit from subcontracting some data collection in view of reaching more households. Each household surveyed needs to be pho- tographed and referenced. A database with the geo coordinates and illustrations of each household should be annexed to the report. A second field mission in year 2 should allow the Consultant to observe progress and produce the Mid-Term-Evaluation. This Mid-Term-Evaluation will be the last chance for the Consultant to really influence the Implementing Partners\u2019 work. Hence, recommendations should be prioritised at this stage. ii. Final Evaluation This phase will be more about synthesis and pointing at policy recommendations (including to Sri Lankan authorities) in view of addressing housing reconstruction challenges. It will be built on all data collected, all analytical work and should assess whether recommendations have been followed and, if so, whether they ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 88 have led to improvements. If the EU is at that stage in the process of contracting or implementing an additional housing programme, the recommendations should be aimed to improve that new programme. The AUP-2012 housing programme will, in principle, conclude on 30 June 2015. Again, UN-Habitat and SDC will have six months to submit the final report. Hence, fieldwork should start in the third quarter of that year (might have to be antici- pated should UN-Habitat close down offices) such that the Consultant can share preliminary findings prior to the submission of the Implementing Partners\u2019 Final Report. The last quarters of the evaluation contract should allow for revisions of the Final Evaluation Report on the basis of donors\u2019 comments. 2. Build stakeholders capacity to improve programmes\u2019 impact Under this component it is expected that the Consultant makes sure that evaluation rec- ommendations reach out to the intended targets and that they are duly informed as to how to undertake the corresponding remedial or additional actions. For the purpose of tendering, the Consultant is expected to commit to organising at least three workshop events (one during each mission) in Colombo or elsewhere in a relevant District of Sri Lanka. Each should be estimated with an input of least 4 man-days. The Consultant will cover the running expenses as reimbursable costs. In the tender, a one page proposal of possible capacity building sessions should be presented based on the expertise of the experts. Indicatively these could concern: 1. Manageable social research methods for needs assessment of rural livelihoods; 2. How to measure \u2018impact\u2019 and development indicators in rural context: \u2018impact evalu- ations\u2019 and randomised trials; 3. On mainstreaming beneficiary acceptance of alternative low-cost and environmen- tally-friendly construction methods (e.g.: Stabilised compressed Earth Block construc- tion, filler-slab, rat-trap bond, soil-cement, etc\u2026); 4. Participatory low-cost housing design and designing for better incremental growth; 5. Best practices in \u2018Community Action Planning\u2019 relevant for Village Reconstruction Committees; 6. Promoting entrepreneurship for small construction service providers; 7. Identifying potential improvements in the NEHRP technical guidelines for owner driv- en housing construction; 8. Village Reconstruction Committee management: including better gender mainstream- ing. 9. Etc. Concerning the target stakeholders: a. Beneficiaries The Consultant is not encouraged to directly interfere with beneficiaries beyond data collection, surveys and interviews. However, it is expected that recommendations be complemented with descriptions of plausible actions for the Implementing Partners ",
        "ANNEx 1 \u2013 TERMS OF REFERENCE 89 to induce the recommended change. Accordingly, it is expected from the Consultant to assist Implementing Partners in punctually running or devising focused capacity building approaches or sessions (e.g.: drafting a relevant training strategy or running a particular session on sensitisation about the role of women in Community Recon- struction Committees, or on how to reduce material wastage in construction). b. Local Authorities The Consultant should assess the role of Local Authorities (Division Secretariats) par- ticularly concerning the process of identification of needs, beneficiary selection to the delivery of assistance. If the Consultant concludes that a particular message should be conveyed to a Local Authority, again, it is not expected that they establish a bilateral dialogue with them but it will be positively valued that the Implementing Partners are assisted strategically in getting the relevant message, data, knowledge or skills across. c. Implementing Partners The Consultant should undertake capacity building sessions with key officers of Im- plementing Partners (UN-Habitat and SDC), beyond the mere debriefing of findings and recommendations. As indicated above these could include workshops or lec- tures on how to further develop the scope of alternative low-cost or environmentally sound construction materials, or case-studies illustrating how to improve social re- search methods, or data collection on needs, etc\u2026 Participation of the Consultant to conferences on the programme organised by the Implementing Partners is required. d. Donors Finally, donors could also be subject to more than debriefing. Beyond evaluation rec- ommendations they could exchange experiences on state of the art methods for improving programme design and undertaking developmental needs assessments. 3. Identification of AUP-2014 housing programme (should such programme be de- cided) Subject to the pending Implementing Decision of the European Commission on the programming cycle for 2014-2020 concerning the Asia Regional DCI Programme, the Consultant might be requested to assist the EU-Delegation in drafting the Identification Documents for an additional \u2018Aid to Uprooted People\u2019 housing programme for Sri Lan- ka (AUP-2014 or AUP-2015). A priori (subject to recommendation) the intention would be to keeping up the inertia of \u201cHome Owner Driven\u201d reconstruction whilst ensuring a smooth transition from donor dependency in housing reconstruction to local self-reliance by promoting the sustainability of local service providers. The Consultant should tentatively allocate 12 man-days for this purpose . Should this component not be required, then the man-days will be reallocated to the other expected services. ",

These are to be understood as house types to be further suited to local norms, regulations, and cultural sensitivities. For the time being they can be considered as al- ternatives which can be incorporated within the existing programme as a cost-effective solution for those few households belonging to the most vulnerable categories, such as widows/widowers living alone or with 1-2 children, childless parents and parentless children who have not obtained sufficient scoring to be eligible for housing support. There are possibilities to expand all house types in the future, as the proposed gable roof allows this. The principle of an expandable house, which underlies these type plans, can be extended beyond vulnerable groups as a possible general model in any future housing programme. Figure 1: Three proposed new Expandable Type-plans \u2013 comparative table (Source: architect Mario Martelli, on behalf of the Evaluation team) Type 1 The 264 sq. ft. type-plan consists of only one bedroom (shrine), a living room, kitchen with chimney and an attached but external toilet. ( 1 ) All room surface areas are close to, adjustable, or greater than the minimum area of rooms in residential buildings \u2013 Guidelines for Housing Development in Coastal Sri Lanka \u2013 NHDA, 2005 ",

According to existing updated BOQs and grants amount, both 264 sq. ft. ( 1 ) and 276 sq. ft. ( 2 ) type plans would cost some 350,000 LKR (meaning some 200,000 LKR less than the currently agreed grant), whereas the 361 sq. ft. ( 3 ) type plan would raise the cost to 450,000 LKR. Further cost reductions are also possible through full family member contribution of labour, use of local resources (trees, sand), or by bulk purchasing and recycling materials. Type plan 276 sq. ft. has a potential expansion up to 451 sq. ft. (one more room and a veranda, to be potentially walled off in the future) as shown below.

        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 210 1 Introduction In the terms of reference for the present evaluation it was intended that a baseline survey be carried out for AUP-2012 during the first mission. As it was, by the time the mission took place, in September 2014, AUP-2012 was already well underway and it was agreed with the EU Delegation that a mid-term evaluation be carried out instead. The baseline study would be carried out for the next AUP programme, if there was one. Such a pro- gramme was approved in 2015 which is known as AUP-2014. This is the programme which is the subject of the present baseline study. It is called a baseline study rather than survey because it consists of more than a house- hold survey and includes documentary analysis, the results of focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, case studies and observations, as is explained in Chapter 2 below (\u201cMethods\u201d). Grants and the changing context of AUP-2014 The AUP-2010 and AUP-2012 offered beneficiary households grants, each worth Rs.500,000 to 550,000 to construct 550 sq. ft. houses. Recently, the GOSL decided to implement a programme of 65,000 prefabricated steel houses of the same size costing Rs.2.1 million each. The 10,000 owner-driven housing programme being implemented by local governments has also set a grant level of Rs.800,000 for a 550 sq. ft. house 1 . The Indian Housing Project has similarly raised its grant from Rs.550,000 to Rs.950,000. The present evaluation argues that a figure of around Rs.700,000 is sufficient to complete a standard house assuming that beneficiaries will always add more, regardless of whether they are obliged to or not 2 . But, in any case, the AUP-2014 grant amount should be re-assessed and fixed at a more realistic level than it now is. It should also consider whether equity is better served by raising the grant from the current Rs.550,000 level: if the other programmes are providing a significantly higher grant it would be unfair for AUP grantees to receive the far smaller amount. The implications of this, in terms of numbers of beneficiaries, should be calculated. If grants are Rs.150,000 -250,000 higher the budget will require that there be 25%-45% fewer of them. 1 This is expected to reduce debt levels because, it is believed, grantees will not need to resort to loans. However, it is still possible that they will continue to borrow in order to further improve their houses. 2 Costs can also be held down below Rs.800,000 because of a number of improvements in procurement which have been made during the successive AUPs such as with bulk purchase and the greater availability of experienced/skilled masons.

        "INTRODUCTION 211 Figure 1: Rearing goats as a livelihood, Kithul village, Batticaloa district (Observation no. 12 \u2013 AUP2014) Scope of the baseline study AUP-2014 is being implemented by Habitat for Humanity (HFH) and World Vision Lanka (WVL). At the time of the mission in March\u2013April 2016 they were preparing their own baseline survey which they would use to help them monitor performance regularly and to evaluate it. The question then arises why the evaluation team should carry out a seem- ingly duplicate survey. First, the team\u2019s study was not only a survey but employed additional methodological tools which could provide data to enrich that of the survey. The survey data itself can be used by the IPs to complement their own findings. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 212 Figure 2: Focus group discussion in Karadiyanaaru village, Batticaloa as part of baseline study (24 th March 2016) Secondly, the baseline study carried out by the evaluation team was intended to con- tribute to the IPs\u2019 own baseline survey design. During the mission meetings were held between the team and responsible IP monitoring and evaluation staff to discuss their survey design and methodology. The baseline survey used by the evaluation team was given to the IPs before they started their own survey so that they could incorporate whatever contents they considered of value. The evaluation team\u2019s survey questionnaire appears in Annex 1. The monitoring and evaluation system Although it was not part of its terms of reference the team considered it important to discuss with the implementing partners how they would monitor the AUP 1 . This is be- cause the mid-term and final evaluations will benefit from good monitoring data. While the IPs are aware that this exercise was not part of the ToR they were keen to receive independent suggestions from the team. Details of the team\u2019s recommendations are given in Chapter Three. 1 In their proposal to the EU the IPs stated that they intended to carry out their own mid-term and final evaluations in addition to the independent external evaluations which the Delegation of the European Union will require. ",
        "METHODS USED FOR THE BASELINE STUDY 213 2 Methods used for the baseline study The baseline study employed four main tools: a household survey, focus group discus- sions, semi-structured interviews, case studies and observations. 2.1 Documentary analysis Before the baseline study was undertaken key project documents were read, in par- ticular the Grant Application (the concept note and project proposal). This allowed the evaluation team to inform itself of the programme scope (number of beneficiaries, geo- graphical location, etc.), the intended results (e.g. income opportunities, financial skills and the strengthening of organisational capacity as well as housing) and implementation methodology and procedures for monitoring and evaluation. 2.2 Semi-structured interviews Six interviews were carried out with HfH and WVL staff between 16 th March and 8 th April. Their purpose was obtaining information on the programme\u2019s design and implementa- tion methodology especially insofar as these had been developed since the proposal sub- mitted to the EUD. One example of this is the methodology to be employed for carrying out the baseline survey and project monitoring. 2.3 Household Survey A local survey team was sub-contracted to carry out a household survey. It carried out a total of 259 household interviews . These comprised 99 in Mullaitivu, 97 in Kilinochchi, and 63 in Batticaloa. The purpose of the survey was to collect information on the condition of houses before the start of AUP-2014, potential beneficiaries\u2019 perception of a \u2018good house\u2019, feelings of security, priority house improvements and livelihoods. At the time the baseline was carried out the beneficiary lists had not yet been drawn up by the IPs. It was, therefore, impossible to carry out a random survey of beneficiar- ies as was done for the final evaluation of AUP-2012. The same applies, of course, for non-beneficiaries. Instead, quota sampling was carried out in the GN divisions where it was known that the AUP-2014 would be implemented. The Sampling Frame The evaluation team had been requested by the EUD to carry out 250 surveys for the baseline study. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 214 The sample was selected by calculating the percentage of all intended beneficiaries in each district and surveying households in each district in proportion to this distribution. Households were subject to quota sampling. It was decided that the total number of villages which could be surveyed in the time available was twelve. The proportion of villages to be covered in each district was calculated in the same way.

The results of the household survey are presented at several points in the following chapters and headings. A pilot study of 50 households was carried out to test the questionnaire\u2019s usability which are apart from the sample for the full survey which appears in the table. The pilot study resulted in the removal of a question on caste membership which was too awkward to ask and could possibly jeopardise the rapport between respondent and surveyor. 2.4 Focus Group Discussions Focus group discussions were held with community members in groups which, accord- ing to usual practice, would ideally have numbered 10-12 persons. In reality, the number and composition of discussants was usually much larger than this. The experience of the evaluation mission in September 2014 was that it was all but impossible to control the number of participants. Anyone who had heard about it could present themselves, as well as those specifically invited, and it would be difficult to turn them away. Further- more, the discussions were being held at the start of a housing programme in which ",
        "METHODS USED FOR THE BASELINE STUDY 215 every villager wanted to participate. The major benefits which earlier programmes had delivered were well-known. The focus group meetings were probably seen as an oppor- tunity to learn more. It is unsurprising then that meetings were over-subscribed. Figure 3: focus group discussion in Suthanthirapuram, Mullaitivu on 5 th April 2016 It was decided that it would be possible to carry out five focus group discussions for the baseline study in the time available. The number per district was determined in the same way as the household survey: in proportion to the number of beneficiaries there would be in each: two in Kilinochchi, two in Mullaitivu and one in Batticaloa. In the event, two were held in in Mullaitivu, two in Batticaloa and one in Kilinochchi. Attendances ranged from twenty to ninety with an average of approximately fifty 1 . The purpose of the focus groups was to identify the type of existing community based organisations in potential beneficiary villages, existing social infrastructure and villagers\u2019 priorities for additional infrastructure, attitudes to alternative building materials and vil- lagers\u2019 livelihoods. Those attending included representatives of community based organisations and other key actors in each of the villages as well as ordinary village members. These included rep- resentatives of such organisations as Rural Development Societies, Women\u2019s Rural De- velopment Societies, elderly citizens groups, and fishermen\u2019s and farmers\u2019 associations. 1 Exact figures were impossible to obtain in the larger gatherings where people would come in and out throughout the meeting. In the open-air meetings it was also sometimes difficult to know who was attending and who just happened to be in the vicinity! ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 216 Figure 4: Focus group discussion in Mullaivakai East village, Mullaitivu District (05 th April 2016) The discussions were open-ended but guided by the evaluator using a list of question topics. This list appears as Annex 1 to this report. 2.5 Case studies It was decided that at least five case studies would be carried out for the baseline study in the time available. The number of case studies per district was determined in the same way as the household survey: in proportion to the number of beneficiaries there would be in each. It was, in fact, possible to carry out 7 case studies . These were distributed across dis- tricts as follows: Batticaloa (3), Kilinochchi (2) and Mullaitivu (2). There were none done in Mannar as the AUP-2014 did not include this district. The purpose of the case studies was to gain an in-depth understanding of villagers\u2019 opinions about housing and their preferences by learning about their life histories and current situations. While those interviewed were yet to be selected for a housing pro- gramme (the selection of beneficiaries for AUP-2014 had not commenced at the time of the evaluation and the interviewees were seen only as potential beneficiaries) it was also an opportunity to find out why these households had not been included in any of the previous programmes, how they felt about missing out and how they had coped with the situation till now. The way in which the information was gathered was through open-ended discussion. ",
        "METHODS USED FOR THE BASELINE STUDY 217 Figure 5: Kulal village in Karadiyanaru, Batticaloa (Case Study 4). While waiting for the formal housing programmes to reach them, households had mobilised scrap material brought along with them from the refugee camps to build temporary houses for themselves.

",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 218 2.6 Observations It was decided that it would be possible to carry out ten observations for the baseline study in the time available. The number of case studies per district was determined in the same way as the household survey: in proportion to the number of beneficiaries there would be in each. In fact, it proved possible to carry out twenty-three observations. Observations were intended to show the conditions of houses (actually, all of the po- tential applicants visited, are currently living in shacks ) before the start of AUP-2014 which have not been subject to any previous AUP. They show how the houses have been constructed, the materials used and the labour involved. They also reveal occupants\u2019 preferences with regard to building materials and house design which it is hoped that the AUP-2014 Implementing Partners will find useful to take up. The houses chosen for observation were randomly selected and as many were covered as possible in the time available which exceeded the intended number. A format was devised in which the technical findings have been recorded for each case which allows easy comparison between them. Results have been analysed and some significant pictures included in each case to illustrate the findings. The observations are presented in Annex 8 of this part of the report.

        "MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E) SYSTEM 219 3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System The team discussed Habitat for Humanity International\u2019s and World Vision Sri Lanka\u2019s proposed monitoring system with staff responsible in each organisation. 3.1 The M&E framework The team found that the structure for collecting monitoring data is generally well thought out. HfH will focus on housing aspects while WVL will concentrate on flanking (livelihood support) measures. It will be important for the two partnering organisations to coordi- nate their two M&E systems effectively within the combined programme framework. For example, HfH has developed a baseline survey which the evaluation team reviewed and commented upon and later found a \u201cBL Tool\u201d which had been developed by World Vision (WVL) which is different and much more extensive. The former has good, detailed questions about livelihoods and face sheet data about respondents but also contains questions about houses which overlap with the HfHI survey. The IPs summarise the monitoring and evaluation framework they will use in their grant application (p. 24). Amongst the various procedures two planned activities are worth singling out. The first is: \u201cHFHSL will facilitate a monthly meeting of the District Steering Committee between representatives of beneficiaries, relevant CBOs (VRC/RDS/WRDS), GN, DS or his/her nominee and any other government agencies\u201d. As the IPs say: \u201cThis will enable speedy resolution to matters related to the project which requires government approval or intervention as well as accountability and feedback\u201d. But it will also bring beneficiaries and their organisations into the decision making process and strengthen their self-confidence, legitimacy and credibility in further development actions outside AUP-2014 and beyond it once it has ended. Another creditable activity is described thus: \u201cHFHSL will also organise periodic community meetings for accountability reporting\u201d (ibid.) It is suggested that this element of the M&E system be closely monitored by manage- ment as it is one which could fall by the wayside under pressures of implementation. The team suggests that learning reviews also be carried out in which lessons learnt can be identified and fed back into the management system. The reviews could include \u201cmost significant change\u201d (MSC) experiences from communities which can be used as inputs into the mid-term and final evaluations. World Vision already has experience with the MSC methodology so is well\u2013placed to implement it in this programme. Given the number of monitoring activities which are envisaged by the Implementing Partners it is suggested that they consider carefully the number of field monitoring staff they will require to implement it. Their framework is a good one but will suffer if staff are too few and actions are hurried. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 220 The two partners intend to carry out mid-term and final evaluations with their own staff. This is very good: it can only facilitate internal learning and promote buy-in to the process and its results. Furthermore, it will be carried out by staff who have knowledge of the available data and are experienced in accessing it. Of course, the EU will contract external evaluators to carry out independent mid-term and final evaluations. The lead final evaluator should certainly be external and possibly the mid-term too. This is in order to provide an independent, external perspective and to ensure credibility of the findings to third parties. However, this is an initiative that is to be encouraged. There are some specific aspects of the proposed M&E system which deserve mention: First, it incorporates more qualitative measures than the preceding AUP. For example, in addition to survey, focus group discussions will be held to elicit community opinions and expectations. They intend to carry out learning reviews amongst staff and commu- nities. The partners are familiar with community based tools such as the most significant change approach. Secondly, the monitoring will be broader than in the previous AUP as it will contain a significant qualitative dimension. As mentioned above this means it will be important to have sufficient field staff. Reliance on university volunteers, rather than paid researchers, may be risky unless the IPs already have sufficient experience to show that this approach works. The evaluation team did not have time to look at this. The IPs, especially WVL, has developed a monitoring tool with which they are familiar. This is the living standards ranking survey (PLSR) which can be used for the baseline survey as well as for monitoring. Another has been developed specifically for this pro- gramme which is the Financial Literacy tool to assess and monitor indebtedness. Finally, it is recommended that the IPs look at the electronic monitoring system employed by UN-Habitat / SDC in AUP-2010 and AUP-2012 which may provide experience on which they can build, especially if it is possible to discuss with personnel responsible for management of the system and managers who used the data it produced 1 . 3.2 The Logical Framework and Performance Tracking Matrix The evaluation team analysed the logical framework with HfH staff responsible for coor- dinating the M&E activities and discussed it, to a lesser extent, with the corresponding coordinator on the side of WVL. The team has only one recommendation in this respect: Regarding indicators, it is suggested they be further developed to better reflect the in- tention to increase social cohesion and other qualitative changes (\u201coutcomes\u201d). This in- cludes developing a measurement tool for social cohesion. 1 It may be difficult to do this as staff from the earlier AUPs will have dissipated and there may some discomfort in their discussing with the new IPs how to continue the work they had intended to do themselves had UN-Habitat\u2019s proposal been successful. However, this does not mean that there should be no attempt made. ",
        "MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E) SYSTEM 221 3.3 The Implementing Partners\u2019 Baseline Survey 3.3.1 Comments on the implementing partners\u2019 survey The evaluation team discussed the HfH baseline survey format with its monitoring and evaluation coordinator and suggested a number of modifications. The Implementing Partner\u2019s survey included questions about the condition of the respondent\u2019s house, land ownership, sanitation, water, sanitation, road access and \u201cother information\u201d. All infor- mation was to be gathered by the enumerator through observation with the household- er verifying his/her assessment at the end of the survey. The evaluation team suggested additional questions which would be put to the householder. One of these was to ask about the cost of the water the householder obtains; another is their opinion about alternative sanitation options including the ex- isting toilet. Additionally, there should be a question about solid waste disposal by the household. It was also suggested to include questions about what features householders thought a \u2018good\u2019 house would have (e.g. sturdiness, security, comfort, perceived status and space). The team thought it important to measure existing levels of social cohesion as part of the baseline survey the IPs would carry out, such as the extent they collaborated with neighbours and participated in community based organisations. 3.3.2 Comments on the evaluation team\u2019s survey: limitations of the data The evaluation team took the HfH survey format, added its own suggestions and tested the modified questionnaire in the field as its own baseline survey, the results of which are reported in various parts of this report. In this section the evaluation will make a few comments on its own baseline format which the IPs may find useful in its own baseline survey design. The first comment of the evaluation team on its own survey is that some questions were not asked correctly by the enumerators. For example, question 2.2.23 looks for explanations to the answer in the previous question (whether they would accept com- pressed earth blocks as a walling material). The answer recorded was \u201cnot relevant\u201d for all respondents whereas what was expected was a range of explanations such as \u201cnot durable\u201d or \u201clow status\u201d. This shows that the enumerator did not understand the question him/herself. A thorough pilot of the survey instrument would have detected this; unfortunately the evaluation\u2019s pilot survey failed to pick this up. The same applies to question 2.2.25. Another comment relates to whether questions should be closed or open-ended. Some of the questions are closed but will only give useful answers if they are open-ended. For example, question 2.2.26 asks respondents whether they consider \u201cstrength\u201d to be a feature of a \u2018good\u2019 house. Similarly the following questions ask the same about comfort, protection from the elements and animals, hygiene and privacy. It is unsurprising that all ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 222 respondents answered that these features were either \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d. These results tell us little. It would have been more useful to ask what respondents con- sidered to be the main features of a \u2018good\u2019 house 1 . 1 There were some other shortcomings in the survey tool and/or the data obtained from it. For example, there is some overlapping of categories (namely for age and educational level in questions 2.2.4 and2.2.6 respectively. ",
        "RESULTS OF THE BASELINE STUDY 223 4 Results of the baseline study Notwithstanding some of the weaknesses of the data identified above, the household survey produced some useful information to complement data produced by the other methods used in the baseline study. The following findings have been assembled from the baseline survey, focus group discussions, case studies and observations. Beneficiary Selection (AUP-2014) Anecdotal evidence that the AUP selection process had been somewhat unfair emerged during the Baseline Study for the AUP-2014 programme. One in particular, a young fam- ily in Mullaitivu (see Case Study 16) who had a four year old child suffering from blood cancer had been denied a house since 2010 despite their applications being strongly endorsed by medical practitioners treating the child. Their anger and frustration were heightened by the fact that another family member and his wife (a two member family) had been supported through the Indian Housing Programme to build their house in an adjoining property. The yet-to-be-beneficiary family is still hopeful that support would be coming their way very soon. Similarly, despite being injured in the war, a family, also from Mullaitivu, has still not received a housing grant (Case Study 17). Figure 8: Anomalies in the Selection Process \u2013 While a sister and her family with two young children, one seriously ill, languish in a make-shift shack (top) the brother and her wife, with no other family members, benefitted from the Indian Housing Programme (bottom) in Suthanthirapuram, Puthukudiruppu, Mullaitivu (Case Study 16). In yet another case, a female-headed household, in which the male head of household had gone missing after the military forces had taken him for interrogation in 2008, was denied a house in the AUP-2010 programme, but was successful in the AUP-2012 programme when the application was made along with documentary evidence of the missing head of household (Case Study 3). ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 224 At the time of this evaluation, it appeared that there has been a genuine attempt by the newly selected Implementing Partners (Habitat for Humanity/World Vision) to take on board the recommendations made in the MTE with respect to selection criteria being revised to reflect a higher degree of fairness. In particular, the MTE was critical of the se- lection criteria used in AUP-2012 (which had been adopted from the Indian Housing Pro- gramme) where households with unmarried female members above 18 could not count these members towards the criterion determining the size of the household and thereby being discriminated against. The recommendation was for these members to be counted towards determining the household size. However, the new selection criteria to be used in AUP-2014 has positively discriminated with respect to unmarried females over 18 in the household by including a special criterion giving additional points for those families with unmarried females over 18 and also counting them towards the size of the household. 4.1 Community Based Organisations\u2014CBOs There are plenty of CBOs with which to work. Those present at focus group discussions were RDSs, WRDS, women\u2019s groups, sports clubs, elders\u2019 societies, youth societies, Com- munity Centre Groups, Dairy Farm Cooperative Society, Farmers\u2019 Society, Fishermen\u2019s Society, Disabled Society, Samurdhi Society and Coconut Development Society. The baseline survey shows membership of village organisations is extremely high with membership at 96-100% in the three districts of Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Batticaloa. For example, 26% of respondents were in both the WRDS and Samurdhi Society and another 26% in the Samurdhi Society alone and 12% in the WRDS alone. 21% of re- spondents were members of the RDS in their village. CBOs are a potential partner for the IPs and any development partner. In the focus group discussions CBO members demonstrated great enthusiasm to work in development pro- jects for their villages but lacked financial resources. Nevertheless they have undertaken or contributed to efforts in their villages such as repair of roads, clearing sites for drain- age and road construction and maintenance of public and community buildings. The focus group discussions revealed that CBOs were aware of the relevant government development partners but less of those belonging to the NGO sector. Where the latter had worked in a village it was at the NGO\u2019s initiative. The evaluation team recommends that as part of a CBO capacity building component in their activities the IPs include: \u2022 mapping of potential NGOs and other sources of support and disseminating the re- sults to CBOs \u2022 providing training in proposal writing \u2022 preparing an inventory of community assets and ascertaining priority needs, ensuring that flanking measures are adapted to the needs expressed in each village. ",
        "RESULTS OF THE BASELINE STUDY 225 4.2 Needs Identified at Village Level The types of needs mentioned in our FGDs are the following. However, it should be not- ed that this represents a quick brainstorming exercise which can be improved upon by the IPs carrying out deeper consultations. This list is presented simply to show the wide range of needs identified in the five villages in which FGDs were held. \u2022 Training for pre-school teachers \u2022 Construction of paddy drying platforms \u2022 Toilets and safe drinking water facilities \u2022 Internal road renovation \u2022 Individual wells \u2022 Land ownership \u2022 Evening school classes for primary & secondary pupils \u2022 Dengue awareness \u2022 Renovation of culverts \u2022 Seeds and fertilisers for farmers \u2022 Clinic for pregnant and lactating mothers. \u2022 Skill development centre: language, vocational education and training (VET) \u2022 Small library \u2022 Renovation of tank for irrigation farming. \u2022 Renovate tanks in village to provide water in dry season \u2022 Irrigation \u2022 Houses The baseline survey provides more pointers to key improvements desired by villagers. When asked what physical infrastructure improvements needed to be made 34% of respondents, who were only allowed one answer each, answered \u201cwater supply and internal roads\u201d. Results varied significantly between districts with Batticaloa respondents more concerned about internal and external roads (24%) than those in Kilinochchi (0%) and Mullaitivu (1%). It is possible that there are significant differences between villages in the same district too. As for social infrastructure needs health, education and child care proved the most pri- oritised at 28%, 22% and 22% respectively with all districts listing it as their first priority. Within health, 18% wanted a dispensary and 10% a \u201cmidwife medical centre\u201d. Within education 19% wanted improvements to existing schools; only 3% gave pre-schools as their priority. Within the category of child care 19% of the 22% was accounted for by those who prioritised a day care centre or nursery. Other significant responses were for a playground (10%) and repairs to water reservoirs (ponds), also at 10%. 4.3 House Design 29% of all respondents in the baseline survey considered their house \u201cpermanent\u201d rather than \u201ctemporary\u201d. This will presumably be taken into account in the beneficiary selection process. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 226 The most important improvement wanted from proposed housing programme was more space (36%), more security / safety (26%) and more privacy (18%). Interestingly, 10% gave \u201cbetter relationship between family members\u201d as the most important improvement wanted and one in twenty (5%) a \u201cbetter relationship with neighbours\u201d. This may reflect how temporary housing strains the social fabric of communities. Regarding sanitation facilities 57% of respondents stated that they had a toilet, all wa- ter-sealed pit latrines. However, approximately 60% of them needed repair. Unsurprisingly, no respondent had piped water in their houses. Although 22% had their own wells, over 60% depended on water from a well which was over 30 feet from the house. (That\u2019s not far!) Rather more surprisingly, 48% of households had electricity connections. 60% of respondents felt \u201cunsafe\u201d or \u201cvery unsafe\u201d in their current houses. 38% felt \u201cfairly safe\u201d and 2% \u201cvery safe\u201d. Toilets have been one very significant improvement in the housing programme AUP- 2012. The Mid-Term Evaluation noted: In Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu districts (full and repair houses) detached toilets have often been built many metres away from the house (a paradox, taking into consideration the danger of snakes and overall insecurity, especially during the night). This choice is due to the perception, rooted in the traditional thinking mainly among rural Sri Lankans, particularly of the Tamils and especially in the northern districts, that a toilet in any form is \u201cdirty\u201d and hence needs to be de- tached and located at a distance from the main house ( 1 ) (only the urban elites are comfortable with internal toilets). However, during the observations many potential applicants of the future AUP-2014 said that detached toilets would be preferable for hygienic reasons - due to a scarcity of water. On the other hand, several potential AUP-2014 applicants were confused: regarding the toilet set-up in the envisaged new house, some said they would prefer an \u201cinternal toilet\u201d (for security reasons, especially during the night), some preferred it \u201cattached with ex- ternal access\u201d (such as the AUP-2012 type design), for reasons of proximity but avoiding problems of hygienic and some also preferred \u201cexternal and detached\u201d for the reason given in the Mid-Term Evaluation. Three other interesting options were observed, as built within AUP-2012, and should be considered as lessons learnt within AUP-2014 (the first two positive, the third definitely negative). 1 A new house with an attached toilet should be introduced to new applicants through thorough capacity building sessions; people are now used to that and the presence of a Public Health Inspector would help in winning over people\u2019s potential resistance ",

In Vivehantha Nagar village (Observation no. 17 - Kilinochchi district) and in Iranaipil- lai village (Observation no. 28 - Mullaitivu district) two houses were found with inter- nal toilets with a corridor. These two observations were very negative: both houses are far from completion (in spite of official documents to the contrary) and the toilets stink inside the house and are almost never used. In addition to this, both corridor and toilet add, unnecessarily, many costs and construction items (such as walls, foun- dations, plastering, slabs and frameworks). Figure 12 (above): Observation no. 17 (Vivehantha Nagar village, Kilinochchi District) Internal toilets in AUP-2012 implemented but houses not yet completed. Note the unnecessary sizes. ",
        "RESULTS OF THE BASELINE STUDY 229 As a result of the above observations the evaluation team strongly recommends that an awareness campaign be carried out for future AUP-2014 beneficiaries regarding attached toilets with external access, since this is the most suitable and reasonable arrangement in terms of hygiene, security, proximity and construction item optimisation (digging trench- es, foundations, walls, etc.) 1 . In this regard, AUP-2014 houses with an attached toilet will no longer be exceptions and so it will be very easy for the Implementing Partners to physically show the beneficiaries the pros and cons of the different options. In order to suggest a potential incremental element to the AUP-2014 housing scheme (especially in case of an increased grant), we step back to the abovementioned \u201cwash- room\u201d in addition to the standardly required toilet. It can be with or without roof, more or less refined (with simple tin-sheets or with concrete slab: in the latter case also could be partially used as a storage, with shelving; simply floored or tiled, plastered or simply polished; with shower and/or washbasin; etc.); the costs actually would significantly vary because of the above choices, but in any case it would not cost more than the required toilet. Figure 13: Potential expansion to increase sanitary facilities: a washroom (to be alternatively used as: shower; laundry; \u2026) is placed before the toilet Habitat for Humanity has drawn up an alternative house design which uses sun-dried clay bricks. This appears in Annex 7. 1 The mid-term evaluation report (page 68) states that: \u201cEven in Batticaloa district, where the Evaluation Team found practical and recommendable attached toilets, they were external. According to the existing BOQs, stretching the toilet out of the squared (or rectangular) shell significantly raises the cost: more external walls obviously mean more foundations and more elevated structures, a larger roof, more plastering, more 6\u201d walls, more time, and so on. On the other hand, it seems that \u2013 in spite of cultural traditions \u2013 people are now ready to accept a (conceptually speaking) \u201cnew\u201d house with toilet, detached or attached (and beneficiaries definitely love it and recognize the great benefits for all family members)\u201d. ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 230 A final point about house design is that it is recommended that physical models of adequate scales should be available during the initial session , when qualified ap- plicants are expected to choose their own future house; despite models being available (the roof is movable, so that there is a perfectly clear view of the house interior), many beneficiaries stated that they made their choice on the basis of banners and 3D images. Figure 14: Example of a model house 4.4 Sanitation Surprisingly, during our way to Mannar (March 31 st , 2016) we noted well-shaped, im- pressive and huge clay-reservoirs (estimated capacity > 1,000 litres), nearby many hous- es, surely not brand new tools to harvest rain water (we never saw something similar across the thousands of kilometres driven during many visits to Sri-Lankan northern and eastern provinces). The above changes the entire approach to this important element of sanitation in the housing scheme, as 1) it displays a traditional use in many places within the AUP-2014 targeted districts, 2) is a physical sample, useful to be touched, commented by users, replicable and whose manufacturing is well known in those areas, 3) could be included in the proposed \u201cpartially assisted ODA\u201d approach to AUP-2014, as those reservoirs might be purchased in large quantity and delivered to households once the house works are coming to an end, 4) this creates an innovative new market in the area, aiming to save ",
        "RESULTS OF THE BASELINE STUDY 231 a traditional and peculiar skill, 5) as a traditional tool, it surely does not mismatch with Vashtu prescriptions, etc. Designing an improved traditional version of the clay-reservoir is a well-worth exercise, aiming to stimulate designers within AUP-2014 and Local Authorities to promote system- atic awareness campaigns across the targeted villages to convince future beneficiaries to seriously keep into due consideration this interesting addition to their new house. According to the typical meteorological local conditions, an estimate about the water factually harvestable makes no sense, as the showers are sometime very abundant (a lot of water is harvested in a few minutes) or completely absent; anyhow, there is no doubt that during the rainy season the jar will be recharged daily, whereas during the dry sea- son it will provide benefits for a more limited period of time. The below drawing samples an improved traditional clay-reservoir, having some facilities like: water level pipe, sealed cover, taps and valves, in order to update and improve the technical performances and provide a traditional system with more tools for hygienic whole purposes.

        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 232 4.5 Building standards Not all the recommendations in the AUP-2010 FTE and AUP-2012 MTE have been adopt- ed in the design of the new AUP-2014. One which the team feels strongly should be taken up is the height of the spine wall as well as \u2013 consequently - that of the external walls. The reasoning for this is given in detail in the mid-term evaluation (pages 50-51). It is a technically reasonable and money-saving recommendation 1 . 4.6 Building Materials Focus group discussions revealed a high degree of conservatism regarding accept- able, alternative materials. There was an overwhelming preference for cement blocks for walling because of their perceived durability. Soil blocks were similarly rejected as their durability was questioned. They are seen as a temporary building material when a permanent house is what is wanted. The earth blocks may also be considered to reflect low status and backwardness when the newly returned refugees are looking for social advancement. The baseline survey confirms the a priori rejection of compressed earth blocks with a rejection rate of 100% in all three districts. However, this is probably be- cause of the nature of the survey instrument: it simply asks a question and does not allow discussion. In eight of the observations, on the other hand, beneficiaries were found to be open to the use of compressed stabilized earth block (CSEB) technology as long as they could count on the close support of project engineers, were instructed how to use it and received a full explanation of about its benefits and durability and so on. 4.6.1 Public sand mining There is a debate about the potential environmental impact of AUP-2014 regarding the use of river sand. Opinions about this were expressed during the workshop held in Kilin- ochchi (see next section), the programme\u2019s Steering Committee meeting in Colombo and later in media and academic statements. It is the opinion of the evaluation team that this is not as dramatic an issue as sometimes portrayed 2 considering the total volume of sand expected to be used 3 , which is relatively small when compared with massive building initiatives across the country. It is the evaluators\u2019 opinion that a housing programme such as AUP-2014 cannot serve as an experiment to develop new techniques and materials on a large scale. A reliable 1 With special reference to the return visit to Puthuvely village (Observation nos. 22, 23, 24 - Mannar district) implemented houses, we still observed an unnecessary height of wall, meaning more materials, frameworks, working days, technical troubles and so on. 2 \u201cFormed by erosive processes over thousands of years (John, 2009), they are now being extracted at a rate far greater than their renewal\u201d in \u201cSand, Rarer Than One Thinks\u201d, at http://www.unep.org/pdf/UNEP_GEAS_March_2014.pdf. 3 In order to give readers an idea of the relatively small magnitude of the entire AUP-2014 housing programme impact on, in particular, river sand, we compared the proposed (roughly) 3,500 houses expected to be built under AUP-2014 with the newly proposed, huge, offshore Colombo City Port. AUP-2014 proposes approximately 3,500 houses which will each use 12 cubic metres of sand which comes to a total for the entire programme of roughly 42,000 cubic metres of river sand for some 105,000 cubic metres of cast concrete. Considering a regular design plan (4x4 metre floor area and 4 metre height) and a plot surface of 1 hectare (10,000 square metres), the entire volume of concrete used in AUP-2014 (including sand) would be equivalent to what it takes to build just one 29-storey building. ",
        "RESULTS OF THE BASELINE STUDY 233 and prompt solution is due to war-affected people, some having suffered thirty years of displacements and having lost all their means of livelihood and many family members. There are some burning questions to be discussed at donor and IPs\u2019 level such as: \u2022 Are beneficiaries expected to be limited in using non-renewable materials, by exploit- ing raw materials such as sand or Palmyra\u2019s trees excessively? \u2022 Are they to be obliged to reduce sand mining, from both coastal and riverbed sites? 1 \u2022 Should they be made aware of coastal erosion and refrain from using raw materials because of that? The evaluation team do not think so. Beneficiaries, who spontaneously live in adequate harmony with their environment, should be made aware of environmental risks, but they should be given the right to build their \u201conce in a lifetime house\u201d without being subject to broader, major environmental constrains. A greater environmental burden should be placed on those with greater capacity to bear it, who are not the project beneficiaries. The AUP-2014 house should be a solid and traditional one, built according to agreed national and local technical rules, matching beneficiaries\u2019 needs and beliefs, although sometimes contradicting certain reasonable technical approaches. Figure 17: AUP Steering Committee Meeting, Colombo, 8 th April 2016. 1 See: http://www.unep.org/pdf/UNEP_GEAS_March_2014.pdf ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 234 4.6.2 Alternative Building Materials Throughout the observations, it was noted that no potential AUP-2014 applicants were neither aware of nor interested in the appropriate techniques and materials which the programme is considering to use. They said that they would only be confident with alternative materials if they received a building engineer\u2019s recommendation and then only if the house was sure to last longer than the present generation\u2019s expected lifetime. The latter is important because housing is a non-replicable economic investment and is expected to serve a second family generation either through dowry or maintaining social status. This implies that significant effort will be required to ensure acceptability. The evaluators agree with the EU-Delegation\u2019s stance whereby beneficiaries should not be exposed to experimentation with alternative materials. Hence, the importance that materials and construction techniques be consolidated and well established. Further, the underlying reason for promoting their use in this case should primarily be for local em- powerment (e.g. local income generation) rather than for global environmental reasons (e.g. vulnerable war-victims should not pay a higher cost to reduce CO2 emissions). Rammed earth is foreign to local construction traditions and it will be very difficult to mainstream its use, even for the 30 proposed houses. We consider the target set by HfH of 2/3 of houses being in CSEB overambitious and will need to be reviewed based on specialist feasibility studies on the viability of production, quality assurance in production and construction and in beneficiary acceptance. Acceptance of techniques such as CSEB and filler-slabs can only be tested through genuine efforts by the implementing partner in mainstreaming these alternatives. However, no beneficiary should be forced to adopt a material or technique they do not trust and hence the donor should both be demand- ing of the efforts but also show flexibility in adapting set targets to ensure appropriate materials are not imposed upon people. Advantage should be taken of the few houses already built with CSEB: other households should be invited to view the houses and discuss the construction process and benefits with the occupants. Through discussion converts might be made to the CSEB technology. This percentage target to be attained should be sufficient to ensure potential multiplier effects from the use of local materials (e.g. using CSEB would mean 100% of spending being made locally instead of approximately 80% \u2018leaking\u2019 out of the village when other materials are purchased) while minimising rejection by the community. Much will be determined by the viability of production too. The programme should target a sufficient market for potential micro-entrepreneurs to flourish. This operational structure would create more impact by managing sand procurement in bulk to the whole of AUP-2014 \u2013 not only the appropriate materials component \u2013 including housing and flanking measures activities. Nowadays, the GAs\u2019 offices have a predetermined allowance (very limited, on a monthly basis) to mine and sell riverbed sand, leaving in turn a large amount of land vulnerable to illegal mining throughout the programme\u2019s targeted districts. However, the evaluation team was told by public ",
        "RESULTS OF THE BASELINE STUDY 235 officers that more generous allowances of sand could potentially be permitted under certain circumstances, such as an obviously large housing programme like AUP-2014. Such permission would offer numerous benefits given that 1) GAs\u2019 offices (in Batticaloa, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi districts) would have full supervision of the actual quantities and quality of materials mined in their respective districts, 2) private companies would enjoy transport to the housing scheme\u2019s targeted villages at agreed rates and 3) beneficiaries and IPs would reduce time and money expenditures, assured of the quality and the source. Moreover, sand procurement in this way could be a powerful tool to stabilize raw materials prices, as the whole chain is well known by the public and transparent to all stakeholders. Carrying out procurement in this way would turn AUP-2014 into a partially assisted Owner Driven Approach (ODA). The argument for providing this assistance to what is supposed to be owner-driven is extensively argued in the MTE 1 and the evaluation team restates its earlier arguments here. If a \u201cpartially assisted ODA\u201d approach were adopted it could include reviewing the pro- ject management plan to reduce the time taken in construction 2 and consequently the loss of income for those beneficiaries involved in building on a daily basis. 4.6.3 Workshop with implementing partners The evaluation team held a one-day workshop for implementing partners halfway through their fieldwork which was intended both as a capacity building exercise and an opportunity to verify the team\u2019s findings to date. The list of the participants to the workshop is presented in Annex 3. The workshop was entitled Promoting Beneficiary Acceptance of Alternative Low-Cost and Environmentally-Friendly Construction Methods and Materials3 . The day started with a presentation by the team and a brainstorming session on Beneficiary Resistance and Acceptance in Housing Programmes. This was followed by a series of group exercis- es and presentations on: (i) current attitudes to appropriate low-cost methods and materials in N. and E. Sri Lan- ka, (ii) gaining acceptance of appropriate low-cost methods and materials in AUP-2014 and (iii) building acceptability into AUP-2014. According to the feedback received from the workshop participants at the end of the day, it was well received and considered of value. Figures 18-21 show some moments from the workshop. 1 MTE, 9.10 Recommandations, page 70 2 MTE, 9.2 Construction timing, pages 54-55 3 The PowerPoint presentation is reproduced in Annex 5 below. ",

The key messages of the workshop were: 1. Alternative technologies need to meet social needs (e.g. status, aesthetics) as well as be technically sound; 2. It is important to understand the reasons for resistance to change; 3. There is a range of approaches and techniques which may be employed to overcome resistance (e.g. incentives to use new technologies, demonstration houses); 4. Changing beliefs and attitudes is a long-term strategy but we need to develop short- and medium-term approaches too (within the lifetime of the project). A special guest at the workshop was Ms Arulambikai (affectionately referred to as Thevi Akka). A beneficiary of the AUP-2012 programme completed her house within 70 days and within budget. Project officials were so impressed by her performance that they began to refer other beneficiaries facing difficulties in their own construction to her. She claims that she helped 30 such beneficiaries to complete their houses. In the same way, beneficiaries who have used alternative technologies could help by demonstrating to others what the benefits and costs are. ",
        "RESULTS OF THE BASELINE STUDY 237 4.7 The construction process Regarding construction skills 22% of interviewees in Kilinochchi claimed that they had such skills (two-thirds of these were masons with the rest carpenters or electricians); the corresponding figure was 14% in Mullaitivu (all but one masons) and only 6% in Batticaloa (two masons and one electrician). If the IPs of AUP-2014 decide that these figures are not high enough it should be noted that the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) has funds for hundreds of training courses and is ready to collaborate with the programme. However, it should be noted that the MTE found that very few of the beneficiaries\u2019 family members used the construction skills they acquired during the AUP-2010 and AUP-2012 programmes. Almost all of them returned to traditional employment (mostly farming) and did not start a new career in construction. This may partly be because farming has a higher social status than being an unskilled construction labourer. In any case, it seems as if acquired construction skills do not necessarily translate into new employment. Al- though untested as a hypothesis, it may be that a higher level of training to semi-skilled proficiency will have more impact as status rises and the potential for higher incomes prove attractive. There are exceptional cases of (women) builders who have managed to complete their houses within the grant limits which many beneficiaries have claimed they could not do. It is useful for the AUP-2014 IPs to analyse these cases and whether their experience can be scaled up. One such case was reported in the MTE report 1 . Another was discovered during the baseline study. The case of \u201cDevi\u201d was presented in person to the workshop participants in Kilinochchi and explained to the Steering Committee held in Colombo. This beneficiary acted as a contractor for other households and somehow managed to build within time and budget. How precisely she did this needs research but includes op- timizing procurement, efficient use of labour and maximising beneficiaries\u2019 responsibility. 4.8 Employment The household survey found that farming was the largest employment sector covering 31% of respondents with fishing and livestock rearing accounting for another 10%. The next largest group was unskilled labour at 13% with skilled labour at 11%. 12% of respondents claimed to be self-employed with another 7% owning small businesses. 7% of those interviewed were employed in public service and 8% of household heads were reported as working abroad. 99% of respondents claimed to be in full-time employment (i.e. working more than 50% of the working week) with 36% stating that they were able to save regularly. Batticaloa respondents were the highest in the latter category at 44%. 1 A woman (FHH \u2013 see Observation no. 30; in this current FTE Observation no. 01) saved some 50,000 LKR, by using sand for plastering from her plot and casting all blocks by herself ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 238 4.9 Borrowing and indebtedness The MTE and the Final Evaluation of AUP-2012 showed the serious consequences of pursuing housing construction without some discipline with expenditures. If it were prac- tical to use a household\u2019s propensity to borrow as a criterion in the beneficiary selection process it would perhaps be possible to reduce indebtedness. However, past studies have shown that this would not be possible as almost all beneficiaries in AUP-2010 and AUP-2012 were inclined to borrow at some stage. This being said, families with high levels of debt prior to being selected in the programme need to be closely monitored and guided through difficult situations. In the Baseline Study for AUP-2014 a particular case was found to be heavily indebted, yet was in urgent need of housing assistance (Case Study 14). In the household survey for the final evaluation, when respondents were asked where they would obtain money in times of need or emergency 49% said they would only turn to a family member, friend, neighbour or a Samurdhi Society. Only 13% gave bank, pawn shop or money lender as their sole recourse though 38% included them as possible sources along with family, friends or neighbours. The survey of potential beneficiaries also found that there is a widespread practice of borrowing informally (Annex 2 \u2013 Table 2.2.40), which suggests that in any given difficult circumstance in the construction process there would be a tendency to reach out to local money lenders who would be quick to exploit the situation. As for saving practices, only a third of those surveyed responded positively (Table 2.2.39) Surprisingly, however, the non-participant observations found that 100% of potential applicants to AUP-2014 seemed to dislike the idea of acquiring debts for a new house. They seemed very prudent and conscious of the risk of entering into a vicious circle of borrowing (or pawning) and having to pay unmanageable rates of interest 1 . This contra- diction with the findings of the household survey is worth the IPs investigating further. 4.10 Dependency Almost all those interviewed during the observation process believe that externally fund- ed help for similar housing programmes will continue indefinitely beyond AUP-2014. One response to a question whether the non-selection of some villagers might affect social cohesion negatively was \u201cNo problem at all, since if we or others in the village do not qualify for this programme, we will keep waiting for the next one\u201d. 1 In detail, they appeared shocked about past experiences (got indebted building their shacks after resettlement) and definitely not willing repeat similar experiences; \u201cwe do not care about luxury items, priorities are schooling our children and health\u201d, many said ",
        "CONTINUITY BETWEEN AUP-2012 AND AUP-2014 239 5 Continuity between AUP-2012 and AUP-2014 In an interview the Batticaloa Government Agent Mrs. P.S.M. Charles pointed out the different approaches used by different housing programmes in her district. She referred to the very good implementation by UN-Habitat and other supporting agencies during AUP-2012 and contrasted it with the Indian Housing Project (as largely implemented by other agencies) during its first phase of implementation 1 (though this later improved). The GA advocated a much stronger focus on fully integrated implementation (housing, flanking measures, strong social components and community empowerment) and rec- ommended the IP for the coming AUP-2014 focus on the needier villages (which she estimated at some 35) where vulnerable people are still lacking help after resettlement. 5.1 Recommendations of the AUP-2012 Mid-Term Evaluation Many of the recommendations made by the evaluation team in the AUP-2012 mid-term evaluation are taken up in the design of AUP-2014. Examples of this are in the areas of: Beneficiary selection. However it should be pointed out that, with regard to the pro- posed scoring system for AUP-2014, a sense of complete unfairness was observed in Mullaitivu (Mullivaikai East village) where a group of potential applicants 2 to AUP-2014 explained their mistrust of selection systems. In the past they suffered because the IHP scoring system did not take into account both Divisional Secretary lists and the actually more vulnerable families. In particular, a group of widow-headed potential applicants 3 to AUP-2014 complained about the scoring system they experienced in the past and claimed they had not been scored appropriately, having also been disqualified from pre- vious housing programmes. Opinions found in the observations and the interview held with the Karachchi Divisional Secretary (Kilinochchi district) were in favour of a dedicated scoring system for special cases which would allow the inclusion of the most vulnerable applicants. \u2022 Livelihoods \u2022 Alternative building materials \u2022 Incremental housing \u2022 Creation of affordable sources of borrowing \u2022 Financial literacy training \u2022 Strengthening CBOs 1 She noted in detail \u201ca lack of explanation from Technical Officers and bad quality materials\u201d 2 See Observations nos.: 35, 36, 37 3 See Observations nos.: 12, 38, 39, 40 ",
        "EVALUATION OF THE EU-FUNDED HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN SRI LANKA 240 The MTE of AUP-2012 included a chapter on \u201cThe Spread of Benefits\u201d. It has been es- timated that when AUP-2014 has ended there will be a remaining 135,000 houses in need of repair or rebuilding. On average, if house costs are \u20ac4,000 for the AUP-2014 programme, the elimination of this deficit would require \u20ac540,000,000. This is many times more than what will have been spent in AUP-2010, AUP-2012 and the future AUP-2014. Therefore the evaluation team still believes and strongly recommends that for future programmes to reach their maximum breadth of housing production, costs need to be examined and cheaper options found. The team has already carried out an exer- cise 1 which sought to do this and believe these proposed alternative plans are still valid 2 . It is hoped that IPs within AUP-2014 will evaluate the proposed type plans (or any simi- lar), taking into account local religious beliefs and official regulations and revise the new proposed plans accordingly. Not all recommendations have been taken up and the team considers that they are worth reconsideration on the part Habitat for Humanity International as the implement- ing partner responsible for the housing component of the programme. These are in the areas of building materials and building standards (discussed above in sections 4.4. and 4.5.) However, it should be noted that the evaluation team\u2019s terms of reference did not include assessment of the programme design and so these comments remain only as suggestions. 5.2 Institutional Memory The same point about the scope of the team\u2019s terms of reference applies to its concerns about the possible loss of institutional memory which was accumulated by implementing partners of previous AUPs. This applies in particular to UN-Habitat which had the lead role in AUP-2010 and AUP-2012. The organisation accumulated an enormous amount of capacity and knowledge during these programmes and possessed many experienced and skilled staff. The evaluation team suggest that HfH and WVL look for a way to incor- porate as much of this capability as possible such as through the recruitment of UN-Hab- itat data experts, engineers, Technical and Social Officers who have become available in June 2016 on termination of AUP-2012. Where relevant the EUD could facilitate the transfer of data and network information from UN-Habitat to the new Implementing Partners. 1 See MTE, pages 26-34 2 If qualified, a single, widow household applicant in Kithul village (Batticaloa district) would just claim for a \u201cone room house\u201d (plus internal Kitchen, Toilet and veranda) as her dream-house (see Obs. No. 12). Such a condition, with only one vulnerable family member, should be considered within the proposed special cases dedicated scoring system, as it will increase the impact of the programme and the spread of benefits with relatively little disbursement of grants.
