        "3 A CLIMATE RESILIENT EUROPE 1 Vision In a world of increasing and mutually reinforcing climate disruptions and socio- economic and environmental challenges, the vision of this Mission is to turn the urgent challenge of adapting to climate change into an opportunity to make Europe resilient, climate-prepared and just. By 2030, the Mission will: 1. Prepare Europe to deal with climate disruptions , and assist all citizens, communities and regions in better understanding, preparing for and managing climate risks; 2. Accelerate the transformation to a climate resilient future , supporting 200 European communities and regions in co-creating a vision, innovation pathways, and developing solutions for transformative adaptation within safe planetary boundaries; 3. Build deep resilience by scaling up actionable solutions triggering societal transformations through 100 deep demonstrations of resilience across a number of European communities and regions, with emphasis on cross-border cooperation and cohesion. 2 The Mission explained 2.1 The need for the Mission The global climate crisis is an existential threat i to the world as we know it . Without a radical abatement of greenhouse gasses, global warming will reach and exceed 3-4 \u00baC before the end the century. We cannot continue in this trajectory without facing the risk of unleashing unstoppable planetary forces with huge socio-economic consequences. Climate change has already put additional stress on both natural and human systems and made some weather and climate extremes more frequent and severe (see annex 1 for key references). And because some additional warming is inevitable even after cessation of emissions, mitigation and adaptation are both essential for climate risk management. The COVID-19 pandemic has taught a lesson about how closely environmental, societal and human health are connected. What we have lived through and still will is a mild foretaste of the shocks that climate change may and will cause in the future. But we can break the vicious circle of living on environmental debt and restore planetary health. The pandemic\u2019s emergency has shown unambiguously how important it is to act early upon warnings and in a coordinated way . It has shown us how compound risks affect most those who are already vulnerable, and how existing disparities across Europe are amplified. But we have also learned that rapid change is possible and that solidarity and social cohesion matters. Now, more than ever before, the European Union needs to stand by its citizens and its ",
        "4 common values and maintain its role as a global leader. Principles of solidarity and intergenerational justice, which have permeated public health care choices during the pandemic emergency, need to be given equal weight in investments supporting recovery from the pandemic and beyond in choices regarding environmental restoration, conservation and climate change. This time, we need to protect all, and in particular, our youth. Citizens and stakeholders engaged in the process scoping this Mission strongly emphasised this view (see annex 2). The European Green Deal ii traces a pathway to climate change neutrality and sustainable development , transforming the EU into a low-carbon, resource-efficient and prosperous society economy. The Green Deal is a package of legislative measures, which includes the first EU Climate Law with a legally binding target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, a new circular economy action plan, a new biodiversity strategy, and a strategy for a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system, to mention a few. It commits to a just and inclusive transition, putting people first and focusing on those that will face the greatest challenges. To deliver on these ambitions, the Green Deal will stimulate immense investments in green technologies, social innovation, education and societal transformations. Along the same lines, the Next Generation EU iii plan to recover from the pandemic , driven by solidarity, cohesion and convergence, directs significant resources to build a more sustainable, resilient and fairer Europe. The European Green Deal also includes a new and revised EU Adaptation Strategy iv and recognises that more ambitious and large-scale efforts are needed for climate adaptation, climate proofing, resilience building, prevention and preparedness. The previous 2013 EU Adaptation strategy helped to mainstream adaptation into policies and funding instruments. As a result, the EU Member States have adopted comprehensive adaptation strategies and plans and the EU made sizeable investments in making cutting-edge climate risk information accessible, usable and useful. The new EU Adaptation Strategy will build and expand on these efforts to help all levels of government and stakeholders to (i) further improve knowledge of climate impacts, (ii) reinforce planning and climate risk management, and (iii) accelerate action with a focus on solutions, innovation, implementation, and prevention. The here proposed Mission will get Europe prepared to unavoidable climate impacts and to accelerate the transformation to a climate- resilient and just Europe . It will be fundamental for the success of the new climate change adaptation strategy, testing and up-scaling innovative solutions, creating enabling conditions for societal transformations, and providing demonstrations of deep climate-resilience. Further, it will make important contributions to the achievement of the European Green Deal and the post-COVID recovery plans (see annex 3), and the Sustainable Development Goals (see annex 4). By combining impactful research and innovation, inclusive community engagement, green financial transition and coherent policy reforms, the Mission will develop and deploy innovative solutions at a scale and magnitude of impact that could not be otherwise achieved. ",
        "5 2.2 The objectives of the Mission To turn the urgent challenge of adapting to climate change into an opportunity to make Europe more climate resilient, prepared and just, the Mission will work with citizens, communities and regions on green innovation, transformative adaptation and resilience forging. All of which will be enabled by investments, capacity building, knowledge creation, inclusive governance, sustainable business innovation and partnerships in and between regions and communities. Figure 1. The vision and objectives of the Mission By 2030, the Mission will: 1. Prepare Europe to deal with climate disruptions , assisting citizens, communities and regions in better understanding, preparing for and managing climate risks such as heatwaves, forest fires, droughts, floods, storms, and diseases. Target: By 2030, all local administrative units (LAU) and regions (NUTS) will have access to climate risk profiles and enhanced early warning systems for all relevant risks, will have adopted comprehensive climate risk management plans, and will have community infrastructure and services that are safe and operable and accessible under critical conditions 2. Accelerate the transition to a climate resilient future , supporting 200 European communities and regions that reflect the diversity in climate and approaches to addressing climate risk in Europe, in co-creating a vision, innovation pathways and enabling conditions for transformative adaptation within safe planetary boundaries. ",
        "6 Target: By 2030, 200 European communities and regions will have developed their own transformative vision; co-created adaptation pathways; co- designed and tested actionable solutions; and created favourable conditions for societal transformations towards climate resilience. 3. Build deep resilience , scaling up actionable solutions triggering societal transformations through 100 deep demonstrations of climate resilience across a number of European communities and regions. Target: By 2030, 100 deep demonstrations have scaled-up actionable solutions that have triggered societal transformation, building deep climate- resilience and creating value shared across borders. 2.3 The approach of the Mission As we respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting unprecedented social and economic crisis, we need to ensure that Europe is prepared for climate emergences and unavoidable impacts of climate variability and change. The Mission seeks to advance climate adaptation by building resilience as a capacity to withstand and cope with climate crises and as an opportunity to undergo transitions in a sustainable, fair and democratic manner v,vi . The Mission employs an integrated and systemic approach to risk management and resilience building, moving away from piecemeal sectorial and linear cause-effect-solution focus. A climate resilient Europe is understood to include three fundamental and interrelated dimensions and principles that guide the Mission and determine the success of the Mission: 1. Resilience of environmental systems with a commitment to long-term sustainability, in which the precautionary and do no harm principles are embedded in the efforts to regenerate critical community systems most affected by climate impacts (see section 3.1). The Mission is committed to support overarching goals of the European Green Deal, such as reaching climate neutrality, adopting circular economy principles, and preserving biodiversity and a toxic-free environment. 2. Resilience of social and economic systems with a commitment to equity, social and gender justice, to engage children and youth, and to leave no one behind. The Mission's approach to societal transformation vii pervades all community systems and embraces social, economic, and cultural value changes. Making societies less vulnerable leads the way for building new norms, practices and habits that preserve the environment, enhance wellbeing, and shift from a market-fixing framework to a market-shaping framework redefining the meaning of public value. 3. Resilience of political systems , with a commitment to inclusiveness, deliberation, shared values, solidarity and respect for diversity. The Mission will foster societal transformations in a manner that involves all actors, including citizens, civil society organisations, public authorities, business and industry, academia, R&I, and other relevant stakeholders throughout all its phases. The Mission also commits to joint learning and sharing assisted by ",
        "7 learning communities and communities of practice, mobilisation of funds and resources, multi-level governance, and support to the most vulnerable. The Mission understands and employs innovation as a way to catalyse systemic change . It embraces a model of innovation viii designed to generate options in the face of uncertainty and diversity, and tests integrated and exponential solutions to address the complex, multi-faceted nature of the changes we need to make. The Mission will work closely with and assist regions and communities across Europe to design and implement an ambitious transformation agenda. By focusing on regions, communities and citizens, the Mission seeks to mobilise and leverage on local innovations and responses to climate risk. To inspire society at large, and to ensure that it has the necessary legitimacy, acceptance and relevance, the Mission will engage all relevant actors, in particular citizens, in the co-design, co-implementation, and co-evaluation of the Mission, informed by the best available science and supported by dedicated processes and mechanisms. Already the recommendations made in this report have been inspired and sustained by the citizen and stakeholder engagement conducted by the Mission Board so far (annex 2). Co-design: To further strengthen societal ownership and long-term sustainability of the Mission\u2019s goals and objectives, the co-design phase will include the first two years of the Mission. The Mission will engage and support partner regions and communities, in order to: \uf0b7 build their own visions of climate resilience and adaptation, tailor- made to local and context-specific challenges and climate risks . Regions and communities will choose the community systems to focus on and frame social, economic, cultural and behavioural change to work towards. This should be done while taking into account existing programmes, strategies and commitments at the regional, national and European level, in particular those of the European Green Deal (see annex 3); \uf0b7 co-design climate-resilient adaptation pathways . Regions and communities will outline their social and economic innovation priorities and actions, make strategic choices, choose leverage points and test actionable solutions. Each pathway will result in a portfolio of innovation actions with alternative or complementary strategies, paying attention to citizens' priorities, knowledge needs, trade-offs and uncertainties, as well as principles of social and intergenerational justice. \uf0b7 sign a climate resilience contract . Regions and communities, where necessary in agreement with and participation of higher governance bodies, will sign social (climate resilience) contracts. These contracts will show social and political commitments to work together and implement innovation portfolios that catalyse the necessary transformations. The climate resilience contracts should entail the main goals, commitments and responsibilities, as well as key performance indicators. The ownership of the resilience contract will stay with the implementing regions and communities. ",
        "8 Co-implementation: User-led innovation will require close engagement of citizens, businesses and industries, governments, entrepreneurs and investors as well as scientists. The Mission will engage and support partner regions and communities, in order to: \uf0b7 foster co-production of data and knowledge and co-design of climate services and innovative solutions. The Co-implementation will focus on improving the availability and relevance of data and knowledge, usability of digital tools and services for better understanding of risks and their management. This phase will also work on enhancing the efficiency and economic relevance of transformative solutions. The Mission will engage all stakeholders in joint work with researchers, citizens, innovators and government representatives. \uf0b7 employ citizen science, citizen observatories and other means of joint knowledge gathering and monitoring . Reaching out to community leaders and associations will be a major pillar for the co-implementation of the Mission. Citizens and stakeholders will jointly explore available evidence and state of knowledge, risk perceptions, and behavioural and social practices leading to a better understanding of science-based decision making, and possibly reconciliation of the differences in their views and value judgements. This co-implementation enhances education, awareness and communication of climate risks and solutions. \uf0b7 establish and operate living Mission Labs . Accelerators and incubators are key co-implementation mechanisms for the Mission. The Living Labs of the Mission are spaces for deliberation and shared learning, crafting innovations, fostering dialogues, and maturing the regulatory frameworks needed for the implementation of emerging solutions. Co-evaluation: The final stage of engaging citizens and stakeholders is joint monitoring, assessment and evaluation of the progress and outcomes of the Mission. As part of this phase the Mission will foster an agile, flexible, transparent, systemic and citizen-centred co-evaluation framework, shared learning and transfer of best practices. In close collaboration with the partner regions and communities, the Mission will: \uf0b7 provide feedback on whether the transformative vision and targets are responsive to the principles that guide the Mission and whether results have been accomplished . It will assess to what extent results have contributed to building resilience to climate change and the Mission\u2019s outcomes are aligned with the needs, values and expectations of society. A combination of deliberative processes such as peer review, civil society organisations assessments, monitoring observatories, and standardised proxies will help to assess the performance and ensure impartiality and accountability. \uf0b7 enable new information and lessons learned to feed back to policy review and agenda setting at the European, national and local scales. It will shed light on whether policy goals and targets are still appropriate or need to be adjusted to accommodate new knowledge and lessons learnt ",
        "9 accounting for societal requirements. Information and lessons will be open and accessible to all relevant stakeholders and citizens. \uf0b7 help to identify knowledge and innovation gaps, and design mechanism to create feedback loops with knowledge generated through Horizon Europe and various other innovation platforms. Adaptation planning is often based on uncertain or an otherwise incomplete understanding of changing climate risks. Thus, a systemic and iterative co- evaluation will continuously improve existing knowledge on climate change impacts and vulnerability, and help to identify key challenges, opportunities and remaining knowledge gaps. 2.4 The support structures of the Mission The governance mechanisms of the Mission will build on existing structures, allow agile adjustments to specific circumstances in regions and communities, and promote efficiency, reflectivity, democratic deliberation and accountability. Partner regions and communities are expected to establish local governance platforms to enable inclusive and deliberative processes and foster citizen engagement to navigate through the transformations. Physical and virtual interaction (e.g. climate assemblies, online consultation tools and surveys, workshops and webstivals) will make it possible to collect citizens' and stakeholders' voices in a safe and flexible way. Local governance platforms are mechanisms for facilitating co-design, co-implementation and co-evaluation of the Mission \u201con the ground\u201d. Ensuring some form of support across multiple levels of governance is another critical structural element for the successful implementation of the Mission. Choices made in support of societal transformations in communities and regions will need to be upheld or endorsed at various governance levels. Alignment and collaboration across various regional, national and European actions on climate adaptation, disaster risk reduction and sustainable development will be essential for accomplishing societal transformation. Adhering to the principle of subsidiarity and adapting to various national contexts, such multi-level governance structures should allow for a coordinated and complementary use of European funds and coherent application of all planning instruments mobilised by the European Green Deal. By building on what already exists, the Mission will, for example, require that actions are coherent with and supported by national efforts to implement the EU Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, and foster exploitation of European and national research and innovation policies. The Mission will provide horizontal support to all partner regions and communities. To this end, the Mission will organise communities of practice across the key thematic issues that are essential for the implementation of the Mission (see section 3.1). The communities of practice will bring together experts and practitioners, business and industry, organisations and networks to foster innovation and support the partner regions and communities. For each key community system and enabling condition, communities of practice will (i) review ",
        "10 and advance knowledge and innovations, (ii) support co-designing and testing of transformative solutions, and (iii) support upscaling of successful solutions. Furthermore, the Mission will foster shared and cooperative learning and coordination amongst regions and communities where common needs, priorities or interests have been identified, and where it is important to ensure that objectives and instruments developed are mutually reinforcing. While success of adaptation is context dependent, regions and communities can benefit immensely from peer learning, exchange of practices and sharing of knowledge. Citizens will also learn about cross-European initiatives, successes achieved, and challenges faced elsewhere. Within this context, the Mission will establish a twinning mechanism bringing together innovation leaders and more modest performers. In general, the Mission will build upon and benefit from synergies across various European and national policies, programmes and initiatives, including the European Climate Pact, the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, Climate ADAPT, and the European Urban Initiative. A Mission implementation platform should be designed to carry out day-to- day management, coordination and monitoring of the Mission. The Mission Platform should provide and coordinate the necessary technical, regulatory, financial, engagement and socio-economic expertise as well as assistance to regions and communities, in particular to (i) facilitate participatory processes underpinning the co-design, co-implementation and co-evaluation, (ii) manage the portfolio of innovation actions and test transformative solutions, and (iii) assist in mobilising additional funds, including, but not limited to, by providing a climate-resilience financing platform. This Mission Implementation Platform should be composed of organisations with large experience in managing public investments and able to attract external investments. Because it is essential for this Mission to move forward with the urgency it deserves, we strongly recommend that the European Commission swiftly prioritise the resources and create a project management team that can reach out to potential partners, help defining selection criteria, and activate broad-ranging citizen engagement. Without thus anchoring the Mission solidly, we fear that the implementation of the Mission can be delayed and the momentum lost. 3 The portfolio of the Mission 3.1 Areas of research and innovation for transformation 3.1.1 Addressing key community systems The Mission will stimulate major innovations in the management of interdependent key community systems that are central for resilience building and sustainable development and most affected by climate change (see Figure 2). ",
        "11 Figure 2. The Mission\u2019s areas of research and innovation for transformation ",
        "12 Regenerating community and social infrastructure Urban and rural communities with well-functioning social infrastructure, such as schools, libraries, health care, shelters, parks, social protection systems and housing, and safe and reliable access to transport, energy and other basic services, are more resilient and better prepared to cope with environmental and human-made risks and shocks. Public investment in social infrastructure can catalyse innovative community welfare systems, promote social inclusion and improve living conditions in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Public services that are affordable and accessible to all, including disadvantaged groups and youth at risk of exclusion, support individual and community fulfilment, foster personal development, and form lasting social relationships and collaborations. However, in many places the community infrastructure is underinvested, degraded, or not adequately provided for ix . The Mission will foster regenerating public spaces and community facilities for inclusive, healthy and climate-resilient neighbourhoods, and resilient social protection mechanisms. As a result, the Mission will contribute to making the social and community infrastructure safe, accessible, resource and energy efficient, and compliant with principles of circular economy. Research and innovation will address, among others, ways to climate proof buildings in energy and resource efficient ways, optimal use and greening of public spaces, new modes of social innovation and partnerships, blended financial instruments such as social impact bonds, and institutional frameworks such as national and regional promotional banks. The Mission will establish links to the Urban Greening Plans, supported by the LIFE Program, to bring nature back to cities; and the Green Deal quest to promote energy and resource efficient renovation in public buildings and social housing, schools and hospitals (including innovative financing schemes under InvestEU). It will contribute to the \u2018renovation wave\u2019 that Member States are encouraged to undertake to make buildings climate-proof and energy and resource efficient, and which is also supported by sizeable funds from the 'Next Generation EU' recovery package. It will also contribute to further strengthen European social protection systems providing insights and solutions how to promote social cohesion and equality through adequate, accessible and financially sustainable social protection systems and social inclusion policies that are climate resilient. Protecting human health and wellbeing Climate risks are affecting health, wellbeing and quality of life of European citizens. Health risks include morbidity and mortality from for example heatwaves, forest fires, storms, floods but also from air pollution, illnesses from food, vector- and water-borne infectious diseases, and mental health impacts including trauma related to extreme events as well as distress, anxiety and feelings of disempowerment. Also, climate risks have the potential to exacerbate long term chronic illnesses such as respiratory, cardiovascular and endocrine diseases and cancer, further increasing existing health inequalities in society. The Mission will help communities to stay healthy in a changing climate including with planning, early-warning and surveillance systems. ",
        "13 The research and innovation will address inter alia integration of climate risks into health preparedness systems, development and adoption of early warning systems to ensure a rapid response from health services, and development of robust epidemiological surveillance and modelling tools for assessing and predicting impact of extreme events and disasters associated with climate change including impacts on mental health. The Mission will foster adoption of health plans and adequate response to address all relevant hazards, to protect people at high risk such as children, senior citizens, people with chronic diseases, socially disadvantaged groups. The Mission will help define and assess the resilience goals that have been proposed as a part of risk management capacities under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) and contribute to improving the understanding of and societal preparedness for health risks. Also, it will contribute to the EU4Health 2021-2017 programme by strengthening health systems and stimulating disease prevention, as well as improving access to health care for vulnerable groups. Restoring nature, biodiversity and ecosystems services The loss of nature threatens livelihoods, health and wellbeing, and long-term viability of communities. Climate change accelerates environmental deterioration, which may in turn further amplify climate change and exacerbate impacts of climate risks. Ecosystem degradation affects us all and is disproportionately felt by the poor, presenting obstacles to social and economic wellbeing, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. Nature-based solutions provide means for mitigating climate risks and boosting societal resilience, locally or regionally, stimulate innovation, and produce multiple co-benefits, including for people\u2019s health. To harness the power of nature for climate resilience the Mission will boost nature-based solutions and green-blue multipurpose infrastructure investments in ecosystems. Research and innovation will address, among others, incentives and financial schemes encouraging cooperation among landowners and high degree of ecological connectivity, transferability of knowledge and evidence within and across context-specific domains, demonstrated performance and efficiency of nature-based solutions at large scales, connections between ecosystem quality and human health. In aiming to reach its objective, the Mission supports and leverages efforts directed to meeting the commitments under the Biodiversity Strategy 2030, which include, among others, the scaling up of restoration of nature as a key nature-based solution to increase the EU\u2019s resilience and contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, the increase of high-diversity landscape features of agricultural areas to at least 10%, the afforestation and reforestation to adapt forests to climate change in full respect of ecological principles, the restoration of at least 25,000 km of rivers into free-flowing rivers, and the establishment of a true Trans-European Nature Network including high quality and well-connected green and blue (water-related) infrastructure. ",
        "14 Rethinking water management As a result of climate change, millions of people and many water-intense industries in Europe will be short of sufficient water every so often and many regions will suffer from chronic water stress and accelerated desertification. At the same time, intense rainfalls will become more regular, increasing the frequency and severity of inland and coastal floods, which are already now among the costliest climate change-related hazards in the EU. These challenges will not be effectively addressed without a step change improvement in sustainable water consumption, resource management and adequate protection against water- related risks. Embracing these new water realities, the Mission will foster innovations towards smart, reliable, and efficient access to water and reduced vulnerability to water-related risks. Research and innovation will develop incentive schemes fostering efficient use and allocation of water, propose novel metering and monitoring systems for water use/reuse and quality of aquatic ecosystems, design and test smart, low-energy water technologies and improve assessment, monitoring and management of water-related risks. In doing so, it will contribute to achieving the water-related environmental and risk management objectives, promote water security and sustainable community water management principles, as well as negotiated water agreements and governance schemes such as water contracts. The Mission will support efforts to meet the EU water-related environmental policy objectives, in particular achieving and preserving good ecological and chemical status of water bodies, as well as ensuring that a sufficient quantity of good quality water is available to meet the needs of citizens, the economy and the environment. Recycling and reuse of water are central to a circular economy and provide an alternative type of water supply . In line with the risk assessment and planning processes established under the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Mission will encourage adoption of local environmental agreements such as river or coast contracts empowering local communities to co-manage water resources and water-dependent ecosystems. Reviving landscapes and sustainable food systems Rural and urban landscapes are an expression of the European cultural heritage and reflect how local communities have adapted to and transformed the natural environment to produce food, fibre, raw materials and renewable energy from agricultural crops, forests, and aquatic bodies or fisheries. The diversity and resilience of productive landscapes and sustainable livelihoods are undermined by climate risks, non-sustainable agricultural practices, migration to urban areas or urban sprawl. The Mission will support the transition to a resilient food system, mindful of the interrelations between human and ecosystem health, supply chains, sustainable consumption, and cultural heritage. Research and innovation will promote sustainable business model innovation for income diversification, organic farming and community agriculture, sustainable and circular supply chains, design schemes for fair distribution of economic and social benefits from tourism throughout the recipient community, find adequate ",
        "15 substitutes of synthetic fertilisers and increase nitrogen efficiency, and design strategies to overcome cultural, technological, market and regulatory barriers to circular economy. The Mission will contribute to adoption of conservative management practices protecting soils and employing bioremediation, promote diffusion of smart agroecological and technological innovation, foster environmental stewardship, effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions and expand natural carbon sinks, and accelerate the transition towards circular economy. Policies to promote the establishment of centres of excellence in rural Europe can help to create critical mass of activity and expertise that can promote diversification of agricultural activity and resource efficiency on the farm. The updated EU Bioeconomy Strategy and its action plan generate new economic opportunities for farmers, foresters and fishers by using research and innovation to modernise primary production systems in a sustainable way and create novel biobased value-chains. The circular economy promotes the retention of materials in the materials cycle for as long as possible, the use of short or inner loops in manufacturing: this is appropriate for food production systems where by- products, residues, and side streams generated on the farm or at food processing facilities can be converted into products of value. The integration of food and non- food products is a major opportunity to build efficiency and resilience into the food production system. The Mission will help to meet the commitments under the Farm to Fork Strategy, ensuring that (i) the food chain from food production to consumption has a neutral or positive environmental impact (with at least 25% of agricultural land under organic farming management), (ii) everyone has access to sufficient, nutritious and sustainable food (ensuring food security and public health), and (iii) most sustainable food becomes the most affordable (promoting sustainable food consumption and facilitating a shift to healthy and sustainable diets). 3.1.2 Creating enabling conditions Dealing with complex systems, it is not possible to know beforehand which solutions will deliver on the envisaged transformative change. Creating enabling conditions for this change to happen is therefore a central task of the Mission, which includes: Facilitating inclusive and deliberative governance processes for just transitions The success of this Mission will depend on engagement of stakeholders, from civil society organisations, to business communities, professional organisations, industries, and citizens. The Mission will spur social, institutional and cultural change employing deliberation and co-design, co-production and co-assessment of transformative solutions, and will support partner regions and communities in establishing innovative local governance platforms to steer the transformations. It will encourage inclusive and participatory processes to engage citizens and stakeholders, foster social learning and culture of civic engagement, develop capacities and capabilities, and provide mechanisms ensuring a just transition, securing support for those that are most vulnerable to climate change, as well as those that may be most negatively affected by the transition. ",
        "16 Research and innovation will include actions responding to knowledge needs and benefiting civil society organisations and local governance bodies such as climate assemblies that will design, test and monitor performance of experimental modes of participatory governance and environmental stewardship. Adequate strategies and mechanisms will be developed to manage structural changes that emerge during the transformations, and to resolve tensions as well as redistributive and intergenerational social conflicts undermining a just transition. To facilitate inclusive and deliberative governance processes, the Mission will help mobilise grants from Horizon Europe, and will contribute to efforts undertaken in the context of the Climate Pact and the European Skills Agenda for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience. Providing access to data, knowledge, and digital services Data and knowledge are critical for better understanding and managing climate risks, enhancing adaptive capacities and supporting transformative innovations towards a more climate resilient society. Building on available data services and capacities, the Mission will mobilise research and innovation to improve and fill knowledge gaps at regional and local levels and unlock the benefits of the digital transformation for and within the regions and communities. Partner regions and communities will be assisted in scenario building and modelling needed to develop context-specific adaptation pathways, visualising possible futures. The Mission will also facilitate the co-production of data and knowledge and the co-design of climate services and solutions with citizens and stakeholders to improve the local saliency of data, usability of digital services and practicability of solutions. Research and innovation will harness the advancements in climate risk assessment and management, building upon cutting-edge earth system modelling and assessment of compound, cascading and spill-over risks as well as crowdsourcing and citizen observatories, integration of climate and non-climate (social, economic, behavioural, institutional, historical and/or cultural dimensions, perceptual aspects of) knowledge and fomenting synergies across different types and sources of knowledge, and exploring possible futures by modelling and foresights. Further research will also address how social and cultural processes that shape how risks and solutions, including their associated uncertainties, are perceived and responded to. The Mission will contribute to filling the knowledge gaps hampering the adoption of transformative adaptation solutions and map the needs and opportunities for systems innovation and societal change. In delivering on the provision of access to data, knowledge and digital services, the Mission will mobilise grants from the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Horizon Europe. The Mission will also contribute to and leverage efforts undertaken to shape Europe\u2019s digital future, for example the establishment of EU-wide digital data spaces, aiming to overcome legal and technical barriers to data sharing across organisations, and the \u2018Destination Earth\u2019 initiative bringing together scientific and industrial excellence to develop a very high-level precision digital model of the Earth (both initiatives under the EU\u2019s strategy for data). ",
        "17 Strengthening education, communication and a better understanding behavioural change The Mission will support partner regions and communities in fostering education, skills and capacities to improve understanding and developing new skills that are necessary to retain the benefits of the transition. To strengthen education, skills and capacities, the Mission will tap into efforts outlined in the European Skills Agenda intended to strengthen sustainable competitiveness, ensure social fairness and build resilience. The Mission will also benefit from the EU plans on Youth Employment Support that will reinforce the Youth Guarantee programme and future-proof the EU\u2019s vocational education and training making them adaptable to future challenges. Research and innovation in this regard should, for example, address the need to develop and operate a skills forecasting systems that would provide information on upskilling and reskilling needs, design master courses to train green skills, or develop community adult learning centres, where people of all ages can learn and exchange, building a resilient and cohesive society. The European Social Fund+ will play an important role in helping Europe\u2019s workforce acquire the skills they need to transfer from declining sectors to growing sectors and to adapt to new processes. Also, the Recovery and Resilience Facility yields unprecedented opportunities in this regard. The Mission will support partner regions and communities also in better understanding and nudging behavioural change, mobilising grants from relevant pillars under Horizon Europe. Strengthening sustainable and circular local economies The resilience and adaptive capacities of communities and regions depend on, among others, how well their economies perform. Transformative innovations need to address financial and economic vulnerability as well as the underlying drivers of inequality and poverty. The Mission will work with partner regions and communities to renew and restore local economies in a sustainable manner centred on smart specialisation, collective wellbeing and local resilience, and exploit the potential of a circular economy for building climate resilience. The Mission will also support the partner regions and communities to develop financial risk strategies against damage and losses from extreme climate events to close the climate protection gap. Research and innovation will address collective wellbeing and local resilience, strengthening the plural forms of business entrepreneurship, new forms of social enterprises and community owned small-medium enterprises (SMEs), and more dense local supply chains that are more resilient to shocks in the system. Innovation will also address measurement, modelling and performance assessment of policy tools to exploit synergies between circular economy and climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies at various levels. To strengthen local economies, the Mission would mobilise grants from relevant pillars under Horizon Europe, and should contribute to and leverage efforts undertaken in the context of the Circular Economy Action Plan leveraging Cohesion policy funds, and the Just Transition Mechanism promoting a transition ",
        "18 towards low-carbon and climate-resilient activities and striving to protect the citizens and workers most vulnerable to the transition. Synergies will be created with the updated EU Bioeconomy Strategy and its action plan. It will also increase the understanding of the ecological boundaries of the bioeconomy, which is central to many areas of this Mission. To unlock the benefits of the digital transition, the Mission will tap into efforts accelerating investments in Europe\u2019s \u2018Gigabit Connectivity\u2019 to strengthen the regions\u2019 digital infrastructure and networks. Mobilising funds and resources The Mission will support the partner regions and communities in crowding-in and mobilising multiple forms and sources of funding and finance. The EU budget will play a key role, with a proposed 25% target for climate mainstreaming across all EU programmes and at least 30% of the InvestEU Fund to contribute to fighting climate change. The Mission will assist partner regions and communities in accessing the EU funds and programmes, and loans from the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. National and regional funds, as well as progressive Green Procurement policies and environmental taxation will also play a role, as well as research on how insurance and other financial instruments can be harnessed to protect and regenerate ecosystems and the regulating services these provide. 3.2 Meeting the objectives of the Mission 3.2.1 Prepare Europe The first objective of the Mission is to raise the bar on safety and security of the key community systems and ensure continuity of essential community services under all-hazard conditions. The Mission will help citizens, communities and regions to better prepare for climate change related shocks and disruptions (see annex 5 for a proposed timeline for the Mission). By 2030, all local administrative units (LAU) and regions (NUTS) will have easy access to climate risk profiles and reliable early warning systems for all relevant risks, will have adopted comprehensive climate risk management plans, and will have community and social infrastructure and services that are safe, operable and accessible under critical conditions. To meet the above ambitious objective, it is critically important to mobilise existing information, data and knowledge, and capacities to use them in a way that brings positive results to the community. To foster a better understanding of the climate risk exposure , the Mission will: \uf0b7 improve availability, accessibility and usability of climate risk knowledge and digital knowledge services that are useful to identify local \"reasons for concern\" and to reveal gaps in local risk management capacities and capabilities; ",
        "19 \uf0b7 provide access to climate risk assessments built upon cutting-edge climate and environmental information from European Earth Observation Programmes; \uf0b7 support adjustments of existing early warning systems to take into account the changing patterns of climate extremes and ensure a rapid response protecting people at high risk such as children, senior citizens, people with chronic diseases, socially disadvantaged groups; and developing robust epidemiological surveillance and modelling tools. The Mission will build upon existing capacities and stimulate use and exploitation of available data and services, and help overcome legal and technical barriers to data sharing, re-use and interoperability. The Mission will collaborate with the Disaster Risk Management Knowledge Centre; Galileo, Copernicus and Space Situational Awareness Programmes, European Environment Agency, EUROSTAT and others. The functionality and services of the existing datahubs and clearinghouses such as Climate Data Store and Climate-ADAPT will be further developed to allow users to explore risk profiles at various geographic scales, and combine and visualise the data in the most meaningful and engaging way. A dedicated project will lay the groundwork for a European Climate Risk Assessment (ECRA) Framework, built upon open access research and innovation. Pioneering work of the Copernicus Climate Change Service and the progress made under the European Roadmap for Climate Services will be shared and made accessible for re-use and exploitation. The insights and users' requirements collected from the co-generation of knowledge within the 200 partner regions and communities mobilised as accelerators for transformative solutions (section 3.2.2) will inform the development of ECRA data and services. To facilitate the adoption of climate risk management and community- based emergency plans and ensure that social infrastructure is safe and essential services operable and accessible under critical conditions, the Mission will support communities and regions and: \uf0b7 provide training, assistance, and equipment to understand, make sense of and respond to climate risks threatening the safety of lives and social infrastructure, reliability of lifeline networks, performance of public services, viability of local livelihoods, and conservation status of natural community environment; \uf0b7 guide formulation of comprehensive climate risk management plans along a single framework for managing fast-onset climate extremes such as floods and storms and gradual changes such as desertification and sea level rise; and based on inclusive and deliberative processes, making transparent and accountable how risks are prioritised and managed, and how the vulnerable, disadvantaged and marginalised are protected; \uf0b7 support mobilisation of funds available for the renovation wave to retrofit and climate-proof public buildings and social housing, making them resource and energy efficient, healthy and compliant with principles of circular economy; \uf0b7 incentivise rigorous monitoring and evaluation of the progress made on reducing risk and adapting to global warming, driven by consistent reporting schemes feeding into a periodic European stocktaking exercise and ",
        "20 providing input for the next cycle of climate risks\u2019 assessment and management. The Mission will initiate research and innovation projects responding to the knowledge needs of citizens and civil society organisations and building capacities to take part in otherwise inaccessible policy- and decision-making processes. A series of projects will explore how to assimilate risk perceptions and behavioural aspects of human decision making in risk analysis, assessment and communication. These projects will also exploit the developments in mobile communication and social media to sensitise society to climate related risks. The Mission will foster demand- and challenge-driven innovation actions, training and capacity building, and citizen observatory campaigns. Dedicated supporting and coordination actions will develop community guidance and best practice examples for formulating climate risk and community emergency management plans, and mobilising funds to climate proof social infrastructure and services. 3.2.2 Accelerate transformation The second objective of the Mission is to accelerate the transformation to a Europe that is climate resilient, fair and prosperous, within safe planetary boundaries. By 2030, 200 regions and communities (accelerators x ) will have articulated their visions of social change and climate-resilient pathways, tested transformative solutions, and prepared the ground for deep-rooted system innovations. To assist the accelerators in designing transformative vision and pathways , the Mission will mobilise resources for a major research programme on social transformations for resilience and sustainability. The program will support fundamental research and foresight studies analysing ongoing societal changes and their drivers, as well as the key transformations that are needed to meet the goals of the Sustainable Development Agenda, the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk reduction 2015-2030. Research will address systemic macro-level social, governance and economic processes and help to scale down their implications to regional levels. In the opposite way, research will explore the systemic consequences of observed or imaginable processes at local and regional scales. The Mission, supported by its communities of practice, will assist the partner regions and communities to formulate their individual visions and pathways by providing an overview of relevant innovations and solutions, and visualising possible futures modelling scenarios of pathways chosen. It will also assist in the formulation and agreement of the climate resilient contracts that should entail the main goals, commitments and responsibilities, as well as key performance indicators and would provide continuous support regarding the monitoring of progress made. Based on the vision and adaptation pathways developed by partner communities and regions, the Mission will support these communities and regions to follow the chosen path to transformative change, by assisting them to: \uf0b7 co-design and test transformative solutions within and across the key community systems (section 3.1.1) ; and \uf0b7 co-create favourable conditions for transformations (section 3.1.2) . ",
        "21 This objective is the cornerstone of the Mission. The 200 partner regions and communities will play a key role in piloting societal transformations. The regions and communities will be supported by a number of 'communities of practice' initiated by the Mission (section 2.4). The transformative solutions developed within the partner regions and communities will form a dynamic portfolio, which the Mission will use to stimulate mutual learning, partnership building and innovation. The Mission will support the partner communities and regions to: \uf0b7 mobilise additional funds and resources to finance a portfolio of innovation actions . Based on the agreed adaptation pathways and responding to the knowledge and innovation demand identified in the local and regional accelerators, the Mission will launch competitive calls and/or mobilise other funds for a number of innovation actions testing transformative solutions. \uf0b7 co-implement and orchestrate a portfolio of innovation actions . The Mission will support partner regions and communities in making coherent choices about projects and problems as a system of interventions, allowing for iterative insights and feedback loops to inform dynamic management of innovation options and the portfolio as a whole, including managing exits/failures and introducing new solutions. \uf0b7 co-assess the portfolio of innovation actions . The Mission will assist the regions and communities in making sense of the ongoing developments within the portfolio of innovation actions and in learning about obstacles and barriers to innovation, potential multipliers, more or less effective leverage points, integration effects and pathways to scaling. It will provide ample opportunities to share solutions, experiences, and knowledge with peer regions and communities and the respective communities of practice. 3.2.3 Build deep resilience The third objective of the Mission is to provide deep demonstrations of climate resilience at large scale. Deep demonstrations are on-the-ground examples of thoroughgoing societal transformations accomplished on a larger scale, with verifiable impacts, and based upon citizen engagement. By 2030, 100 deep demonstration of climate resilience will be developed across Europe. The Mission will: \uf0b7 Create impact at scale, and scale-up innovations designed and successfully tested in pilot accelerators at regional and/or community level (objective 2), and \uf0b7 Create value across borders and promote cross-border partnerships on issues where regions and communities have identified a need or benefit to address the transformation to climate resilience within a common framework. The 100 deep demonstrations will mostly emerge from the grassroot innovation of the 200 accelerators. Some advanced regions may be already in position to work on the deep demonstrations. Member States governments and cross-border organisations such as international river basin commissions will play a critically important role. Going beyond research and innovation, the creation of impact at scale or cross-border value hinges on governments and the EU leveraging policy ",
        "22 processes and funds managed at national and European level, such as the National Energy and Climate Plans, the Common Agricultural Policy and the European Agricultural Fund for Regional Development, the European Structural and Investment Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, and the Cohesion Fund. To create the impact at scale , the Mission will: \uf0b7 select the most promising accelerators, based on a thorough review of their potential impacts, diversity and complementarity, as well as their geographic distributions, and assist them in achieving and amplifying their outcomes; \uf0b7 further enhance capacities and capabilities of the chosen demonstrators by innovative coaching, peer review, knowledge transfer and twinning through every step of their transformation pathways; \uf0b7 assist demonstrators to implement the successful transformative solutions at large scale, to mobilise and tailor European and national funding, to respond to encountered challenges and barriers, as well as to exploit new opportunities. To create value across borders , the Mission will: \uf0b7 help identify issues that would need and/or benefit from a coordination across borders for more climate resilience, such as the cross-border management of health systems and services xi , natural and cultural heritage xii , river basins xiii , business and value chains, or knowledge and innovation xiv ; \uf0b7 facilitate and strengthen coordination and cooperation, drawing on the support of relevant communities of practice established under the Mission, and/or other relevant platforms offering the sharing of knowledge across borders, including for example the EU macro-regional strategies; \uf0b7 assist demonstrators to mobilise relevant funds and resources, in particular drawing on the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), including the European Territorial Cooperation (or Interreg) xv that supports common challenges across regions. i EUCO 23/19.

(editors) (2020). Climate change impacts and adaptation in Europe . JRC PESETA IV final report. [Link] Abstract The JRC PESETA IV study shows that ecosystems, people and economies in the EU will face major impacts from climate change if we do not urgently mitigate greenhouse gas emissions or adapt to climate change. The burden of climate change shows a clear north-south divide, with southern regions in Europe much more impacted, through the effects of extreme heat, water scarcity, drought, forest fires and agriculture losses. Limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C would considerably reduce climate change impacts in Europe. Adaptation to climate change would further minimise unavoidable impacts in a cost-effective manner, with considerable co-benefits from nature-based solutions. European Environment Agency (2020).
