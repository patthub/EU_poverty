        "COMMON POSITION (EC) No 12/2006 adopted by the Council on 18 July 2006 with a view to adoption a Decision No \u2026/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \u2026 establishing a Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity \u2014 Progress (2006/C 238 E/03) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EURO- PEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Com- munity, and in particular Articles 13(2), 129 and 137(2)(a) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), Having regard to the Opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 2 ), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 3 ), Whereas: (1) The Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000 incorporated the promotion of employment and social inclusion as an integral part of the overall strategy of the Union in order to achieve its strategic goal for the next decade of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. It set ambitious objectives and targets for the Union aiming to recreate the condi- tions for full employment, improve quality and produc- tivity at work, and promote social cohesion and an inclusive labour market. Furthermore, the strategy was focused upon again by the Brussels European Council of 22 and 23 March 2005. (2) In line with the Commission's express intention of consolidating and rationalising Community funding instruments, this Decision should establish a single and streamlined programme providing for the continuation and development of the activities launched on the basis of Council Decision 2000/750/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a Community action programme to combat discrimination (2001 to 2006) ( 4 ), Council Decision 2001/51/EC of 20 December 2000 establishing a Programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality (2001-2005) ( 5 ) and Euro- pean Parliament and Council Decisions No 50/2002/EC of 7 December 2001 establishing a programme of Com- munity action to encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion ( 6 ), No 1145/2002/EC of 10 June 2002 on Community incen- tive measures in the field of employment ( 7 ) and No 848/2004/EC of 29 April 2004 establishing a Com- munity action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women ( 8 ), as well as those activities under- taken at Community level in relation to working condi- tions. (3) The Extraordinary European Council on Employment in Luxembourg of 20 and 21 November 1997 launched the European Employment Strategy to coordinate Member States' employment policies on the basis of commonly agreed employment guidelines and recom- mendations. The European Employment Strategy is now the most important instrument at European level for implementation of the employment and labour market objectives of the Lisbon Strategy. (4) The Lisbon European Council concluded that the number of people living below the poverty line and in social exclusion in the Union was unacceptable and therefore deemed it necessary to take steps to make deci- sive progress in the eradication of poverty by setting adequate objectives. Such objectives were agreed by the Nice European Council of 7, 8 and 9 December 2000. It further agreed that policies for combating social exclu- sion should be based on the open method of coordina- tion, combining national action plans and a Commission initiative for cooperation. (5) Demographic change represents a major long-term chal- lenge to the ability of social protection systems to deliver adequate pensions and high-quality health and long-term care which are accessible to all and can be funded in the long term. It is important to promote poli- cies that can achieve both adequate social protection and the sustainability of social protection systems. The Lisbon European Council decided that cooperation in this area should be based on the open method of coordi- nation. 3.10.2006 C 238E/31 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) OJ C 255, 14.10.2005, p. 67.

        "(6) Attention should be drawn to the specific situation of migrants in this context and also to the importance of taking action to transform undeclared work into regular employment. (7) Ensuring minimum standards and the constant improve- ment of working conditions in the Union is a central feature of European social policy and an important overall objective of the European Union. The Com- munity has an important role to play in supporting and complementing Member States' activities in the fields of workers' health and safety, working conditions, including the need to reconcile work and family life, protection of workers where their employment contract is terminated, information, consultation and participation of workers, and representation and collective defence of the interests of workers and employers. (8) Non-discrimination is a fundamental principle of the European Union. Article 13 of the Treaty provides for action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Non-discrimination is also enshrined in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The specific features of the diverse forms of discrimination should be accommodated, and appropriate action developed in parallel to prevent and combat discrimination on one or more grounds. There- fore, when considering the accessibility and results of the Programme, the particular needs of people with disabilities should be taken into account in terms of ensuring their full and equal access to the activities funded by this Programme and the results and evaluation of those activities, including the compensation of addi- tional costs that they incur as a result of their disability. Experience gained over many years of combating certain forms of discrimination, including discrimination based on sex, may be useful in combating other kinds of discri- mination. (9) On the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty, the Council has adopted the following directives: Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin ( 1 ) which prohibits discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin in, inter alia, employment, voca- tional training, education, goods and services and social protection, Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation ( 2 ) which prohibits discri- mination in employment and occupation on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orienta- tion, and Directive 2004/113/EC of 13 December 2004 implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services ( 3 ). (10) Pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty equal treat- ment for men and women is a fundamental principle of Community law. The directives and other acts adopted on the basis of this principle play a major part in improving the situation of women in the Union. Experi- ence of action at Community level has shown that promoting gender equality in Community policies and combating discrimination in practice call for a combina- tion of instruments, including legislation, funding tools and mainstreaming, designed to complement one another. In accordance with the principle of equality between men and women, gender mainstreaming should be promoted in all sections and activities of the Programme. (11) Many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) active at various levels can make an important contribution at European level through key networks which assist in changing policy orientations relating to the general objectives of the Programme. (12) Since the objectives of this Decision cannot be suffi- ciently achieved at Member States level because of the need for exchange of information at European level and the Community-wide dissemination of good practice and since therefore these objectives can, by reason of the multilateral dimension of the Community actions and measures, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportion- ality as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives. (13) This Decision lays down, for the entire duration of the Programme, a financial envelope constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 37 of the Interin- stitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial manage- ment ( 4 ), for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure. (14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 5 ). (15) As the Programme is divided into five sections, Member States may provide for the rotation of their national representatives according to the subjects addressed by the Committee assisting the Commission, 3.10.2006 C 238E/32 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22.

        "STATEMENT OF THE COUNCIL'S REASONS I. INTRODUCTION On 27 August 2004, the Commission submitted a proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and the Council establishing a Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity \u2014 Progress (2007-2013). The legal basis of this proposal rests on Articles 13(2), 129 and 137(2)(a) of the Treaty. Essentially, the proposal combines in a single text a number of programmes which had previously been the subject of separate Decisions. The Committee of the Regions gave its opinion on 23 February 2005 and the Economic and Social Committee submitted its opinion on 6 April 2005. During its plenary from 5 to 8 September 2005, the European Parliament gave its opinion on first reading and adopted 72 amendments to the proposal for a Decision. The Commission adopted its amended proposal on 21 October 2005. On 24 May 2006, the Commis- sion adopted an amended proposal that concerned only Article 17(1), the budget of the Programme. The Council adopted a Common Position on 18 July 2006, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty. II. OBJECTIVE The overall objective of the Programme is to consolidate into one streamlined Programme, running from 2007 to 2013, activities launched under a number of earlier Decisions. The Programme's activ- ities are divided into five different sections: employment, social protection and inclusion, working conditions, anti-discrimination and diversity, and gender equality. III. ANALYSIS OF THE COMMON POSITION 1. General On the whole, the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission have convergent approaches to this Programme. A significant number of the European Parliament's amendments have been taken up in the Common Position (see Section 2 below for more details). The Programme's budget of EUR 657,59 million ( 1 ) was agreed by the three institutions in the context of the inter-institutional agreement on the Financial Perspectives for the years 2007-2013. The Common Position reflects that agreement (Article 17(1)). A major modification to the Commission's proposal is that the Common Position, in Article 17(2), allocates the overall budget fully between the different sections of the Programme; the Commission had initially proposed a ten per cent unallocated reserve, to be distributed between the fives sections during the period of the Programme's implementation. The Parliament, in its amendment 67, wished to increase the funding to two sections, Section 2 (social protection and inclusion) and Section 5 (gender equality). The Council accepts this amendment fully but also wishes to increase the funding to two other sections, i.e. Sections 1 (employment) and 3 (working conditions). As a consequence, the Council considers that it is best to allocate all the funding from the outset of the Programme, as a relatively small reserve would be unnecessarily cumbersome to allocate annually. The Council considers that this full allocation of the funding follows the aim of the European Parlia- ment which, in its amendments, stressed the importance of transparency in the budgetary decision- making. 2. European Parliament Amendments taken up by the Council A large number of the Parliament's amendments have been accepted by the Council. Amendments 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 34, 36, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 53, 61, 62, 63, 65, 67, 69 and 70 have been accepted in their entirety, albeit in places with minor linguistic changes or updating (like using the term \u2018 national reform programmes \u2019, a term introduced by the European Council in March 2005, instead of \u2018 national action plans \u2019 in Amendment 22). 3.10.2006 C 238E/39 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) At 2004 prices.

        "A number of amendments are accepted in part, taken up elsewhere in the text or taken up in spirit. On these amendments, the Council makes the following comments: Amendment 4: The Council shares the Parliament's concern on migrants and undeclared work; however, it does not consider that these two are automatically linked; thus the Council, while accepting the amendment's spirit, has changed the wording (Recital 6). Amendment 9 on the role of NGOs: The Council agrees with the Parliament on the important role of the NGOs and a new recital has been included in the text, using different wording, however, from that in the Parliament's amendment (Recital 11). Amendment 13 on the general objectives of the Programme: The Council does not accept the inclu- sion of the text on \u2018 the creation of more and better jobs \u2019 in Article 2, as this is not a prerogative of this Programme. Amendment 14 also on general objectives: The Council accepts adding \u2018innovative approaches\u2019 to the text; however, it considers that the Programme should have its focus at EU level and therefore has not included the words \u2018regional\u2019 and \u2018national\u2019 in the Common Position (Article 2(1)(d)). Amendment 16 on supporting the capacity of key EU networks: The Council considered that it was not necessary to list specific requirements concerning these networks (Article 2(1)(f)). Amendment 18 on the dissemination of the results: The Council agreed with the Parliament on the importance of such dissemination but considers that it is unnecessary to list in the article the stake- holders to whom the results are disseminated (Article 2(3)). Amendment 28 on gender mainstreaming (Article 6): The Council fully agrees with the principle and this issue is dealt with in Article 2(2). Amendment 29 on statistics in the field of working conditions: The Council does not consider it necessary to describe the types of indicators (Article 6(a)). Amendment 32 on working conditions: The second part of the amendment (on specific topics within the larger field of working conditions) is not included in the text in full, as it was considered to be already covered (Article 6(d)). Amendment 35 on anti-discrimination and diversity: The Council considered that the words \u2018 and action taken to combat it \u2019 were already covered at the beginning of the point in question (Article 7(a)). Amendment 37 also on anti-discrimination and diversity: The Council agreed with the Parliament to add a list of stakeholders but used a slightly different list, for the sake of consistency with the articles dealing with other sections of the Programme (Article 7(c)). Amendment 38 also on anti-discrimination and diversity: The Council agrees with the Commission to align the wording of this paragraph with similar paragraphs in other articles. As in the case of Amendment 16, it does not consider it necessary to include a list of the qualities of NGOs (Article 7(d)). Amendment 48: The Council has followed the Commission's amended proposal and has incorpo- rated this reference to national circumstances in the text of Article 9(1), point (b), first indent. Amendment 49: The Council agrees with the Commission's amended proposal that it is not neces- sary to list the other relevant actors (Article 9(1)(c)(iii). Amendments 54 and 55 on access to the Programme: Although the Programme is also open to regional and national NGOs, the Council wishes to stress the role of the NGOs organised at EU level. Similarly, in this context, the Council wishes to stress the important role of public employ- ment services. However, it notes that all bodies, actors and institutions can have access to the Programme, as stated in the introductory part of Article 10. Amendment 64 on consistency and complementarity. While the Council agrees with the Parliament on the importance of this issue, it considers that Article 15(2) covers the issue and that it is not, therefore, necessary to list the different European agencies in the legal text. 3.10.2006 C 238E/40 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "Amendment 66 on the overall budget: See comments above, under Section III, point 1. Amendment 71 on evaluations: The Council agrees with the Parliament that the ex-post evaluation should be available by 31.12.2015. However, concerning the other parts of the Parliament's amend- ment, it has followed the Commission's amended proposal (Article 19). 3. European Parliament amendments not adopted by the Council The Council followed the advice of the Commission and did not include the following Amendments in its Common Position: 23, 33, 50, 51, 56, 57, 59, 60 and 72. As for Amendments 31, 41, 47, 52, 58 and 68 (which were included in the Commission's amended proposal), the Council did not consider it advisable to include them in its Common Position: Amendment 31: While the Parliament wanted to delete the words \u2018 the prevention culture in the field of \u2019 from the text of Article 6(3), the Council considered it more appropriate to keep the words in the text, as the prevention culture should indeed be fostered. Amendment 41: The Parliament wanted to add a reference to \u2018 reconciling work and family life \u2019 also to Article 8(3); the Council considers this superfluous, as the text has already been added elsewhere in the text. Amendment 47 on the Forum: The Council did not consider it necessary to include a reference to \u2018 an annual forum to evaluate the Social agenda and the Programme \u2019 in Article 9 (i.e. in the Article on Types of actions). A new Article 19(4) includes several of the ideas contained in this amendment, whilst not taking on board the requirements to organise the Forum annually and to use it to eval- uate the Programme. Amendment 52 on the Social Agenda. As the amended version of Article 1 already includes refer- ences to the Lisbon strategy and to the Social Agenda, the Council considers it superfluous to intro- duce a new paragraph on this issue under Article 9. Amendments 58 and 68 on the budgetary procedure: These amendments have become redundant now that all the Programme's funding is distributed between the different sections. See also Section III, point 1. IV. CONCLUSION The Council considers that, as a whole, the Common Position is in line with the objectives of the Commission's amended proposal. The Council also considers that it has taken account of the objectives pursued by the European Parliament in its amendments to the original Commission proposal. 3.10.2006 C 238E/41 Official Journal of the European Union EN "
