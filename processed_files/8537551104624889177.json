        "1 Executive Summary The present study deals with the growth potential of an integrated EU Urban Agenda. The objective of the study is to demonstrate the growth impact of the most pressing urban policies through business cases. The main policies which have been highlighted in the study are related to the main urban challenges namely: climate change, demographic change, and migration causing the need for more resource efficiency and energy saving, social security and health systems reforms, labour force mobility and flexible integration of migrations. Different policies are contributing to the interventions addressing those problems and needs in urban areas triggered by urban challenges. When addressing urban needs it is necessary to understand that cities are not unified territorial areas and do not follow a single path of logic but are confronted with different contextual factors shaping their character and needs. Beside global challenges and different contextual aspects urban management is exposed to different political and governmental levels where local and regional authorities do have limited power to significantly change and address urban conflicts. Local and regional authorities are facing sectoral policies defined at mostly national levels and EU level. Although there is a general agreement that integrated initiatives including several policy areas as well as multi-level governance are more suitable to solve social, economic and environmental problems, there is still a gap between the need to shift towards the integrated approach and the actual historically driven sectoral policy reality. At EU level, only the cohesion policy explicitly addresses urban areas. The specific aspect of c ohesion policy support is the integrated approach addressed in each Operational Programme (OP). However the cohesion policy tools seem to be over ambitious and are implemented only to a small extend. Nevertheless cohesion policy programmes still integrate the urban aspect with using urban related investment priorities in ERDF. One important instrument for cities and urban areas is the URBACT programme. Additional platforms serve as knowhow exchange and cooperation platforms again overextending the sources of local administrations. The mix of different programmes and tools demonstrates the complexity local authorities are acting in. Not only the national administrative hierarchies as well as the position of urban areas are of importance but also the availability of financial sources and the need to involve all stakeholders . ",
        "2 At Member State level urban policies are even less represented. A stronger focus lies in those Member States with a high extend of urban areas. Most Member States focus on regional development and allow the regional administrations a certain self-governments without any specific focus on cities and urban areas. The conclusion out of the facts stated in the study is that the current administrative structures do not adequately respond to the changes caused by global challenges. The current policy nature itself does not easily support a sustainable and integrated approach and the need to trigger a change is necessary. In this respect it is not enough to establish top down sectoral policies at EU level but to better serve the integrated approach top down and bottom up. The EU Urban Agenda therefore not only has the task to coordinate different actors and actions. It also needs to trigger a change to address the most pressing urban challenges. The EU Urban Agenda has to seek for respecting the contextual differences of cities and urban areas but need to seek for homogeneous key parameters to pressing challenges across Europe. Furthermore it needs to empower cities and urban authorities to follow an integrated approach towards climate change, social and demographic changes individually. When it comes to the growth impact of the most pressing urban policies, the study reveals that almost all policies do have a significant growth impact however not in all cases local authorities do have the power for changing. Based on that four business cases had been elaborated with one additional horizontal case. Those business cases are built around the most important policies with the highest impact at local level. Policies areas of the defined business cases: \uf06e Urban economy (policies: culture, public amenities, ICT networks education, RTDI, business development). \uf06e Resource efficiency (policies: public procurement, zoning and land use, waste &water management, urban transport, energy efficiency, education). \uf06e Social fabric (policies: education, housing, health and social care, social security). \uf06e Transport is considered as a transversal theme for urban areas. \uf06e Modern urban governance is understood in a broad sense as the capacity to administer and govern the urban territory over cross-sector coordination implementing participatory approaches and more open forms of government in order to attract the interest of a diverse society. ",
        "3 The EU Urban Agenda should not only serve as another strategy paper but should provide already concrete thematic initiatives to support local and regional authorities. In this respect it is most important to acknowledge the limits and possibilities of cities in implementing new approaches. Considering the facts of different levels of power and influence as well as scarce financial sources, the EU Urban Agenda needs to be a multi-dimensional vehicle. On the one hand it has to function bottom up and top down and on the other hand serving as a platform for soft infrastructure (information networks, educational infrastructures and STI) as well as hard infrastructure (project on transport, waste and water management, housing and site development). Figure 1. Simplified EU Urban Agenda model Source: Metis GmbH. Within the EU Urban Agenda logic including the four plus one business cases the following recommendations are developed: \uf06e There is a need to establish a more holistic and cross cutting approach of European policies . Ideally an assessment of the urban potential in all EU policies could be the basis to adapt the implementation tools towards a more urban related approach. \uf06e The EU Urban Agenda should include key parameters in order to enable local authorities to act towards the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. In this respect the EU Urban Agenda should provide guidelines Policy coordination Key parameter (cases) Indicators Individual approaches and projects contextual driven Urban Agenda Cross border Interaction and cooperation Capacity building Research Hardware Software ",
        "4 for Member States authorities to establish regulative parameter regarding legislation, infrastructure and financial sources. \uf06e The currently elaborated reference documents and reports to the BATs (Best Available Techniques) are the basis for the indicators which should be adjusted according to their use in the related business cases. The indicators as well as the research results should be translated to for local authorities in order to allow them to monitor the implementation. \uf06e The business cases defined in the study need further input and exchange between experts in order to provide a stable platform for integrated action at local level. The CoR in this respect could overtake the leading role of conducting the working groups . \uf06e The EU Urban Agenda should be an interactive tool helping local actors to choose the right interventions and enter new paths . Therefore the EU Urban Agenda should be more than a paper but an interactive lively platform. \uf06e The European Commission has recently published several cross sectoral agendas which do have a considerable impact on urban areas and politics. These EU agendas and strategies should be communicating vessels rather than independent parallel initiatives. This interaction needs to be supported actively by the CoR. \uf06e There are several networks and learning platforms existing but the mere number reduces efficiency and impact. There needs to be one well conducted platform which helps to filter the most important aspects of each project and the value added for other cities. The platform could be conducted or organised by the CoR. \uf06e The EU Urban Agenda should support the metropolitan regional governance across administrative borders in an apolitical context across administrative borders. Local authorities need to understand that functional leadership is going to be the future role rather than political agents. The role of the bridge between local authorities and the EU Urban Agenda needs to be adopted by the CoR. \uf06e The CoR could be agent to assure that a coherent and effective capacity building process is established in order to translate the complexity of integrated urban development.

        "5 1 Introduction The study on the growth potential of an integrated EU Urban Agenda should provide a new impetus to the work of the Committee of the Regions (CoR) and its members in the urban policy debates at European level. The concept of an integrated EU Urban Agenda should be used as a basis for further discussion. The objective of the study is to demonstrate the potential growth impact of an urban policy at European level. The study builds a case for dedicated policy action since: \uf06e cities and agglomeration areas in the European Union are on the rise in terms of population numbers and economic production 1 and \uf06e policy developments in cities and agglomeration areas are crucial in terms of sustainable development encompassing its three dimensions: economic, environmental and social development. The perspective of local and regional authorities (LRA) and the possibilities of a stronger involvement of European cities in the future governance system is a crucial element: LRAs are the obvious target group of an EU Urban Agenda and should become its key actors. A very brief historical perspective presents the main roots of European cities considering their particular importance for growth: \uf06e Trade, handicrafts and the rise of urban citizenship. \uf06e Industrial revolution \u2013 industrial raw materials, transport networks, mass- migration from rural areas. \uf06e Rise of the tertiary sector and move from resource-based to information- and knowledge based industries shapes the third wave of urban development \u2013 this is now part of a global development. In addition to long-term private and public investments as well as location-based skills, historical circumstances often determine a city\u2019s position in global networks 2 . In particular small and medium-sized cities benefit not only from a good geographical embeddedness but also from their architectural heritage and 1 European Commission, DG Regional Policy 2011, Cities of Tomorrow.

A future EU Urban Agenda should meet many of the aspects that provide the basis for the contents of this study: 3 First and foremost, an integrated EU Urban Agenda should contribute to a better understanding of the urban context in European policies. The focus should be on small and medium-sized towns and rural areas just the same as on large cities. The present study will therefore review and briefly outline the major urban challenges, trends and policy responses in chapter 2. These take into account the diversity of the type and size of cities. When it comes to strengthening cities\u2019 engagement and ownership of EU and national policymaking and implementation, instruments to better involve cities and their political leaders in EU policymaking and policy implementation will be addressed. This will be done by highlighting the cross-cutting role of LRAs in transversal challenges. An EU Urban Agenda shall ensure a strengthened awareness for urban development policies in EU development aid policies. References and benchmarking to global development trends and challenges such as demographic change, climate change and migration will be tackled for this purpose. The EU Urban Agenda should provide a framework to bring coherence to a diversity of initiatives and policies and to mobilise stakeholders . Addressing city challenges, mainly the gap between the growing demand for services and the lack of financial resources requires a review of sectoral policies that also take the role of national and sub-national governments (LRAs) into account. Main policy levers, major initiatives and their purpose are therefore analysed in chapter 3. Local challenges are the regeneration of run-down urban areas, urban rehabilitation and renovation and energy efficiency in building construction, for example. They offer considerable potentialities to link public investment strategies for rehabilitation works with job growth and are discussed as important potentialities through coordinated policies. The contribution to a better coordination of policies and between urban and its surrounding areas (including cross-border urban areas) is the key question addressed in the business cases (chapter 4). An EU Urban Agenda should explore and support new models of governance in a long-term view (always cross-border) with local communities being directly involved in decision- making. The business case was built along the main policy fields of an EU 3 Main aspects to be addressed by an EU Urban Agenda are taken from COM(2014) 490 Final, CdR 6902/2013 and CdR 650/2012. ",
        "7 Urban Agenda and thus outlines the context of growth in which an EU Urban Agenda should be embedded. Four key intervention areas include the relevant policy fields detected earlier and result in the presentation of a modern urban governance case. Urban governance should function as a driver in social integration and empowerment of citizens, challenging people to take part in a participatory society. New approaches to governance with best practice examples are reflected. The role of different actors in modern urban governance is highlighted and therefore new approaches to strengthen the awareness for holistic local development is presented. This shall bring EU policymaking closer to the citizens and adopt an integrated approach. The required support of cities\u2019 capacities for transition and structural change will be tackled by presenting best practice examples at various points in the present study . They show approaches to address major challenges, e.g. energy efficiency in buildings and passive housing or the rehabilitation of industrial sides. ",

        "9 2 Cities and agglomerations as drivers of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth 2.1 Performance of European cities Beside the really large metropolitan regions London and Paris, most of Europe consists of a polycentric urban system . The typical European city is a city between 500,000 and 4 million inhabitants, a city that is large enough to justify a good range of urban amenities and to have a genuine urban environment, but without the disadvantages of the new global mega-cities that are emerging. At a smaller scale, there are also a great number of cities of below 500,000 that generally lack a true metropolitan quality, and which are usually less significant in international terms (see Figure 2). Their importance at the national level largely depends upon the size of the country and its political system. 4 Figure 2. Total resident population in the Urban Audit core cities, 2011 Source: Eurostat, 2011. 4 European Parliament (2014), The Role of Cities in the Cohesion Policy 2014-2020, Metis, EPRC. ",
        "10 Companies and universities located in cities encourage residents to invest in human capital and knowledge spillovers, which in turn make cities the main centres for research and development activities , patent applications and venture capital. R&D expenditures positively influence businesses, the public sector, higher-educational institutions and the private non-profit sector. However, expenditures on research and innovation considerably vary across the EU Member States. In Finland, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom as well as in the capital regions of Denmark and France, investments exceed the Europe 2020 target of 3% of GDP. Also capital regions of less developed EU Member States outperform their national levels of investment for Research and Innovation. As a longer-term process, innovation appears to have a positive effect on regional growth only after five years. Innovation is a strongly localised element although agglomeration advantages tend to positively influence growth in neighbouring cities and regions. 5 75% of the EU\u2019s metropolitan areas outperform the rest of the country \u2013 a trend that is specifically recognised in Central and Eastern European major cities. Metropolitan GDP growth in Europe between 2000 and 2010 was up to 4% with the highest values in cities in Luxemburg, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia, Estonia and Greece, followed by metropolitan areas in Northern and Western European countries 6 . Research indicates an almost linear dependency of a city\u2019s population size and its average labour productivity. OECD studies suggest an increase of productivity by 2-5% for a doubling in population size that is reasoned in greater competition, deeper labour markets and a high share of highly educated people in larger cities, \u201cbut also due to a faster spread of ideas and a more diverse intellectual and entrepreneurial environment\u201d 7 . On the one hand, a dense labour market allows for better matching of workers\u2019 skills and the requirements of firms. 8 On the other hand, incentives to acquire new skills are even greater where workers face more prospective employers 9 . European metropolitan regions show different patterns depending on their size and location. In general, GDP per head in metropolitan regions is higher than in other regions although growth rates do not reflect this picture 10 .

Paris: OECD Publishing, p. 1. 8 Helsley and Strange 1990. 9 Matouschek and Rober-Nicoud, 2005. 10 Between 2000 and 2011, GDP per head grew faster in non-metropolitan regions in Germany, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Portugal and Spain (sixth report on economic, social and territorial cohesion, 2014). ",
        "11 regions in Europe grew despite the crisis because of higher productivity growth in the EU-15 and higher employment growth in the EU-13. However, between 2000 and 2008, GDP per head in second-tier metropolitan regions was equal to the national level or \u2013 in the case of smaller metropolitan regions in the EU-13 \u2013 even below the level of non-metropolitan regions. The tendency of higher investment in capital regions and lower investment in second-tier cities assisted these patterns and therefore should be reversed. A tailored and place-based development policy taking explicit account of the different territorial impact of national policies is therefore also recommended by the European Commission. 11 Economic winners of urbanisation can be reduced to three dominant groups worldwide 12 : \u201cEmerging Cities (fast growing middle income cities in countries such as China and India), Global Megacities (middle and higher income cities with populations over 10 million) and Mature Cities (higher income cities where carbon emissions per capita are already high).\u201d Except London, which also belongs to the second group, the latter group includes bigger European cities. Those cities will experience significant urban change mostly determined either by population growth and or by decline and thus different growth rates in their major economic sectors can be expected. It must be borne in mind that mature cities have a substantial contribution to global economic growth. Cities offer opportunities and access to cultural amenities such as a vibrant culture and historical sites as well as recreational sides. A variety in goods and services and a high quality and variety of specialised services , such as medical services or educational institutions, improve the cities\u2019 well-being. According to the OECD, larger cities, in general, are more productive because of greater competition, deeper and well-functioning labour markets (resulting in better matching of workers and jobs), faster spread of ideas and a more diverse intellectual and entrepreneurial environment. For Europe and the United States, this was proved by comparing the average labour productivity with the number of persons living in big metropolitan areas: the bigger the size of cities the higher the average labour productivity . 13 Non-pecuniary costs such as congestion and long commutes, air pollution from traffic and industrial production, which mostly occurs in large cities, must be taken into account although they are not covered by comparable statistical 11 European Commission 2014a, sixth report on economic, social and territorial cohesion; Parkinson et al. 2012. 12 Floater, G. et al, 2014, Cities and the New Climate Economy: the transformative role of global urban growth.

        "12 analysis. The policy objective to limit traffic flows occurring as a result of urban sprawl does not have deep evidence and is often not efficiently implemented, e.g. through correct pricing of negative externalities of fossil fuel- based individual transport or taxes and regulatory policies. Public transport and road network determine the area that can be reached within a reasonable amount of travel time. Proximity (time-wise, not distance-wise) to other cities has a positive effect on growth. The density of European urban systems leads to broader agglomeration benefits such as positive spillovers on productivity levels suggesting that inter-urban trade and linkages play an important role in regional growth. Moreover, a good connection to global markets facilitates the capacities to innovate. Cities perform well when local actors in a regional innovation system can communicate easily with each other. 14 An ageing population as well as international migration has considerable implications on the demographic structure of cities. Moreover, social exclusion and segregation of certain social groups (immigrants, ethnic minorities and/or young people from low-income households) tend to increase globally. A spatial stratification along socio-economic dimensions , i.e. poor and wealthy neighbourhoods with different levels of public service provision, accessibility and unequal access to education can lead to self-perpetuating patterns of inequality. On the other hand, the provision of infrastructure should be backed by adequate levels of human capital and innovation. OECD analyses reveal that the positive impact of infrastructure on regional growth occurs time-delayed. In addition, more developed Member States such as Austria, Belgium, France, Portugal and the United Kingdom tend to have a higher unemployment rate in cities than in the rest of the country. On the other hand, urban areas in less developed EU Member States, e.g. in Latvia, Bulgaria, Poland and Romania, have higher employment rates and average incomes than in rural areas of small towns. 15 2.2 Challenges related to urban policies Out of a total of 90,000 local and regional authorities, 89,000 represents the local government level, i.e. municipalities, towns or cities with the remainder representing the regional level. Roughly one third of all public expenditure in the EU is spent by local and regional authorities, which accounts for 14 OECD 2015, The Metropolitan Century: Understanding Urbanisation and its Consequences, OECD Publishing, Paris. 15 OECD 2015, The Metropolitan Century: Understanding Urbanisation and its Consequences, OECD Publishing, Paris. ",
        "13 \u20ac2,100 billion a year. Regarding public investment in the EU the expenditures of local and regional authorities even make up 70% of all public investment in the EU. 16 The density of cities provides economic changes as well as social economic challenges. Going against the general trend of growth, some cities, which have previously experienced industrial growth in the 70s and 80s, are now facing challenges of out-migration and population decline. Older industrialised cities characterised by the former coal or steel industry, experienced population decline even earlier. The so-called shrinking cities 17 face other types of challenges requiring different approaches in governance. Meeting all these challenges and turning them into opportunities depends on effective city governance. Moreover, challenges related to any functional and administrative area have a transversal character that includes diverse policy fields and actors. 2.2.1 Challenges for urban Governance A city\u2019s economic strength also depends on the efficiency and effectiveness of its governance structure. The important question is how governments can manage the growth of cities capturing the benefits of productivity and growth but at the same time reducing economic, social and environmental costs. A poorly managed city tends to cause costs of urban poverty, pollution and carbon emissions, i.e. traffic congestion, inefficient public transport, air pollution with its associated health impacts, depletion of natural resources as well as an inadequate infrastructure for basic services such as energy, water and waste18. A growing demand in industrialised countries against resource constraints (including energy, water, raw materials and food commodities) has to be tackled in order to avoid further increasing economic, social and environmental costs.

        "14 Challenges Policy responses and aspects of coordination resulting from demographic change and migration Strengthening local assets and resources rather than depending on support from the national government facilitates regional growth. The ability to create a well-educated population has important implications for productivity levels. The share of highly educated people tends to be larger in bigger cities. Therefore productivity effects of the city size and human capital can reinforce each other. Investments in tertiary education take about three years to positively influence growth. Uncontrolled urban sprawl as the major challenge from an environmental perspective Strategies and regulatory policies based on zoning, housing, transport policies (infrastructure and regulation), recycling of land, new offers in terms of compact settlement areas. Shrinkage (of secondary cities with an industrial past) Strategies for maintaining basic public amenities in a cost-efficient way, local employment initiatives. Individuals benefit from living in well-functioning (large) cities that attract and retain well-educated and talented people. Thus the exploitation of the innovation potential in cities puts Europe\u2019s potential for innovation into practice. The digital agenda presented by the European Commission as one of the seven pillars of the Europe 2020 Strategy proposes to better exploit the potential of information and communication technologies (ICT). Innovation, economic growth and progress should be acquired by improving Europe\u2019s digital infrastructure. Environmental degradation including air pollution and noise emission, climate change, water and habitat loss Adaptation and mitigation strategies based on recycling and rehabilitation of land, investment in environmental infrastructure combined with employment initiatives and education, empowerment and capacity building of local administrative units: \uf06e key role of EU initiatives and programmes through initiating, promoting and connecting relevant approaches across Europe; \uf06e Europe 2020 objective of achieving sustainable growth: enhancing resource efficiency and help the EU prosper through low-carbon economic and urban development, greater water efficiency, use of waste as a resource, promotion of renewable energies and more efficient energy supply systems. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by promoting cleaner and more sustainable modes of public transport including raising awareness on part of the citizens need to be tailored to local conditions. The main EU funds however, focus on the infrastructure in less developed cities and regions. ",

Sectoral focus of policies Support to initiatives of cities (raising their visibility; awareness- raising through urban flagship initiatives). Fostering policy models which require a certain level of horizontal coordination such as EU cohesion policy. An integrated political vision of good governance seeks to make urban centres attractive by exploring the potential of architectural heritage and culture and thus facilitating a sense of identity and feeling of belonging to a city. For instance, green policies encouraging mixed- use and energy saving tend to have fewer negative effects on economic growth at the local level than at the national level. The way in which a city is organised influences its social, environmental and economic sustainability.

        "16 2.2.2 New transversal challenges and their role in policy formation Recent and most important transversal challenges for urban areas are climate change, demographic change and immigration driven by conflicts and wars around Europe. Crucial features of these transversal challenges are: \uf06e The dynamics and impacts are characterised by their long lasting effects which clearly exceed the time spans of the political cycles and the responses are often considered as unpopular by politicians at all levels. \uf06e Their nature clearly exceeds the scope of local and regional policy approaches. However, consequences are first and foremost felt at local level, e.g. the local incidence of climate change for cities in mountainous areas or certain cities, which have become gateways to Europe for unprecedented numbers of refugees. Such challenges call for reactions albeit the recent past has shown that policy formation takes significant time and diverging interests often reduce the reaction to compromises without visible effects in a short- to mid-term horizon. This is demonstrated impressively in the case of climate action and will be increasingly observed for the other two transversal challenges if policy formation continues in the same way. The urban dimension of these challenges is in most cases multifaceted: \uf06e With regards to climate change the role of cities when striving for increased resource efficiency is essential. On the other hand, resilient cities need effective adaptation strategies . \uf06e Considering the effects of demographic change , large cities tend to be the winners in general. In many Member States there are particular areas where secondary cities have suffered from massive outmigration and thus are trapped in vicious cycles (in particular those with an industrial past that failed to transform the industrial basis successfully). \uf06e Migration has always been essential for urban areas. Recent immigration however causes massive local incidence since large conurbations are key to recent refugee policy. 19 19 UNHCR Global Trends, A Year of crises, annual report 2011: Refugees, displaced and asylum-seekers end up in urban areas of other countries. At global scale, more than half of all refugees end up in individual ",
        "17 All three recent transversal challenges are further influenced by a lack of convincing policy responses. Role of cities when striving for resource efficiency and adaptation Striving for resource efficiency 20 is an overarching policy aim. An effective and efficient policy approach calls for the integration of several traditional policy areas. However, there is not yet a clear-cut and widely acknowledged approach to it. On the contrary, manifold terms hint at the diversity of approaches and understandings such as the concept of a circular economy, green economy and green growth. 21 Targets are set most commonly for waste, energy use and efficiency as well as for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Policy approaches might comprise economy-wide strategies, sectoral strategies and action plans, resource-specific or product-oriented strategies or plans. Moreover, climate change intensifies vulnerabilities and challenges faced by European cities against the background of developments such as demographic change, technological advances and economic transitions. Energy imports equalling \u20ac400 billion p.a. in the EU 22 raise energy prices and the need to increase energy efficiency which is labelled as the most efficient approach to reduce the costs. Policies and markets guiding energy efficiency investments are relatively new and their impacts can be expected only in a long- term perspective. ESIF 2014-2020 funding and revenues from the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) complement but also initiate the use of national energy efficiency funds, energy efficiency obligations and the long-term strategy of national building renovation. 23 The first-ever universal and legally binding global climate agreement was set in December 2015 at the Paris climate conference (COP21). For diverse action accommodations which mostly concentrate in urban areas. Recent newspaper articles confirm this trend also for Europe during the recent wave of immigration: http://fortune.com/2015/09/08/europe-refugee-crisis- spain/; https://www.opencanada.org/features/view-from-europe-how-cities-are-key-to-refugee-policy/. 20 EEA 2011 p. 9: so far there is no definition of resource efficiency and a lot of terms are being used in connection with the overarching objective. Resources are in many Member States mainly understood as raw materials, often the term sustainable use of natural resources is being used. The most frequently mentioned focus areas are energy, waste, minerals & raw materials and water. 21 EEA 2011, p. 9: a quite advanced perspective has been taken in Sweden by defining strategic objectives on the global environmental impact of national consumption patterns. 22 Cf. EEFIG, 2015, p. 4. 23 As requested in the Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, article 20, 7 and 4. ",
        "18 fields such as mitigation, transparency and global stocktake, adaptation, loss and damage and national support defined targets were set and agreed on by all 195 involved countries. EU\u2019s action areas are focussed on curbing greenhouse gas emissions in all areas of its activities, i.e. more efficient use of less polluting energy, cleaner and more balanced transport options, more environmentally- friendly land-use and agriculture, more sustainable and resilient cities, fewer emissions from all sectors of our economy, and financings for climate action . 24 By dedicating at least 20% of its entire budget from 2014-2020 to climate- related actions , the EU has demonstrated its commitments to achieving the EU\u2019s climate objectives. Project focusing on mitigation, adaptation and better governance in the 2014-2020 period will be financed under the LIFE programme (the EU\u2019s Programme for the Environment and Climate Action) with \u20ac864 million. 25 Moreover, international initiatives in developing countries outside the EU support adaptation and mitigation, e.g. the Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA), co-funded by the ERDF. A considerable contribution is also made by the EIB whose 2014 to 2016 Corporate Operational Plan sets an annual target of over 25% of finance directed to climate action as well as by privately financed EU Regional Investment Facilities 26 and Public Private Partnerships such as the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund (GEEREF). 27 From the perspective of the EU Urban Agenda and the LRAs as key actors, the following policy fields are most important in terms of increased resource efficiency and urban adaptation to climate change: \uf06e Infrastructure: energy, waste, water, transport, ICTs, STI; \uf06e Soft elements: education (contents), governance, instruments to influence consumption patterns. Infrastructure ranks probably among the most immediate and most important policy levers from the perspective of LRAs. One has to consider that in all these fields several policy levels (LRAs, national, EU) play a vital role (cf. table 6). In 24 European Commission, DG Climate Action, Towards the Paris Protocol, http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/paris_protocol/index_en.htm. 25 LIFE is the EU\u2019s financial instrument supporting environmental, nature conservation and climate action projects throughout the EU since 1992. 26 The EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund (ITF), the Neighbourhood Investment Facility (NIF), the Latin America Investment Facility (LAIF), the Investment Facility for Central Asia (IFCA), the East Asia Investment Facility (AIF), the Caribbean Investment Facility (CIF) and the Investment Facility for the Pacific (IFP). 27 European Commission DG Climate Action, Financing, http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/paris_protocol/finance/index_en.htm. ",
        "19 the end policy integration is multi-faceted and would require incentives for horizontal integration of these policy fields at all levels but also vertical integration across the policy levels. The obvious and foremost challenge from the perspective of LRAs is the financing of infrastructure . Inherent challenges for infrastructure development include the following: \uf06e Higher standards stemming from regulatory policies and directives in these fields make infrastructure more complex and expensive. Moreover they necessitate public investment in STI which leads to an increased investment need. \uf06e Shortages in public funds increase the need for new financing models. However, most financing models in these fields require a stable framework and public support in order to attract private actors. As a consequence, environmentally sustainable solutions on these policy fields will not work without public support. Renewable energies are hardly an alternative for traditional forms of energy production in urban areas except for small-scale pilots or facilities in innovative buildings. This is also due to the fact that current carbon prices have little effect on steering investment towards energy efficiency in industry or buildings. A combination of heat and energy production from facilities such as waste incineration plants should be the preferred option. Box 1. Energy efficiency of buildings The efficiency of buildings is one of the key fields of intervention for several reasons: \uf06e The main energy-saving potential can be found in the building sector since 40% of EU\u2019s energy consumption is coming from buildings 28 . Nevertheless, it increases by only 1.4% p.a. which is due to the low renovation rate of existing buildings. 29 \uf06e The implementation of programmes that boost the renovation rate is also a major driver for job growth since the building sector is characterised by SMEs and the renovation of buildings in particular is 28 cf. COM on Energy Efficiency, 2014, p. 12; 90% of buildings are privately owned. 29 An accelerated renovation rate would require a bundle of measures consisting of regulatory approaches (i.e. setting standards) and massive incentives to leverage private funding, and support to emerging energy service markets, e.g. by performance contracting. ",
        "20 labour-intensive. \uf06e For typical urban commercial building zones, such as shopping malls or large-scale office areas development, investment decisions are often based on short time-horizons and approaches to facility management have become increasingly diversified. A segmentation of the building market is required when developing effective approaches. The EU\u2019s main legislation regarding the reduction of energy consumption of buildings are the 2010 Performance of Buildings Directive 30 and the 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive 31 . Resulting from weak data availability on energy performance of buildings for urban areas, an urban impact assessment (UIA) was implemented in order to determine the environmental, social, governance and economic effects as a result of the implementation of the first Directive 32 . As an example, the impact of the Directive as estimated during the experts\u2019 workshop will be presented for two significant judgements: \uf06e About 16% of the metropolitan regions could gain a very high and 79% a high positive impact on employment in the construction sector. \uf06e The level of national implementation influences the transferability of renovation costs to tenants and therefore the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Where renovation is financed by private persons, costs will more likely be transferred than if renovation is financed through tax incentives, public financing and other measures alleviating the financial burden on the private owners. The main important outcome of the assessment was the fact that the different implementation of the Directive in the Member States highly influenced its impact on urban areas. For example in some Member States, the national legislation prevented the energy efficient renovation of the city\u2019s housing stock. In some cases taxes even increased as a result of an increased value of the building after the renovation. Another important issue is the ownership of buildings. For example a mixed ownership structure of a building (private and public) makes an agreement on renovation difficult and results in considerable delays in reconstruction. 30 Directive 2010/31/EU on the Energy performance of buidings. 31 Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency. 32 European Commission, Committee of the Regions and ESPON, Urban Impact Assessment based on ESPON TIA Quick Scan tool, Energy performance of buildings Directive, draft version 04/12 provided by the CoR (04.12.2015); the report represents the views and experiences of the cities participating in the workshop held on 11.11.2015.

        "21 In order to trigger developments and to shorten the return on investment, public incentives are needed. The key supply side instruments are standardisation, i.e. with the aid of building regulations and performance certificates and regulatory stability. For the latter, long-term national, regional or local programmes could act as a stabilising element in order to attract the interest of actors (supply and demand). Further actions comprise e.g. the development of a project rating system in order to assess projects or innovative approaches to financing such as on-bill repayment or on-tax finance mechanisms, including energy costs in mortgage affordability calculations 33 . For 25 years Energy Cities, the European Association of local authorities in energy transition , has supported a locally-led energy transition. The platform includes more than 1,000 member cities in 30 European countries that share experience and learn from each other in order to replicate success. In addition, the association bundles interests and influences EU policies in the fields of energy, environmental protection and urban policy. Soft elements that are closely linked to urban development stretch from short- to mid- to long-term impacts. Demographic change and the migration balance decides whether a region is subject to or is trapped in a vicious cycle. Additionally, climate challenges resulting from flooding, heatwaves, water scarcity and coastal impacts for cities in vulnerable locations require proactive adaptation strategies that enhance urban resilience that include: 34 \uf06e Awareness raising of the importance of urban adaptation. \uf06e Improving the knowledge base. \uf06e Capacity building in cities. \uf06e Processing an EU Adaptation Strategy. Cities addressing demographic changes Urban regions tend to be less affected by the adverse impacts of demographic change , i.e. an ageing population. From a territorial perspective capital regions and agglomeration areas tend to report population growth based on pull-factors in terms of increasing employment opportunities. The process is expected to put a heavy strain on social security and health care systems and thus will also influence the future public economies in urban regions simply owing to the fact that urban population is expected to reach about 33 EEFIG, p. 7. 34 EC, DG Climate 2013, Adaptation Strategies for European Cities. ",
        "22 80% of the EU\u2019s population in the coming decade. Furthermore one has to see that besides growing regions there also exist regions that decline by losing population, for instance some regions with second- and third-tier cities in Europe. Moreover major societal changes are strongly interconnected with the phenomenon of demographic change. One marked trend is the rise of single- person households as a consequence of changing lifestyle, economic developments and also longevity (of women). According to Eurostat in 2011 almost one third of all EU households have been single households. The phenomenon is particularly marked in capital regions, e.g. in Berlin and Brussels (accounting for almost half of all households) and large urban regions. Another phenomenon is a high share of lone-parent families in and around major conurbations. These trends have obvious implications for the urban housing market. The most striking phenomenon of demographical change is the ageing of population \u2013 a process that has been ongoing for several decades. Thriving urban regions have a comparatively better situation since the job opportunities attract younger work force (pull-factors for migration at all levels). As a result, an increasingly difficult situation can be observed for second- or third-tier cities in regions which have experienced enduring out-migration. These cities tend to be trapped in vicious cycles but still are vital as centres for the declining regions. Table 2 presents needs and necessary measures at the level of Member States and of LRAs. Table 2. Needs resulting from an ageing population at MS and at LRA level Challenges for MS Challenges for LRAs \uf06e Measures in favour of higher birth rates (e.g. the economic crisis has had a negative effect on fertility rates in many MS). \uf06e Need to restructure / rebuild social security systems in times of increasing budgetary pressure. \uf06e Need for incentive schemes to foster the adjustment of the housing stock (with a view to support for low-income households such as lone-parents or elderly single-person households). \uf06e Increasing need for cost-efficient care facilities for elderly citizens since tight public budgets do not allow for proportional increases of expenditure in the coming decades.

        "23 According to Eurostat 35 in the period 2008-2012 the population change \u2013 understood as the net balance between natural growth and migration \u2013 revealed that the majority of regions with highest growth rates have been in or around urban regions. 36 This trend is globally set to continue until 2030 although the main urbanisation increase occurs in developing countries. \u201cEurope\u2019s urban population as a percentage of the global total is likely to have shrunk considerably 37 \u201d. Nevertheless, a qualitative growth effect can be observed in terms of the labour force in Europe. The EU2020 target of 40% of the cohort aged 30 to 34 completing tertiary education will likely be achieved by many EU Member States. 38 The regions which have suffered the most marked losses are spread in an arc from many regions in southern countries such as Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece as well as inland regions of Spain and Portugal to Hungary and Eastern Germany and parts of Lithuania and Latvia in the Baltic Region. These are mostly rather rural and peripheral regions. The key element of population change at the regional level in the EU is migration \u2013 the regional patterns of net-benefitting and net-loosing regions are almost identical to the patterns of gains and losses stemming from net migration at a regional level. Thus, the following challenges result for Member States and LRAs: \uf06e The key factor to buffer the adverse effects of demographic change is migration that cannot be regulated within Member States or within the EU but is driven by push- and pull-factors. \uf06e Countries with fiscal equalisation mechanisms such as Austria and Germany use population numbers as a key indicator. Therefore favouring urban regions with higher support means implicitly favouring concentration. \uf06e It will be difficult for declining regions to reverse push factors and the impact of enduring periods of out-migration. Labour force mobility within the EU increased gradually up until the financial and economic crisis, largely driven by income and wage differentials. At first 35 Eurostat 2014, Regional Statistical Yearbook 2014. 36 cf. Eurostat 2014: the highest increases in absolute terms have been reported for Barcelona, Madrid, Stockholm, Berlin, Brussels and Seville. 37 ESPAS 2013, The Global Economy in 2030: Trends and Strategies for Europe, p. 12. 38 ESPAS 2013, The Global Economy in 2030: Trends and Strategies for Europe, p. 10. ",
        "24 this was to be observed between southern and northern EU Member States and more recently between eastern and western EU Member States. The effects of the crisis initially resulted in a reduction in labour mobility \u2013 as employment opportunities dried up \u2013 and has for the last couple of years been increasingly driven by growing unemployment differentials, principally between members of the euro area. Labour mobility next to job opportunities is also strongly driven by the housing market \u2013 prices for housing will determine migratory movements and commuter flows to and around urban regions. The following challenges result for Member States as well as for LRAs: \uf06e Risk of crowding-out effects on regional labour markets, wage dumping; \uf06e Housing markets with high transaction costs might impede labour mobility and can therefore act as limiting factors in growth areas or as an impeding factor in the process of out-migration (or even economic transition). Urban in- and out-migration 39 Throughout history migration has been essential for the growth of cities. The major persistent element has been the move from rural to urban areas which had been essential ever since the start of urbanisation in Europe. In the 19 th and 20 th century industrialisation changed the scale of the phenomena, and in the second half of the 20 th century colonisation as well as rebuilding Europe in the aftermath of the war has added a new element: the increasing influx of migrants from other parts of the world. Statistics on population change in the EU clearly reveal capital regions, agglomeration areas and first-tier cities of the Member States as winners of the past two decades 40 . Population growth reflects the decisive pull-factors of growing job opportunities and the push-factors in declining regions. The patterns of population change are the key patterns pointing at the growing divide between prospering and declining regions. At the same time, they constitute a key indicator for the challenges related to EU cohesion policy. 39 European Commission 2015, COM (2015) final, A European Agenda on Migration, Brussels 2015. 40 As a consequence also within the agglomeration areas the dynamics are the highest: the NUTS-III region with the highest growth rate in the period 2009-2012 has been Ilfov, close to Bucarest \u2013 obviously a consequence of suburbanisation; strikingly two urban regions rank among those with the highest losses in absolute terms in the same period: the centres of Dublin and Athens \u2013 obviously a consequence of the economic crisis (cf. Eurostat, Regional Statistical Yearbook 2014). ",
        "25 Nevertheless, seeing urban regions as the winners would provide an incorrect picture of the developments. One can assume that the number of losers in this development process outweighs the number of winners. In the context of an EU Urban Agenda it must not be forgotten that second- and third-tier cities in declining regions are essential and become increasingly important as the cities might at least impede the process of decline. Since 1985 there is a net inflow of migrants to the EU 28 \u2013 the first peak has been reported for 2003 with a 1.8 million net increase. In the period 2008-2012 41 the general patterns of net migration at regional level reflect the patterns in population change which demonstrates the decisive role of net migration for population change. In this period the inflow of migrants 42 has been particularly marked in Southern France, Northern Italy, the Benelux countries and the United Kingdom. Net out-migration was especially pronounced for the Lithuanian regions except for the capital region and three German regions in Eastern Germany and Dublin \u2013 the latter most probably due to the economic crisis. Migration from non-EU nationals was relatively stable in the period 2010 to 2013. During these years, about 1.4 Mio. immigrants p.a. came from non-EU countries, but also reverse out-migration from EU countries occurred resulting in a net-migration of about 600,000 per year in the period 2010 to 2013. The top countries of origin have varied in this period. 43 The immigrants have been much younger than the resident population in the country of destination 44 . Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and France account for 76% of all non-EU-nationals with a share of 63% of the EU\u2019s population. During 2013, there were an estimated 1.7 million immigrants to the EU-28 from non-member countries . In addition, 1.7 million people previously residing in one EU Member State migrated to another Member State. 45 Owing to the fact that natural population change is close to zero across wide parts of Europe, migration within the Member States means de facto that some regions clearly loose inhabitants. 41 cf. Eurostat: Migration and migrant population statistics, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Migration_and_migrant_population_statistics. 42 Migration from national level, Member State and non-Member States. 43 Cf. Eurostat, 2014, Infographic: India, China and Morocco have been among the top-ranking countries in these years. 44 Eurostat: median average of the EU citizens is 42 years, median average age of the immigrants is 28 years. 45 Eurostat website: data on migration.

        "26 The migration policies of Member States differ to a huge extent which is documented e.g. in diverging acceptance rates for asylum seekers. There is also a trend to encourage skilled labour force to immigrate \u2013 this implicitly directs also the intended and controlled migration flows to urban centres. The main countries of origin in the recent immigration wave 2014/2015 have been Syria, Kosovo and Afghanistan. For the first time the magnitude of the waves of refugees and asylum seekers calls for action at European level. Despite the urgency of the call policy responses are reluctant and impeded by diverging interests. So far the intended target of the immigrants covers only a minority of Member States and within these countries the capital regions or first-tier cities due to a range of factors (job opportunities, relatives, migrant communities). Resettlement plans within the EU have not yet become effective. At Member State level they do exist but their implementation is difficult and overall burdening for involved actors.

The most diversified economies and resources in the sense of a knowledge based economy are concentrated in urban areas. Due to comparatively high wage levels, the economic pressure for increased productivity is particularly marked in urban regions. Urban growth will depend to a significant extent on the ability of urban economies to determine new development paths, to support the resilience and adaptability of their economic structures and to raise the profile of their STI institutions. One of the major approaches in this sense is smart specialisation. Among thirty other action points the Innovation Union contains the implementation of ground-breaking initiatives like the European Innovation Partnerships (EIP) . The new approach to EU research and innovation is ",
        "28 challenge-driven and focuses on societal benefits and modernisation of the associated sectors and markets. It further aims at bringing together relevant actors at EU, national and regional levels. 46 Smart urban technologies contribute to the sustainable development of European cities. The Smart Cities and Communities EIP (SCC) includes the areas of energy, transport and information and communication. It focuses on industry led innovation and promotes actions across the innovation cycle as well as across different sectors. It has the following objectives 47 : The European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities (EIP-SCC) brings together cities, industry and citizens to improve urban life through more sustainable integrated solutions. This includes applied innovation, better planning, a more participatory approach, higher energy efficiency, better transport solutions, intelligent use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), etc. Smart-city strategies offer technological solutions to link urban challenges, making use of ICTs to support new urban growth activities, linking together data to enhance sustainability such as using smart-grid technology or optimising public transport, and meeting the needs and challenges of social exclusion through a better and more intelligent provision of public services. 48 Yet such smart-city strategies need to be underpinned by effective and inclusive governance , as well as by changes in social behaviour that enable the full use of the new technologies. While cities develop more and more sustainable and smart strategies, this is not necessarily a guarantee for greener and more environmental friendly industrial production nor does it guarantee solutions for the urban challenges named above. There are two main reasons for this: \uf06e However smart a city is, its level of influence is limited if it does not own a considerable building stock.

Passive housing in Vienna \uf06e The city of Vienna has firmly established a status as pioneer in passive house standards. This is also possible due to the fact that one in four Viennese citizens live in municipal housing. Overall, the City of Vienna has built 220,000 municipal dwellings for half a million tenants and additionally subsidised the building of 200,000 affordable housing dwellings. 49 \uf06e Experience shows that some lessons are still to be learned. In Europe\u2019s biggest passive house settlement (information from 2013) in the centre of Vienna, the \u201cEurogate\u201d, the housing satisfaction leaves much to be desired. This is mainly to be traced back to poor construction quality and costs savings by the developer. For instance, hot indoor temperatures in summer and winter in the upper floors and cold indoor temperatures further down result from missing external blinds and an immature venting system that is not to be turned off. 50 \uf06e Here, the city should introduce stricter conditions, especially if the buildings are subsidised. Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3) or Triple Helix 51 (3H) refer to open but structured forms of strategic cooperation in order to support innovation and economic growth. The centre of gravity for S3 in the common definition and approach is the knowledge of market and business, its underlying trends and emerging patterns of users. The focus of S3/3H is on the process of shared strategy development and the facilitation of interaction between the main players. The approaches are intended as a dynamic process based on mutual understanding between the actors, interdisciplinary approaches and a sound process monitoring which allows for ongoing assessment of results and adjustment of the policy mix, programmes and action plans. The Strategies seek to actively involve the players and thus are 49 City of Vienna, Municipal Housing in Vienna.

        "30 often labelled as indigenous and bottom-up approaches: S3 is also viewed as one of the most important approaches in the sense of place-based development as set out in the Barca-Report. It is evident that this type of approach poses significant challenges for governance. Therefore, they will be defined in more detail in section 4.5 on urban governance. Specialisation \u2013 as reaction to rapid economic transformation The new strategies have to be understood as reaction to changes in economies: The knowledge and information embedded in products and services grows across all economic sectors and activities. It puts new demands on skills and specialisation, and leads companies into open innovation [\u2026] Routine activities tend to leave expensive cities for cheaper locations. Yet, this is a not about \u2018manufacturing versus services\u2019, but about the types of activities that are prone or not to routinisation. Paradoxically, there is an emerging trend of manufacturing resurgence in some European cities known as re-shoring (i.e. formerly off-shored production returning to Europe) and the production of small batches of specialised products. 52 The quickened pace of economic developments is owed to a significant extent to the diffusion of Key Enabling Technologies (KET) 53 , in particular ICT, in all sectors: Among the trends that affect the economies of Europe\u2019s cities, the digital revolution is the key game changer. It deeply impacts many sectors of the economy, it fundamentally changes how companies and people work and learn, and evokes entirely new business models. 54 There are obvious winners and losers of the rapid transformation process. For example, one has to think about the effects of e-commerce and e-services which allow for targeted services in mobility. Also accommodation or travel provided at low cost due to savings for rent of premises and marketing strategies become a challenge for established shops, car rentals and hotels. ICT as KET has also triggered the transformation of industries such as transportation or health, retail 52 Van Winden, de Carvalho 2015, p. 7. 53 KET as usually understood comprise next to ICT the following technologies: material technology, micro and nano electronics, photonics, biotechnology. 54 Van Winden, de Carvalho 2015, p. 8. ",
        "31 and specialised manufacturing. The digital economy is often viewed as a cradle of new entrepreneurship. 55 The effects of transformation become also visible in urban areas when thinking of derelict shops, temporary use of premises in office or shopping areas as well as rather open office communities for certain sectors such as the creative sector which combine cost savings with options for flexible use. An interesting model case for ICT acting as driver in development is the City Cluj in Romania. 56 Box 3. Cluj as a hub in IT The nucleus of the development has been the university which had been specialised in informatics even before the changes in the 90s of the last century. When the development of IT companies started and the IT sector grew, it became obvious that entrepreneurs were not satisfied with the quality of university graduates\u2019 skills. University rectors were ready and willing to adjust the curricula but requested the fragmented local IT industry to harmonise and consolidate their proposals. Thus, a more structured cooperation developed: Universities teamed up with the local IT industry and public organisations, to create a cluster organisation, the Cluj IT Cluster. Currently, the cluster is made up of 32 companies, three regional universities, and eight partner organisations (including the Regional Development Agency, the City Council of Cluj-Napoca and county-level institutions in Cluj). [\u2026] The city played the role of facilitator and network-mediator . 57 Infrastructure in S3 The new approach implicitly shifts to some extent the attention from traditional forms of RDTI infrastructure. Universities, incubators and science parks play a vital role in strategy development but rather as partners in new forms of cooperation. Examples of new types of infrastructure in the sense of S3 are: \uf06e Intermediaries, knowledge hubs such as Demola 58 [Tampere (FI)] which is an organisation based on the collaboration of the city, its universities 59 and other local stakeholders. Its aim is to collect research 55 Van Winden, de Carvalho 2015, p. 21. 56 Van Winden, de Carvalho 2015, p. 12. 57 Van Winden, de Carvalho 2015, p. 12. 58 Cf. van Winden, de Carvalho 2015, p. 13. 59 There are about 38,000 students in universities around Tampere.

The academic sector benefits from the more effective commercialisation of research results and the business sector from quicker knowledge transfer and shorter innovation cycles. Box 4. 3H model Eindhoven The region of Eindhoven has become a model in terms of institutionalised cooperation for 3H. 60 The innovation strategy is designed by a foundation with representatives of the three main parties to 3H, i.e. the LRAs, leaders of knowledge institutes and businesses. The current strategy is labelled as Brainport 2020 . The engine in implementation is an organisation named Brainport Development staffed with 50 persons. The organisation is owned and funded by regional LRAs \u2013 mutual trust and the broad underlying partnership have helped to strengthen an independent profile of the organisation and prevents political ad-hoc intervention and supports a long-term approach. The organisation is in charge of a broad range of activities: it runs business parks, it kickstarts promising projects, it provides support for funding and subsidies, it markets and promotes the region at home and abroad, and it supports the strategy-building process. 61 A feature common to most current successful models of S3 or 3H partnerships is the pivotal role of universities . Harmonious collaboration of the 3H partners is one of the foundations for success. Examples of pro-active roles of universities 62 come e.g. from Aachen (Germany) where professors \u2018gon on tour\u2019 to local and regional SMEs and actively seek cooperation. In Tampere (Finland), universities have established the \u2018problem Fridays\u2019 where companies and institutions are invited to face-to-face meetings in order to discuss technological challenges. As regards digital skills, Manchester is an interesting example. The City Council and the City\u2019s universities organise jointly the Digital Skills Summit \u2013 a forum for digital and graduate hiring and training workshops. Another initiative is the 60 Cf. van Winden, de Carvalho 2015, p. 13. 61 van Winden, de Carvalho 2015, p. 13. 62 van Winden, de Carvalho 2015, p. 13. ",

In such cases LRAs could act as facilitators in order to build trust between the partners and support the negotiation of cooperation terms on eye level. Learning from models in Europe Many urban regions have set-up such strategies and lots of opportunities for exchange of information across Europe exist. Important knowledge hubs in terms of S3/3H strategies are e.g. the Joint Research Centre (JRC) which runs the S3 platform. In an urban context, the capitalisation efforts undertaken by the URBACT programme is to be mentioned. One of the models for a comprehensive strategy-building process is the example of the Finnish capital region Helsinki-Uusima. Box 5. Smart specialisation strategy (RIS) 3 Helsinki-Uusima The Smart Specialisation Strategy (RIS3) 2014-2020 for the Finnish Capital Region 64 is a model of interest given the long-standing tradition and success of cooperation between universities and industries. The goals foresee a clear orientation on breakthroughs of (technological) innovations on international level. An accompanying strategy element is a strengthened approach towards longer-term strategy setting and infrastructure development in the research sector. A stronger programme-based approach and predictability of funding should support an innovation-friendly research climate. The priorities are labelled as multi-disciplinary thematic entities with strong innovation and value creation potential. These will be expanded on and developed throughout the RIS3 period . Universities, universities of applied sciences and research institutes are key actors. Co-operation, especially with companies and municipalities, is vital. The five chosen priorities are: \uf06e Urban cleantech. \uf06e Human health tech. \uf06e Digitalising industry. \uf06e Welfare city. \uf06e Smart citizens. 63 van Winden, de Carvalho 2015, p. 23. 64 Helsinki-Uusima Regional Council 2015. ",
        "34 The intent is to trigger development through the combination of these industries with related KET. The organisation and process design is based on shared thematic innovation platforms in order to act as hub in the coordination of activities and to monitor progress. These platforms differ in character and the main players involved. The character of platforms ranges from large thematic platforms over cluster-type platforms to participatory functional platforms as intended as open innovative milieus. Universities and intermediaries have an important role in furthering the activities of the platforms. A vital strategy element are the so-called spearhead projects in the five priority areas with the aim to change the operating culture 65 and give momentum to the process from the very start. From the perspective of LRAs the key policy angles have been taken into account during the process of strategy-building: the municipal perspective as well as the metropolitan one have been represented in strategy development. 66 65 Helsinki-Uusima Regional Council 2015, p. 9. 66 Helsinki-Uusima Regional Council 2015, p. 13; the region consists of 26 municipalities. 12 municipalities in the metropolitan region have created a shared competitiveness strategy as ancillary strategy.

        "35 3 Key elements of an integrated EU Urban Agenda Measures for sustainable economic growth are designed to reduce poverty, social exclusion and environmental problems. Economic and social perspectives in cities differ spatially (between neighbourhoods) and socially (between different groups) which makes it more important to boost integrated sustainable development in cities most exposed to problems of social exclusion, deterioration of the environment, wastelands and urban sprawl. 67 Local and regional authorities gained more and more influence over EU policy- making through the implementation of cohesion policy but also in the frame of public procurement, state aid and the application of environmental standards. The section aims to describe the main strands of a fully operational EU Urban Agenda. It contains an overview of main EU policies, governance mechanism as well as stakeholder and therefore allows an understanding as to which expectations a future EU Urban Agenda should meet. Based on these considerations, an assessment of the current situation for implementing an integrated EU Urban Agenda will be conducted. Urban best practices will be proposed, where available, to demonstrate the impact of a possible new Urban policy at EU level. 3.1 Typology of cities During the last decades a wide range of different city rankings and city typologies have been developed. However, its use is not always clear as the different rankings and typologies are similar even if developed for different purposes. Also at the European level several typologies have found recognition starting with the OECD typology followed by FOCI 68 and LUZ 69 . All those approaches are still too broad. City typologies in general lack the acknowledgement of aspects such as: 70 67 European Commission, 2006, Communication from the Commission to the Council and Parliament. Cohesion Policy and cities: the urban contribution to growth and jobs in the regions. 68 ESPON 2013a, FOCI Future Orientations for Cities, applied research. 69 ESPON 2013b, Typology of Urban development, 1990-2006, Larger Urban Zones. 70 European Parliament (2014), The Role of Cities in the Cohesion Policy 2014-2020, Metis, EPRC. ",
        "36 \uf06e The different positions of cities and urban areas in different Member States \u2013 in general, in small Member States, smaller cities have an economically and socially higher ranking than in larger Member States. \uf06e Different typologies do not acknowledge a standardised system boundary. Cities and their hinterlands do not orient along administrative borders, which, in practice, are most relevant for policy development in different Member States. Moreover, those Member States with a federal system orient along administrative borders at the federal level. \uf06e Comparisons between agglomerations differ in their size cut-off. Some include small towns, while others only consider larger urban areas. Furthermore, metropolitan areas encompass substantial hinterlands with some rural areas as well. Comparison between metropolitan cities and the rest of the territory is more like a comparison between very small settlements and highly rural areas on the one hand and the rest of the national territory on the other hand. \uf06e Research and innovation is not always related to city size, and smaller cities sometimes do have a higher level of innovation interaction and concentration. Larger cities tend to be more concentrated on the service sector. It seems unquestionable that urban typologies are useful for various purposes and should be a basis for a Europe wide urban policy debate. However, the purpose of the typology needs to be clear before defining indicators for any new ranking or typology system. The following aspects should be considered: \uf06e Member State sizes. \uf06e the location (peripheral or central) of cities and urban areas. \uf06e functional alliances between cities 71 . \uf06e the size of the city and the type of hinterland. At this point, a critical remark on weak data availability at the urban level is necessary for understanding further elaboration on the impact of an integrated EU Urban Agenda: 71 Strategic alliances that have a narrow scope involving only a single functional area of the business are less complex than comprehensive alliances and therefore may not take the form of a joint venture. ",
        "37 Box 6. Weak indicators at urban level The attempt to measure economic performance in urban areas causes some difficulties because of weak data availability of comparable and reliable indicators for agglomeration areas. Where quantitative information for cities is available, it only exists either at NUTS 2 or 3 level or within administrative boundaries for larger cities which does often not mirror the actual concentration in the regionally integrated areas. As a result, the vast majority of smaller cities and towns in Europe cannot be presented by comparable indicators and therefore cannot be used for detailed quantitative analyses on economic, social and environmental growth. Relevant literature mainly refers to the fact that smaller cities do not have a real impact at the national and in particular at the international level. Indeed, the performance of cities differs greatly in terms of economic indicators but also with regards to social and environmental sustainability. Nevertheless, statistical information at local level is of high importance for local policy strategies. Just its comparison at the national or international level is very complex and time-consuming which leads to the fact that it can only be considered in the form of case studies and examples. Two approaches try to overcome this fundamental challenge although the comparability and transferability to small towns still has some deficiencies: (1) The data collection exercise 72 (formerly known as Urban Audit) is undertaken by national statistical institutes, the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy and Eurostat. The indicators collected relate to the broad field of living quality in cities in the EU, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey. Since data are provided on a voluntary basis its availability differs from topic to topic. Statistical information is collected for several levels, i.e. at the level of Local Administrative Units (LAU) including urban areas of at least 50,000 inhabitants, the Functional Urban Areas (FUA, formerly known as Larger Urban Zone) that consist of a city and its commuting zone and the greater cities that is an approximation of the urban centre when this stretches far beyond the administrative boundaries. For specific indicators relevant for the urban economy the calculation at the EU level is based on a mix of these spatial levels and it includes a number of exceptions. Moreover, definitions of indicators per country 72 cf. Eurostat Cities (Urban Audit), available at http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/cities/data/database (accessed 17.11.2015). ",
        "38 differ from each other. Nevertheless, the following key indicators could be aggregated: \uf06e 77.4% of jobs in the EU are based in European cities and greater cities. \uf06e 53% of companies are located in European cities and greater cities. (2) The Eurostat urban-rural typology consists of three types of regions, \u2018predominantly rural\u2019, \u2018intermediate\u2019 and \u2018predominantly urban\u2019 for statistical analysis. 73 Its data availability is also limited in terms of countries and years. For the following indicators the most comprehensive but still recent data availability can be aggregated for 2011: \uf06e 44% of GDP per inhabitant was gained in predominantly urban regions and 29% in intermediate regions which accounts for 73% in those two types regions in Europe overall. A wide range of GDP levels in European cities and intermediate regions must be borne in mind. \uf06e 49% of GVa in total for all NACE activities is generated in predominantly urban regions and 34% in intermediate regions which accounts for overall 83% in those two types of regions in Europe overall. Again, it must be kept in mind that this is only an average value of all predominantly urban and intermediate regions. General conclusions about the overall high performance of urban areas should therefore not be drawn at an international scale and literature as well as impact assessments must be taken with caution keeping in mind the different contexts of urban areas. Summed up, the typology can only be a baseline and should be extended by contextual clustering of different cities. In order to address different urban areas in Europe, different context related aspects have to be acknowledged. Cities are not comparable based on their size and administrative status in relation to different European policy fields where the respective context needs to be understood. For instance, Naples and Krakow are not facing the same contextual situation, i.e. they vary in their industrial structures, climate conditions and their 73 For more information on the methodology and definition see http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics- explained/index.php/Urban-rural_typology and Directorate for Public Governance and Territorial Development 2011, OECD Regional Typology (accessed 17.11.2015).

        "39 cultural backgrounds. Therefore, a new policy implementation will be managed differently in Naples than in Krakow. The ESPON project Territorial Scenarios and Visions for Europe 74 provides scenarios for metropolises, medium and small cities. The promotion of small cities and less developed regions towards 2050 means that small and medium- sized cities as centres of self-contained and economically resilient regions with more sustainable mobility patterns reduce the existing imbalances at the medium and lower level of the urban hierarchy and their functions for the surrounding regions. 3.2 The urban dimension of the main EU policies European urban development is influenced by diverse policy areas, either by direct urban programmes, initiatives or network activities or indirect with policies that alter growth opportunities, accessibilities, environmental influences or social conditions in cities. The urban dimension in European policies describes the benefits of single policies for cities as well as their impacts and possibilities to take part in policy implementation 75 . Likewise the urban dimension facilitates an integrated and sustainable approach that coordinates different sector policies, its impacts on urban areas and its inhabitants. It is evident that \u2013 similar to EU cohesion policy \u2013 urban policies must be transversal or cross-cutting. Thus as a starting point it is useful to consider the main EU policies and their urban dimension. The brief review in the table below points at the fact that all main EU policies have a marked urban dimension. Table 4.

        "43 Under the ESF , actions with an urban dimension e.g. expanding and improving investment in human capital and training systems, strengthening institutional capacity, increasing the adaptability of workers, enterprises and entrepreneurs and enhancing access to employment and sustainable inclusion in the labour market, as well as promoting partnerships were undertaken during the 2007-2013 period (EU No 1081/2006 Article 3). The integrated approach was further reinforced in the 2014-2020 period, as urban development shall be implemented through strategies setting out integrated actions (EU No 1301/2013 Article 7). At the EU level \u20ac372 million will be dedicated to innovative urban actions that shall include studies and pilot projects to identify or test new solutions which address issues that are related to sustainable urban development and are of relevance at the Union level (EU No. 1301/2013 Article 8). Member States shall organise partnerships with competent regional and local authorities and involve them in the preparation of the Partnership Agreements (PA) and OPs as well as in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the OPs. 79 A minimum of 5% of ERDF resources allocated shall be invested in integrated actions for sustainable urban development in order to strengthen the role of cities in the programmes (EU No 1301/2013, Preamble, Recital No 19). In the PAs each Member State presents principles for the selection of urban areas where integrated actions for sustainable urban development and integrated approaches for urban areas are defined to a different extent and degree of specificity. The new cohesion policy provisions for urban regions acknowledge the importance of cities and towns for the future development of Europe. It also underlines the strengthened territorial approach at country or OP/priority-axis level and not through a common European understanding 80 . At the Community level, strategic guidelines on cohesion policy propose the establishment of an urban development network \u2018to promote capacity-building, networking and exchange of experience at Union level between urban authorities responsible for implementing sustainable urban development strategies and authorities responsible for innovative actions in the area of sustainable urban development\u2019 (EU No 1301/2013 Article 9). 79 Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, Article 5 provided the legal basis for adoption of a delegated act on a European Code of Conduct on Partnership (ECCP). 80 Metis 2014a, The Role of Cities in the Cohesion Policy 2014-2020.

        "44 Integrated Territorial Investments (ITI) support the thematic approach and facilitate the right mix of investments in the integrated urban strategies by allowing the implementation of OPs in a cross-cutting way. It has its roots in model strategies for deprived urban areas combining physical investments in infrastructure from ERDF with investments in human capital from ESF. Thus, it again takes up the initial URBAN method that aimed to contribute to the effectiveness of urban actions by acting as a model and by facilitating the exchange of experience. At the level of OPs Community-led local development reverses traditional \u201ctop-down\u201d development policy. It aims at building local partnerships that develop and implement an integrated development strategy which is designed to build on the community\u2019s social, environmental and economic strength. The partnership is funded on a long-term basis. Both tools, which contribute to the development of specific sub-regional areas, have been implemented with reluctance in some Member States. The national level sometimes feared too much local influence in territorial development. 81 ITIs is as well as CLLDs require a certain amount of additional administrative effort. Therefore one could assume that the number of OPs specifically addressing those instruments is rather small. In the case of CLLDs, information has been provided at the CLLD conference in summer 2015. CLLDs are predominantly used for rural development programme implementation and only to a small extend involved in ERDF and ESF programmes.

However, a direct relation is defined for particular investment priorities in the ERDF regulation (EU No 1301/2013 Article 5): \uf06e Thematic objective 4, supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors, Investment priority (e): promoting low-carbon strategies for all types of territories in particular for urban areas, including the promotion of sustainable multimodal urban mobility and mitigation- relevant adaptation measures. This investment priority has been addressed in 11 Member States (Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Greece, Spain, Finland, France, Netherlands, Sweden, and United Kingdom) in 25 mono- and multi-funded ERDF OPs 86 . \uf06e Thematic objective 6, preserving and protecting the environment and promoting resource efficiency, Investment priority (e): taking action to improve the urban environment, to revitalise cities, regenerate and decontaminate brownfield sites (including conversion areas), reduce air pollution and promote noise-reduction measures. This investment priority has been addressed in 18 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, and Slovakia) in 87 mono- and multi-funded ERDF OPs 87 . \uf06e Thematic objective 8, promoting sustainable and quality employment and supporting labour mobility, Investment priority (b): supporting employment-friendly growth through the development of endogenous potential as part of a territorial strategy for specific areas, including the conversion of declining industrial regions and enhancement if accessibility to, and development of, specific and cultural resources. This investment priority has been addressed in 11 Member States (Austria, Estonia, France, Hungary, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and United Kingdom) in 24 mono- and multi-funded ERDF OPs 88 . \uf06e Thematic objective 9, promoting social inclusion, combating poverty and any discrimination, Investment priority (b): providing support for physical, economic and social regeneration of deprived communities in 86 Data taken from 216 mono and multi-funded ERDF OPs. 87 Ibid. 88 Ibid.

Its method of implementation included local economic development, social exclusion and physical and environmental regeneration in an integrated approach by acting as a testing ground. 91 Together with the reform of cohesion policy in 2007, the principles underpinning this initiative were mainstreamed under the European Territorial Cooperation Programme URBACT II within the EU regulation and therefore a legal basis for the continuation of support for integrated urban development was created. It aims at fostering sustainable integrated urban development in cities across Europe. The URBACT III programme (2014-2020) has a total budget of \u20ac96.3 million which means an increase by approx. 20%. It intends to use three types of interventions in order to \u2018promote sustainable integrated urban development and contribute to the delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy\u2019: 92 \uf06e Transnational exchange. \uf06e Capacity-building. \uf06e Capitalisation & dissemination. For the current programming period, a stronger linkage with new instruments and thematic networks for the exchange of experience is targeted by the URBACT programme. It should work complementarily with the urban development network. 89 Ibid. 90 http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/policy/cooperation/european-territorial/; in 2015, ETC, better known as Interreg, celebrated its 25 birthday of implementing joint actions and policy exchanges between national, regional and local actors from different Member States. 91 European Commission, DG Regional policy, Partnership with the Cities.

It aims at translating the common sustainability goals and the recommendations in the Leipzig Charter into practice by supporting cities through the improvement of disadvantaged neighbourhoods or districts and helping processes of evaluation. The financial instrument tools supported by the JESSICA policy initiative aims to mobilise private sector funding and expertise for integrated urban regeneration strategies. The Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas supports sustainable urban development and regeneration through financial resources engineering mechanisms. It allows ERDF funding to be allocated to Urban Development Funds (UDFs), which in turn provide equities, loans and/or guarantees to public-private partnerships or other projects in the context of an integrated plan for sustainable urban development. The initiative of the European Commission was developed in cooperation with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) and promotes sustainable urban development by supporting projects in the following areas: 93 \uf06e Urban infrastructure - including transport, water/waste water, energy; \uf06e Heritage or cultural sites - for tourism or other sustainable uses; \uf06e Redevelopment of brownfield sites - including site clearance and decontamination; \uf06e Creation of new commercial floor space for SMEs, IT and/or R&D sectors; \uf06e University buildings - medical, biotech and other specialised facilities; \uf06e Energy efficiency improvements.

        "49 3.2.4 Stakeholders for a new urban policy at Member State and EU level Furthering urban policies requires dedicated lobbying. At the EU Member State level associations or national initiatives exist that represent the needs and interests of its member cities and their citizens. These associations frequently participate in the process and monitoring of EU Structural Fund programmes instead of their member cities itself. An important task is the facilitation of knowhow transfer and exchange of experience with regards to sustainable urban development: The National Association of Municipalities of the Republic of Bulgaria (NAMRB) represents all 264 Bulgarian municipalities before the central government, supports them in executing their power and participates and lobbies in Bulgarian and international fora. It also takes part in the work of the CoR and the Council of Europe. 95 In Germany , the National Urban Development Policy serves as a communication platform within the country between actors and interested parties around urban issues. In addition, several municipal associations represent the interests of cities and communities in German urban policies, among others the Association of German Cities and Towns ( Deutscher St\u00e4dtetag ) or the German Cities and Communities Association ( Deutscher Verband f\u00fcr Wohnungswesen, St\u00e4dtebau und Raumordnung ). These networking and coordination platforms that bring urban interests to national and supranational policy levels are considered even more effective than the actual financial benefit through Structural Funds. 96 The German Austrian URBAN Network represents the first cross-border URBAN network including the Austrian cities Graz and Vienna. It supports horizontal exchange between cities through knowhow transfer, support for integrated urban development measures, information and publicity as well as political awareness building for integrated urban development. The platform is co-financed by financial contributions from participating cities and the German Association of Saving Banks. 97 95 Metis 2014a, The Role of Cities in the Cohesion Policy 2014-2020.

        "50 The highly devolved multi-level governance system of Spain , encompassed a number of plans upon land-use and regulatory guidelines (including the regional and sub-regional levels) focussing mainly on housing policy, land zoning and the expansion of settlements and infrastructure. Integrated sustainable urban development approaches that transform environmental, economic and industrial trends into urban growth strategies are less well developed. An effort made in this respect is the existence of information-sharing platforms, i.e. the Urban Information System ( Sistema de Informacion Urbana, SIU ). Moreover, a domestic continuation of the URBAN and URBAN II Community Initiative, URBANA (also referred to as the Urban Initiative) supports urban development projects in Spain. The Federation of Spanish Municipalities and Provinces ( Federaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Municipios y Provincias, FEMP ) represents the interests and opinions of urban areas in cohesion policy programming consultations. As a result of the devolved governance system, autonomous communities such as the Andaluc\u00edan Federation of Municipalities and Provinces ( Federaci\u00f3n Andaluza de Municipios y Provincias, FAMP ) provide input into the design and management of Structural Funds programmes from the perspective of cities. Finally, the Network of Urban Initiatives facilitates the urban dimension in Structural Funds management and programming as a sectoral network. Knowledge transfer and the dissemination of experience in urban-oriented Structural Funds projects constitute its major tasks. 98 In Italy , EU Structural Funds 2007-2013 were delivered through urban development plans, which are based on experience under URBAN II. As a result of delays in the approval of these plans, the Italian Ministry for Territorial Cohesion developed a national OP for Metropolitan Cities for the 2014-2020 period which includes 14 cities and will work in parallel to the Regional OPs. 99 A mechanism for municipalities to come together at sub-regional level to design a programme for their local area in Poland was only established for the Silesian Voivoidship , the Sub-regional Development Programmes (SDPs). As a result of the large population in Silesia that brings the greatest financial allocation out of EU Structural Funds in Poland, a Regional Territorial Forum was established in the scope of the preparation of the 2014-2020 period. This forum served as an advisory body for the development of the Silesian OP 2014-2020 including representatives from Silesian cities. 100 98 Metis 2014a, The Role of Cities in the Cohesion Policy 2014-2020.

        "51 Nevertheless, Poland \u2013 as supporter of territorial instruments for years \u2013 decided to implement sustainable urban area development programmes entirely through ITIs. As a result, ITIs will be implemented in all regional capital cities and on their functional areas as well as in cities of regional or sub-regional importance and in their functional areas, depending on the Regional Government\u2019s decision in a given Voivodship). 101 EU Structural Funds OPs in the UK do not have a particular urban focus and cities do not have a strong emphasis in programming or consultation except in England. The 39 voluntary Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) between local authorities and the private sector that exist in England are responsible for the economic development at the sub-national level. The Localism Act 2011 changed the powers of local government in England by facilitating the devolution of decision-making powers from central government control to individuals and communities. A series of \u2018City Deals were negotiated by the government in 2012 between the Core Cities, the Cabinet Office, and the Department for Communities and Local Government. Enhanced powers and the opportunity to develop new combined authorities to manage some services at the city-region level have been developed for cities. 102 At the European level different city networks exist that mainly involve local and municipal governments of major European cities such as EUROCITIES and METREX. Similar to national associations or initiatives EUROCITIES intend to provide the 130 member cities and 40 partner cities the possibility for sharing knowledge and exchanging ideas by offering moderated working groups, projects, diverse activities and events. Moreover, they lobby at EU institutions in order to improve the role of LRAs in the multi-level governance structure. 103 METREX elaborates in its Futures Group prospective change at the global, European and metropolitan levels that gives a basis for informed and integrated decision making at the metropolitan level.

It shall aim at close cooperation among Member States, the European Commission, cities and other stakeholders. The European Commission and the Dutch Presidency of 2016 is jointly developing an EU Urban Agenda. It aims to improve and coordinate existing initiatives within the Commission and to promote closer cooperation on urban issues in the Member States aligned with all government levels and in accordance with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity. Moreover, a better collection and monitoring of data is intended in all European policy fields as well as regarding the urban impact of and challenges in the scope of the effectiveness EU initiatives. 106 In July 2014, the European Commission launched a public consultation on an EU Urban Agenda that aimed to widen the debate to all relevant stakeholders. The strong participation and broad opinion can be summarized as follows: 107 The main message emerging from the consultation is that Europe can help cities to address common challenges and, in turn, cities can contribute to achieve the priorities of the Union. Most respondents are of the opinion that no new legislation is needed, but rather better legislation which reflects urban realities. No new instruments or funding sources are requested, but better coordination among the existing ones. No new competences should be transferred to the European level, but a more structured, regular dialogue in full respect of subsidiarity and respective responsibilities should be put in place to ensure that what already Europe does is good for cities. 105 http://www.aebr.eu/en/activities/regional_organisations.php. 106 Platform31, EUKN 2015. 107 Commission SWD(2015) 109 final/2; In total, 225 responses from 29 European countries, as well as Canada and the USA were received. Many of them were local authorities, associations, trade and industry federations and civil society organisations. Additionally, some Member States have carried out national consultations with local authorities. ",
        "53 The main focus in the EU Urban Agenda was then defined by the Commission for the following strands to be further developed 108 : \uf06e Result orientation \u2013 focus on a limited number of priority areas. \uf06e Effective application of better regulation tools. \uf06e Improve coherence and coordination of EU policies with an impact on cities, align existing EU instruments with priority areas. \uf06e Improve urban intelligence, benchmarking and monitoring. Compared to this, the European Parliament plenary on the urban dimension of EU policies reflected the CoR position in terms of 109 : \uf06e The need for multi-level governance. \uf06e The importance of input from decentralised levels of government when drawing up impact assessments and new policies (\u201cbottom-up approach\u201d). \uf06e To be able to assess urban areas more accurately than just on the basis of the GDP indicator \u2013 sufficient data must be made available. \uf06e The Code of Conduct on Partnership when implementing programmes and projects supported by EU funding. \uf06e The need for greater involvement of towns and cities in the new Structural Funds Programmes. \uf06e The usefulness of other programmes besides URBACT and the like for knowledge-sharing between cities for the engagement of local and regional actors Against the background of EU initiatives related to urban issues as well as the identification of relevant stakeholders in chapter 3.2, this section reflects on the main policy levers in an integrated EU Urban Agenda and its interdependencies. 3.3.1 Main policy levers in an integrated EU Urban Agenda A strong business case for an integrated EU Urban Agenda is subject to interdependencies between policy areas and their policy levers as well as their positive impact on growth and jobs. The main underlying mechanisms will be presented in order to raise awareness for more holistic approaches to urban policy and at the same time highlight the need for coordination. 108 Ibid. 109 http://web.cor.europa.eu/alde/what-we-do/Pages/Vote-in-EP-plenary-on-the-urban-dimension-of-EU-policies- reflects-ALDE-CoR-positions.aspx.

        "54 Most policy areas are still dominated by a sectoral approach. Administrative structures have grown over decades and structures tend to persist. Traditional sectoral approaches are therefore still the main point of reference. Holistic or cross-cutting policy approaches tend to be less tangible for LRAs. They are often perceived as top-down development, which is partly owed to a lack of capacities. When developing business cases for urban policies it is important to be aware of the different policy levers in policy areas. The differentiation of levels and governance mechanisms is an important step to prepare the ground for the discussion of an integrated EU Urban Agenda. Table 6 provides a tentative overview that should raise awareness for: \uf06e The main points of interaction between LRAs, the national level and the EU as well as \uf06e The weight, i.e. the capacity and competences at the level of LRAs in comparison to national and international policy levers; \uf06e The relevance for the different aspects of growth. On the one hand the overview should raise awareness for the broad range of issues that are essential for urban development. On the other hand it is useful to identify areas where efficiency gains through better coordination can be achieved within a policy area (vertical coordination) as well as among the sectoral policies (horizontal coordination). The following aspects should be taken into consideration when going through table 6: \uf06e It is evident that the scope of action and the competences of LRAs vary to a significant extent across the EU. In particular self-government at regional level is restricted to a small number of Member States 110 . 110 Generally speaking, most of the EU Member States are unitary states, i.e. most of the competencies lie with the central state; among EU-15 three Member States are federations, i.e. having states or regions with equal competencies (Austria, Belgium, Germany), six other states have either devolved certain competencies to regions or are federacies (or both). Devolved states are Spain, Italy and UK, federacies (mostly related to territories distant to the mainland) are Denmark, Finland, France and UK. Among the EU-15 decentralisation is an ongoing process in several Member States, in particular in Czech Republic, Poland and Slovak Republic. ",

        "61 Some specifications of a business case for an integrated EU Urban Agenda are evident: cities are undergoing permanent change and part of their infrastructure is built and used for periods which clearly outlast most of the conventional production facilities. This brings several points to mind: \uf06e Administrative structures and practices often did not respond to the phenomena of change resulting in adverse consequences. \uf06e Due to the long-lasting effects of decisions in terms of environmental sustainability policy makers should act responsibly \u2013 in many fields the linear economic perspective should be replaced with circular approaches taking resource efficiency as one of the lead targets. \uf06e Due to long-established practices and a built-in reluctance to alter business practices \u2013 any business case of an integrated EU Urban Agenda will need a particularly convincing narrative and coherence in order to achieve a contribution to change. 3.3.2 Interrelationships and coordination between policy fields The interrelationships between policy fields are in part dense. A brief qualitative analysis of these interrelationships can be found in table 7. The analysis confirms the transversal role of information networks, educational infrastructures and STI for an EU Urban Agenda. These infrastructures\u2019 respective policy fields reveal the highest requirements in terms of policy coordination since their influence on a large number of policy fields is significant: one could say that this is the software of an EU Urban Agenda , acting as enabler and driver of developments in combination with societal changes such as demographic change and migration. Heavy-investment infrastructures in an urban context are transport, waste and water management, energy supply and site development (for housing, business, recreation). Policy coordination in these fields is essential because a lack of coordination has significant financial impact in the long run. These fields could be considered as the hardware of an EU Urban Agenda . ",

        "63 3.4 Steps towards Circular Economy One key element of the EU policy agenda for 2016 is the recently proposed legislative package with regard to the circular economy. Given its strong local dimension it is a good case for looking deeper in the interlinkages between an EU Urban Agenda and this important policy field. Keeping in mind the high resource-dependency of Europe\u2019s economy having hardly any significant quantities of the key exhaustible raw materials, which are needed as input for industrial productions, accessible materials and energy will reach its physical limits. Thus, certain policy fields that strongly influence urban areas such as waste recycling and energy efficiency are of vital importance for any scenario towards sustainable development when considering periods spanning for several decades. For EU businesses a more efficient use of resources can bring considerable net savings. Therefore the European Commission adopted an Action Plan for the Circular Economy 111 . This recently adopted package does not include an explicit attention for the specific urban impact nor for the way EU cities can contribute to the realisation of its main objectives. This urban impact will therefore be tackled in this section when analysing the overall impact of a new EU circular economy. 3.4.1 Policy background of the EU Circular Economy A core determinant of economic competitiveness and sustainable growth has become the greening of industries, i.e. the promotion of sustainable patterns of production and consumption. Sustainable industrial development does not only aim at resource and energy efficiency, low-carbon and low-waste production, non-polluting and safe production. It also impacts poverty alleviation through the promotion of energy security, health and safety, jobs, and reducing costs through increased productivity. 112 It can be achieved \u201cby de-coupling economic growth from the use of natural resources and by increasing efficiency through producing more economic value with less environmental impacts.\u201d 113 111 Press Release of 02 December 2015: http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-6203_en.htm. 112 UNIDO 2011, UNIDO Green Industry, Policies for supporting Green Industry. 113 SERI 2013, Green growth.

        "64 Figure 3. Relative decoupling at the global level Source: Dittrich et al. 2012, p 34. The figure shows that \u2013 despite the fact that material intensity of the world economy decreased by about one third \u2013 efficiency gains were overcompensated by economic growth since 1980. This is to be explained by an increase in material consumption of 79% against an increase of GDP of 147%, which results in an increase of material productivity of only 37%. At this point, it is useful to have a look at best practices in urban industrial reconversion policy supported by cohesion policy instruments. Box 7. Cohesion policy and urban industrial reconversion policy 114 Urban areas are often confronted with industrial restructuring because most businesses are located in major agglomeration areas for the purpose of better serve markets, link to suppliers and draw on labour and knowledge sources. In particular, second tier cities are therefore most in need of public investment in the form of cohesion policy support for industrial reconversion. Main metropolitan centres instead tend to be characterised by more advanced service sectors. Cohesion policy support for industrial reconversion has different dimensions explained by the following examples: (1) Examples for business innovation and investment in the 2007-2013 period is similar to the \u2018smart specialisation\u2019 strategies in the 2014-2020 period: 114 Metis 2013a, Regional Strategies for industrial areas, Metis 2015a, Evaluation der st\u00e4dtischen Dimension in den Europ\u00e4ischen Strukturfonds Sachsen-Anhalt 2007-2013. ",
        "65 \uf06e The approach was seen in the NUTS-2 sub-region of Keski-Suomi and its main city of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 in western Finland where ERDF and ESF supported the key clusters of mechanical engineering, bio- energy and housing, through investment in R&D, innovation, education and training and business development. The support was seen as important for the regions\u2019 future economic development as it referred to its main challenges, the restructuring of major industries and relatively high unemployment rates. (2) Examples for social inclusion as a result of high levels of unemployment, and social dislocation: \uf06e A more strategic use of resources as well as more effective local cooperation and services delivery could be reached in the Lowlands and Uplands of Scotland (UK). Entrepreneurship and physical regeneration in disadvantaged urban areas was supported by ERDF during the 2007-2013 period. At the same time, the ESF funded vocational training, advice for job-seekers, assistance with childcare, and initiatives to encourage employers to understand the needs of vulnerable groups entering the workforce. (3) Examples for the integration of different types of intervention: \uf06e In Saxony-Anhalt (Germany), the urban dimension was a horizontal theme for the ERDF and ESF 2007-2013 OPs. Thus, integrated approaches to urban development addressing RDTI, education, physical regeneration, land reclamation but also urban transport, water and waste infrastructure were implemented by involving different kinds of actors (i.e. firms, universities, local and regional authorities). Whereas the two main cities Magdeburg and Halle rather profited from support of the knowledge based economy, smaller cities took benefit from long-term investment drawing on citizens\u2019 participation and high visibility. The flagship initiative for a resource-efficient Europe under the Europe 2020 strategy aims to support the shift towards a resource-efficient, low-carbon economy to achieve sustainable growth. This shall be reached by means of a circular economy turning \u2018waste\u2019 into a new resource through re-using, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products. Consequently, the linear economic perspective of \u201ctake-make-consume and dispose\u201d assuming that resources are abundant, available and cheap to dispose of ",
        "66 should be replaced with circular approaches taking resource efficiency as one of the lead targets. The concept of circular economy goes beyond economic growth that considers for instance, also ecological factors such as the reduction of resources and fossil energy. It rather describes a positive development cycle that preserves and enhances natural capital, optimises resource yields, fosters system effectiveness and minimises system risks by revealing negative externalities. 115 3.4.2 Circular Economy Package adopted by the Commission Recently, the European Commission adopted a circular economy package aiming to stimulate Europe\u2019s transition towards a circular economy, which will boost global competitiveness, foster sustainable economic growth and generate new jobs. According to Vice-President Frans Timmermans, responsible for sustainable development, a \u201cmix of smart regulation and incentives at EU level will help businesses and consumers, as well as national and local authorities, to drive [the] transformation.\u201d 116 Against the background of sustainable (urban) development, the EU action plan shall mainly contribute to green growth as well as towards a Resilient Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy. Its overall approach focuses on \u201cclosing the loop\u201d of product lifecycles through greater recycling and re-use. By extracting the maximum value and the use of all raw materials, products and waste energy savings and the reduction of Green House Gas emissions shall be ensured. Waste management and its related key aspects of the value chain creates synergies with other policies such as product policies or the development of well-functioning markets for secondary raw materials. It further aims at country specific approaches by improving the implementation of waste policy on the ground. 117 Required action and improvements in terms of resource and energy efficiency shall be taken \u201cat all stages of the life cycle of products: from the extraction of raw materials, through material and product design, production, distribution and consumption of goods, repair, remanufacturing and re-use schemes, to waste management and recycling.\u201d 118 115 Ellen Macarthur Foundation, 2015, Delivering the circular economy.

        "67 Despite the fact that subsidiarity is considered as key guiding principle, some actions have to be taken at EU level : \uf06e The legislative proposals on waste have already been revised setting clear targets for reduction of waste and establishing a long-term path for waste management and recycling 119 . \uf06e A further review of EU product and substance legislation 120 and recycling legislation shall harmonise national measures on circular economy and thus provide signals and legal certainty to new economic operators 121 . The following considerations with respect to all European companies, especially SMEs should be taken into account in order to not unnecessarily hinder business, innovation and competitiveness 122 : \uf06e EU regulations with the objective to support measures on circular economy may not always reflect products and sectoral circumstances of European companies which could result in a break on innovation and investment and thus on economic growth. \uf06e Municipal waste represents only 10 per cent of all waste generated in Europe. However, when considering the packaging of products not only the end of their life phase is to be recognised but also all other demands on the supply chain, i.e. product protection, shelf-life, food waste prevention and the demands of distribution, as well as consumer expectations for safety, convenience and security. Considerations on waste management below should be considered in this respect. \uf06e Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for goods in the post-consumer stage of the product\u2019s life cycle is able to shape the future circular economy. Binding minimum requirements would help Member States meet their recycling and recovery targets. 123 The transition towards the circular economy shall be financed by ESIF, \u20ac650 million from Horizon 2020, \u20ac5.5 billion from structural funds for waste management, and investments by the Member States.

They manage the European Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Bureau (EIPPCB) that produces the BAT Reference Documents (BREFs) 126 for a given sector. According to article 14(3) of the Industrial Emissions Directive 127 , BAT conclusions shall be the reference for setting the permit conditions for large industrial installations. The BREFs provide information about technically and economically available possibilities in industries to improve their environmental performance. BREFs and consequently the BAT conclusions are the result of an exchange of information and the pursuant negotiation process between Member States, the industries concerned, environmental NGOs and the Commission.

        "69 negotiations are framed in so-called Technical Work Groups (TWG), involving significant numbers of stakeholders. The agreement on the results, the so-called BAT conclusions, takes considerable time. 128 In practice the BREFs address, first of all, quite sector-specific approaches for major industrial productions such as food, organic chemicals production, iron and steel production, glass manufacturing etc. Next to these documents setting standards for specific industries, several BREFs address broader policy fields, which are of vital interest in the context of urban policies. The most relevant BREFs of a rather cross-cutting or horizontal character are: \uf06e Waste treatment. \uf06e Waste incineration. \uf06e Energy efficiency. As a result of the intra-disciplinary negotiation process, they serve as a basis for EU authorities to develop permits for industrial installations. 129 The EU should be in a strong position based on policy levers such as the prioritisation of key action areas through targeted regulatory policies and incentives. However, in reality more resource-efficient technologies are not being used or their market introduction is delayed \u2013 mainly for economic reasons. The technical and scientific support to EU policies aiming at the most efficient use of resources, waste management and BAT for production can start to be applied here by significantly supporting the growing market of green technologies. It is important to note that in part these BREFs directly address LRAs since in particular LRAs or urban regions might be contractors or even owners and operators of waste treatment and waste incineration plants. Since waste management is one of the cornerstones of the approach towards a circular 128 Cf. http://eippcb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/reference. In total so far 31 BREFs have been developed, thereof for seven the BAT conclusions are available, .i.e. for the majority either the negotiation or the review process (in 2 cases) is ongoing. As regards the numbers of stakeholders involved one has to see the considerable size of the technical Work Groups (TWGs) which are in charge of the negotiations. For example, the TWG on waste incineration is made up of more than 200 experts (cf. JRC 2014 - the report on the meeting of the TWG in November 2013 in Seville, ES). 129 JRC, Sustainable production: best available techniques, https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research-topic/sustainable- production-best-available-techniques. ",
        "70 economy some considerations on the quantitative and qualitative scope of the issue in an urban context might be useful. The case of waste management and the role of BAT Waste management is the dominant expenditure item among the government expenditures for environmental protection 130 : according to Eurostat data 131 , EU 28 expenditure for environmental protection has amounted to 0.8% of GDP in 2013. Thereof, on average 50%, i.e. 0.4% of GDP has been spent on waste management. In terms of costs and public spending, waste management outweighs other environmental protection tasks such as waste water management' or pollution abatement or protection of biodiversity and landscape (expenditure for each item accounting for 0.1% of GDP). In economic terms this share indicates that waste management is one of the market segments of particular interest for technology and service development. Moreover the challenge is inter alia a local one since municipal waste represents one of the most challenging segments in waste management due to the dispersed sources, the challenge of efficient prevention and control as well as the considerable resources required for efficient collection, separation and processing for re-use. In order to outline the quantitative scope from the perspective of LRAs one has to bear in mind that currently about 65% of EU\u2019s population inhabit urban regions. According to Eurostat data 132 the total waste generated by economic activities and households has amounted to 4.9 tons per capita in 2012 in the EU. Thereof 63% or about 3.2 tons per capita represent mineral waste. 133 Of the remaining approximate 1.7 tons, municipal waste accounts for about 25%. The table below outlines the key data on treatment of household waste: 130 Definition according to government expenditure by function (COFOG). 131 Government expenditure on environmental protection, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics- explained/index.php/Government_expenditure_on_environmental_protection. 132 Sustainable Development Indicator (SDI) on municipal waste and waste statistics, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/waste/transboundary-waste-shipments/key-waste-streams/municipal-waste and http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics. 133 In terms of weight the by far dominant waste fraction. This is a result of mining and quarrying (important in Member States such as Bulgaria, Finland, Estonia and Romania) which accounts for almost 29% of all waste generated and of construction accounting for about 33% of waste. ",
        "71 Table 8. Municipal waste in the EU28 in 2013 Treatment Kg per capita, p.a. Total municipal waste EU 28 on average 481 Thereof treated 471 Thereof: Landfill disposal 147 Incineration 122 Material recycling 131 Composting and digestion 71 Source: Eurostat waste and municipal waste statistics. Waste management itself has become an increasing concern: waste generated from waste treatment and waste water treatment has risen considerably by 61% in the period 2004 to 2012. In terms of the most marked increases, construction ranks second with an increase of 45% in the same period. It is obvious that these increases have to be considered to a significant extent as an urban phenomenon since for obvious reasons it is urban regions which require large-scale facilities for waste and waste water treatment. Therefore, cities produce residual waste in considerable quantities and moreover they are the ones with most significant building activities. As has been outlined, municipal waste is a significant challenge in quantitative terms. For selected Member States such as Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany and France also data at NUTS-II level 134 are available. Data for some of the capital regions reveal quite diverging trends: \uf06e data for Prague show a marked increase from 307,000 tons in 2004 to 377,000 tons in 2013; \uf06e other regions stable or even decline in the same period e.g. Berlin from 1,465,000 tons in 2004 to 1,389,600 tons in 2013 or Brussels has reported a decline from 459,000 tons to 448,000 tons. In terms of EU legislation, waste management is subject of several Directives. With a view to municipal (household waste) the most important aspects are covered by: 135 134 Cf. pilot data collection of Eurostat: http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do. 135 Cf. Ecologic Institute, UBA, RIMAS, 2013. ",
        "72 \uf06e the Waste Framework Directive (WFD) as overarching guidance document and \uf06e the Landfill Directive (mainly relevant for biodegradable waste); \uf06e the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive The WFD 136 sets also targets for 2020 such as a minimum rate of recycling for metal, glass, paper amounting to 50% or preparation for re-use, recycling and backfilling of at least 70% of waste from construction and demolition. 137 Further reduction targets are set in the Landfill Directive for biodegradable waste as well as in the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive. 138 Given the target values in the Directives and the current statistical facts the enormous need for investment in order to improve the performance in waste management becomes obvious. Next to the important question related to the choice of technologies for waste treatment and the resulting longer-term budgetary impacts as well as eventual resulting path dependencies, the LRAs face multiple other challenges in waste management. These challenges stem from the comparatively high value of land in urban areas and their immediate surroundings as well as the high population densities and the often dynamic process of suburbanisation. For cities it is often challenging to maintain or even enlarge existing areas for treatment plants or to gain local acceptance in case of the need to build new plants. Another obvious challenge is the rehabilitation and the upgrade of landfills in proximity of cities (landfills have to be considered as the least sustainable form of waste deposits but still accounting for 31% and thus the highest share in treatment of municipal waste in 2013). BATs and BEMPs The role of the relevant BATs on waste treatment and waste incineration is quite specific and targets certain aspects: the BAT seek to cover technological aspects which are none the less of key importance in urban waste management. The fact that currently almost 25% of household waste is subject to incineration makes the role of BAT on waste incineration obvious: the BAT on waste treatment covers inter alia large-scale installations for the disposal of non-hazardous waste. But in many cities also the treatment and incineration of hazardous waste is owned and operated by municipalities. By including the processing of waste 136 Cf. Ecologic Institute, UBA, RIMAS., 2013 p. 5. 137 Which is not part of household or municipal waste but an obvious and rising concern in urban regions. 138 Landfill Directive \u2013 target on biodegradable waste: reduction to 35% of levels attained in 1995 for landfill disposal \u2013 tobe met in 2016 repsectively 2020; Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive- recycling rates of 55% to 80%. ",
        "73 to be used as fuel, the BREF on waste treatment document covers the treatments that can be applied to make different types of waste suitable for the fuel quality required by different combustion processes. It is important to note that next to the BAT the JRC issues also guidance documents on Best Environmental Management Practice (BEMP). Generally speaking, the BEMPs are intended to provide information on frontrunner approaches in priority areas: waste management has been selected as one of these priority area and the study is expected to be commissioned in the short- term. It foresees inter alia an explicit focus on municipal solid waste and on construction and demolition waste 139 . In comparison to the BAT the BEMP intends to cover all steps of waste management from prevention over collection, re-use and treatment. In terms of treatment the distinct aspects of recycling, energy recovery and disposal should be subject of considerations. This BEMP could also become a valuable source of information for LRAs since it will provide also the explicit links to legislation and the respective BATs (on waste treatment and waste incineration). Summary: the role of BAT and BEMPS in an integrated EU Urban Agenda The key significance of BATs stems from the fact that these documents represent the viable compromise on emission limits between the major parties concerned, i.e. the Member States, the industries concerned, the environmental NGOs and the Commission. BATs represent also the tested results of state-of- the-art large-scale facilities. However, given the lengthy elaboration processes, the limits and approaches set in BREFs might require re-consideration during the negotiation process in order to act as drivers in technology development. Setting legal norms in favour of environmental protection has to be understood as an ongoing, dynamic process. In addition, the need for highly qualified staff in the public sector in order to act as competent authorities in the process is obvious. It is important to note that the majority of BREFs is directed at specific industries but in the context of the EU Urban Agenda three BREFs with potential relevance have been identified. Two of them refer to waste management, one to energy efficiency. The latter represents a horizontal approach in the series of BREFs. Waste management represents the largest single public investment item in environmental protection and thus it should be included in the approaches of an EU Urban Agenda. Moreover, the perspective of LRAs has also been subject of a CoR-Study. 139 Working paper on the scope of the future BEMP on Waste Management provided on the JRC website. ",
        "74 Since BATs in general do not prescribe any specific technology but point at environmental standards for large-scale industrial facilities it is hardly possible to derive a direct link to the implications for growth and jobs. In terms of mobilisation of LRAs as promoters of advanced technologies, the future BEMP on waste management could have an important role as resource and point of departure to foster LRA activities in the sector. ",
        "75 4 \u201cBusiness case\u201d of an integrated EU Urban Agenda The business case was built along the main policy fields of an EU Urban Agenda as defined in table 6. It mainly serves the purpose of raising awareness for important growth areas and their explicit or implicit urban dimension. It should help to outline the context of growth in which an EU Urban Agenda should be embedded. Looking at the quantitative dimension the weight of urban policies is evident: in 2020 about 389 million people (75.9% of the population) will live in urban areas in the EU and the trend will continue. In 2050 about 417 million are estimated to live in urban areas which accounts for 82.9% of the EU population. 140 It is also obvious that LRAs governing towns, cities and metropolises are facing multi-faceted challenges since urban areas consist of dense networks of respective layers of infrastructure representing significant public assets requiring permanent maintenance and often expansion. On the one hand, business activities and lifestyles are marked by an enormous diversity and at the same time best places for education and STI are concentrated in cities. On the other hand, social inequalities culminate in cities. Dense construction and sealed urban areas are most sensitive to the impacts of climate change. The heat-island effect influences people\u2019s health and well-being and thus the living quality of urban inhabitants. Cities aren\u2019t homogeneous and differences in its building structure, green areas and vegetation provide diverse possibilities for adaptation mechanisms that make them more or less resilient against climate change impacts. Density and close social interactions in the urban fabric make it more obvious that any action affecting one element will have repercussions on other elements. Nearly all policy fields at the level of the EU or at the level of the Member States (and eventually sub-national levels) matter for the development of cities and urban areas. Nevertheless, in total four, respectively five key cases or intervention areas are highlighted that are vital for the coming decades and include all relevant policy fields detected earlier (cf. figure 1): 140 World DataBank, Health Nutrition and Population Statistics: Population estimates and projections, http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx (06.11.2015). ",
        "76 \uf06e Urban economy , resource efficiency and social fabric 141 \u2013 the three areas can also be understood as thematic clusters, each cluster comprising several policy elements understood in the sense of more traditional sectoral policies. \uf06e Transport is considered as a transversal theme for urban areas. \uf06e Modern urban governance is understood in a broad sense as the capacity to administer and govern the urban territory over cross-sector coordination implementing participatory approaches and more open forms of government in order to attract the interest of a diverse society. Figure 4. Key cases vital for the coming decades Source: Metis GmbH. A closer look into the five intervention areas that are outlined below reveal also the challenges in terms of feasibility since in many fields, policy interventions are seen as quite a sensitive issue. One has to keep in mind that: \uf06e Feasible policy responses are always marked by compromises and 141 The term social fabric means the composite demographics of a defined area. It consists of its ethnic composition, wealth, education level, employment rate and regional values (cf. www.businessdictionary.com). For the present study, the term is considered as most suitable for the respective business case. ",
        "77 \uf06e National and EU-wide frameworks matter or are even decisive to further the implementation of crucial interventions at the level of LRAs. For example, stand-alone ground-breaking initiatives of LRAs might be expected in certain fields of resource efficiency. Nevertheless, in some of these fields effective policy responses will only be possible with the \u2018backing\u2019 of national and EU policies. 4.1 Business Case Urban Economy Urban areas are the economic drivers of regions and Member States. They host resources and provide the critical mass of knowhow and technology in order to serve the whole value chain of market products. The key to urban economy is the availability of labour force, knowhow as well as a selling market. Urban areas overtake the role of gravitation centres attracting companies as well as people. In Europe, urbanisation started with industrialisation. Nowadays with the dramatic decline of production in Europe 142 some cities, especially in Eastern Europe, which have been industrial dominated are losing their gravitation power and are starting to shrink. This phenomenon first defined in the USA asks for new concepts and city management. Consequently, today European cities are defined by lower industrial influence and dominated by the service sector. The service sector for example depends heavily on ICT networks. With the urban wide supply of high speed ICT network, cities have a distinct advantage over rural areas and smaller towns. Several different parameters influence urban economy today. A model framework of urban economy including selected policy fields is provided below. The light blue fields are those where any EU Urban Agenda could provide impulses. 142 LSE 2006, Transforming cities across Europe. ",

        "79 Urban economy can be seen as an economic laboratory where different parameters are available to develop the urban living conditions. Besides the environmental aspects, which are covered in a specific case, there are several policies that are directly linked to urban economy. They are mainly dominated by national and regional responsibilities with some horizontal directives from the European Commission site. Some strategies and legislative acts of the European Union are: \uf06e Europe 2020 objectives. \uf06e Poverty reduction and inclusion strategy. \uf06e Non-discrimination and equal treatment directive. \uf06e Stability and Growth Pact. \uf06e Small business act. \uf06e Public procurement. \uf06e State aid . The European Commission has numerous programmes that should operate as initiatives to boost education, the labour market, research and ICT development in the amiable direction: \uf06e ERDF as well as the ESF supporting ICT infrastructure, and labour market. \uf06e In the field of education there are several different funding opportunities provided by the European Commission (ERDF, ESF, ERASMUS). \uf06e In the field of research and development the main programme is HORIZON 2020 as well as COSME for SMEs. \uf06e Regarding the improvement of ICT networks in Europe, the Connecting Europe Facility has been established, co-funded by ERDF and ESF. There are no urban specific strategies, legal acts or programmes other than the thematic area of integrated urban development, which forms a small part of the ESI-Funds 2014-2020. The main actors regarding urban economy are those who govern the area together with active economic actors. These include private and public organisations as well as all people involved in the labour market. Local governments therefore are to support the best possible interaction between all actors and need to assure that the urban area provides an adequate basis. In this respect local authorities face the following challenges: 143 \uf06e Understand the local economic drivers. 143 LGAT 2013, The role of local governance, Exploring the roles of local governance, Discussion paper 2013. ",
        "80 \uf06e Understand the weaknesses, vulnerabilities and opportunities. \uf06e Spend budget the best possible way to support economy. \uf06e Seek to broaden the economic base. \uf06e Establish strategic alliances. \uf06e Create networks. Local governments are directly involved in the success and failure of economic aspects. The pressure of economic situations and financial shortages are the first to recognise. There are two key parameters available for local authorities to address: \uf06e Provide an economy friendly environment with providing positive living conditions and \uf06e Support business development. In both cases the local authorities need to be flexible and have to be open for unorthodox concepts. The nature of legislation and political competition often thwart long-term decisions. The key element hampering long-term initiatives, which might not be popular, are political elections and political competitions. Especially in federal states these seem to be the brake for improvements and developments. 4.1.1 Living conditions Urban areas and cities are in a worldwide competition when it comes to company headquarters settlements in all sectors, high quality labour force and economic and living attractiveness. Especially the latter is recently the subject of several rankings such as the smart city ranking. The concept of a liveable city is seen to be strongly related to attractiveness for high quality labour forces, headquarters and researchers. According to several sources \u2018liveability\u2019 should express the \u2018 city's ability to be responsive to the needs of its inhabitants around certain key areas\u2019 144 . \uf06e Infrastructure and natural environment. \uf06e Social stability. \uf06e Low criminalisation. \uf06e Recreational opportunities. \uf06e Educational opportunities. \uf06e Support for mental health and marginalized populations. 144 http://www.citiesforpeople.ca/en/projects/livability. ",
        "81 These are main factors, which lie in the responsibility of local authorities, with the exception of education and health. The liveability of a city does require financial resources, which are scarce. There are several interventions possible, e.g. investments in security, integration, buildings and open space as well as other infrastructure. Another approach is the integrated development of urban areas and neighbourhoods, which stands for a cross sectoral approach involving different stakeholders from citizens to companies. Integrated urban development is difficult to measure and sometimes long lasting. Thus integrated projects are often used for improvement of neighbourhoods in order to attract economic stakeholders. One major source of improvement of city areas, which are not attractive to business development, is again the ERDF with its budget for integrated urban development. The budget however is very small and can only serve as an incentive. In times with scarce public budgets, proactive public initiatives of citizens are sometimes the only source for change. The key responsibility of urban and local administration is to support those initiatives rather than hamper them with legal barriers. Small budgeted projects for integrated urban development are instruments to trigger such initiatives. Evidence for sound local policies that improve living conditions needs information on social aspects such as welfare, the individual housing situation, health conditions and social benefits but also negative influences on wellbeing such as the local concentration of traffic accidents and criminal offences. On the basis of a European survey, Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), welfare indicators are compiled that contain data on these aspects. 145 Providing the framework for self-responsibility of citizens helps to empower neighbourhoods and improve the attractiveness of the neighbourhood. Such developments become independent and soon reach a level where private investment is getting attracted. The easiest and fastest way to reach citizens is via ICT-Platforms. ICT platforms are able to provide a powerful tool for triggering activities amongst city actors (see for example the Amsterdam Smart City platform presented in the next Box). 145 http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics- explained/index.php/Glossary:EU_statistics_on_income_and_living_conditions_(EU-SILC).

Where local companies together with the Almere Economic Development Board develop a facility which, amongst other things, will promote more efficient urban management, innovation and economic growth, strong social cohesion and sustainable development. According to the project description the smart connections can also generate substantial cost savings in running the city. For example, the local urban management processes will be supported by an intelligent digital infrastructure for the exchange of information, services and applications between all municipal departments in areas such as public safety, traffic and mobility, waste management and the coordination of relief efforts in the event of disruptions, incidents or disasters in the city. 4.1.2 Business development Business development and most of all support of entrepreneurship is a key element in urban economy. However, the European economic environment does not provide an adequate framework for easy entrepreneurship. Highly over- bureaucratic and risk-averse European Member States do not adequately support innovative people willing to start business. The European Commission provides several different tools in order to motivate Member States to improve the legal and administrative framework. However, one key element hampering entrepreneurship is bank conditions defined in the Basel Accords. The result is a limited access to credits and venture capital for micro enterprises and SMEs and almost no capital for entrepreneurs. The European Commission as well as Member States fill this gap with grants provided via intermediaries. Several other different solutions are emerging in Europe starting with crowd funding, peer-to-peer lending, angel investors 147 etc. Those forms of finances require new forms of business support, which also asks for involvement of public authorities. Several projects in the UK have supported multi-used business facilities for micro enterprises and entrepreneurs (see Box below). 146 http://amsterdamsmartcity.com/projects/detail/id/30/slug/almere-smart-society 147 http://www.businesszone.co.uk/community-voice/blogs/marketinvoice/5-alternatives-to-traditional-bank- finance . ",
        "83 Public administration has successfully involved private companies in supporting the projects. The general character of interventions supporting business development are: \uf06e the provision of facilities for start-ups and entrepreneurs, \uf06e networking with innovation centres and universities as well as \uf06e establishing partnerships across the administrative border with other public authorities and with private actors. Box 9. Example for local authorities' role in economic growth in the UK 148 Economic development has become a major local government activity in the UK. Radical changes to the economy have left many areas with little alternative but to act to regenerate their economies. A range of policies has been adopted in relation to land clearance, retail development, public transport, roads, housing, and marketing. As government capital grant reduces and access to traditional bank finance becomes harder for the private sector to raise, councils are exploring opportunities for new ways to lever investment to support growth including from pension funds and more flexibility to be active in the bond markets. Pro-growth policies are the norm in many areas, particularly where unemployment is high. For example, Wychavon Council took part in a joint venture with Waitrose to acquire land and build a supermarket in a previously run-down high street with an out-of-date 1970s precinct. Waitrose had been having problems with land acquisition. The joint venture allowed the project to be completed and improve trading conditions within the town centre. Calderdale has been working to diversify the local economy away from a traditional reliance on financial services and manufacturing. An Economic Task Force managed a \u00a32.8 million fund for small projects to stimulate the economy. The Task Force has commissioned over 60 projects from the private, public and voluntary sectors, encouraging start-ups, social enterprises, Community Asset Transfers and innovative projects such as Business Growth Calderdale, Totally Locally, Creative Calderdale and Silver Entrepreneurs. So far, this activity has created more than 150 businesses and supported 900 other new-starts, creating over 500 jobs and drawing in private sector investment of over \u00a32.9 million. Halton is a member of The Halton Employment Partnership (HEP) which brings together expertise from various employment, learning and skills development agencies to support inward investors and local businesses 148 Local Government Association 2012, Local government\u2019s role in promoting economic growth Removing unnecessary barriers to success.

The HEP was approached in May 2011 to meet with the Regeneration Partnership Manager of Tesco Stores Limited and the local Job Centre Plus to discuss the recruitment of staff and identify the support HEP could offer to this recruitment drive. The partners of HEP established and managed a hotline through which applicants could apply for places to join interviews skills workshops. Attendees received a numeracy and literacy assessment, a session on interview skills and techniques and training on the completion of application forms. As a direct consequence, Tesco invited 100 candidates to join their workforce. 4.2 Business Case Urban Resource Efficiency Inherent different contexts of urban areas allow and require targeted approaches to solve urban challenges. Any EU Urban Agenda needs to acknowledge the differences in city structure, location, temperature zone, culture, economic situation etc. Some of those contextual parameters are able to be influenced others are not. Nevertheless, a toolbox which allows for different urban types to develop tailor made solutions should be developed. Urban resource efficiency comprises a vast field of different aspects. The main resources involved in city consumption are land, water and energy. For all three thematic fields specific contextual aspects have to be considered. Urban areas are responsible for the majority of the resource consumption due to the concentration of households and industries combined with transport concentration. Almost 80% of energy consumption is linked to urban activities 149 . Improvements can be made to the energy mix by making changes to the way municipalities use resources for power production combined with increased efficiency as well as a more efficient use of resources. Resources are managed by key parameters covering technical infrastructure, economically driven supply chains and legal frameworks. These three parameters apply to all different types of urban areas but solutions to adjust those parameters should be individually developed according to the regional and local context. Instruments for local and regional actors are interventions in various fields addressing aspects related to resource efficiency. Interventions address education as well as technical and legal adjustments in order to reach the required outputs. Those outputs can be predefined in the EU Urban Agenda. The way to achieve them needs to be context driven and individual. Outputs need to be measurable and based on easily available data. The need to compare different 149 Covenant of Mayors 2014, Reducing Energy Dependence in European Cities. ",
        "85 cities is only secondary. Example for outputs are changes in the legal framework as well as local and regional supplier projects improving efficiency and the use of renewable resources. Resulting impacts are not easy to measure. The EU Urban Agenda can lead and indicate different types of impacts that are desirable. A general aim should be to improve local and regional supply changes that are addressing the local conditions, or the increase of behaviour regarding a circular use of resources. The following model shows the principle logic of urban resource efficiency and where a potential EU Urban Agenda can support. As an example, it includes a choice of three main important policies. The light blue fields are those where any EU Urban Agenda could provide impulses. ",
        "Figure 6. Resource consumption model Source: Metis GmbH. ",
        "87 Obviously some regulative parameters have a higher impact on resource efficiency than others and more importantly cities do not always have the same influence on these parameters. Therefore, it is important to highlight those parameters which are first, having a high impact on resource efficiency and second, local administrations are able to play an active role and are able to make a difference with a set of interventions. The following key elements for change can be extracted out of the model above: \uf06e Transport (see case below). \uf06e Building efficiency. \uf06e Land use. Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that inherent challenges such as a competing role of cities for national investment in large-scale infrastructures (such as STI facilities) as well as strict environmental standards, which when applied on business buildings might deter investors or might lead to delocalisation of businesses. 4.2.1 Building efficiency According to recent studies, buildings account for 40% of the total energy use and 36% of Europe\u2019s CO 2 emissions 150 . This includes all kind of buildings and the energy consumption varies between the type of building and the age of the building. There are several measures in place as to how to reduce energy consumption, such as: \uf06e adequate insulation, \uf06e double glazing, \uf06e green facades, \uf06e energy generation in buildings such as solar power. Again the way to retrofit a building needs to be adjusted to the context of the area. Several aspects such as the location of the building, the urban climate as well as the age of the building need to be considered. 35% of the buildings in the European Union are older than 50 years. According to the Commission, energy consumption could be improved by 5% - 6% when targeting those buildings 151 . Besides retrofitting buildings, which would address a majority of all buildings in the European Union, standards need to be set and implemented for new buildings. Notwithstanding the necessity of retrofitting old residential buildings, 150 Covenant of Mayors 2014, Reducing Energy Dependence in European Cities. 151 European Commission DG Energy, https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency/buildings. ",
        "88 the construction of new office buildings for example still lacks the potentials of energy efficiency. In most cases office buildings are built to the lowest possible budget eliminating additional costs to the disadvantage of potential energy savings. Retrofitting buildings forms a major impact on resource efficiency. There are different levels of influence for local and regional authorities regarding the regulative parameters. First of all there are differences between public and private buildings. Renovation in public buildings is a matter of financial sources and can be conducted within the administrative framework of public authorities. Public buildings owned by different levels of public authorities are state owned or owned by municipalities. Different levels of administrations have access to different financial sources. More difficult to regulate are renovations of private buildings such as dwellings as well as business and industry. In the first case financial incentives as well as the increase of energy costs based on legal adjustments are the only two instruments available for local authorities. In terms of commercial and industry also incentives are one form of instrument, together with regulative instruments requiring companies to adapt buildings and follow specific regulations for new buildings. Again different administrative levels are responsible for the implementation. And in most cases local authorities have the least influence due to the fact that the legal framework as well as the financial sources lie in the responsibility of EU and/or national level. The legal framework regarding building renovation is heavily dominated by EU laws and strategies, i.e.: \uf06e Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings. \uf06e Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency. \uf06e Guidelines accompanying the Delegated Regulation 2012/244/EU. \uf06e European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan). \uf06e Investment in the Technologies of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan. \uf06e COM(2010) 639 final, Energy 2020 A Strategy for competitive, sustainable and secure energy, Brussels, 21.12.2010. \uf06e COM(2015) 80 final, A Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy, Br\u00fcssel,25.2.2015. \uf06e COM (2010) 265, Analysis of options to move beyond 20% greenhouse gas emission reductions and assessing the risk of carbon leakage . The European Union is also active in the areas of energy research, development and promotion via initiatives such as CEPHEUS (ultra-low energy housing), and ",
        "89 programmes under the umbrella titles of SAVE (energy saving) ALTENER (new and renewable energy sources) and STEER (transport). Member States are obliged to implement the legal directives with only a limited scope for individual adjustments. The implementation of the legal framework at the national level puts a significant financial pressure on regional and local authorities. To implement the energy efficiency directive means that from 1 January 2014, 3 % of the total floor area of heated and/or cooled buildings owned by central governments must be renovated each year. The need for retrofitting buildings expands the financial sources of local communities and municipalities. The idea of private financing has not been successful so far. Therefore the implementation of the building efficiency directive requires a lot more financial sources and effort than currently involved. Funding opportunities for urban areas regarding energy efficiency in buildings are mainly concentrated on cohesion policy instruments and the programme \u2018Intelligent Energy\u2019. Moreover, the ERDF plays a powerful role with \u20ac11.5 billion dedicated to energy 152 . Nevertheless, compared to the need of building renovation it is still just an incentive and Member States have to carry the heavy weight. Private financing so far has not been very successfully implemented. Yet public Private Partnership models have been started and are supported by financial suppliers. The involvement of the private sector needs to be enhanced in order to support public authorities in their efforts. To involve private financial partners there are \u2013 depending on the specific building sector \u2013 different instruments necessary. 153 The main drivers are public procurement, incentives, legal requirements and standardisations. For example, public authorities are able to influence the building sector at least in terms of public buildings by conducting Green Public procurement, which offers a significant opportunity for local authorities to improve their overall energy consumption performance. Those different instruments are situated at different administrative levels. Finally local administrations are able to reach the communities more directly and address behavioural changes through awareness raising . These soft measures are sometimes the only instrument local administrations have available. 152 European Commission, DG Regio, cohesion policy Data, https://cohesiondata.ec.europa.eu/. 153 Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group 2014, Energy Efficiency - the first fuel for the EU Economy.

Examples for awareness raising in Latvia and Lithuania 154 Energy maps for smart residents Beyond leading big refurbishment projects, municipalities can also encourage residents to improve their own homes. For example, Riga has made available online the annual heat consumption of over 2,500 district heated residential buildings. Similarly, Vilnius has developed an online interactive building energy consumption map, which evaluates and compares the heat consumption of buildings with regards to the previous year. The aim is to encourage residential building renovation and investment in the city, as all owners and tenants can find out how much their building costs them per year and how it compares to similar properties in their neighbourhood. So far, 492 blocks of flats have been renovated. Moreover, this online tool allows people looking for a new home to choose the most energy efficient option. 4.2.2 Land use Urban areas can only improve their efficiency when using their agglomeration advantages. The city density and structure plays an important role in this context. Since 1950 European cities have grown with increasing wealth and 154 Covenant of Mayors 2014, Reducing Energy Dependence in European Cities. ",
        "91 increasing demand for homestead. As a result, air pollution in city centres and urban sprawl are now a common phenomenon throughout Europe. Moreover, there is no apparent slowing in these trends. South, east and central parts of Europe are particularly of risk 155 . Land use and urban sprawls are the second thematic area where local and regional authorities are able to make a real change. Land use and urban sprawl are key sources of resource consumption starting from the use of natural resources. Suburbs require a lot more effort to link them to the city centres, infrastructure and finally energy networks. The general causes of urban sprawls are: \uf06e Lower land rates. \uf06e Demand for open space. \uf06e Lack of urban planning. \uf06e Lower house tax rates. \uf06e Rise in population growth. \uf06e Consumer preferences. All of the above listed causes are either directly or indirectly influenceable. Even the consumer preferences can be changed as several examples in the USA try to establish with their smart growth initiatives 156 . Urban sprawl can be directly managed by land use plans and cooperation across administrative borders for example in order to adjust tax levels across administrative borders. Different to energy there is no legal framework related to land use at the European Union level. Most of the legal framework lies at the national level or even below, at the regional level. The responsibilities and potentials seem to be unused or poorly used. The main instrument at the local level are zoning plans and building permissions. The latter are in many cases issued either without a zoning plan or without diligence considering sustainable urban development. The main impulse issuing new building permissions are economic factors. Municipalities are often in competition for tax revenues and fiscal policies which are based on population and households. Environmental and resource efficiency do not play a significant role in this situations. Main regulative instruments are either legal changes, changes in responsibilities as well as incentives for municipalities to improve their urban development reducing land use and urban sprawl. 155 JRC and EEA 2006, Urban sprawl in Europe. The ignored challenge, EEA Report No 10/2006. 156 http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org . ",
        "92 Incentives for administrations to reduce urban sprawl could for example be specific funding schemes combined with conditionalities (e.g. zoning planning including a strategic environmental assessment). The main driver for citizens to reduce demand for suburban dwellings can be the improvement of inner city neighbourhoods and the improvement of open and green space in cities, incentives for inner city investments as well as the legal change in order to reduce the possibility of urban sprawl. Figure 8. Level of influence on smart growth Source: Metis GmbH. Several studies have already investigated linkages between urban forms, resident lifestyle patterns and associated energy consumption within selected neighbourhoods. 157 A major trend appearing in European cities is the movements of major industry outside of cities and the availability of a significant size of land within city areas. Former industrial sites as well as transport hubs are either transferred outside the cities or reduced and combined. The areas left behind are high valued urban land which opens the opportunity for cities and urban areas to increase density and reduce barriers. The new developments are based on master plans acknowledging the principle of short distances and work-life combinations. 157 The CANMET Energy Technology Centre developed its Canadian Urban Archetypes Project in 2004. ",
        "93 In cases where urban sprawl has already become evident another approach needs to be adapted which forms the suburban areas mainly characterised by 100% dwellings with a lot of commuting transport to the city centre. Those areas should be treated as separate suburban areas with an own development plan including the change of the area structure towards the better mix of utilisation. Box 11. Example of smart city development against urban sprawl in Vienna 158 The city of Vienna develops a compact urban area for around 20,000 inhabitants and 20,000 jobs for working and living. The Aspern\u2019s Vienna Urban Lakeside 159 has been a former airport with 240ha situated within the administrative borders of Vienna. The project allows for a controlled inner city development providing housing for different kinds of demands in different price levels including social housing. The concept has a high level of public transport access as well a high-quality supply of open and green space. The city of Vienna as such has the advantage of being the biggest owner of dwellings in the city. With this the city is able to influence residence markets as well as react and manipulate the demand site. Box 12. Reshaping bedroom communities in the Netherlands 160 Another answer to urban sprawl is the aim to change the settlements, which are dominated by dwellings into compact functional urban areas with short ways and a certain self-development. For this purpose Dutch administrations started to develop suburban development plans for urban areas which have the reputation as being a bedroom community. The redevelopment of such communities into compact urban areas takes time and patience. 4.3 Business Case Urban Social Fabric The governance challenge related to the urban social fabric 161 or in other words \u2013 combating social exclusion and marginalisation in urban regions \u2013 ranks among probably the determining factors for public finances in the coming decades. If public efforts \u2013 in terms of spending efficiency and effectiveness - in areas such as education, social affairs and education fail, one has to expect far- reaching implications for policy-making, social welfare and societal 158 He, D. et al. 2015, Being a smart city: the case of Vienna and Seestadt Aspern. 159 http://www.aspern-seestadt.at/. 160 Kroon, H.J.J. 1999, ESPESP Urban-Rural Partnership. Case Study Groningen, The Netherlands. 161 With an expected share of urban population of about 70% in 2020 it is evident that the most pressing need for targeted public spending on key issues related to the social fabric is and will be dominated by urban regions. ",
        "94 developments. As will be shown the European welfare state rests to a significant extent on public spending for the key policy levers in education, social affairs and health. According to data in 2013 these three items of general government expenditure together account for dominant shares of public spending across the EU. Next to the quantitative weight of the sectors in public spending several long-term trends as well as recent developments point at the fact that the overall spending will have to increase in order to maintain the current status. In other words stagnation would mean a rising challenge for policy delivery. A decrease in spending on these items \u2013 if not paired with significant efficiency gains - will reveal adverse impacts on the social fabric in a short- to mid-term perspective. Table 9.

Almost one third of the GDP of EU-28 is spent on these key policy levers in the context of the social fabric. Also public expenditures at the level of LRAs are dominated by social policies. In the context of the EU Urban Agenda it is important to highlight the importance of Subnational Governments or LRAs . 165 It is obvious that these budgetary items are highly dependent on demographics and political pressures. When taking a closer look at public spending for education, social and health affairs it becomes clear that these spending areas also dominate the public finances at LRA level. As can be seen in the figure below, at least one of the three government functions \u2013 respectively policy areas \u2013 accounts for the highest shares in subnational public finances. 165 Throughout the EU subnational governments (SNG) represent visible shares of public spending in most Member States. In 2012, SNG expenditure accounted on average for 17% of GDP and 40% of public spending in the OECD: within the EU the differences between Member States are remarkable with Denmark being in leading position \u2013 with almost 38% of GDP spent by SNGs, a number of federal countries revealing percentages between 15% (Italy and Austria), 20% (Germany) and 23% (Belgium), GR marks the lowest percentage (3%).

        "96 Figure 9. Breakdown of subnational government spending according to economic functions Source: OECD, Regions at a Glance 2013, Figure 3.2. Also a recent review of the National Reform Programmes (NRP) 2015 166 reveals a marked role of LRAs related to labour, employment as well as social inclusion policies in the national pathway towards EU 2020. These policy fields rank also among those that are most frequently referred to when it comes to the role of LRAs in the NRP. The trend towards an increasing role of the LRAs in the social agenda is ambivalent: \uf06e On the one hand an understandable approach since the LRAs, from the perspective of subsidiarity, are close to those in need of support and most 166 Metis 2015a, The role of Local and Regional Authorities in the Implementation of Europe 2020. 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Greece Italy Denmark Portugal France Luxembourg Finland Spain Austria Sweden Germany Ireland Poland Hungary Netherlands Czech Republic Belgium United Kingdom Slovenia Estonia Slovak Republic Education Social protection General public services Health Economic affairs Housing and community amenities Other ",
        "97 probably policies developed at this level will be more efficient and targeted but \uf06e On the other hand it is evident that budgetary endowments must be adequate in order to cope with the tasks at hand; the incidence and social consequences of lacking budget will be first felt at the local level particularly in deprived urban areas with high concentrations of poverty. A second point is that a strong role of LRAs in social protection, health and education is particularly challenging for stagnating or shrinking cities due to the tendency towards vicious cycles which are exacerbated by degrading levels of public services in health, housing and education. In terms of policy levers it is obvious that the major role in the policies mentioned is in the hands of Member States in terms of competencies as well as financial and policy levers. Characteristics of the urban social fabric Cities have always been a combination of centres of opportunities and concentrations of social problems. This combination confronts cities with important challenges [\u2026]. 167 The social fabric of cities is marked by sharp contrasts: \uf06e Cities offer the broadest range of education offers throughout all levels of education attainments and in urban areas one will find the most divergent quality of schools owing to the fact that urban regions host mostly expensive private schools as well as public schools with high shares of children with migrant background in less wealthy neighbourhoods. \uf06e Cities reveal the most diverse job offers ranging from the highest skill requirements in headquarter functions respectively in the quarterly sector, as opposed to an enormous range of precarious jobs in low-wage sectors. \uf06e Urban labour markets show the sharpest income and wage gradients. For example, one of the effects of rising costs of living and stagnating wage incomes is the dwindling of the middle class and the rise of an urban precariat which are alarming tendencies for the social cohesion in urban areas. 168 167 Cf. EUKN 2014, The Inclusive City. Approaches to Combat Social Exclusion in Europe. 168 CF. EUKN, 2014, p. 19. ",
        "98 \uf06e Urban regions, in particular those in Western Europe, reveal the most expensive housing estates as well as areas marked by deprivation, outmigration of wealthier inhabitants and an influx of migrant population. \uf06e In general, the urban social fabric is marked by changes in demography and life style , i.e. decreasing numbers of traditional families and numerous phenomena with strong implications for social protection. What is meant is rising numbers of elderly persons and single pensioner households, childless households and a trend towards less predictable family respectively partnership arrangements (divorced parents, blended families, one-parent families, same sex partnerships, etc.). \uf06e The pace of economic and societal changes in urban regions is accelerating. A trend, which provides constantly new economic opportunities, is paired with a rising risk of poverty for vulnerable groups. The urban economic fabric is strongly determined by the urban social fabric. This is most visibly reflected in spatial segregation within urban regions which leads to degradation of areas with a high concentration of low-income households. This can be interpreted through selection processes in the housing market but also by causation processes since a concentration of poverty will tend to exacerbate the effects of poverty. 169 Throughout Europe there are numerous examples of cities that managed to revitalise such areas albeit such strategies do not always include flanking measures for social inclusion. Such developments are often driven by developments on urban real estate markets. The nucleus and key momentum in many urban development projects is the availability of larger development zones due to former industrial estates and the corresponding public investment efforts such as upgrading public transport connections (e.g. the expansion of the underground network). Strategies without flanking measures will tend to shift urban poverty within the metropolitan area but will not reduce it: counteracting social inclusion calls for integrated approaches. Urban poverty \u2013 a marked phenomenon in EU-15 In general the risk of poverty and social exclusion has risen in the previous years. 170 In 2012 one in four or 124 million EU citizens were at risk of poverty 169 Cf. EUKN, 2014, p. 5. 170 Cf. EUKN 2014, p. 4: according to the EU 2020 Strategy the risk should be measured by the so-called AROPE-rate, The rate refers to three decisive criteria: at risk of poverty (AROP) describing the income- poverty line (below 60% of the median income at national level), severely materially deprived (SMD) and/or living in a household with low work intensity (LWI). Further explanation is to be found in the glossary. ",
        "99 (AROP). This accounts for an increase of 10 million compared to 2009 171 . The groups most prone to the risk are similar throughout the Member States 172 . A marked territorial characteristic in the EU is the difference in urban poverty between the EU-15 and the EU-12. In 2011, people living in cities in the EU-15 were at greater risk of poverty or social exclusion than those living outside cities, while the opposite is true in the EU-12. The AROPE-rate increased between 2008 and 2011 by 1 percentage point in European cities, compared to an increase of 0.5 percentage points outside of cities. Due to the impact of global processes of structural economic shifts, the retreating welfare state, demographic changes and sub-urbanisation on the EU countries and cities, the labour market structure has become unfavourable to lower skilled workers, jobs have become more precarious, wages keep declining and social protection schemes are being hollowed out. 173 This trend is particularly marked in Northwestern Europe where towns, suburbs and rural areas reveal higher employment rates and lower unemployment rates than cities. Recent Eurostat data have investigated the correlation between the degree of urbanisation and unemployment rates. It confirms the tendencies mentioned above. In 14 Member States the unemployment rate in urban regions is higher than in in rural regions. 174 The table gives an overview on the sharp differences between EU-15 and EU-12. Table 10.

When looking at the urban dimension the economic crisis in these countries did not exclude the agglomerations. The capital regions of Greece, Bulgaria, Croatia and Cyprus 175 have recorded contractions of the employment rates of more than 5% in the period 2009-2014. 176 Youth unemployment 177 peaks in the regions of Spain (53.2%), Greece (52.4%), Croatia (45.5%) and Italy (42.7%) although a slight decline of the rates in these Member States over the period 2012-2014 can be observed. A major concern in this context is the rising number of people NEET with a share of 16.3% in the EU-28 in 2014. 178 Long-term unemployment 179 points at structural challenges in the labour market. Generally speaking these rates are lowest in the Nordic countries, i.e. Finland, Sweden and Denmark. The statistical facts point at a wide variation among the MS and its capital regions. 180 In general the highest rates were recorded in those MS which have been hit hardest by the crisis. Among the capital regions the highest rates have been recorded for Greece, Croatia and Belgium. 181 Another phenomenon that marks the social fabric of deprived urban neighbourhoods is in-work-poverty or in more technical terms the occurrence of very low-income households 182 . The phenomenon is most common in single- person households with dependent children. 183 Major policy levers for an inclusive EU Urban Agenda The most important policy levers respectively instruments of the EU in this context are: \uf06e Cohesion policy targets the objective of social cohesion in particular through the European Social Fund (ESF) with a global budget of \u20ac84 billion for the period 2014-2020.

In the period 2007-2013, the most prominent objectives in ESF-funding were 184 : preventive measures within the labour market; developing pathways for integration and re-entry into employment for disadvantaged people; and providing support for self-employment and business start-ups. In this context important ancillary measures in deprived urban neighbourhoods can be funded from ERDF. \uf06e Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) with an allocation of around \u20ac6 billion 185 for the period 2014-2020 is intended to support young people 186 NEET. The Initiative is open for all regions that reveal a youth unemployment rate above 25%. It is the financial instrument related to the Youth Employment Package and the Youth Guarantee 187 . The policy instruments at the EU level are of crucial importance since these have to be additional and complementary to national measures and have to be considered as investment policies. Significant parts of spending for social protection at the Member State level are public expenditures for old-age pensions and unemployment benefits. In the context of an EU Urban Agenda two main policy levers for social inclusion respectively combating urban poverty will be highlighted in the following: \uf06e Education. \uf06e Housing. A further important policy lever is the provision of health services but in the view of the Consultant the urban dimension and the role of LRAs in the provision of health services is less marked compared to the areas of education and housing. In any case the scope of the study allows only for a brief reflection of major urban policy aspects in the case of education and housing. There is a strong rationale to focus such policies on urban areas due to several reasons: 184 Cf. Eurostat, Regional Statistical Yearbook 2014, p. 95. 185 Thereof \u20ac3 billion from a specific budget line and \u20ac3 billion from the ESF. 186 Aged 15 to 24 years. 187 Council Recommendation from April 2013 with the aim to ensure that all young people under 25 years should get a good-quality offer within four months of them leaving formal education (job, apprenticeship, traineeship or continued education). ",
        "102 \uf06e The quantitative aspect : The dominant share of population in urban areas and thereof an even more marked concentration of poverty in urban areas in the EU-15 confirms the magnitude of the challenge - one can say that the majority of Member States is strongly affected. \uf06e Youth as the economic future : Urban societies will be in the long run the younger European population and thus be the decisive economic asset. Given the current situation access to the labour market is decisive in allowing participation in future economic pathways \u2013 a key requirement to contain immanent social risks. \uf06e Cities offer diverse opportunities : Cities are a strong basis for such policies due to their relative economic strength, the inherent strive for innovation, as well as the concentration and broad range of institutions and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) such as in education, training, qualification. Thus, cities offer significant potentialities related to social upward mobility and self-realisation. 4.3.1 Education The role of education in containing and reducing poverty risk is quite undisputed. Next to enhanced labour market opportunities, education also triggers positive \u2018spill-overs\u2019 such as one of the levers towards a healthier and more active population. It is an element that is crucial for urban societies and the urban economy, which largely rests on the knowledge base of its citizens. Schooling can be the lever to break intergenerational cycles of disadvantage provided that it is acknowledged as a governing principle in national schooling systems. The previous considerations on the urban social fabric and in particular on the manifold aspects of urban poverty reveal a challenging environment for education institutions in an urban context. The challenge is exacerbated in deprived urban neighbourhoods with concentrations of dwellers being at risk of poverty. In education as a measure to contain poverty risk, the LRAs are pivotal since it is the local and regional levels, which in most Member States are responsible for the first steps in institutional education. In short, the role of primary and secondary schools is crucial in terms of integration and prevention of marginalisation and exclusion. Education \u2013 next to social housing \u2013 is one of the most effective public investments in order to contain poverty risks. In economic terms it is marked by ",
        "103 rising cost per pupils 188 which is mainly due to rising staff cost. The trend towards a cost increase is impeded by demographics, i.e. declining birth rates, and cutbacks of public budgets. At the same time education as an active inclusion measure usually requires additional efforts which, in turn, will in most cases require additional public incentives even if such efforts are community- based. An apparent challenge is also to motivate skilled persons to the education sector. In many countries the wage levels for teachers are quite low despite the rising skill requirements in order to cope with an increasingly diverse urban community. 189 There is widespread consensus that formal schooling has to be started at an early stage of childhood in order to prove effectiveness in containing poverty risks 190 : A crucial feature when designing programmes focused on the learning experiences of individuals is their timing. Over the years, a substantial body of evidence has accumulated that testifies to the importance of programmes targeted at pre-school children from disadvantaged background. Primary and secondary schooling is usually provided free of charge but still schooling involves cost and in reality there exists even other barriers for disadvantaged groups: 191 Yet many children and young people are faced with a multitude of difficulties, deriving either from intergenerational poverty and socioeconomic status, or from discrimination based on other grounds, such as gender, race, ethnicity, disability etc., as well as changes in the accessibility and fairness of school systems. Inequalities at school are a growing reality across Europe, mirroring overall inequalities in our societies. One way out of these challenges is the encouragement of respectively the support to so-called community-based approaches, which stresses the importance of education as a shared responsibility between parents, teachers and pupils. These approaches have been developed and used in many deprived urban neighbourhoods. One aspect of such approaches is the dedicated support to the integration of young migrants, which comprises a range of actions. The following table provides examples that should illustrate the broad possibilities of options. 188 6,800 Purchasing Power Standards (PPS) per pupil in 2011 which represents a rise of 15% when compared to 2006; cf. http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics explained/index.php/Educational_expenditure_statistics. 189 This is a fact in many EU-12 countries; but also e.g. Austria is currently facing a lack of teaching staff which has resulted in re-training offers for persons. 190 Machin, S. 2006, p. 5. 191 EAPN 2013, Youth Poverty and Social Exclusion in Europe, p. 13.

The author of the collection underlines the need for approaches that are close to the everyday reality of education. The major effort but also the key to success is to establish and maintain the dialogue between the programme institutions and the migrant communities.

        "105 Box 13. Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP), Ireland An example of a community-based approach on a large scale has been developed with the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in Ireland for the period 2015-2017. 192 The programme is part- financed from ESF including a special allocation from the YEI and it will be implemented e.g. in parts of the capital city Dublin. It is an area-based approach focussing on three main goals, i.e. firstly empowering disadvantaged communities, secondly Life Long Learning (LLL) and thirdly Employment. The delivery mechanism foresees the close interaction between the Contracting Authority (Department of the Environment, Community and Local Development at national level) and the so-called Local Community Development Committees. The latter foresees a broad participation of actors at the local level. The so-called programme implementer (CSOs, consortia etc. plus the Local Authority) concludes the contract and is responsible for delivery to the Authority. The programme foresees a dual approach, i.e. the programme targets both communities of need (area-based) and individuals of need (issue-based). Communities living in disadvantaged areas are a particular focus and for this reason it is a requirement that at least 50% of the SICAP caseload, for individuals and local community groups, must reside in disadvantaged areas. 193 Target groups are explicitly stated, the selection of areas should be based on maps and the HP deprivation index provided by Pobal. 194 Community groups working with the target groups are an important element in programme delivery. The programme is launched as a call and potential programme implementers may apply. 4.3.2 Housing The challenge to cope with housing costs is the most important social challenge and utmost directly felt impact of poverty. It is widely acknowledged that provision of housing ranks among the most effective measures to improve the 192 Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government of Ireland, SICAP Programme requirements, Guide published in 2015. 193 Ibid , p. 10. 194 Pobal stands for the Irish Department named Government supporting Communities ; HP Deprivation Index (HP stemming from its authors Haase and Pratschke developed in 2012) is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area using data compiled from various censuses; for more information please see https://www.pobal.ie/Pages/New-Measures.aspx.

        "106 conditions of the poor. 195 The most common characteristics of social housing are: \uf06e Tenure : mostly let at low prices on the long-term, rents and prices are regulated. \uf06e Beneficiaries : given to those who are in need of it. \uf06e Providers : owned and managed by registered providers such as Local Authorities or not-for-profit entities also labelled as \u2018social landlords\u2019 \u2013 these entities might even enjoy a specific legal status (in particular with regard to taxation). \uf06e Funding arrangements : mostly cooperative efforts involving providers, public sector, banks etc. In many cases this is a direct policy lever of LRAs 196 . Generally speaking, social housing has to be understood as an important policy lever, which is characteristic for urban regions. It is evident that the role of LRAs is determined by the degree of local or regional self-government and corresponding budgetary endowments. In most Member States effective policies will call for joint efforts of all government levels. The major instruments that have developed over time in social housing have been: 197 1. the provision of revenue subsidies, including in particular interest rate subsidies which reduce the annual cost of provision and therefore rents; 2. upfront capital grants which reduce the need to borrow or otherwise fund the capital costs of investment \u2013 thus reducing outgoings and rents; and 3. the provision of subsidy in kind, normally in the form of free or cheap land which again reduces the need for funding and reduces costs and outgoings. The detailed provisions and mechanism governing social housing differ across the Member States. In most countries it has been a reaction to the poor housing conditions that have emerged due to the massive inflow of migrants from rural areas in the period of industrialisation around the turn of the last century. 195 Cf. EUKN 2014, p. 37. 196 cf. Box 2.

        "107 A second massive wave of social housing had been started in the aftermath of the Second World War due to destruction in some countries and the immigration waves in the Sixties and Seventies of the last century in others (e.g. UK). These historical waves of massive building activities are important since in many cities vast complexes, i.e. a massive spatial concentrations of social housing in certain parts of the city, have emerged. Nowadays, in many countries these are a major source of concern for the local authorities due to the concentration of low-income households and the need for repair, especially for large-scale building complexes. Differences across the EU are quite marked 198 . Public sector housing organisations operating at local or regional level are widespread e.g. in Belgium, Finland, France, Italy, Poland and Sweden. There are also examples of organisations at national level. 199 It is also important to see that the structure of the housing market differs to a huge extent across the EU. 200 When defining the social purpose, three basic policy models seem to exist: Table 12.

The EU-average is about 8%. 202 The share peaks in countries such as Netherlands (32%), Austria (23%) and Denmark (19%). In southern EU Member States and EU-12 the share is below 5%. Within the rental stock in EU-12 countries the social housing stock represents significant shares but one has to be aware of the fact that the rental market represents only a small segment. 203 198 Cf.

        "108 Given the market levels of real estate prices and rents in urban areas it is obvious that social housing has been subject of a vivid political debate throughout history. A policy debate has started on the issue of perceiving social housing as Service of General Economic Interest (SGEI). 204 In this debate the Commission took the position in favour of schemes targeting certain social groups thus implicitly questioning the other policy models presented in the table above. This has given further momentum to initiatives and interest groupings that are active in social housing development. Another perspective on the assets of social housing is that of a rather risk-free investment for lenders albeit with low but stable interest rates. Social housing is an important example of a public investment policy which is also often mentioned in the context of public incentives to job generation. Thus it could be understood as a countercyclical investment in times of the economic crisis . The economic crisis in 2008 has led to significant cutbacks of public spending in many Member States 205 . At the same time \u2013 for obvious reasons \u2013 the need for this type of public intervention has risen in the aftermath of the crisis. Major developments in the European social housing sector in the previous decade were summarised in a study conducted for the European Parliament (EP): 206 \uf06e an increasing delegation to local government, \uf06e a special focus on fragile populations, \uf06e a downward trend in the share of social housing over the total housing stock. In particular the first trend points at an increasing financial challenge for LRAs in the coming decade. An evident consequence in most countries might be the shift to policy models, which are targeted more at the neediest. The role of ERDF as an incentive instrument to support local efforts related to housing in cohesion policy has been introduced in the period 2007-2013. The role will be continued in the period 2014-2020. De-facto measures will concentrate on energy-efficiency refurbishment of housing areas and the 204 Cf.

One of the examples for the role of ERDF in the upgrading of social housing in the period 2007-2013 has been the REECH project in UK: 207 The project was intended to stimulate demand for installing low carbon technologies by working with Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) on 2,000 homes in North West England. By creating demand for new green technologies, the project aims to reduce fuel poverty while stimulating a new growing market for local businesses. Energy efficiency refurbishment projects have also been reported from France (e.g. 446 units in La For\u00eat Cambrais), Lithuania (part-financed form the JESSICA holding fund), Latvia, Italy and Hungary. The study has also outlined significant governance challenges 208 related to the implementation of the projects such as: \uf06e the difficulties to lever sufficient match-funding and \uf06e to set-up realistic administrative schedules throughout the project delivery. \uf06e Finally, in some cases the projects did not have the desired socio- economic effect, i.e. to result in increased affordability for the households. 209 Thus it becomes apparent that for such projects \u2013 next to the financial challenge \u2013 administrative capacities of LRAs are essential for successful implementation. 4.3.3 Evidence for urban migrant policies 210 The recent wave of refugees targeting the EU and foremost cities 211 in some Member States in the EU-15 poses a considerable challenge for the coming 207 Dodd J. et al., 2013, p. 208 Ibid ., p.

For the present study, the consultant is very reluctant to provide recent data because of their dynamic and short-term changes of the situation. 211 Asylum seekers that reached a residence permit and therefore are able to migrate within countries or interregional tend to move to urban areas because of their diverse provision of infrastructures and cultural diversity.

The risk of poverty for foreign citizens particularly those from outside the EU is significantly higher than for immigrants or native citizens. 212 A main characteristic of the latest migration waves is the significant gap between the educational attainments of the migrants and the jobs they actually behold. A couple of statistical figures 213 might help to illustrate the quantitative scope of the challenge: \uf06e In London, the largest city in the EU, less than two thirds (63.3% in 2011) of the population was native-born. \uf06e Examples of cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants where more than 25% of the population had been born in another country are Berlin, Frankfurt/Main, Munich, Nuremberg and Stuttgart in Germany, as well as Brussels and Antwerp in BE and finally Amsterdam (NL). \uf06e On the other hand there were only three cities in the EU with more than 500,000 inhabitants where more than 95% of inhabitants have been native-born. 214 Therefore, inclusion policies should be an important element of an integrated EU Urban Agenda and also should be addressed by regional and local policy strategies. Challenges and opportunities for Europe and its cities and regions The growing number of migrants and asylum applications in Western Europe currently result in the implementation of more restrictive policies and thus shift the pressure towards the EU borders in southern European countries. Considering the complex situation, a European response is still in the debate while the territorial and urban impacts of the refugee crisis are increasing from day to day. Main challenges, opportunities and risks of the current migration and refugee inflow to Europe is presented in the table. 212 Cf.

Main aspects to be considered for policy consideration The impact of the high inflow of migrants, including refugees 215 , in the EU on different regions and cities is very diverse. Member States that serve as entry points to Europe such as Italy, Greece, Hungary but also Turkey have to take over several services for other EU countries. This must be considered against the background that they were strongly affected by the economic crisis. In addition, they serve as main transit routes to Western and Northern European countries. In particular cities or municipalities in Czech Republic, Serbia and Croatia as well as the Northern Norwegian border municipality of S\u00f8r-Varanger (Kirkenes) are also affected by the transit of people. The migration flows are mostly directed to countries in a good economic situation featuring strong job markets that have attractive and inclusive integration policies in place. 216 The social, humanitarian and financial efforts to be taken in arrival cities need considerable financial assistance as well as a coordinated approach from the European Union. Policy measures such as the redistribution of regional funds and a fair transfer system should come into the EU policy debate more. Whereas small islands and cities in border regions face challenges regarding the provision of services and taking care of a large inflow of migrants in relation to the local population, larger cities have to deal with housing challenges, school access and ethnic segregation. Concerning this matter, a balanced distribution of 215 720,000 migrants and refugees have entered the EU since January 2015, compared to 560,000 for the entire EU. One million refugees in 2015 as estimated by the United Nations equals to approx. 0.2% of the entire population of the EU (Eurostat in ESPON Policy Brief). 216 ESPON Policy Brief 2015. ",

The large diversity of migrants in terms of education, skills, culture and language is important when considering any integration policy. The exchange of local best practices across Europe \u2013 especially in depopulated, demographically challenged areas 217 \u2013 can support the stabilisation of local labour markets and help reducing economic imbalances. Therefore, the new situation might contribute to a balanced and polycentric development of the European territory. Also the distribution of accepted refugees within countries should take into account the need of local labour markets but also the possible living situation of refugees. 218 4.4 Business Case Transport The transport sector as a whole employs 11 million people in the EU28, representing about 5.1% of the total workforce (2013). It contributes 4.9% to the Gross Value added (GVa) at basic prices of the EU28 which accounts for \u20ac562 billion (2012). 219 At the same time, it has the highest final energy consumption in comparison to all other sectors accounting for 31.6% in the EU (2013) 220 ; 25.8% accounts for road transport alone.

Two key parameters should be addressed by local authorities in terms of sustainable urban mobility: \uf06e The shift of urban modal split to more environmental friendly transport modes and \uf06e The implementation of smart technologies for urban mobility. 4.4.1 Urban modal split The modal split is often conducted by local governments using different methodologies. Diverse definitions and samplings as well as a different extent of geographical areas make it difficult to compare cities. Typical surveys refer to the main mode of transport used during trips to the working place. In general, ",
        "116 the amount of travels per means of transport instead of its path length is counted. The following choice of different European and international cities shows huge differences in the model split of different urban areas (see figure). Figure 10. Examples of urban modal split in passenger transport Source: own elaboration based on Europe: TEMS - The EPOMM (European Platform on Mobility Management) Modal Split Tool 223 ; Overseas: Land Transport Authority of Singapore (LTA) 224 . The actual share of different transport modes does not only result from the political will, transport lobbying and local, regional and national traditions (cf. cycling in Amsterdam) but also from structural characteristics of cities such as: \uf06e Population density. \uf06e Size of the city. \uf06e Density of supply of services and infrastructure. Moreover, the ownership of a driving license differs in different types of areas. 225 In Germany, older people and in particular women are less likely to own a drivers licence. In areas that show a high level of urbanity people less often have a driver\u2019s licence than in small towns. 223 http://www.epomm.eu/tems/. 224 http://www.lta.gov.sg/ltaacademy/doc/J11Nov-p60PassengerTransportModeShares.pdf. 225 TRAMP 2006, Szenarien der Mobilit\u00e4tsentwicklung unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung von Siedlungsstrukturen bis 2050. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 % o f p a s s e n g e r t r a n s p o r t Urban examples: Europe and Overseas Public transport Car Powered two-wheelers Cycling Walking ",
        "117 Another trend is the fact that young people do not see a car anymore as a status symbol and the combination of different transport modes is growing in importance. Urban-wide mobility cards combining public transport, bike and car sharing offers are getting more and more popular in European cities. Potential influence factors of local authorities in the direction of less motorised private transport are on the one hand alternative public transport offerings and on the other regulations in terms of a regulated parking management . Nevertheless it must be kept in mind that any intervention in the urban transport system reveals challenges of feasibility and conflicts between different stakeholders. A strict regulatory approach to motorised traffic and land-use planning enforcing compact settlement areas, might meet strong resistance from interest groupings. Moreover, beneficial effects can be outweighed by massive urban sprawl and non-cooperation across administrative boundaries. 4.4.2 Urban sprawl The integrated Land Use Modelling Platform (LUMP) produces simulated land use maps that can be used for assessing European spatial developments and for evaluating the impacts of climate change 226 . The comparison of different scenarios, the first including a policy in favour of more compact cities and the second having no specific urban land use policies in place demonstrate the following: By promoting compact cities, national and local policies positively influence the location and land use intensity of new developments. Policies that support compact city development result in a reduction of land use, less urban fragmentation, more infill development and the emergence of large city centres . 227 Detailed information on land take intensity per inhabitant in square meters including its variation in dependence on the different degrees of urbanisation will be published by the JRC during the first half of 2016 228 . It is recommended to incorporate the indicators to be provided by the JRC in this factsheet in order to allow the local authorities to monitor the implementation of business case. Another factsheet 229 provides detailed information on population in Functional urban areas (FUA) within the EU28 which accounts for 65% of the population. It also includes projected changes in FUA population for all EU countries. 226 European Commission, European Climate Adaptation Platform, http://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/viewaceitem?aceitem_id=114. 227 European Commission 2014a, sixth report on economic, social and territorial cohesion. 228 JRC factsheet on Land Use and Urban Development. 229 JRC factsheet on Population.

The forthcoming JRC technical report will present a new indicator for motorized road transport dependencies. In addition, an \u2018 urban form efficiency \u2019 factsheet will be presented by the JRC but was not available at the time of finalising the present study. 4.5 Modern Urban Governance Urban governance is the software that enables the urban hardware to function. Urban governance can be defined as the many ways that institutions and individuals organize the day-to-day management of a city, and the processes used for effectively realising the short-term and long-term agenda of a city\u2019s development. Governance is the enabling environment that requires adequate legal frameworks, efficient political, managerial and administrative processes, as well as mechanisms, guidelines and tools to enable the local government response to the needs of citizens. 231 According to the OECD-EC definition 828, cities of more than 50,000 inhabitants exist in Europe 232 . However, most European cities have a size of between 500,000 and 4 million inhabitants. These local governments are in the end the nucleus and one of the key assets to ensuring sustained growth, increased resource efficiency and an inclusive European society. Governance is the key issue for growing as well as stagnating or even shrinking cities \u2013 depending on their size, the economic performance and the national political-administrative system the range of policy options at hand will differ enormously across Europe. Growing cities might have to place more emphasis on regulatory policies whereas for stagnating or shrinking cities incentive policies at all levels are important for developing new perspectives. The effectiveness and efficiency of all major steps furthering the EU Urban Agenda will depend on setting-up enabling frameworks and developing policy levers that support sound urban governance. 230 JRC factsheet on Accessibility. 231 Definition from: http://unhabitat.org/urban-themes/governance/. 232 EC 2012, p.2. ",
        "119 The first obvious observation is that urban governance is directly linked to the issue of political and financial decentralisation respectively to the local self- governing capacity . The management of urban infrastructure, approaches to resource-efficient cities as outlined in section 4.2, coping with the challenges of the urban social fabric have a common feature in these policies: from the perspective of urban governments, forward-looking long-term planning and steering is required in order to provide policy responses with lasting effects. The key lever is local tax revenues or at least stable, long-term frameworks for the redistribution of tax revenues between the layers of state administration. Stable local budgets are a pre-condition for encouraging longer-term planning and sound financial managements thus being an implicit lever for improved governance and the willingness to venture into new forms of governance, according to the principles of multi-level governance. On the other hand, dependency on irregular transfers from the national level or \u2013 even worse \u2013 transferring responsibilities from the national to the local level without adequate financial endowments will clearly restrict any urban government to less or least efficient forms of crisis management and ad-hoc decisions. This can even trigger a vicious policy-cycle: forward-looking perspectives will be avoided in order to not create expectations that cannot be met. Next to the role of local self-governing capacities, the interaction between the policy levels is decisive. In some policy areas the policy levers at the local level are limited, e.g. taxation as major lever in SME policy or standards in waste management. In other areas the role of the local level is decisive. A prime example is land-use planning in order to contain urban sprawl. The table below outlines basic ideas on that point along the building blocks for an EU Urban Agenda which have been identified in the previous sections. ",

Also from this perspective of the layers of policy-making it is obvious that efficient and effective urban policy depends on vertical coordination of policy actors. It is evident that for the majority of policy areas concerned the national political- administrative system is decisive for the quality and the incentive function of legal frameworks, the depth and detail of consultative processes between the policy levels etc. In short, the scope and room for manoeuvre for cities and towns is defined to a large extent at the national level. 233 Understood in the sense of one of the territorial keys in accordance with the work of Spatial Foresight \u2013 cf.

        "121 Urban Governance is a multi-faceted topic and it touches all elements from local democracy and community-building to fair and transparent legal frameworks and tax systems, participatory approaches in planning, to advanced management of infrastructure. Given the enormous range of issues at hand it is important to be selective and draw attention to fields where major need for action has been identified in the previous sections of the report. The following governance issues will be discussed in more depth: \uf06e Infrastructure : Proper governance of the major public urban assets is essential. \uf06e Functional areas \u2013 territorial governance : Containing urban sprawl and the land consumption in the process, urbanisation requires incentives for inter-municipal cooperation. Planning restricted to the administrative boundaries of cities will fail to provide convincing results. \uf06e Public-private partnerships : Given the limits of public budgets and the increasing pressure on local governments new forms of partnerships have to be developed ranging from real estate development to service delivery. \uf06e Governance of Smart Specialisation Strategies or Triple Helix: The future growth path of urban regions will depend to a significant extent on the capability of economic and institutional actors to innovate, to develop skills and strategies which foster adaptability and thereby the resilience of urban economic structures. \uf06e Presentation of participatory approaches : Venturing into participatory processes is a major learning process for governments at all levels. In some cases there is no way out and urban governments are forced to act e.g. given the legal norms on large scale-infrastructures 235 and the public resistance to projects such as the expansion of airports or urban railway transport. Fortunately, in a growing number of cities the value of participatory approaches has been recognised and has contributed to innovative and more effective approaches with a higher degree of local acceptance. 4.5.1 Governance of urban infrastructure Efficient and affordable provision of infrastructure is an evident constituent for a well-functioning city. Compared to other global regions, the EU is marked by dense networks and comparatively old urban structures. Thus the dominant 235 As the need to conduct e.g. an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). ",

Source: OECD 2015 pp. 6-7, Metis GmbH. Sound urban governance of infrastructure is essentially linked to the following factors: \uf06e Skilled employees in the public sector : Infrastructure investment requires a multiplicity of skills to assess, procure, manage and regulate [\u2026] 238 . \uf06e The targeted interaction between policy levels in order to ensure effective and efficient infrastructure delivery: There are important challenges at both the national and sub-national level to catalyse sufficient regulatory capacity to oversee the performance of infrastructure service delivery. Regulatory delivery (the downstream of the regulatory policy cycle) is in particular perceived as the weak link. 239 . \uf06e Sound tariff regulation which is fair, transparent and also induces cost- efficiency is a basis for the long-term sustainability of the investments. \uf06e Overcoming the limits imposed by administrative boundaries : Investing at the relevant \u201cfunctional\u201d socio-economic scale requires coordination across jurisdictions to increase efficiency through 236 Cf.

        "123 economies of scale and affordability of the asset for users and government [\u2026] The small scale of public investment projects in countries with high levels of administrative fragmentation can result in lower returns on that public investment, and ultimately poor service delivery to citizens 240 \u2013 as is being demonstrated for the case of fragmented public transport providers. For further considerations on that point please see the following section. \uf06e Public budgeting : one of the key points related to infrastructure is that the public budgeting system takes the state of maintenance of the public assets into account. \uf06e Long-term programmes for investment, maintenance and extension : political cycles have a visible effect on local investment cycles. 241 Also the economic crisis has resulted in a sharp dent in public investment. The implications for the quality of delivery are obvious and moreover a lack of maintenance bears the risk of high, unprecedented financial burden on public households. The main levers counteracting such risks are shared long-term programmes for investment, maintenance and extension. Two examples are being introduced in order to illustrate practical approaches to the advanced urban infrastructure management. Box 14.

The project demonstrates the added value of City-to-City cooperation as well as the obvious interface to the development of innovative technologies.

        "124 4.5.2 Functional areas - territorial governance Cities do not end at their administrative boundaries, on the contrary. The process of suburbanisation or urban sprawl is a large-scale process that tends to significantly lower the potentialities of urban areas to contribute to more resource-efficient ways of living. One of the keys is to provide incentives to further develop Inter-Municipal Cooperation (IMC) and the emergence of functional regions. Most governmental systems include elements that tend to encourage competition among municipalities instead of cooperation, for instance, systems of fiscal equalisation depending on population numbers or subsidies for infrastructures from the central to the local level without models for sharing tax revenues. Next to that also a lack of trust and perceived loss of control might act as impediments to cooperation among local entities. Most common forms of IMC: \uf06e must be backed up by a clear rationale which points to the economic advantages of cooperation and \uf06e depend on a regulatory or incentive framework from the national or regional level which fosters cooperation. The major initial rationale for IMC is the increased efficiency and effectiveness of public services (closely interlinked with infrastructure management). This is for obvious reasons not only an issue for growth regions but also for urban areas adversely affected by demographic change where provision of public services is increasingly challenging. A report by the Council of Europe distinguishes between three main forms: 243 \uf06e A highly integrated, mainly public law model used mostly for basic services, such as water supply and waste water treatment. State supervisions and the legal framework are laid down in detail (e.g. France, Spain, Portugal) 244 . \uf06e A more flexible model based on the freedom for lower-tier governments to opt for cooperation in certain areas. The framework being laid down in statutes (e.g. Bulgaria, Czech Republic, United Kingdom). 243 Council of Europe 2007, p. 7. 244 In Portugal intermunicipal cooperation is anchored in the 1976 constitution which allows for local autonomy related to IMC in major urban areas \u2013 cf. Council of Europe, 2007, p. 13. ",
        "125 \uf06e Intermediate models \u2013 based on mixed features of the two previously mentioned (common in most of the other Member States). In centralised Member States the rules are set at the national level whereas in federal states usually the regions provide a legal frame. A Member State with a long tradition of IMC is France. Box 15. IMCs in France In France IMCs are set up as legal entities governed by public law. There are different types of such entities with their own tax system. The law distinguishes between agglomeration communities 245 and urban communities. 246 One of their main purposes is to engage in urban and spatial development. Functional regions have also been labelled as one of the territorial keys, 247 i.e. these are considered as key policy levers in order to step-up the impact of the Territorial Agenda in the EU. The following interlinked issues have been highlighted: \uf06e Enlargement of local labour markets. \uf06e Critical mass of means through territorial cooperation. \uf06e Accessibility of secondary growth poles and regional centres. \uf06e Public transport connections to regional centres. \uf06e Compact cities. Functional regions and their executive bodies have to be considered as prime examples for multi-level governance. Two examples should help to illustrate the potential scope of actions of such bodies governing functional areas. Box 16. The functional urban area Region Hanover The Region Hanover has been labelled as a unique model in Germany since it is the result of a merger of an intermediate layer of administration (Landkreis) with an association of municipalities 248 and several competencies of the city of Hanover. The region covers about 1.2 million inhabitants and consists of 17 cities and four municipalities. Its core tasks \u2013 according to the Act 249 are: 245 2007 in total 164 in France: legal threshold more than 50,000 inhabitants, thereof a core city with a minimum of 15,000 inhabitants. 246 2007 in total 14: legal threshold more than 500,000 inhabitants. 247 Cf. B\u00f6hme, K. et al., 2011, p. 7. 248 Kommunalverband, www.region-hannover.de. 249 Since 2011 the legal framework governing the agenda of the Region is the Act on Local Constitution of the Land Niedersdachsen (Nieders\u00e4chsisches Kommunalverfassungsgesetz).

        "126 \uf06e Shared policy for growth and jobs (e.g. support to start-ups and SMEs). \uf06e Shared environmental policy. \uf06e Urban-regional public transport (as one of the major organisational tasks). Major internal objectives of the reform have been to make the administration more efficient and bring it closer to the citizens. The reform project has been initiated by the local and intermediate actors and it was backed by the region (Land) Niedersachsen: the discussion process lasted several years but led to a new act which acknowledges the Region Hanover as a legal territorial entity. A second example is based on a comparable situation at the outset: a dense network of cities and towns in a highly integrated economic area. It is a cross- border area situated between France and Belgium. Box 17.

The added value is the commitment to a long-lasting cooperation based on a clear framework provided by the EGTC and its implicit and explicit role in coordination related to many areas of urban development. The decisions are taken in an Assembly of Mayors; the EGTC has established an agency as executive body. Currently the Eurom\u00e9tropole focusses on the following areas: \uf06e economic development, \uf06e cultural amenities and tourism development, \uf06e mobility and accessiblity, \uf06e public services, \uf06e territorial strategy.

        "127 4.5.3 Public Private Partnerships Urban areas across the EU encounter a broad range of challenges depending on variables such as national legal frameworks, geographical location and development paths shaped by history and global trends. However there is one challenge that affects practically all urban self-governments: the scarcity of financial resources and at the same time an increasing portfolio of tasks to be met. This is one of the major reasons for an increasing role of Public Private Partnerships (PPP) in urban development issues: the (scarce) public funds embedded in stable long-term regulatory and contractual frameworks should act as a lever for private investment. Generally speaking, the advantages and risks of PPP in urban development can be summarised as follows: 253 Table 19. Major benefits and risks related to PPPs in urban development Advantages Risks Cost savings : drive for economic gains yields incentive to improve performance. Whole of life-cycle : efficiency and return on investment in the long-term as incentive. Output-based contracts : a major incentive for innovation in the quality of delivery is ensured in the contract. Risk-sharing : passing on the risk to the partner which is capable of managing it best. Delivery on time : e.g. due to incentives to maximise return on investment and minimise financing risks. Enhanced public management capacities : through direct interaction with private investors but also in best case freeing capacities to perform regulatory duties, monitor performance and service delivery. Increased availability of infrastructure funds : cost savings, spread of payments over longer periods. Additional cost : e.g. compared to traditional procurement tendering procedure \u2013 if not run properly \u2013 depending on the number of bidders evaluation and selection might turn into a significant cost factor. Secondly expertise needed to foresee and react to future contingencies might consume resources. Reduced control of public assets : shared decisions on tariffing and quality and level of service means loss of control for the public sector. Loss of accountability : if not clearly defined contracts can overlap roles and responsibilities. Rigidities in long-term contract : which restricts the room for manoeuvre in case of significant changes of the economic situation. Source: UN, Habitat, 2011, pp. 6-8. From the above presented tentative list of advantages and risks it becomes obvious that governing PPPs is a major challenge which requires highly skilled persons in the administration in order to contain the risks related to tendering and contracting and shared control. 253 UN Habitat, 2011, pp. 6-8.

        "128 Ample experience with the active inclusion of the private sector in major regeneration operations exists in the United Kingdom. Box 18. Strategic Regeneration Framework for East Manchester The Strategic Regeneration Framework for East Manchester has been a massive regeneration programme including the construction of 5,000 new homes, refurbishment of 6,700 homes, creation of family neighbourhoods including shopping malls and parks, 200,000 m\u00b2 of new floor space, and recruitment and training of 1,000 residents. The vehicle for the framework has been the New East Manchester Ltd. (NEM) which was set-up as Urban Regeneration Company (URC) a partnership between Manchester City Council, the Homes and Communities Agency (the national social-housing funding agency), the North West Development Agency and the communities of East Manchester. NEM\u2019s activities are funded primarily through grants from the three partners and their associated expenditure covers their operational activities. 254 The financial estimate for the framework amounts to GBP 3,965 million over the period 2000 to 2018 \u2013 thereof 70% is expected to come from the private sector, 30% from public budgets. The total list of funding sources is impressive: next to the private sector 255 in total 22 public and private entities are listed \u2013 the scheme includes also ERDF as a funding source. As is apparent from the structure of the public funding partners the investment in social housing is provided by the Homes and Communities Agency. Parts of the funding framework have been the result of a tender procedure in order to identify the most advantageous project for the development of the area. 4.5.4 Governance of S3/H3 from the perspective of LRAs For LRAs the strategic setting of S3 respectively H3 requires the adoption of governance approaches which in part differ strongly from established administrative routines. Inducing or supporting dynamics of the helix requires new approaches in the sense of process facilitation and collaborative goal development and new types of cross-sector and cross-institutional cooperation and coordination. 254 European Commission, 2013b, p. 72. 255 Mentioned as aggregate since these private funding partners are expected to invest at a later stage. ",
        "129 Basically speaking the role of LRAs can be interpreted as follows: to provide the essential public goods in particular education, training offers and to some extent also facilities and to create incentives in order to overcome bottlenecks in collaboration. The start-up phase is the critical part where prudent intervention of public institutions is probably most urgently required. It is also a very sensitive type of intervention. The role of government institutions in this phase is to provide the adequate incentives for the development of effective collaborations among all stakeholders in the innovation system, that is, to set the conditions for an \u201cinclusive\u201d approach to the identification of policy priorities. However, the risk is that vested interests from the most powerful regional stakeholders and lobbies may condition decision-makers [\u2026] The presence of a functioning system of checks and balances ensures the transparent definition of priority objectives in cooperation with all relevant actors. 256 The desired result of the process is the genuine prioritisation of investment options and the implicit resistance to dominance of politically-driven criteria for the allocation of funds. 257 The experimental nature of the process 258 is calling for benchmarking and assessment as central elements. The inherent element of discovery involves the risk of mistakes and failure. Thus one of the key points in prudent strategy development should be the constant assessment in order to contain the cost of mistakes. This must not be mistaken with risk-averse action. Strategic centrepiece of S3: priority setting At the core of S3 strategies is the setting of priorities in order to trigger shared development processes in prospective areas. In the scientific debate different model approaches do exist which have distinct points of departure: \uf06e Open models based on entrepreneurial discovery : In its ideal form an inclusive, interactive process centred on the integration of empirical but often fragmented entrepreneurial knowledge of the market thus forming partnerships. The discovery as such refers to the opening of new domains of opportunities. Public institutions act as facilitators and provide the frame for a successful process-design. 256 Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, di Cataldo, Rainoldi, 2014 p. 4. 257 Nauwelaers, Peria\u00f1ez Forte, Midtkandal, 2014, p. 11. 258 Foray, Rainboldi 2013, p. 5. ",
        "130 \uf06e More strategy-based models which come through analytical steps to prospective fields with a higher likelihood of innovation. Future potentialities are being explored in facilitated processes with a stronger involvement of public institutions as driving forces. The approach has been labelled e.g. as related diversification 259 where relatedness between actors in regional economies and regional innovation systems become subject of close scrutiny and form the bases for setting priorities. In practice it is evident that the strengths of the two model approaches might be blended and turn into a process design which: \uf06e on the one hand reassures the actors involved in the decision-making process due to known patterns of interaction, such as running the process of a shared regional analysis with established mechanisms for the involvement of stakeholders and \uf06e on the other hand invites new actors to participate due to new and open formats, open-minded approaches to facilitation and a visible element of experimentation. Position and role of LRAs from a process perspective As regards the position and role of LRAs in the process in particular two aspects should be considered: \uf06e In case of a genuine indigenous local or regional strategy it is evident that one of the key responsibilities of the LRA is the political legitimation for the goals of the process. \uf06e An essential role of LRAs \u2013 in particular in urban regions which are less dynamic \u2013 is the broadening of the resource-base through active search for partners in other tiers of the government, i.e. the active search for a broader partnership in the sense of MLG. It is evident that the size of the city, the urban or metropolitan region is decisive : the larger the more institutions and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) will appear as potential partners. This opens a broad range of options for diversification of activities but places a higher emphasis on the process design and the selection of priorities. It is obvious that \u2013 in case the LRAs has a pivotal role in initiating and running the strategy-building process \u2013 in larger urban 259 Cf. Boschma , Gianelle 2014, p. 14. ",
        "131 areas the process design and organisation might pose considerable resource requirements. Many examples in Europe have shown intermediaries based on a sound system of checks and balances between the partners involved. These might step in and act as engines in the strategy-building and implementation process. The smaller the urban region the more the success of the process might depend on the LRA. It is obvious that in smaller urban areas also the capacities for setting-up intermediaries are more limited. The more so the success will depend on persons rather than on institutions. A cross-cutting challenge which goes through all steps from the initiation of the process over strategy-building to implementation is the fact that S3/H3 requires skilled staff in LRAs: Smart specialisation strategies will not succeed in Europe if the policy making capability at regional level does not reach high levels of competence and commitment [\u2026] smart specialisation is part of the family of the so- called \u2018new industrial policy\u2019 that aims at designing and deploying sophisticated instruments to make compatible vertical choices for concentrating resources and market dynamics. The policy challenge is enormous. 260 The table below outlines the main aspects of an S3/3H process and the underlying challenges for LRAs. Table 20.

Generally speaking it is important to note that \u2013 despite the prevalence of economic aspects \u2013 the term innovation should not be restricted to technologies leading to new or improved marketable products and services. It should also include a wider concept of innovation comprising also social innovation . Meant is a perspective which is useful in particular in an urban context with its diverse social fabric.

Important and most frequently mentioned subcategories are food, power generation and renewable energy, biotechnology, health and automotive industries. When mapping the correspondence with EU Objectives the leading ranks are best by the following ones: sustainable innovation, KET, public health and Digital Agenda. 4.5.5 Participatory approaches Generally speaking \u2018participatory approaches are flexible, process-oriented methodologies. They combine guiding principles, core concepts and sets of interactive techniques which have been developed to better realize high levels of community participation [\u2026].` 264 The nature of the approaches differs to a huge extent as well as the underlying rationales and the motivation to participate: there is an obvious and sharp contrast between consultative mechanisms foreseen by regulatory frameworks as opposed to initiatives which are encouraging new approaches to urban renewal or local action in deprived neighbourhoods. The following table lists exemplary urban contexts where participatory approaches have been applied: Table 21. Examples for the application of participatory approaches Context Annotation Local acceptance of projects Development or expansion of large-scale infrastructure The construction of large-scale projects is to some extent subject to a consultative process as part of the legislation governing EIA.

The project LUMASEC 265 has provided a wealth of experience in comparative studies for the Member States Germany, France, United Kingdom, Greece, Poland, Romania, and Slovenia.

Urban design Collective modelling of housing designs and settlement areas Housing projects of various kinds including participatory approaches have been an important element in urban renewal movements (such as in Austria and Germany) but also in the process of expansion of cities: the future inhabitants are included in the process of planning and designing their houses and the neighbourhood. Urban renewal Neighbourhood initiatives Citizen participation is seen as a must in the revitalisation of deprived neighbourhoods. This is a widely accepted principle. Nevertheless, a critical appraisal is required in order to ensure that such methods are not understood as an easy-to-implement ancillary element of urban development. The project CoNet 267 has provided valuable insights to such questions: With citizen participation, a huge chasm between wish and reality exists. Doubts mainly concern three questions: 265 Supported in the framework of URBACT. 266 LUMASEC, Thematic Report 2, 2009. 267 Supported In the framework of URBACT. ",

The programme consisted of two phases including rehabilitation of buildings and public areas, education, employment and entrepreneurship programmes, community development, crime prevention. The programme was facilitated through a local office (R\u00e9v8) which acted as interlocutor between the over 140 partners involved in the process. Phase 1 included a strong participatory element in the form of a community development programme where inter alia a community house and a park have been put to use, respectively rehabilitated. Throughout all phases of the programme, feedback from the residents had been monitored. This type of urban rehabilitation programme was unprecedented in HU and invited other smaller cities to develop similar programmes oriented to social inclusion. After the pilot phase from 2005 to 2009 the programme was disrupted but could be continued in the frame of the National Development Programme (based on EU funds). 269 Costa, E. in Grisel M., van de Waart F., 2011 pp. 58-68.

        "139 5 Conclusions and recommendations 5.1 Conclusions and specific recommendations There is ample evidence that cities and urban areas are the key drivers of growth in the EU. Prudent policy action at all levels, i.e. EU, Member States, regional and local will be essential to reinvigorate, maintain and sustain growth paths in these regions. An integrated EU Urban Agenda should contribute to a better understanding of the urban issue in European policies and it should provide a framework to bring coherence to a diversity of initiatives and policies and to mobilise stakeholders. The implementation of an integrated EU Urban Agenda would boost growth and create jobs. Furthermore, considering the three territorial scenarios for Europe towards 2030 and 2050 developed by ESPON, the promotion and networking of European metropolises; medium rank cities; and the small cities, would imply an expansion of growth in terms of GDP from 1,8% to 2,3% 270 . There seems to be consensus that no new instruments or funding sources are requested, but better coordination among the existing ones. No new competences should be transferred to the European level, but the EU Urban Agenda should foster a more structured, regular dialogue. Cities and urban areas in the world as well as in Europe are confronted with enormous transversal challenges . Those challenges are not new and there is already a wide ranging debate about the role of cities in the European economic growth ongoing. Urban areas and cities do not follow one single path of logic and every generalisation or typology cannot capture the diverse character of European cities. There does not exist one single typology and approach of urban areas and cities. Types of cities and with it their approaches depend on contextual aspects such as Member States\u2019 size, administrative structures, political systems, geographical location and size of the urban area. However all of them face the same transversal challenges: climate change, demographic change and immigration. These transversal challenges lead to urban social changes, structural changes, and environmental pressures urban administrations might be prepared to face adequately. The local and regional governments are not always empowered to administer changes in urban areas due to a mismatch between administrative and urban structures as well as a still sectoral focus on policies. New challenges however ask for integrated approaches which are more and more supported by European Commission policies above all the cohesion policy. 270 ESPON Project 2013/1/19, Final Report 30.06.2014 http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/Documents/Projects/AppliedResearch/ET2050/FR/ET2050_FR- 02_Main_Report.pdf. ",
        "140 Notwithstanding the efforts, sectoral policies are still dominating the European Union as well as Member States. Those policies do not adequately respond to the pressing needs caused by changes in social, environmental and economic matters. The most pressing need for coordinated action refers to fields such as resource efficiency and energy savings, social security and health systems reforms, labour force mobility and flexible integration of migrants. The pitfalls related to these areas are: \uf06e Policy frameworks are shaped at national level, responses to new challenges calling for integrated action tend to be slow whereas local incidence would often require quick and targeted action (plus the availability of budgets and competences). \uf06e There are no unified systems across Europe which is as such hampering efficient changes. Results are directly influencing the urban systems. Local administrations are therefore asked to respond within inadequate policy frameworks thus increasing political uncertainty. Almost all cities and urban areas in Europe are facing this paradox. At European level there is hardly any policy area with an explicit urban dimension: only Cohesion Policy explicitly addresses urban areas. Cohesion Policy provides several levers which are important to strengthen an integrated perspective and there deserve particular attention in urban policies. Recommendation: Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3), Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI) and Community Led Local Development (CLLD) are main levers towards an integrated and place-based approach. These approaches reveal significant potentialities for LRAs implicit and explicit. In the context of an Urban Agenda it is important to support and disseminate guidance on these instruments and to encourage the exchange of experiences. Thus first results in an urban context could become subject of a comprehensive review in the mid-term perspective, i.e. 2019). However, the implementation of the cohesion policy tool Integrated Territorial Investments (ITI) and Community-Led Local Development (CLLD) remain questionable. The main reason for reluctance at regional and local level is additional administration which is required for implementing ITIs and CLLDs. ",
        "141 Nevertheless, in the Partnership Agreements, several Member States have expressed the intent to implement CLLD as cross-funds approach combining EAFRD with ERDF and/or ESF. This is specifically interesting for urban regions which is intended in Hungary and Romania, for example. ITIs as new instrument for this period is mostly intended for urban development. In addition, OPs still integrated the urban aspect with using urban related investment priorities in ERDF. Next to Cohesion Policy there are numerous programmes and elements of EU policies which are of vital importance for cities and urban regions, just to name a few: Trans-European Networks for Transport (TEN-T) and the Connecting Europe facility (CEF), Horizon 2020 for Science, Technology and Innovation or JESSICA for urban regeneration. From the perspective of local authorities the range of programmes and tools offers on the one hand valuable financial incentives on the other hand it poses a veritable challenge in terms of knowledge-building. Manifold different platforms, networks and interactions would offer benefits and in turn would benefit from a strong involvement from local authorities but capacity constraints are a serious impediment for the involvement of the stakeholders from the local level. And pronounced urban policies at national level are not in place (yet) in many Member States. The European Commission sees the improvement of urban intelligence, benchmarking and monitoring as one of the major goals of the Agenda. Recommendation: The wealth of information generated at European level in platforms, by interest groupings, by programmes is enormous but from the local perspective it is only accessible and useful if it is well-structured and has \u2018entry gates\u2019 which are easily accessible. Several think-tanks on the urban issue at European level exist \u2013 very important ones are: the URBACT programme and its investment in capitalisation, the European Urban Knowledge Network (EUKN) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC). These institutions are a key resource in the process of collecting and structuring information and turning it into knowledge-driven strategies. A structured repository of information on good practices fuelled by these institutions could become a valuable asset in promoting the Urban Agenda. ",
        "142 At Member States level urban policies are even less represented with a strong focus in those Member States where urbanisation is quite advanced such as the Netherlands. Most Member States focus on rather general approaches to regional development without any specific focus on cities and urban areas. But even without explicit urban dimension regional development constitutes a major policy area of interest for cities and urban regions since it comprises the management of economic development as well as the management of settlements and infrastructure: these aspects strongly influence urban areas. Summarising the current situation one has to state that administrative structures at all levels have difficulties to adequately respond to the changes and challenges calling for integrated policy responses. It is evident that established structures and routines in administration and politics are hard to change but the dominant approach based on mostly linear actions tends to reduce efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of results. It is evident that efforts for an EU Urban Agenda have to start at EU level. Concerted awareness-raising and initiatives across sectors at European level can provide visible impetus for national policies. Knowing this the establishment of an EU Urban Agenda is even more important in order to provide a model in terms of the coordination across different actors and actions in order to address the most pressing challenges. The European debate about the EU Urban Agenda is already ongoing since several years. The European Commission has already defined the main focus of an EU Urban Agenda including better regulation, result orientation as well as improvements of coherence and coordination. The European Parliament has stressed ancillary elements in particular multi-level governance, decentralisation and the involvement of local authorities in the process. Notwithstanding the relevance of the aspects listed this is still quite abstract and will as such fail to mobilise local and regional authorities. One of the major points at European level is the sustained focus on incentives which guide actions in terms of addressing the key themes but also in terms of governance, i.e. strengthening integrated policy approaches. One of the major challenges for an EU Urban Agenda which goes beyond overarching guidance towards a streamlining of tools and approaches is the balance between the following positions: \uf06e Encouragement for targeted place-based approaches in order to strengthen and enable local authorities and to support actions tailored to the specific context of their city or urban region. ",
        "143 \uf06e Definition of key levers, parameters and indicators to effectively cope with the most pressing challenges from a European perspective. For the key elements of the Agenda it is important to take a closer look at the role of key infrastructures and policy areas which represent the major tasks and concerns of local authorities. Generally speaking cities and urban regions are marked by density and thus interrelations between infrastructures and policies are vital in an urban context. And it is evident that there is a number of key areas which deserve particular attention. There are several elements which have a cross-cutting or transversal role, i.e. these elements have an influence on manifold other policy elements: the analysis confirms the transversal role of information networks, educational infrastructures and STI. These infrastructures\u2019 respective policy fields reveal significant potentialities but pose also the highest requirements in terms of (horizontal and vertical) policy coordination in order to exploit the potentialities effectively. One could say that this is the software of an EU Urban Agenda , acting as enabler and driver of developments in combination with societal changes such as demographic change and migration. Heavy-investment infrastructures in an urban context are transport, waste and water management, energy supply and site development (for housing, business, recreation). Policy coordination in these fields is essential because a lack of coordination has significant financial impact in the long run but in contrast to the aforementioned software the coordination requirements are more focused on vertical coordination (i.e. with the regional and national level) in order to cope with the financial implications of maintenance and operation or expansion. These fields could be considered as the hardware of an EU Urban Agenda . Figure 11. Simplified EU Urban Agenda model Source: Metis GmbH. Policy coordination Key parameter (cases) Indicators Individual approaches and projects contextual driven Urban Agenda Cross border Interaction and cooperation Capacity building Research Hardware Software ",
        "144 Furthermore, the EU Urban Agenda has to acknowledge the possibilities of cities in implementing new approaches and which kind of aspects are rather national or globally driven with low influence at local level. One of the utmost and obvious functions of the Urban Agenda is to raise awareness for those themes and policy fields which have an enormous weight in terms of impact and future development paths: resource efficiency, social issues and transport deserve particular attention in this regard. The Study proposes the focus on four broad clusters of themes: each of these clusters consists of several (sectoral) policies which reveal dense interlinkages. All of the theme clusters are marked by the fact that the potential role of LRAs in key intervention areas is high. The theme clusters are: \uf06e Social fabric. \uf06e Resource efficiency. \uf06e Urban economy. \uf06e Urban governance A cross-cutting aspect which is also at least partly in the hands of local authorities is transport. Transport is a genuine transversal element: it is vital to make cities function, public transport is one of the major potentialities related to resource efficiency, the accessibility and market size of a city determines its economy to as significant extent and finally transport and logistics are a growing economic sector with a strong STI and ICT element. Urban Economy 77.4% of jobs in the EU are based in European cities and greater cities. 53% of companies are located in European cities and greater cities. A lot of global factors as well as contextual aspects are important for a prospering urban economy . Several key parameters are shaped by EU and national legislation as well as financial instruments. In particular taxation and access to finance are decisive elements of an attractive and investment-friendly climate which fosters entrepreneurship. In this field a limited number of direct levers for LRAs exist such as foremost education but also business infrastructure. Facing the diversity of urban economies the focus of LRAs should be on setting-up well-functioning core ",
        "145 infrastructure and public amenities which make the city foremost an attractive place to live and work. This is a complex and wide ranging subject including sustainable urbanism based on smart settlement strategies as well as open atmosphere for young and innovative industries, social inclusion as well as intelligent and foresighted use of lighthouse projects. Especially projects which are triggering innovation should be in focus. Cities in this respect do at least have the possibility to establish facilities and partnerships with the use of structural funds. Best practice interventions and the exchange of experience are important for local authorities. The CoR\u2019s role could be to bridge different types and sizes of urban areas and translate projects from one type to another. Resource efficiency Urban keys for resource-efficient development are: \uf0a7 Transport \u2013 accounting for 30% of primary energy consumption. \uf0a7 Energy efficiency of building \u2013 buildings are accounting for 40% of primary energy consumption; programmes and tax incentives on an increased renovation rate would uncap an enormous potential lever for jobs. \uf0a7 Land use \u2013 as land consumption per person has risen considerably and urban sprawl counteracts the major potentialities of cities for more resource efficiency. \uf0a7 Waste management \u2013 as the dominant item in public spending for environment protection centrepiece of approaches towards circular economy. Resource efficiency and energy production is only to a certain extend a matter of urban authorities. The potential of change lies mainly in the subject of resource efficiency. In this matter, cities can play as a role model as well as initiate new innovative solutions. The focus on resource efficiency includes not only the renovation and isolation of buildings but also the implementation of green public procurement as well as local awareness raising campaigns. Local authorities need to get motivated to be engaged in this subject with respective policy approaches beyond EU funding. The CoR could help to enhance the understanding of the need to get engaged in sustainable development across policies and political parties. In different Member States legal regulations do have different levels of actors, for example land use can be a subject of local authorities. The results are often devastating. A clear regulation as well as incentives to reduce grassland reallocations are the main levers for reducing urban sprawl. ",
        "146 Social Fabric Public spending for social protection, health and education accounts for almost 32% of the EU\u2019s GDP. Unemployment \u2013 in particular youth unemployment rising poverty are the key challenges for Europe with deep implications for politics and policy at all levels. Urban keys related to the social fabric are: \uf0a7 Education \u2013 as key means to reduce the unemployment and poverty risk but also to integrate migrant population. \uf0a7 Housing \u2013 as second key means to reduce poverty risk. \uf0a7 Health \u2013 challenged by rising costs and an aging population In the context of the EU Urban Agenda it is important to highlight the importance of local governance related to the social fabric . It is obvious that social and societal developments are highly dependent on demographics and political pressures. When taking a closer look at public spending for education, social and health affairs, it becomes clear that these spending areas also dominate the public finances at LRA level. In terms of competencies as well as financial and policy levers, it is obvious that the major role in the policies mentioned is in the hands of Member States. Policy instruments at the EU level are of crucial importance since these have to be additional and complementary to national measures. Moreover, they have to be considered as investment policies. Significant parts of spending for social protection at the Member State level are public expenditures for old-age pensions and unemployment benefits. In the context of an EU Urban Agenda two main policy levers for social inclusion respectively combating urban poverty have been highlighted: education and (social) housing. A further important policy lever is the provision of health services. Social housing is an important example of a public investment policy which is also often mentioned in the context of public incentives to job generation. Thus it could be understood as a countercyclical investment in times of the economic crisis. Although its actual influence on the social fabric is limited for local authorities it becomes apparent that for projects addressing social housing the administrative capacities of local authorities are essential for successful implementation. It is therefore essential to empower LRAs and to enrich their capacity in this respect. Finally, the matter of migration, which only recently showed how unprepared EU and Member States are with the side effects, needs to be settled at EU level. ",
        "147 Local authorities are the one directly absorbing the impact of unplanned migration flows and it heavily depends on the local authority experience and leadership competences to handle social acceptance and logistics. Overall, there should be a better balance between those absorbing migration and those refusing. The agreement can only be reached at EU level and the CoR\u2019s role in this respect should help to understand the needs of local authorities to face future migration in all Member States. Urban governance Given the challenges outlined in the analysis and related to the priority areas sketched above the importance of urban governance is evident. Sound governance has an obvious economic dimension due to the significant role of public spending in the EU: roughly one third of all public expenditure in the EU is spent by local and regional authorities, which accounts for \u20ac2,100 billion a year. Regarding public investment in the EU the expenditures of local and regional authorities even make up 70% of all public investment in the EU. Urban governance has also an obvious role in ensuring smart, inclusive growth. Most urban growth strategies demand rather complex and integrated strategies and policy approaches in order to become effective. A resulting cross-cutting challenge for modern urban governance is the need for skilled staff and knowledge management in the urban administration. As exemplary elements of modern urban governance aspects such as Life Cycle Analysis in infrastructure management, set-up and management of Public-Private-Partnerships or participatory approaches in the rehabilitation of deprived neighbourhoods as well as the governance of Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3) have been highlighted. These have to be considered as examples since there are numerous other ones such as the implementation of Green Public Procurement or the governance of SGEI which pose considerable requirements in terms of governance and administrative capacities. 5.2 General recommendations The study\u2019s main recommendation is the incorporation of the business cases into the EU Urban Agenda. The business cases would enrich the currently broad agenda draft and lead towards content driven actions. The detailed recommendations below therefore address the different aspects of the EU Urban Agenda and the process of its implementation. ",
        "148 A holistic and cross cutting approach of European policies is necessary . With the exception of some parts of the cohesion policy, EU policies are neither integrated nor urban related. Most of the EU policies are as sectoral as Member States policies. The integrated approach should start at EU level. An assessment of the urban relation of EU policies in all DGs of the European Commission should help to understand the relevance of EU policies for cities. The results should be incorporated as urban policies in the EU Urban Agenda and should be incorporated in the next review of the EU 2020 Strategy. The same exercise should be conducted at national level with the result of incorporating the most relevant urban related policies in the agenda. The assessment should follow the business case logic and should help a better contribution of EU policies to the cases. Definition of key parameters for each of the business cases: The EU Urban Agenda should include key parameters in order to enable local authorities to act towards smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. In this respect, the EU Urban Agenda should provide guidelines for Member State authorities to establish regulative parameter regarding legislation, infrastructure and financial sources. Based on the policy assessment the cases developed in the present study should be the leading laboratories for the EU Urban Agenda. They are based on the assessment of the most relevant policies and the respective influence of local authorities, which are: \uf06e Business. \uf06e Climate action. \uf06e Economy, finance and tax. \uf06e Employment and social rights. \uf06e Energy and natural resources. \uf06e Environment, consumer protection, health. \uf06e External relations and foreign affairs. \uf06e Science, Technology and Innovation (STI). \uf06e Cohesion policy. \uf06e Transport. \uf06e Cultural policy. The CoR can serve as a platform to conduct the capacity enhancement and knowhow exchange. Local authorities should be able to address CoR representatives with questions related to the practical use of BAT. Monitoring and evaluation of the business cases: In order to allow the local authorities monitoring the implementation of business cases, indicators ",
        "149 developed by the JRC should be incorporated into the agenda and adapted where necessary. Only together with a well-developed indicator system the EU Urban Agenda gets binding. Support local authorities in defining the most suitable actions based on the individual urban areas: Most important for addressing specific urban needs is to understand the respective urban context. This can only be done by the local actors. The EU Urban Agenda should support the bottom up approach of addressing specific needs. It should provide an interactive tool helping local actors to choose the right tools and enter new paths. Therefore the agenda should be more than a paper but an interactive platform. In this respect, existing platforms should be taken rather than creating additional ones. The CoR should act as a moderator as well as mediator between different levels of authorities. Understand and acknowledge the context of urban areas and cities: Current policies at EU level are strongly unified without acknowledging the different contextual elements. This results in sometimes inefficient use of sources and frustration. Implementation of other EU strategies and agendas: The European Commission has recently published several cross sectoral agendas which do have a considerable impact on urban areas and politics. For example the European Agenda on Migration, Circular Economy Package, climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, and the Europe 2020 strategy. Use learning platforms for best practice: There are several networks and learning platforms existing but the mere number reduces efficiency and impact. There needs to be developed one well conducted platform which helps to filter the most important aspects of each project and the value added for other cities. The filter should follow the path of the business cases describing the key parameters, interventions, output and indicators as well as the most important contextual influences. With the results different cities could overtake best practices. It is important to establish an understanding which context parameters influence which intervention in order to enable local authorities to choose the right interventions. Support the empowerment of urban local authorities in Member States: Local authorities are engaged in a wide range of different sectoral as well as process aspects. Local authorities need to understand the changes in local governance and with increasing responsibilities local authorities will have to carry further future challenges. LRAs need to understand that functional ",
        "150 leadership is going to be the future role rather than political agents. The new democratic models should be subject of a wider debate at EU level as well as at regional and local level. LRAs should be given the possibility to decide in an apolitical context. Exchange and discussion should be possible between urban areas and cities and between different levels of public authorities. Local authorities should be able to act across administrative borders in order to improve efficiency and sustainability rather than competing with administrative neighbour regions. For this purpose the EU Urban Agenda should support the metropolitan regional governance across administrative borders. Capacity building of local administrations towards integrated urban development: modern urban governance requires skilled staff in the administration, a new approach to knowledge management and tools as well as the acceptance of new perceptions and attitudes in politics and administration. Set up working groups for better implementing business cases: The business cases defined in the study need further input and exchange between experts in order to provide a stable platform for integrated action at local level. Considering the mandate given by the Treaties, the CoR should lead and conduct the working groups. It is essential to better integrate experts in the respective fields as well as representatives of different types of urban areas. On the basis of the business cases and in the frame of the EU Urban Agenda profound initiatives should be established. Existing initiatives for example European Innovation Partnerships or urban networks and project should be involved. In order to establish such initiatives the following steps are proposed: \uf06e Stakeholder and policy mapping. \uf06e Data mapping in a more detailed way as it was possible in the study. \uf06e Best practice mapping based on the recommendations above. \uf06e Strategy development for each business case. \uf06e Organisational structure. \uf06e Definition of objective and work plan. With this basic feature it would be possible to trigger a set up for all five cases. ",
