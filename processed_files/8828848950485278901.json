        "I (Resolutions, recommendations and opinions) RESOLUTIONS EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT P8_TA(2015)0006 Russia, in particular the case of Alexei Navalny European Parliament resolution of 15 January 2015 on Russia, in particular the case of Alexei Navalny (2015/ 2503(RSP)) (2016/C 300/01) The European Parliament , \u2014 having regard to the Constitution of Russia, in particular Article 118 thereof, which states that justice in the Russian Federation shall be administered by courts alone, and Article 120 thereof, which provides that judges are independent and are subordinate only to the Russian Constitution and federal law; \u2014 having regard to its previous resolutions on Russia, in particular its resolutions of 23 October 2012 on common visa restrictions for Russian officials involved in the Sergei Magnitsky case ( 1 ), 13 June 2013 on the rule of law in Russia ( 2 ), 13 March 2014 on Russia: sentencing of demonstrators involved in the Bolotnaya Square events ( 3 ), and 23 October 2014 on the closing-down of the NGO \u2018Memorial\u2019 (winner of the 2009 Sakharov Prize) in Russia ( 4 ) and its recommendation to the Council of 2 April 2014 on establishing common visa restrictions for Russian officials involved in the Sergei Magnitsky case ( 5 ), \u2014 having regard to its resolution of 11 December 2013 on the Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World 2012 and the European Union\u2019s policy on the matter ( 6 ), \u2014 having regard to the statement by the Spokesperson of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (VP/HR) of 30 December 2014 on the sentencing of Alexei Navalny and his brother Oleg Navalny by the Zamoskvoretsky Court, \u2014 having regard to the EU-Russia human rights consultations of 28 November 2013, \u2014 having regard to the existing Agreement on partnership and cooperation establishing a partnership between the European Communities and their Member States, of one part, and the Russian Federation, of the other part (PCA), and the suspended negotiations for a new EU-Russia agreement, \u2014 having regard to Rules 135(5) and 123(4) of its Rules of Procedure, C 300/2 EN Official Journal of the European Union 18.8.2016 Thursday 15 January 2015 ( 1 ) OJ C 68 E, 7.3.2014, p. 13.

        "A. whereas the Russian Federation, as a full member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and a signatory to the UN declaration, has committed itself to the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights; whereas, as a result of numerous serious violations of the rule of law and the adoption of restrictive laws during the past months, there are grave concerns about to Russia\u2019s compliance with international and national obligations; and whereas the EU has repeatedly offered additional assistance and expertise, through the Partnership for Modernisation, to help Russia to modernise and abide by its constitutional and legal order, in line with Council of Europe standards; whereas there are a multitude of judicial cases in which politically constructed reasons are used to eliminate political competition, threaten civil society and discourage citizens from participating in public rallies and protests opposing the country\u2019s current leadership; B. whereas Alexei Navalny has consistently exposed massive corruption within the highest levels of the Russian state apparatus; whereas his first court verdict imposing a five-year sentence on him in July 2013 was seen as political; whereas he was placed under house arrest for two months in February 2014, and was fitted with an electronic bracelet to monitor his activities in March 2014; C. whereas Alexei Navalny won 27 % of the vote in the September 2013 Moscow mayoral elections, thus confirming himself as one of the most prominent faces of the Russian opposition to the Kremlin; D. whereas Alexei Navalny\u2019s second court verdict had been due on 15 January 2015, but inexplicably the court brought the date forward to 30 December 2014, when most Russians were focused on the New Year holiday; whereas the same technique of bringing the date forward was used with Mikhail Khodorkovsky; E. whereas the human rights situation in Russia has deteriorated dramatically in recent years and the Russian authorities have adopted a series of laws which contain ambiguous provisions that are used to further restrict opposition and civil society actors, and hinder the freedoms of expression and assembly; F. whereas in the last year legislation on NGOs and on the right to freedom of assembly has been used to suppress civil society, stifle opposing political views and harass NGOs, democratic opposition and the media; whereas, pursuant to the \u2018foreign agents\u2019 law, the independent rights organisation \u2018Memorial\u2019 was de facto closed down; whereas the implementation of this law has involved severe actions aimed at preventing and dissuading civil society organisations, including the Soldiers\u2019 Mothers organisation, from carrying out their work; G. whereas at the end of December 2014 the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation substantially amended the list of \u2018foreign agents\u2019, adding several organisations engaging in support for the protection of human rights, including the Sakharov Centre, thus hampering notably their activities and the protection of human rights in Russia; H. whereas several trials and judicial proceedings over the last few years, such as the Magnitsky, Khodorkovsky and Politkovskaya cases, have cast doubt on the independence and impartiality of the judicial institutions of the Russian Federation; whereas such high-profile cases as that of Alexei Navalny are merely the most well-known cases outside Russia of what amounts to a systematic failure of the Russian state to uphold the rule of law and to deliver justice to its citizens; whereas the current court decision represents a politically motivated attempt to punish Alexei Navalny as one of the most prominent opponents of the government; 18.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 300/3 Thursday 15 January 2015 ",
        "I. whereas there is an increasing need for a firm, coherent and comprehensive EU policy towards Russia, supported by all the Member States, with support and assistance backed up by firm and fair criticism; 1. Expresses its deepest concern at the fact that, in Russia, the law is being used as a political instrument; underlines that the conviction of the prominent lawyer, anti-corruption campaigner and social activist Alexei Navalny, imposing a 3.5-year suspended sentence on him and a 3.5-year prison sentence on his brother, Oleg Navalny, was based on unsubstantiated charges; strongly deplores that the prosecution seems to be politically motivated; 2. Notes with concern that, even though Alexei Navalny is being kept out of prison, his brother Oleg Navalny is currently imprisoned, and that this is giving rise to concern with regard to the possible political use of a family member to intimidate and silence one of Russia\u2019s opposition leaders, Alexei Navalny; recalls that Alexei\u2019s brother, Oleg, the father of two small children and a former executive of the state-owned postal service, has never played a role in the Russian opposition movement; 3. Urges the Russian judicial and law-enforcement authorities to carry out their duties in an impartial and independent manner, free of political interference and to ensure that the judicial proceedings in the Navalny cases, and all the other investigations and trials against opposition activists, meet the internationally accepted standards; stresses the importance of ensuring that judicial decisions are free from political interference, independent, and are taken in full compliance with the rule of law; 4. Fully backs the campaign against corruption in Russia initiated by Alexei Navalny, and supports the efforts of Russian people to find a settlement ensuring democracy, political pluralism, unity and respect for human rights; 5. Takes the view that the Russian Federation, as a member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, should meet the obligations to which it has signed up; points out that the recent developments have moved in a direction that is contrary to the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary in the country; 6. Calls on the Presidents of the Council and the Commission, and the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (VP/HR) to continue to follow such cases closely, to raise these issues in different formats and meetings with Russia, and to report back to Parliament on the exchanges with the Russian authorities; 7. Stresses that freedom of assembly in the Russian Federation is enshrined in Article 31 of the Russian Constitution and in the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Russia is a signatory and which the Russian authorities are therefore obliged to comply with; 8. Urges the Council to develop a unified policy towards Russia that commits the 28 EU Member States and EU institutions to a strong common message on the role of human rights in the EU-Russia relationship and the need to end the crackdown on freedom of expression, assembly and association in Russia; 9. Asks the VP/HR to come up, as a matter of urgency, with a comprehensive strategy towards Russia, aimed at maintaining the territorial integrity and sovereignty of European states, and supporting, at the same time, the strengthening of democratic principles, respect for human rights and the rule of law in Russia; C 300/4 EN Official Journal of the European Union 18.8.2016 Thursday 15 January 2015 ",
        "10. Expresses its deep concern about the continuous wave of attacks against independent human rights organisations and civil society groups in Russia, which is another sign of the crackdown on independent voices, a trend that is of growing concern to the European Union; urges the Commission and the EEAS, with regard to the ongoing programming phase of the EU financial instruments, to increase its financial assistance to Russian civil society through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights and the civil society organisations and local authorities funds, and to include the EU Russia Civil Society Forum in the Partnership Instrument in order to ensure sustainable and credible long-term support; welcomes the decision of the Board of Governors of the European Endowment for Democracy (EED) to allow the Endowment to extend its work also to Russia; 11. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the President, Government and Parliament of the Russian Federation. 18.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 300/5 Thursday 15 January 2015 ",

        "\u2014 having regard to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966, to which Pakistan is a party, \u2014 having regard to Rules 135(5) and 123(4) of its Rules of Procedure, A. whereas on 16 December 2014 seven armed men launched a deadly attack against an Army Public School in the city of Peshawar \u2014 which is surrounded on three sides by the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) \u2014 killing over 140 people, including 134 school children, and injuring a nearly equal number; B. whereas this attack has created great shock inside and outside of Pakistan, being perceived as the most cruel terrorist act in Pakistan\u2019s history, intensified by the fact that it took eight hours before military forces regained control of the school; whereas many pupils and school personnel were executed and injured in that interval and those surviving the ordeal remain deeply traumatised; C. whereas Malala Yousafzai, the youngest ever Nobel Peace Prize winner and recipient of the Sakharov Prize, was shot in the head by Taliban gunmen in October 2012 for campaigning for girls\u2019 education in Pakistan; D. whereas the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the massacre and said one of the reasons for the attack on the school was to send a strong message to the supporters of Malala, who advocates education for women and children, as well as to take \u2018revenge\u2019 for the army\u2019s campaign against the militants; E. whereas since the government offensive against the Taliban and other militant groups started in the FATA area, one of the poorest areas of Pakistan, over one million people have been displaced to Afghanistan or various parts of Pakistan; F. whereas freedom of belief and religious tolerance in Pakistan are both threatened by terrorist violence and the widespread abuse of blasphemy laws; whereas women and girls are doubly exposed, both to enforced conversion and to widespread sexual violence; G. whereas according to the report by the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack (GCPEA), there were over 800 or more attacks on schools in Pakistan between 2009 and 2012; whereas militants have also recruited children from schools and madrassas, some to be suicide bombers; whereas, according to the report, at least 30 children, dozens of school teachers and other education personnel, including one provincial education minister, were killed in attacks on schools and school transport between 2009 and 2012; H. whereas the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has suggested that Pakistan establish a rapid response system whenever there are attacks on educational institutions, in order to promptly repair and rebuild them and replace educational materials so that students can be reintegrated into schools/universities as soon as possible; whereas recent changes to the constitution have made access to free compulsory education a fundamental right; I. whereas within hours of the APS Peshawar attack, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif lifted the death penalty moratorium which had been in place for six years; whereas so far several prisoners on death row on terrorism-related charges have been executed; whereas according to Pakistani officials 500 convicts could be executed in the coming weeks; whereas there are an estimated 8 000 people on death row in Pakistan; J. whereas on 6 January 2015, in reaction to the school massacre, the Pakistani Parliament passed a constitutional amendment which empowers military courts for the next two years to try suspected Islamist militants and could move defendants from arrest to execution in a matter of weeks; whereas as a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Pakistan is obliged to uphold and take measures to ensure basic fair trials and is prohibited from using military courts to try civilians when the regular courts are functioning; 18.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 300/7 Thursday 15 January 2015 ",
        "K. whereas Pakistan recently ratified seven of the nine most significant international agreements on human rights, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which contain a range of provisions on the administration of justice, the right to a fair trial, equality before the law and non-discrimination; L. whereas the recommendations made by the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers in her report of 4 April 2013 include reforming the legal system so as to ensure that fundamental rights are upheld and the system is effective; whereas human rights organisations regularly draw attention to corruption in the legal system; M. whereas the EU and Pakistan have deepened and broadened their bilateral ties, as exemplified by the five-year engagement plan, launched in February 2012, and the second EU-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue, held in March 2014; whereas the aim of the EU-Pakistan five-year engagement plan is to build a strategic relationship and forge a partnership for peace and development rooted in shared values and principles; N. whereas the stability of Pakistan is of a key importance to peace in South Asia and beyond; whereas Pakistan plays an important role in fostering stability in the region and could be expected to lead by example in strengthening the rule of law and human rights; 1. Strongly condemns the brutal massacre of schoolchildren perpetrated by Pakistani Taliban splinter group Tehreek-e- Taliban (TTP) as an act of horror and cowardice, and expresses its condolences to the families of the victims of the Peshawar school attack and its support to the people and the authorities of Pakistan; 2. Expresses its full commitment to tackling the threat posed by terrorism and religious extremism and its readiness to further assist the Pakistani Government in this; 3. Expects the Government of Pakistan to take urgent and effective measures, in keeping with internationally recognised standards of the rule of law, to address the security threat posed by all militant groups operating within Pakistan and the surrounding region, without exception; underlines that no form of terrorism or extremism should be supported by the authorities; 4. Calls on the Government of Pakistan to ensure the safety of schools and to make sure that children, regardless of gender, are never intimidated while going to school; believes the government should show significantly stronger determination and strengthen its efforts to arrest and prosecute TTP militants and others who target schools for violence, failing which its international credibility will be undermined; 5. Recalls its constant opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances; regrets the decision by Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif to rescind a four-year unofficial moratorium on capital punishment, and calls for this moratorium to be reinstated immediately; 6. Calls on the Government of Pakistan to reserve anti-terrorism laws for acts of terror, instead of being using them to try ordinary criminal cases; regrets strongly the recourse to fast-track military justice which lacks minimal conditions of international standards of the rule of law, and underlines that the prolonged granting of GSP+ preferences is linked to the accomplishment of certain basic standards enshrined in UN and ILO conventions; C 300/8 EN Official Journal of the European Union 18.8.2016 Thursday 15 January 2015 ",
        "7. Welcomes the will of Pakistan\u2019s political parties to come up with a national plan to tackle terrorism; emphasises that in the fight against terrorism and religious extremism it is crucial to work on its root causes, including by addressing poverty, ensuring religious tolerance and freedom of belief, reinforcing the rule of law and guaranteeing the right and safe access to education for girls and boys; calls for a long-term strategy to prevent the radicalisation of young people in Pakistan and tackle the \u2018extensive learning crisis\u2019 which UNESCO has established for Pakistan, in particular by increasing investment in a publicly funded education system and by making sure religious schools have the materials they need to provide a balanced and inclusive education to young people; 8. Urges the Pakistani Government to abide by the recently ratified international agreements on human rights, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which oblige the authorities to ensure basic fair trials prohibiting them from using military courts to try civilians when the regular courts are functioning; 9. Calls for a renewed international commitment to fighting the financing and sponsorship of terrorist networks; 10.

        "X. whereas the Special Report submitted to Parliament was the result of a comprehensive own-initiative inquiry concerning the obligations of Frontex in regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and was ultimately motivated mainly by the agency\u2019s response to the specific recommendations of the Ombudsman for redressing the absence of an appeals mechanism for asylum seekers; Y. whereas a Special Report is the last resort of the European Ombudsman for dealing with cases of maladministration by institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union; whereas the Ombudsman should further explore her political powers and develop the instruments available to her; Z. whereas compliance with the Ombudsman\u2019s proposals in 2012 was 80 %; whereas the Commission, which accounts for the highest proportion of the Ombudsman\u2019s inquiries, had a compliance rate of 84 %; whereas every year the Ombudsman publishes a comprehensive account of how the EU institutions have responded to the Ombudsman\u2019s proposals for improving EU administration; whereas the 20 % non-compliance rate regarding the Ombudsman\u2019s proposals represents a serious threat that could lead to further erosion of citizens\u2019 confidence in the effectiveness of the European institutions; AA. whereas the European Commission is the institution concerning which the Ombudsman receives the highest number of complaints; whereas one of the investigations concluded in 2013 concerned documents regarding the UK\u2019s exemption clause relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU; AB. whereas the average length of inquiries in cases closed by the Ombudsman in 2013 was 13 months; whereas 22 % of cases were closed within 3 months, 37 % within 3 to 12 months, 14 % within 12 to 18 months, and 27 % after more than 18 months; AC. whereas the Ombudsman\u2019s budget in 2013 was EUR 9 731 371 and whereas the Ombudsman\u2019s establishment plan consists of 67 posts; whereas maintaining sufficient budget and human resources is essential to ensure the efficiency of the Ombudsman\u2019s services and rapid responses to citizens\u2019 complaints; AD. whereas Emily O\u2019Reilly has been the first woman elected to the position of European Ombudsman; 1. Approves the annual report for 2013 presented by the European Ombudsman; congratulates Emily O\u2019Reilly on her first annual report as Ombudsman and welcomes her approach in terms of keeping up positive working relations and cooperation with Parliament, in particular with its Committee on Petitions; acknowledges that 2013 was a transition year and that a large part of the annual report relates to the work of Professor Nikiforos Diamandouros, the outgoing European Ombudsman, and pays tribute to his legacy; 2. Commits itself to restoring Parliament's practice of inviting the Ombudsman to plenary immediately after his/her election; 3. Gives its full support to the new Ombudsman\u2019s stated ultimate goal, which is to help strengthen the structures and institutions of accountability and transparency at European level, in order to promote good administration for every EU citizen and resident, and to improve the quality of democracy in the Union; reiterates the crucial role of the European Ombudsman in addressing citizens\u2019 concerns and helping bridge the wide gap that exists between them and the EU institutions; 4. Stresses the importance of social media as a channel for communication, and encourages the Ombudsman\u2019s office to make greater use of such media in order to raise public awareness of the Ombudsman\u2019s activities and promote the rights of EU citizens; considers, however, that the further digitalisation of the Ombudsman\u2019s services should not lead to the exclusion of citizens who do not have access to or cannot use the internet; calls on the Ombudsman to pay special attention to the needs of such citizens, so that every EU citizen is ensured equal access and can thus make full use of the Ombudsman\u2019s services; 18.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 300/17 Thursday 15 January 2015 ",
        "5. Notes that the Ombudsman\u2019s annual report has been revamped for 2013 and that in addition to the traditional print version, a downloadable interactive version is now also available in e-book format; further notes that the report has been split into two parts, one part being an easy-to-read reference text setting out the most important facts and figures on the Ombudsman\u2019s work in 2013, and the other containing an in-depth account of key cases investigated by the Ombudsman in 2013 ( 1 ); 6. Commends this new approach on the Ombudsman\u2019s part, which was adopted to reflect her desire to make her institution as accessible and user-friendly as possible; encourages interested parties to read the in-depth investigations section entitled: \u2018Good administration in practice: the European Ombudsman\u2019s decisions in 2013\u2019, and to take to heart the Ombudsman\u2019s considerations and recommendations; 7. Notes that in 2013 the Member State with the largest number of complaints was Spain (416), followed by Germany (269), Poland (248) and Belgium (153); notes that as regards inquiries opened per Member State Belgium (53) takes the lead, followed by Germany (40), Italy (39), and Spain (34); 8. Notes that transparency-related issues once again topped the Ombudsman\u2019s list of inquiries closed (64,3 %), representing an increase on 2012 (52,7 %); notes that the other key topics in complaints were ethical issues, citizens\u2019 participation in EU decision-making, EU-funded projects, fundamental rights, and culture of service; 9. Considers that transparency, openness, access to information, respect for the rights of citizens and high ethical standards are essential for building and maintaining citizens\u2019 and residents\u2019 trust in the European civil service; emphasises that trust between citizens and residents and the institutions is of paramount importance in today\u2019s difficult economic situation; agrees with the Ombudsman that transparency is a cornerstone of an advanced democracy, making it possible to scrutinise the activities of public authorities, evaluate their performance and call them to account; agrees equally that openness and public access to documents form an essential part of the system of institutional checks and balances; acknowledges the right of citizens to privacy and to protection of their personal data; 10. Notes that recommendations and critical remarks are not legally binding, but stresses that nevertheless the EU institutions can use them as an opportunity to fix a problem, learn a lesson for the future and avoid reoccurrence of similar cases of maladministration; urges all institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union to cooperate fully with the Ombudsman and ensure full compliance with her recommendations, and also to make full use of the critical remarks; recalls that the Charter of Fundamental Rights (Article 41) includes the right to good administration as a fundamental right of citizens of the European Union; 11. Notes that a large majority of inquiries conducted by the Ombudsman over the past year (64,3 %) concerned the European Commission; recognises that the Commission is the institution whose decisions are most likely to directly affect citizens, civil society organisations and businesses; understands that the Commission is therefore the main object of public scrutiny; notes with concern, however, that the share of complaints concerning the Commission has risen compared to 2012 when it was 52,7 %; encourages the Ombudsman to examine the reasons for this increase in order to help improve the Commission\u2019s administration and thus increase the credibility of the EU institutions as a whole; calls on the new Commission to take rapid action to improve its performance with the objective of reducing the number of complaints against it; considers that the involvement of the Commission in opaque entities such as the Troika does not tend to promote transparency and accountability within the Union, nor does it respect the principle of subsidiarity; 12. Notes with concern that the percentage of complaints concerning EU agencies has almost doubled, from 12,5 % in 2012 to 24 % in 2013; suggests that the Ombudsman indicate whether this increase was the result of greater public awareness of complaints procedures or was caused by other factors, such as possible non-compliance of EU agencies with the Ombudsman\u2019s recommendations from previous years; encourages the Ombudsman to monitor developments in the agencies and report back in good time; supports the Ombudsman\u2019s plans to reach out to the various agencies with a view to emphasising the importance of good administration, good complaint handling, and a culture of service; C 300/18 EN Official Journal of the European Union 18.8.2016 Thursday 15 January 2015 ( 1 ) http://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/en/activities/annualreports.faces ",

Notes that in 2013 the Ombudsman published a new version of the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour; calls on all the institutions to fully respect and implement this code; calls on the new Commission to adopt common binding rules and principles on administrative procedure in the EU\u2019s administration, and in particular to submit a draft regulation to this end; recalls that Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union stipulates that \u2018every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union\u2019; 15. Encourages all EU institutions, bodies and agencies to improve their performance by deepening their commitment to good administration and to the principles of a culture of service to citizens; calls on them to assist the Ombudsman by speedily responding to her inquiries and to collaborate more closely with her in order to reduce the deadlines in the inquiry process for complaints; supports the Ombudsman in her efforts to further speed up the inquiry process and reduce the response timeframe for processing complaints with a view to serving citizens who exercise their rights in a timely and proper manner; 16. Notes that overall compliance with the Ombudsman\u2019s recommendations stood at 80 % in 2012, slightly down from 82 % in 2011; supports the Ombudsman in her ambition to improve the compliance rate; urges the Commission, in particular, to make all efforts to improve its compliance rate; is concerned at the 20 % non-compliance rate, and urges the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union to respond and react within a reasonable timeframe to the critical remarks of the Ombudsman and to make all the necessary efforts to improve their follow-up rate through the prompt implementation of the Ombudsman\u2019s recommendations and critical remarks; looks forward to the specific information that will be provided in the Ombudsman\u2019s upcoming annual report on compliance in 2013; 17.

Notes that the Ombudsman submitted one Special Report to Parliament, the subject of which was the absence of a mechanism in the Frontex agency for dealing with complaints about fundamental rights infringements arising from its work; is confident that this Special Report will be the subject of a report to be drawn up by its Committee on Petitions in cooperation with its Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs; 19. Encourages the Ombudsman to deepen her relations and cooperation with the various networks, in particular the European Network of Ombudsmen and the framework under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; recalls Parliament\u2019s call in the Committee on Petitions\u2019 Annual Report of 2012 for the setting- up, by Parliament, of a network encompassing petitions committees in the Member States, which could be supplementary to the European Network of Ombudsmen; 20.

        "D. whereas Turkey already holds a very large number of jailed journalists and journalists awaiting trial, and the pressure against the media has increased over the past few years, including against owners and executives of media groups as well as online and social media platforms; whereas intimidating statements by politicians and proceedings launched against critical journalists, combined with the ownership structure of the media sector, have led to widespread self-censorship by media owners and journalists, as well as to dismissals of journalists; whereas the Turkish Government mostly charges journalists under the country\u2019s Anti-Terrorism Act (TMK) and the penal code articles related to \u2018terrorist organisations\u2019; E. whereas on 6 January 2015 the Dutch correspondent Frederike Geerdink was arrested in Diyarbakir, interrogated by the police and released the same day after interference by the Dutch minister of foreign affairs, who was visiting Turkey at that time, and on 7 January 2015 another Dutch journalist, Mehmet \u00dclger, was arrested on departure at the airport in Istanbul, interrogated at a police station and released later that day; F. whereas respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, are at the core of EU values, to which Turkey is formally committed through its application for EU membership and related negotiations, and through its membership of the Council of Europe; G. whereas the EU and its Member States have strongly criticised the arrests which took place on 14 December 2014, saying that they are \u2018incompatible with European values\u2019 and \u2018incompatible with the freedom of media\u2019; whereas President Erdo\u011fan has firmly rejected the EU\u2019s criticism; 1. Condemns the recent police raids and the detention of a number of journalists and media representatives in Turkey on 14 December 2014; stresses that these actions call into question respect for the rule of law and freedom of the media, which is a core principle of democracy; 2. Recalls that a free and pluralistic press is an essential component of any democracy, as are due process, presumption of innocence and judicial independence; stresses, therefore, the need, as regards this latest round of arrests, in all cases (i) to provide ample and transparent information on the allegations against the defendants, (ii) to grant the defendants full access to the incriminating evidence and full defence rights, and (iii) to ensure the proper handling of the cases to establish the veracity of the accusations without delay and beyond reasonable doubt; reminds the Turkish authorities that the utmost care must be taken when dealing with the media and journalists, as freedom of expression and freedom of the media remain central to the functioning of a democratic and open society; 3. Expresses its concern over backsliding in democratic reforms, and in particular the government\u2019s diminishing tolerance of public protest and critical media; notes, in this regard, that the arrests on 14 December 2014 fall into a deplorable pattern of increased pressure and restrictions on press and media outlets, including internet-based social media and fora; notes that website bans are of disproportionate scope in Turkey; deplores the number of journalists in pre-trial detention, effectively punishing them, and calls on Turkey\u2019s judicial authorities to review and address these cases as soon as possible; 4.

Notes that the Action Plan for the Prevention of Violations of the European Convention on Human Rights does not envisage revision of all relevant provisions of the Anti-Terror Law or of the Criminal Code that have been used to limit freedom of expression; stresses the need to reform these laws as a matter of priority; 7. Stresses that, as was concluded by the Council on 16 December 2014, the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA II) for the period 2014-2020 sees the introduction of enhanced coherence between financial assistance and the overall progress made in the implementation of the pre-accession strategy, including full respect for fundamental rights and freedoms; 8. Calls for increased attention to be paid to independent media within the framework of the Instrument for Pre- Accession Assistance; underlines, furthermore, in this respect, the importance of also supporting civil society organisations (CSOs), since only a transparent and well functioning civil society can build trust and confidence among the different components of a lively and democratic society; 9.

(3) Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ) lays down certain provisions for fishing in the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (\u2018GFCM\u2019) Agreement area. It is the appropriate legislative act for the implementation of those GFCM recommendations whose content is not yet covered by Union law. Indeed, Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011 can be amended to include the measures contained in the relevant GFCM recommendations. (4) At its Annual Sessions in 2011 and 2012, the GFCM adopted measures for the sustainable exploitation of red coral in its area of competence to be implemented in Union law. One of those measures concerns the use of Remotely Operated under-water Vehicles (ROVs). The GFCM decided that ROVs in zones under national jurisdiction used exclusively for observation and prospection of red coral on the basis of Recommendation GFCM/35/2011/2 are no longer to be allowed after 2014 , unless scientific advice states otherwise. However, in line with that Recommendation, the use of ROVs should be allowed in the case of Member States which have not yet authorised them for prospection and may wish to do so, provided that scientific results obtained in the context of management plans show no negative impact on the sustainable exploitation of red coral. The use of ROVs may also be authorised for a limited period not extending beyond 2015, for scientific experimental campaigns both for observation and for harvesting . According to another measure laid down in Recommendation GFCM/36/2012/1, red coral catches are to be landed only in a limited number of ports with adequate port facilities and the lists of designated ports are to be communicated to the GFCM Secretariat. Any changes affecting the lists of ports designated by Member States should be communicated to the European Commission for further transmission to the GFCM Secretariat. [Am. 1] (5) At its Annual Sessions in 2011 and 2012, the GFCM adopted Recommendations GFCM/35/2011/3, GFCM/35/ 2011/4, GFCM/35/2011/5, GFCM/36/2012/2 laying down measures for the mitigation of incidental catches of seabirds, sea turtles, monk seals and cetaceans in fishing activities in the GFCM Agreement area to be implemented in Union law. Those measures include the prohibition, from 1 January 2015, on the use of bottom-set gillnets with monofilament or twines greater than 0,5 mm, with a view to mitigating incidental catches of cetaceans. Such prohibition is already contained in Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 ( 4 ) which, however, covers only the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore it should be included in this Regulation in order to apply also to the Black Sea. C 300/54 EN Official Journal of the European Union 18.8.2016 Tuesday 13 January 2015 ( 1 ) OJ C 12, 15.1.2015, p. 116. ( 2 ) Position of the European Parliament of 13 January 2015. ( 3 ) Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on certain provisions for fishing in the GFCM (General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean) Agreement area and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 concerning management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea (OJ L 347, 30.12.2011, p. 44).

",
        "(6) At its Annual Session in 2012, the GFCM also adopted Recommendation GFCM/36/2012/3 laying down measures aiming to ensure in its area of competence a high level of protection from fishing activities for sharks and rays, and in particular the shark and ray species listed as endangered or threatened under Annex II of the Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean ( 1 ) to the Barcelona Convention ( 2 ). According to a GFCM measure, fishing activities carried out with trawl nets are to be prohibited within three nautical miles off the coast, provided that the 50 meters isobaths is not reached, or within the 50 meters isobaths where the depth of 50 meters is reached at a shorter distance from the coast. Such prohibition is already contained in Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 which, however, covers only the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore it should be included in this Regulation in order to apply also to the Black Sea. Certain other measures aimed at proper identification of sharks included in that recommendation which are not covered by Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 ( 3 ) or other Union legislation, need to be included in this Regulation in order to be fully implemented in Union law. (7) At its Annual Session in 2013 and 2014, the GFCM adopted Recommendations GFCM/37/2013/1 and GFCM/38/ 2014/1 laying down measures for fisheries exploiting small pelagic stocks in the Adriatic Sea which should be implemented in Union law. Those measures concern the management of fishing capacity for small pelagic stocks in GFCM Geographical Sub-Areas 17 and 18, on the basis of the reference fishing capacity established by means of the list of vessels that had to be communicated to the GFCM Secretariat by 30 November 2013, in accordance with paragraph 22 of Recommendation GFCM/37/2013/1. That list includes all vessels equipped with trawl nets, purse seines or other types of surrounding nets without purse line, authorised by the Member States concerned to fish for small pelagic stocks and registered in harbours located in Geographical Sub-Areas 17 and 18, or operating in Geographical Sub-Area 17 and/or in Geographical Sub-Area 18 although registered in harbours located in other Geographical Sub-Areas as at 31 October 2013. Any changes which may affect the above-mentioned list should be communicated to the European Commission as soon as they occur, for further transmission to the GFCM Secretariat. The GFCM measure also includes a prohibition on retention on board or land which should be implemented in Union law in line with Article 15(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 4 ). (8) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of certain provisions of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those provisions concern: the format and transmission of the request for a derogation from a minimum depth for harvesting of red coral or from the minimum basal diameter of colonies of red coral; the format and transmission of the results of scientific evaluations of the zones subject to a derogation from a minimum depth for harvesting of red coral; the format and transmission of data on harvesting of red coral; information related to incidental catches of sea birds, sea turtles, monk seals, cetaceans and sharks and rays, changes of lists of ports designated for landing catches of red coral, impacts of certain fishing vessels on cetacean populations and changes taking place to maps and lists of geographical locations which identify the location of caves of monk seals. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 5 ). 18.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 300/55 Tuesday 13 January 2015 ( 1 ) Council Decision 77/585/EEC of 25 July 1977 concluding the Convention for the protection of the Mediterranean Sea against pollution and the Protocol for the prevention of the pollution of the Mediterranean Sea by dumping from ships and aircraft (OJ L 240, 19.9.1977, p. 1).

",
        "(9) In order to ensure that the Union continues to fulfil its obligations under the GFCM Agreement, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission concerning authorisations to derogate from the prohibition on harvesting red coral at depths less than 50 m and on departing from the minimum basal diameter of red coral colonies. Member States which have already transposed Recommendation GFCM/35/2011/2 and developed appropriate national management frameworks, and which have already informed the Commission to that effect, should not be subject to the derogation procedure. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. [Am. 2] (10) Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011 Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011 is amended as follows: (1) the following Article 15a is inserted: \u2018Article 15a Use of trawl nets and gillnets fisheries in the Black Sea 1.
