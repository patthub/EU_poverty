        "III (Preparatory acts) COUNCIL POSITION (EU) No 8/2013 OF THE COUNCIL AT FIRST READING with a view to the adoption of a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council providing macro-financial assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic Adopted by the Council on 23 September 2013 (2013/C 309 E/01) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 209 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure ( 1 ), Whereas: (1) Cooperation between the Union and the Kyrgyz Republic is based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Kyrgyz Republic, of the other part ( 2 ) (PCA) that entered into force in 1999. The Union grants Generalised System of Preferences treatment to the Kyrgyz Republic. (2) The Kyrgyz economy was affected in 2009 by the inter\u00ad national financial crisis and in June 2010 by ethnic violence. These events disrupted economic activities, creating substantial public expenditure needs for recon\u00ad struction and social assistance, and resulted in important external and budgetary financial gaps. (3) At a High Level Donors Meeting held in Bishkek on 27 July 2010, the international community pledged USD 1,1 billion in emergency support to assist in the recovery of the Kyrgyz Republic. At that meeting, the Union announced that it would provide up to EUR 117,9 million in financial assistance. (4) The Council, meeting in its foreign affairs configuration, in its conclusions on the Kyrgyz Republic of 26 July 2010, welcomed the efforts of the new Kyrgyz government to establish a democratic institutional framework and invited the Commission to continue providing assistance, including in the form of new assistance programmes, to the authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic in the implementation of their reform programme and to contribute to the sustainable economic and social development of the country. (5) Union political and economic support to the Kyrgyz Republic's incipient parliamentary democracy would provide a political signal of the Union's strong support to democratic reforms in Central Asia, consistent with the Union's policy towards the region, as set out in the Union Strategy for Central Asia (2007-2013) and in the Council conclusions on Central Asia of 25 June 2012. (6) In line with the Joint Declaration by the European Parliament and the Council adopted together with the decision providing further macro-financial assistance to Georgia ( 3 ), Union macro-financial assistance should be an exceptional financial instrument of untied and undes\u00ad ignated balance-of-payments support, which aims at restoring a beneficiary's sustainable external finance situation and should underpin the implementation of a policy programme containing strong adjustment and structural reform measures designed to improve the balance of payment position, in particular over the programme period, and reinforce the implementation of relevant agreements and programmes with the Union.

        "(7) The economic adjustment and reform process of the Kyrgyz Republic is supported by financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In June 2011, the Kyrgyz authorities and the IMF agreed on a non-precautionary three-year IMF Extended Credit Facility ( \" IMF programme \" ) of SDR 66,6 million (Special Drawing Rights) in support of the country. The IMF approved the fourth review of that programme in June 2013. The objectives of the IMF programme are consistent with the purpose of the Union macro- financial assistance, namely to alleviate short-term balance of payment difficulties, and the implementation of strong adjustment measures consistent with the aim of Union macro-financial assistance. (8) The Union provides sectoral budget support to the Kyrgyz Republic under the Development Cooperation Instrument of a total of EUR 33 million over the period 2011-2013 to support reforms in social protection, education and public financial management. (9) In 2010, in view of the worsening economic situation and outlook, the Kyrgyz Republic requested Union macro-financial assistance. (10) Given the Kyrgyz Republic's strategic importance for the Union, as well as the determining role it plays in regional stability, the Kyrgyz Republic should, exceptionally, be considered to be eligible to receive Union macro- financial assistance. (11) Given that there is still a significant residual external financing gap in the balance of payments of the Kyrgyz Republic over and above the resources provided by IMF and other multilateral institutions, and despite the implementation of strong economic stabilisation and reform programmes by the Kyrgyz Republic, the Union macro-financial assistance to be provided to the Kyrgyz Republic ( \" the Union's macro-financial assistance \" ) is, under the current exceptional circumstances, considered to be an appropriate response to the Kyrgyz Republic's request to support economic stabilisation in conjunction with the IMF programme. (12) The Union's macro-financial assistance should aim to support the restoration of a sustainable external financing situation for the Kyrgyz Republic thereby supporting its economic and social development. (13) The determination of the amount of the Union's macro- financial assistance is based on a complete quantitative assessment of the Kyrgyz Republic's residual external financing needs, and takes into account its capacity to finance itself with its own resources, in particular the international reserves at its disposal. The Union's macro-financial assistance should complement the programmes and resources provided by the IMF and the World Bank. The determination of the amount of the assistance also takes into account expected financial contributions from multilateral donors and the need to ensure fair burden sharing between the Union and other donors, as well as the pre-existing deployment of the Union's other external financing instruments in the Kyrgyz Republic and the added value of the overall Union involvement. (14) Taking into consideration the Kyrgyz Republic's residual external financing needs, the level of its economic devel\u00ad opment, as measured by per capita income and poverty ratios, its capacity to finance itself with its own resources, in particular the international reserves at its disposal, and the assessment of its ability to repay drawing on debt sustainability analysis, a part of the assistance should be provided in the form of grants. (15) The Commission should ensure that the Union's macro- financial assistance is legally and substantially in line with the key principles, objectives and measures taken within the different areas of external action and other relevant Union policies. (16) The Union's macro-financial assistance should support the Union's external policy towards the Kyrgyz Republic. Commission services and the European External Action Service should work closely together throughout the macro-financial assistance operation in order to coordinate, and to ensure the consistency of, Union external policy. (17) The Union's macro-financial assistance should support the Kyrgyz Republic's commitment to values shared with the Union, including democracy, the rule of law, good governance, respect for human rights, sustainable development and poverty reduction, as well as its commitment to the principles of open, rule-based and fair trade. (18) A precondition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance should be that the Kyrgyz Republic respects effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi- party parliamentary system and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. In addition, the specific objectives of the Union's macro-financial assistance should strengthen the efficiency, transparency and accountability of public finance management systems in the Kyrgyz Republic. Both fulfilment of the precon\u00ad dition, and the achievement of those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission. (19) In order to ensure that the Union's financial interests linked to the Union's macro-financial assistance are protected efficiently, the Kyrgyz Republic should take appropriate measures relating to the prevention of, and fight against, fraud, corruption and any other irregu\u00ad larities linked to the assistance. In addition, provision should be made for the Commission to carry out checks and for the Court of Auditors to carry out audits. EN C 309 E/2 Official Journal of the European Union 24.10.2013 ",
        "(20) Release of the Union's macro-financial assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the European Parliament and the Council. (21) The amounts of macro-financial assistance provided in the form of grants and the amounts of the provision required for macro-financial assistance in the form of loans should be consistent with the budgetary appropri\u00ad ations provided for in the multi-annual financial framework. (22) The Union's macro-financial assistance should be managed by the Commission. In order to ensure that the European Parliament and the Council are able to follow the implementation of this Decision, the Commission should regularly inform them of devel\u00ad opments relating to the assistance and provide them with relevant documents. (23) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implemen\u00ad tation of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Coun\u00ad cil ( 1 ). (24) The Union's macro financial assistance should be subject to economic policy conditions, to be laid down in a Memorandum of Understanding. In order to ensure uniform conditions of implementation and for reasons of efficiency, the Commission should be empowered to negotiate such conditions with the Kyrgyz authorities under the supervision of the committee of representatives of the Member States in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. Under that Regulation, the advisory procedure should, as a general rule, apply in all cases other than as provided for in that Regulation. Considering the potentially important impact of assistance of more than EUR 90 million, it is appropriate that the examination procedure be used for operations above that threshold. Considering the amount of the Union's macro-financial assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic, the advisory procedure should apply to the adoption of the Memorandum of Understanding, and to any reduction, suspension or cancellation of the assistance. (25) According to the IMF, the Kyrgyz Republic falls under the category of emerging and developing economies; according to the World Bank, the Kyrgyz Republic is part of the group of low-income economies and Inter\u00ad national Development Association (IDA) countries; according to the UN-OHRLLS ( 2 ), the Kyrgyz Republic falls under the category of landlocked-developing country; according to the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, it is in the list of other low income countries. Therefore, the Kyrgyz Republic should be considered as a developing country in the sense of Article 208 TFEU, which justifies the choice of Article 209 TFEU as a legal basis for this Decision, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 1. The Union shall make macro-financial assistance available to the Kyrgyz Republic ( \" the Union's macro-financial assist\u00ad ance \" ) of a maximum amount of EUR 30 million, with a view to supporting the Kyrgyz Republic's economic stabilisation and covering its balance of payments needs as identified in the current IMF programme. Of that maximum amount, up to EUR 15 million shall be provided in the form of loans and up to EUR 15 million in the form of grants. The release of the Union's macro financial assistance is subject to the approval of the Union budget for the relevant year by the European Parliament and the Council. 2. In order to finance the loan component of the Union's macro-financial assistance, the Commission shall be empowered on behalf of the Union to borrow the necessary funds on the capital markets or from financial institutions and to on-lend them to the Kyrgyz Republic. The loans shall have a maximum maturity of 15 years. 3. The release of the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be managed by the Commission in a manner consistent with the agreements or understandings reached between the IMF and the Kyrgyz Republic, and with the key principles and objectives of economic reforms set out in the PCA and in the Union Strategy for Central Asia (2007-2013). The Commission shall regularly inform the European Parliament and the Council of developments regarding the Union's macro-financial assistance, including disbursements thereof, and shall provide those insti\u00ad tutions with the relevant documents in due time. 4. The Union's macro-financial assistance shall be made available for a period of two years from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding referred to in Article 3(1). 5. Where the financing needs of the Kyrgyz Republic decrease fundamentally during the period of the disbursement of the Union's macro-financial assistance compared to the initial projections, the Commission, acting in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 7(2), shall reduce the amount of the assistance or suspend or cancel it.

        "STATEMENT OF THE COUNCIL\u2019S REASONS I. INTRODUCTION 1. On 21 December 2011, the Commission transmitted to the Council its proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council providing macro-financial assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic (doc. 5075/12). 2. The European Parliament adopted its position at first reading at its plenary session on 11 December 2012 (doc. 17476/12). The European Parliament adopted one amendment. 3. On 23 September 2013 the Council adopted its position at first reading in accordance with Article 294(5). 4. The Council position at first reading is the result of informal contacts between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council as foreseen by the Joint declaration on practical arrangements for the co-decision procedure ( 1 ). II. OBJECTIVE 5. The Kyrgyz economy has been affected in 2009 by the international financial crisis and by ethnic violence in June 2010, which disrupted economic activities, creating substantial public expenditure needs for reconstruction and social assistance, and resulted in important external and budgetary financial gaps. 6. In response to those events and their economic implications, the international community organised a High Level Donors Meeting for the Kyrgyz Republic on 27 July 2010 in Bishkek. At this conference, donors committed to provide USD 1.1 billion in emergency support by the end of 2011. The EU was among the major donors, pledging EUR 117.9 million for support in a number of critical areas. 7. The IMF extended help to the Kyrgyz Republic in 2010 with a three-month Rapid Credit Facility. In June 2011, the IMF agreed with the Kyrgyz Republic authorities on a follow-up arrangement in the amount of USD 106 million in support of a comprehensive economic adjustment and reform programme for the period mid-2011 to mid-2014. In 2010, the President and the Minister of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic formally requested the EU macro-financial assistance (MFA) to complement the support from the IMF. 8. Given that there is still a significant residual external financing gap in the balance of payments of the Kyrgyz Republic over and above the resources provided by IMF and other multilateral institu\u00ad tions, and despite the implementation of strong economic stabilisation and reform programmes by the Kyrgyz Republic, the Union macro-financial assistance to be provided to the Kyrgyz Republic is under the current exceptional circumstances considered an appropriate response to the Kyrgyz Republic's request to support economic stabilisation in conjunction with the IMF programme. III. ANALYSIS OF THE COUNCIL'S POSITION AT FIRST READING General 9. On 9 July 2013, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Decision 778/2013/EU ( 2 ) providing further macro-financial assistance to Georgia. 10. In a joint Declaration adopted together with the above decision, the European Parliament and the Council: \u2014 agreed that the adoption of the decision on providing further macro-financial assistance to Georgia should be seen in the wider context of the need for a framework that should secure sound and effective decisions on providing macro-financial assistance to third countries; EN 24.10.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 309 E/7 ( 1 ) OJ C 145, 30.6.2007, p. 5. ( 2 ) OJ L 218, 14.8.2013, p. 15. ",
        "\u2014 agreed that the adoption of decisions on macro-financial assistance operations should be based on the considerations and the principles set out in the joint Declaration for the granting of Union macro-financial assistance to eligible third countries and territories, without prejudice to the right of legislative initiative and the legal form that a future instrument formalising these considerations and principles might take; \u2014 committed to fully reflect these considerations and principles in the future individual decisions on granting the Union's macro-financial assistance. 11. In that context, amendments have been introduced in the proposal for a decision providing macro- financial assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic to fully reflect the considerations and principles set out in the joint Declaration. Key issues Geographic scope 12. The Kyrgyz Republic is not a candidate or potential candidate country nor a country or territory covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy. Recital (10) underlines however that given its strategic importance for the Union, as well as the determining role it plays in regional stability, the Kyrgyz Republic should exceptionally be considered eligible to receive Union macro-financial assistance. Amount and form of the assistance 13. Recital (13), recital (14) and article 1 of the Council position at first reading deal with the determination of the amount of the assistance to be provided and its form (loans and grants). While there are no changes to the amounts proposed by the Commission (up to EUR 15 million in the form of loans and up to EUR 15 million in the form of grants), the Council Position specifies the criteria for the determination of the amount of the assistance and its form in loans and grants. Article 1 also introduces a clause whereby the Commission, acting in accordance with the advisory procedure, shall reduce the amount of the assistance or suspend or cancel it, where the financing needs of the Kyrgyz Republic decrease fundamentally during the period of disbursement of the Union's macro-financial assistance compared to the initial projections. Conditionality 14. Recital (18) and article 2 specify the pre-condition for the assistance, namely that the Kyrgyz Republic respects effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system and the rule of law and guarantees respect for human rights. Article 2 introduces the requirement for the Commission to monitor the fulfillment of this pre-condition throughout the life cycle of the assistance. 15. Article 3 deals with the conditions to which the assistance should be subject, which are to be laid out in a Memorandum of Understanding. 16. Article 4 introduces the obligation for the Commission to temporarily suspend or cancel the disbursement of the assistance when the relevant conditions are not met. Committee 17. For the adoption of the Memorandum of Understanding referred to in Article 3 and for the decision to reduce, suspend or cancel the assistance referred to in Article 1, the Commission is to be assisted by a Committee (recital (23) and (24), article 7). The Commission is to act in accordance with the advisory procedure. The choice of procedure is explained in recital (24). Reporting 18. Article 8 specifies the reporting requirements for the Commission to European Parliament and to the Council. EN C 309 E/8 Official Journal of the European Union 24.10.2013 ",
        "IV. CONCLUSION 19. The Council position at first reading reflects the compromise reached in negotiations between the Council and the European Parliament, facilitated by the Commission. This compromise was endorsed through the adoption of a political agreement by Coreper on 18 July 2013 and by the Council on 27 July 2013. The Chair of the Committee on International Trade sent a letter to the Chair of Coreper indicating that, should the Council transmit its position as attached to the letter of the Committee, he would recommend to the plenary that Parliament, in its second reading, accept the Council position without any amendments, subject to verification by the lawyer linguists of both institutions (12285/13).
