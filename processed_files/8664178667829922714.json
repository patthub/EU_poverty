        "A. whereas the Council conclusions of 11 May 2020 on Eastern Partnership policy beyond 2020 highlight that strengthening resilience as an overriding policy framework will be one of the key goals for the Eastern Partnership over the coming years, including in the areas of the environment, health (notably in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic) and human security; B. whereas the joint communication of 18 March 2020 on Eastern Partnership policy beyond 2020 puts special emphasis on reinforcing resilience and envisages the scaling up of action in areas that are critical for people\u2019s health and wellbeing; C. whereas improving quality of life is a longstanding explicit and implicit policy objective of national governments, while its adequate definition and measurement is challenging and often elusive; D. whereas quality of life is a broad concept that covers more than just economic growth andmaterial living conditions;; whereas it encompasses a range of indicators reflecting its multidimensionality, including life satisfaction, employment, health status, social relationships, free time, education and skills, work-life balance, civic engagement and governance, environmental quality, human security and governance; E. whereas the Eastern Partnership (EaP) Association Agreements and the EU-Armenia Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA) each contain a chapter dedicated to health issues, which provides for cooperation covering a wide range of areas with the aim of improving public health standards and the protection of human health, as well as a chapter dedicated to the environment, with the objective of achieving a high degree of regulatory convergence; F. whereas significant disparities exist within and between EU Member States and EaP countries, as reflected by socioeconomic indicators and the Human Development Index; whereas life expectancy as a key indicator is lower by up to seven years in the EaP countries than the EU average; G. whereas the combination of a large informal sector, high unemployment, low savings rates and a heavy reliance on remittances in the EaP region points to the vulnerability of large segments of society in EaP countries which are likely to experience increased levels of poverty and inequalities because of the COVID-19 crisis; H. whereas socioeconomic shocks resulting from the pandemic negatively affect people\u2019s incomes and physical and mental wellbeing, and the social integrity of communities as a whole; I. whereas affordable, effective, accessible, sustainable and resilient public health systems are a key determinant for improving citizens\u2019 quality of life and well-being; J. whereas healthcare expenditure, both in absolute terms and as a share of GDP, is significantly lower in EaP countries than in the EU; K. whereas civil society organisations have been and will continue to be essential in mitigating the effects of the pandemic in the long term and will require support to ensure the continuity of these key support activities to mitigate the economic, social, and health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis; L. whereas the COVID-19 pandemic has put a critical spotlight on the need to boost preparedness and response capacities across the wider European region against emergencies and notably serious cross-border threats to health; M. whereas the COVID crisis has stressed the importance of supporting and fastening the green, care and digital transition so that no one is left behind; N. whereas in response to the COVID-19 crisis, the EU has mobilised an emergency support package of EUR 80 million for immediate needs and up to EUR 1 billion to support health systems and the short- and medium-term social and economic recovery in the Eastern Partnership region; EN Official Journal of the European Union 8.9.2021 C 361/27 ",
        "O. whereas programmes such as the European Union Solidarity for Health Initiative in the Eastern Partnership countries provide short- and medium-term assistance to address the challenges of the COVID-19 crisis and could act as a stepping stone towards further cooperation; P. whereas the COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the importance of joint EU action; whereas Parliament has called, inter alia, for the creation of a European health response mechanism to better prepare for and respond in a common and coordinated way to any type of health or sanitary crisis; Q. whereas the EU has committed itself to a united, coordinated approach in order to act effectively and with solidarity when addressing the COVID-19 crisis, notably with regard to the procurement and roll-out of vaccines, while Member States retain full ownership of their public health policies and responsibility for organising and delivering health services and medical care; R. whereas older women are at greater risk of poverty due, among other factors, to the wage and pension gap, gender segregation in the job market, the gender care gap, and the gender gaps regarding working time; S. whereas the Commission and the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe recognised in their joint statement of 4 November 2020 ( 5 ) that further efforts are needed to assist the Eastern Partnership countries to improve regional and sub-regional health security, address health inequalities, bolster the resilience of health systems and strengthen the cooperation between WHO country offices and EU Delegations while enhancing the partnership between the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and WHO Europe in order to ensure coherent strategic approaches across the entire region; T. whereas predictable, adequate and sustainable pension systems constitute an important element in providing good quality of life after leaving the workplace, as well as ensuring income security, preventing poverty and reducing inequality in old age; U. whereas managing pension systems remains a Member State competence within the EU; whereas the facilitation of mutual learning and the exchange of best practices between the EU and its partner countries has significant potential to improve responses to demographic challenges and to enhance the adequacy and sustainability of pension systems; V. whereas in the context of accelerating population ageing, a significant informal sector and a large number of seasonal workers, as well as the unfolding economic crisis, it is becoming more challenging to achieve pension policy objectives in the Eastern Partnership region; W. whereas the European Pillar of Social Rights contains a number of provisions dedicated to pension rights, including the right of workers and the self-employed to a pension commensurate with contributions and ensuring an adequate income; the right to equal opportunities to acquire pension rights for both women and men; and the right to resources that ensure dignity in old age; X. whereas investment in the care economy is of paramount importance to ensure decent life for all and protect all people living in the EU and the Eastern Partnership; whereas older persons have been and still are heavily hit by complications and fatalities linked to different diseases, including COVID-19; Quality of life 1. Welcomes the EU\u2019s overall emphasis on resilience in the current focus of its Eastern Partnership strategy and notes that stepping up cooperation in the areas of the environment, climate change social policies, gender equality, labour rights and social protection, in particular decent employment, public health and education would contribute to tangible long- term benefits to quality of life in the EU and its Eastern neighbourhood; ( 5 ) https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/international_cooperation/docs/2020_who_euro_cooperation_en.pdf EN Official Journal of the European Union C 361/28 8.9.2021 ",
        "2. Notes that most objectives and existing programmes under the Eastern Partnership contribute to improving quality of life indirectly, but that the visibility of their direct value added is mostly very limited for citizens, calls therefore for a better coordination of economic and social policies as well as their coherence with the ecological transformation of the economy in line with the commitments taken under the Paris Protocol to mitigate; 3. Stresses that decent living and access to social protection constitutes a serious joint challenge for EU Member States and EaP countries and should therefore be key topics of joint efforts and cooperation; 4.

Urges EU Member States and EaP countries to respect the right to health by maintaining universal and equal access to health and care services, without discrimination on the basis of age, race, ethnicity, linguistic or social group or sexual orientation, gender expression, gender identity or sex characteristics, or any other grounds; 12. Insists that healthcare access for minorities should be strengthened during the current pandemic and stresses that they should not be targeted by restrictive pandemic measures without any specific indication for the necessity of such special measures in order to avoid discrimination; 13. Notes that therapy and care options for chronic diseases, such as cancer, should not be negatively affected by and be secured despite the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on healthcare systems and public finances; EN Official Journal of the European Union 8.9.2021 C 361/29 ",
        "14. Notes that quality of life in Eastern Partnership countries is not only lower than in the EU countries, but many people, especially those living in rural areas, face difficulties in reaching basic social standards due to the poor infrastructure and sanitation, lack or distant medical and educational services; 15. Encourages regular and structured information and staff exchanges to improve the resilience of health systems and to reduce pressure on critical health infrastructure and staff, as well as to facilitate mutual learning on best practices, institutional preparedness and management; 16. Calls on the EU to consider bilateral and regional technical assistance programmes for healthcare reform in the EaP region with a view to improving the legislative framework and financial management of national healthcare systems, achieving better access to public health services and raising the overall quality of care, as well as to undertake targeted or sectoral health programmes brining tangible long-term benefits to citizens and their quality of life; 17.

Emphasises that there is no effective COVID-19 pandemic management without fast and efficient transmission of adequate amount of vaccines to the EaP countries; without ensuring it, the virus will be spreading across EU as large group of people is working in many EU countries; 22. Recalls the need for sharing comparable national data related to health emergencies, infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics, as well as a viable system of mutual recognition of vaccinations; 23. Recognises the need to build on the example of the 1st Eastern Partnership Ministerial Conference on Tuberculosis and Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis in 2015, which brought together ministers and high-level officials from national governments and international and non-governmental organisations; 24. Recalls the untapped potential of the Eastern Partnership framework for addressing cross-border aspects of healthcare cooperation, exchange programmes and emergency relief with the participation of medical staff from EU and EaP countries; EN Official Journal of the European Union C 361/30 8.9.2021 ",
        "25.
