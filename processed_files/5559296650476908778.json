        "10.5.2019 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 162/91 Wednesday 14 March 2018 A. whereas the employment rate in the EU is increasing and reached 72,3 % in the second quarter of 2017, corresponding to 235,4 million people in work, and constituting progress towards reaching the 75 % employment rate target specified in the Europe 2020 strategy; whereas there continue to be very substantial differences between employment rates in many Member States, ranging from well below the EU average of 65 % in Greece, Croatia, Italy and Spain, to higher than 75 % in the Nether - lands, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Germany and Sweden, with some way still to go to recover from the crisis and, in parti - cular, to attain the Europe 2020 national targets; whereas employment growth has been stronger among older workers, high- skilled employees and men, and weaker in young people, low-skilled workers and women; whereas employment measured in terms of hours worked per employee remains 3 % below the pre-crisis level in the EU and 4 % below the pre-crisis level in the euro area, owing to more part-time work and fewer hours worked by full-time employees; whereas in the EU at present, 18,9 million people remain jobless, investment is still too low, wage growth is subdued and in-work poverty is still increasing; recalls that Article 3 of the TEU stipulates that the Union shall aim at full employment; B. whereas 18,9 million people in the EU are still jobless, despite the fact that the EU and euro area unemployment rates are at their lowest levels in nine years, standing at 7,5 % and 8,9 % respectively; whereas, moreover, this recovery remains very une - ven among Member States, with unemployment rates ranging from around 4 % in Germany to almost 20 % in Spain and 23,6 % in Greece; whereas hidden unemployment \u2013 unemployed people willing to work but not actively searching for employ - ment \u2013 was 20 % in 2016, while the share of long-term unemployment in the EU remains alarmingly high at more than 46,4 % (the corresponding figure for the euro area is 49,7 %); whereas in some Member States, unemployment remains high because of a lack of growth and structural weakness; whereas inadequate labour market reforms is one of the reasons for high unemployment; whereas support for the long-term unemployed is essential, as otherwise their situation will begin to affect their self-confidence, well-being and future development, putting them at risk of poverty and social exclusion and undermi - ning both the sustainability of social security systems and the European social dimension; C. whereas part-time work has increased by 11 % since 2008 and full-time employment has dropped by 2 % over the same period, while involuntary part-time work fell from 29,3 % in 2013 to 27,7 % in 2016, but still represents one quarter of this kind of contract; D. whereas the labour market segmentation between permanent and atypical jobs remains worrying, with temporary contracts accounting for between 10 % and 20 % of employment in some Member States, with particularly low transition rates towards permanent contracts, and temporary jobs representing dead ends rather than stepping stones towards permanent jobs; whe - reas this phenomenon is preventing large numbers of workers from benefiting from secure, relatively well-paid employment and good prospects, and is creating a wage gap between permanent and temporary workers; E. whereas, although a slight improvement in the youth unemployment rate can be observed, it still remains disturbingly high at 16,6 % (18,7 % in the euro area); whereas, according to the draft Joint Employment Report, young people are more often employed in non-standard and atypical forms of employment, including temporary jobs, involuntary part-time work and lower wage jobs; whereas in 2016 there were still 6.3 million young people aged 15-24 not in employment, education or trai - ning (NEETs); whereas the Member States can tackle youth unemployment by developing and implementing labour market regulatory frameworks, education and training systems and active labour market policies, based on the prohibition of discrimi - nation as regards age in relation to Article 19 TFEU and Council Directive 2000/78/EC on employment equality; F. whereas, although the differences in unemployment rates among the Member States are smaller, they still remain above the pre-crisis level; whereas long-term unemployment remains at above 50 % of total unemployment in some Member States and 46,6 % in the EU and 49,7 % in the euro area on average; whereas the unemployment rate only tracks people who do not have a job and who have been actively looked for work in the previous four weeks, while the long-term unemployment rate only measures the share of people in the economically active population aged 15 to 74 who has been unemployed for 12 months or more; G. whereas the gender employment gap still persists, and now stands at 11,6 % in the EU, with the gender-specific employment rates at 76,9 % for men and 65,3 % for women, while there are even wider gaps among non-EU born and Roma women; whe - reas the gender gap is even wider in part-time employment, where it amounted to a difference of 23 percentage points (pps) in 2016 and even exceeded 30 pps in four Member States, and with female involuntary part-time employment registering 23,5 %; whereas the employment rate of women with at least one child under the age of six is 9 pps less than the correspon - ding rate of women without children, while 19 % of the EU\u2019s potential female workforce was inactive in 2016 because they were looking after children or incapacitated adults; whereas, owing to lower full-time equivalent employment rates, women endured a significant pay gap of 16,3 % in 2015 in the EU on average, ranging from 26,9 % in Estonia to 5,5 % in Italy and Luxemburg; ",
        "C 162/92 EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.5.2019 Wednesday 14 March 2018 H. whereas some Member States are faced with structural challenges in the labour market, such as low participation and skills and qualification mismatches; whereas there is a growing need for concrete measures to either integrate or re-integrate the inactive workforce in order to meet labour market demands; I. whereas societies in the European Union are ageing (nearly 20 % of the European population is over 65 and estimates suggest that this will reach 25 % by 2050), and the old-age dependency ratio is increasing, which presents additional challenges for the Member States and might require them to make adjustments to keep ensuring well-funded and robust social security, health - care and long-term care systems, and to satisfy the need for formal and informal care provision; whereas informal carers consti - tute a vital asset to society; whereas life expectancy at birth in the EU-28 declined slightly in 2015, having been estimated at 80,6 in total (0,3 years lower than 2014), 83,3 for women (0,3 years lower than in 2014), and 77,9 for men (0,2 years lower than 2014); whereas this was the first fall in EU-28 life expectancy since 2002, when life expectancy data became available for all Member States, and can be observed in the majority of the Member States; whereas according to Eurostat, it is not yet pos - sible to say whether the reduction in life expectancy between 2014 and 2015 is only temporary or will continue in the years to come; J. whereas demographic challenges include factors such as depopulation and population dispersion, hampering the growth of the regions affected and threatening the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the EU; K. whereas the early school leaving rate stands at around 20 % in several Member States, including Malta, Spain and Romania, and is still above the EU target rate of 10 % in Portugal, Bulgaria, Italy, Hungary, the United Kingdom and Greece; whereas early school leaving represents a complex challenge at an individual, national and European level; whereas a disadvantaged socio- economic background, migrant origins and special needs are the most significant factors associated with poor educational achievement and early school leaving, bearing in mind that the average proportion of low achievers in science within the bot - tom socio-economic quartile of the 2015 PISA student population in the EU is around 34 %, 26 pps more than in the top socio-economic quartile; L. whereas the social economy sector comprises 2 million businesses (roughly 10 % of the EU total) and employs more than 14 million people (around 6,5 % of EU workers); whereas this sector has an important role to play in meeting the innumerable challenges facing present-day societies, not least the ageing of their populations; M. whereas 80 million Europeans have disabilities; whereas the implementation of accessibility measures for them continues to lag behind; N. whereas although a certain amount of progress in reducing poverty and social exclusion can be observed, there are still disad - vantaged groups in society, and an unacceptable 119 million Europeans at risk of poverty or social exclusion, of whom more than 25 million are children (more than 1 in 4 of all children in the EU), while regional disparities also persist within the Member States and the Union as a whole, leaving the EU far off track in achieving the EU2020 target; whereas income inequa - lity continues to grow in two thirds of all EU countries; whereas in the EU as a whole, the richest 20 % of households received an income share that was 5,1 times greater than the poorest 20 %, with this differential as high as 6,5 or above in some Eastern and Southern European countries \u2013 almost twice as much as some of the best-performing central European and Nordic coun - tries; whereas high levels of inequality remain an obstacle to equal opportunities in access to education, training and social pro - tection, and are therefore detrimental to social justice, social cohesion and sustainable economic development; O. whereas, according to the Commission publication \u2018Employment and Social Developments in Europe 2017\u2019, in 2015 there were 118,8 million people at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE), 1,7 million more than the 2008 figure and far from the Europe 2020 Strategy target of reducing AROPE by 20 million, with wide disparities between Member States, ranging from 5 % or less in the Czech Republic and Germany to around 20 % in Greece and Spain; whereas the AROPE rate for children (0- 17) was 26,4 % in 2016, which was higher than the equivalent rates for adults (16-64, 24,2 %) and, by almost 10 pps, the rate for the elderly (65+, 18,3 %); whereas the number of children experiencing poverty remains alarmingly high in Europe, at more than 25 million at present, and the impact of poverty on children can last a lifetime and perpetuates the passing on of disadvantage from generation to generation; whereas social policies are important for achieving cohesion and bringing the EU closer to its citizens; ",
        "10.5.2019 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 162/93 Wednesday 14 March 2018 P. whereas increasing in-work poverty persists in Europe as a whole, with the highest levels recorded in Spain (13,1 %), Greece (14 %) and Romania (18,6 %), which shows that employment alone is not always sufficient to lift people out of poverty and reflects different labour market patterns, including part-time and/or temporary jobs, wage levels and work intensity in households and poor working conditions; whereas wage growth remains subdued in the EU, having increased by less than 1 % in the last two years, and the dispersion of compensation of employees is rather wide in the EU, ranging from EUR 4,6 per hour worked in Bulgaria to EUR 43,3 per hour worked in Luxembourg; whereas real wage growth lagged behind average producti - vity growth in 18 of the 28 Member States and is even lagging behind the drop in unemployment; whereas wage-setting is a matter of national competence; Q. whereas education is a crucial determinant of young people\u2019s integration into the labour market and is primarily the responsi - bility of the Member States, albeit supported by the Commission; whereas high-quality education and training must be acces - sible to all, taking into account the fact that the employment rate of young people (those aged 20-34) with higher education is 82,8 % in the EU, more than 10 pps higher than those with upper secondary education; whereas vocational training is starting to become more credible, both in the eyes of young Europeans and in the eyes of the businesses which are recognising their abi - lities; whereas training acquired in an informal context also provides Europeans with essential tools for the labour market; R. whereas, although the digital transformation requires workers to at least have basic digital skills, it is estimated that 44 % of the EU population lacks them ( 1 ); S. whereas, in accordance with Article 168 TFEU, a high level of human health protection should be ensured in the definition and implementation of the relevant Union policies and activities; whereas this would contribute to social inclusion, social justice and equality; whereas technological and scientific advances, which the 2018 Annual Growth Survey (AGS) welcomes, are making it possible to find better, more efficacious, and more affordable treatments and medicines; whereas this progress is hel - ping to ensure that people suffering from particular chronic conditions will be fit to enter the labour market or continue wor - king for much longer; whereas this aim is currently being challenged by the high cost of some medicines; T. whereas fiscal policy in the Member States plays a role in the stabilisation of the macroeconomic environment, while also pur - suing other objectives, such as fiscal sustainability or redistribution; U. whereas the provision and management of social security systems are a Member State competence which the Union coordi - nates but does not harmonise; V. whereas gross disposable household income (GDHI) per capita has still not recovered from pre-crisis levels in various Member States, with a number of these figures between 20 and 30 pps lower than in 2008; W. whereas the capacity of the EU\u2019s economy to drive long-term growth is less than that of our major competitors; whereas the Commission has estimated that potential growth is around 1,4 % in the EU, compared with 2 % in the US; X. whereas undeclared work deprives workers of their rights and encourages social dumping, entailing serious budgetary implica - tions, and adversely affects employment, productivity, the quality of work and skills development, and the efficiency and effec - tiveness of the pension entitlements system; whereas continued efforts must be brought to bear in order to turn undeclared work into declared work; ( 1 ) The Digital Economy and Society Index, European Commission.

        "C 162/94 EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.5.2019 Wednesday 14 March 2018 Y. whereas the outermost regions have to contend with immense difficulties relating to their specific characteristics that limit their potential for growth; whereas in these regions unemployment rates range from between 11,2 % and 27,1 %, and long- term unemployment rates from between 54,5 % and 80,9 %; whereas in these regions youth unemployment is above 40 %; Z. whereas, according to Eurofound research, social partners\u2019 involvement in the elaboration of national reform programmes is gradually improving in most Member States, although significant differences in outcomes remain when it comes to the quality and effectiveness of national social partners\u2019 overall engagement in the European Semester process; AA. whereas Eurofound\u2019s forthcoming study on the involvement of the social partners in the European Semester is set to report a process of consolidation and growing awareness, following Employment Guideline No 7 on enhancing the functioning of labour markets; whereas, however, the social partners highlight the need to ensure proper engagement by facilitating meaning - ful and timely consultation, an exchange of contributions and feedback, and by giving visibility to their views; 1. Welcomes the Annual Growth Survey 2018, together with the integrated European Pillar of Social Rights, as an important part of overall policies for quality employment, sustainable growth and investment, aiming to increase productivity and wages, create jobs, reduce inequalities and poverty and improve social protection and the access to and quality of public services; acknowledges that the AGS is based on a strategy of investment, structural reforms and responsible public finances, which should be coupled with policies and measures for fulfilling the principles and objectives of the European Pillar of Social Rights; stresses that the Commission should, within the framework of the European Semester, improve the process of policy coordination in order to better monitor, prevent and correct negative trends that could increase inequalities and weaken social progress, as a means to link economic coordination with employment and social performance; calls on the Member States to follow the priorities identified in the survey and the accompanying Joint Employment Report, with a view to their national policies and strategies to promote growth, sustainable economic development, quality employment, social cohesion, and social protection and inclusion; notes the importance of protecting workers\u2019 rights and fos - tering the bargaining power of employees; 2. Stresses the need for socially and economically balanced structural reforms aimed at the realisation of the Social Triple A by improving inclusive labour market and social policies which address the needs of workers and vulnerable groups, in order to boost investment, to create quality employment, to help the workforce to acquire the skills they need, to promote equal opportunities in the labour market and fair working conditions, to increase labour productivity, to support wage growth and sustainable and adequate social protection systems, and to improve living standards for all citizens; emphasises the need to reinforce a favourable environment for both business and workers with a view to creating more stable employment, while balancing the social and economic dimensions and taking decisions jointly and in a complementary fashion; calls on the Member States to gradually shift taxes from labour to other sources without jeopardising social security; calls on the Member States to undertake measures to improve social standards and reduce inequalities; 3. Stresses that social dialogue and collective bargaining are key instruments for employers and trade unions in order to establish fair wages and working conditions, and that strong collective bargaining systems increase Member States\u2019 resilience in times of econo - mic crisis; recalls that the right to establish collective bargaining is an issue that concerns all European workers, with crucial implica - tions for democracy and the rule of law, including respect for fundamental social rights, and that collective bargaining is a European fundamental right which the European institutions are bound to respect under Article 28 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights; calls, in this context, for policies that respect, promote and strengthen collective bargaining and the workers\u2019 position in wage-setting sys - tems, which play a critical role in achieving a high standard of working conditions; believes all this should be done with a view to sup - porting aggregate demand and economic recovery, reducing wage inequalities and fighting in-work poverty; 4.

Urges the Commission to bring efforts to bear with a view to helping people suffering from given conditions, for example chro - nic pain, to enter or remain on the labour market; maintains that the labour market needs to be geared to such situations, and made more flexible and non-discriminatory, so as to ensure that the people concerned can likewise contribute to the EU\u2019s economic deve - lopment, thus relieving the strain on social security systems; 7. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s support for investment to enhance environmental sustainability and the acknowledgement of its potential across the economy; agrees that support for the transition towards a circular and green economy has a high net job creation potential; 8. Welcomes the Interinstitutional Proclamation on the European Pillar of Social Rights (EPSR) and believes that the European Semester should support the development of its 20 key principles regarding equal opportunities, access to the labour market, fair wor - king conditions and social protection and inclusion, which should serve as a point of reference and a recommendation when imple - menting the European Semester policy coordination cycle in order to build a genuine Social Triple A for Europe, and to create economic growth and a predictable, sustainable financial situation subordinate to the targets of economic and employment policy, thereby serving the main, prioritised aims of the EU 2020 strategy; points out that the European Semester coordination process is an essential means of consolidating the European social dimension, from which the Social Pillar derives; highlights that the EPSR is a first step through building up a common approach to the protection and development of social rights across the EU, which should be reflected in measures pursued by Member States; calls on the Commission, therefore, to put forward concrete proposals to reinforce social rights through concrete and specific tools (legislation, policy-making mechanisms and financial instruments) and achieving concrete results; stresses the primacy of fundamental rights; 9. Acknowledges the efforts taken to strengthen the social dimension of the Semester; calls for further action to balance social and economic priorities and to improve the quality of monitoring and recommendations in the social area; 10.

Underlines the fact, that for the EU on average, 11 of the 14 headline indicators recorded an improvement over the last avai - lable year, confirming the steady improvement in the labour market and social situation which has accompanied the economic reco - very; notes, however, that action is required to achieve social upward convergence along the dimensions identified by the Social Pillar, as stated by the Commission, and that the analysis of the headlines indicators shows at least one \u2018critical situation\u2019for 17 of the 28 Member States; 12. Acknowledges that, despite improvements in the economic and employment situation in recent years in the EU as a whole, the gains produced have not always been distributed evenly, as the number of people in a situation of poverty and social exclusion conti - nues to be too high; is concerned by growing inequalities in the EU and its Member States, and by the increasing share of workers at risk of poverty, not only part-time workers, but also full-time workers; calls on the Commission and the Member States to continue their efforts to improve the conditions for these people, and to give greater recognition to the work and expertise of NGOs, anti- poverty organisations and people experiencing poverty themselves, encouraging their participation in the exchange of good practices; points out that high levels of inequality diminish the output of the economy and the potential for sustainable growth; underlines the fact that the integration of long-term unemployed individuals through individually tailored measures is a key factor for fighting poverty and social exclusion and for contributing to the sustainability of national social security systems; calls for partnerships encom - passing all relevant stakeholders to be established and developed in order to provide the tools necessary to respond more effectively to labour market needs, deliver effective solutions and prevent long-term unemployment; stresses the need to implement effective labour market policies in order to reduce long-term unemployment; considers that the Member States should further help those out of work by providing affordable, accessible and quality support services for job search, training and requalification, while protecting those unable to participate; ",

Shares the Commission\u2019s view that \u2018social protection systems should ensure the right to minimum income benefits\u2019; calls on the Member States to set an adequate minimum income above the poverty line, in line with national legislation and practices and with the involvement of social partners, and to ensure it is accessible to all people and targets those most in need; considers that in order to be effective in the fight against poverty, minimum income schemes should be accompanied by access to quality and affordable public goods and services and measures to promote equal opportunities and facilitate entry or re-entry into the labour market for people in vulnerable situations, if they can work; 16. Calls on the Commission to create a European social security number in order to facilitate information exchange, to provide people with a record of their current and past entitlements and to prevent abuse; 17.

Is of the opinion that Cohesion Policy, as the main public investment policy of the European Union, has demonstrated its effec - tiveness in reducing inequalities and enhancing inclusion and poverty reduction, and should therefore receive more funding in the future MFF; considers that the ESF should be retained as the main EU instrument for the integration and reintegration of workers into the labour market, as well as for supporting measures for social inclusion, combating poverty and inequalities, and to support the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights; calls on the Commission to increase the ESF in order to support the implemen - tation of the European Pillar of Social Rights in the next MFF; 49. Stresses the necessity for the EFSI to support growth and employment in high-risk investment projects, and to tackle youth and long-term unemployment; is concerned, however, about the enormous imbalance in the use of the fund between the EU-15 and EU- 13; stresses, moreover, the role of the Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) Programme for promoting high levels of quality and sustainability of employment, for guaranteeing adequate and decent social protection, and for combating social exclusion and poverty; 50.

Deplores the fact that, after countless requests from Parliament, the outermost regions are still not included in the AGS; urges the Commission, with the aim of guaranteeing equity between regions and furthering upward convergence, which has been much dis - cussed, to step up the application of Article 349 TFEU in an effort to boost the integration of the outermost regions into the EU; stresses that the special attention given to the outermost regions must be maintained, not only with regard to allocation of funds but also in the light of the impact that European policies can have on their social situation and levels of employment; 56. Highlights the fact that over the period 2014-2016, real wage growth lagged behind productivity growth, notwithstanding improvements in the labour market; recalls that growth in real wages, as a result of increased productivity, is crucial for tackling ine - qualities; 57. Underlines the role in the reform process of the social partners as essential stakeholders, of national social dialogue practices and of civil society, and the added value of their active involvement in the drafting, sequencing and implementation of reforms; stresses that being effectively involved in the design of policies will enable social partners to feel more engaged in the national reforms adopted as a result of the country-specific recommendations of the Semester and ultimately reinforce their ownership of the outcomes; calls on the Commission, therefore, to propose guidelines for such adequate involvement of all relevant stakeholders; supports the view that new forms of employment in the globalised market require new forms of social and civil dialogue, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to support the creation of these new forms of social dialogue and the protection of these new forms of employ - ment; stresses that all workers must be informed of their rights and be protected in the event that whistleblowing is used to report abu - sive practices; believes that, if we are to move towards upward convergence, social dialogue should be pursued throughout every phase of the European Semester process; affirms that the Member States need to help people build the skills required in the labour market; 58. Highlights the fact that, according to the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) and the EU2020 scoreboard, the distribution of skills in the labour force largely matched the qualification requirements of the labour market in 2016, and that labour supply exceeded demand for all qualification types, and was particularly high for low- and medium-level qua - lifications; stresses that CEDEFOP forecasts show a parallel rise in skills from both demand and supply until 2025 and that skills levels are expected to change faster for the labour force than those required by the job market; calls on the Commission and the Member States, therefore, to carefully reassess the difficulties in accessing the labour market; is concerned about the increase in the over-qualifi - cation rate (25 % in 2014); 59. Highlights that gender discrimination, such as the gender pay gap or the gap in the employment rate between men and woman, is still great, with the average gross hourly earnings of male employees about 16 % higher than those of female employees; stresses that these gaps are due to the under-representation of women in well-paid sectors, discrimination in the labour market and the large num - ber of women in part-time work; urges that further progress is needed to narrow these gaps; calls on the Commission, in this context, to introduce into the EU 2020 strategy a gender equality pillar and an overarching gender equality objective; 60. Calls on the Member States to incorporate the gender dimension and the principle of equality between woman and man in their national reform programmes and stability and convergence programmes, by setting qualitative targets and devising measures that address persisting gender gaps; 61.
