        "6 1. Introduction and context: what, where and why? 1.1. Understanding the selected region: key characteristics In general, Sterea Ellada where both schools are situated has high unemployment rates (25.8%) (Eurostat, 2015a) and it is suffering from the effects of de-industrialisation and the recession of farming. Sterea Ellada has 42.9% youth unemployment rate (Eurostat, 2015b) and 8.2% of early leavers from education and training (Eurostat 2015c). In Sterea Ellada, the NEETs rate was 23% in 2011, while in 2015 the rate reached to 25,1% (Eurostat 2016a). 40.4% of the total population were at risk of poverty or social exclusion in 2015 (Eurostat 2015d). The GDP in Sterea Ellada was 61 (PPS per inhabitant in % of the EU28 average) in 2014 (Eurostat 2016b). The wider area of Viotia is also considered environmentally disadvantaged due to the contamination of the river of Asopos with industrial waste. Figure 1. The region of Sterea Ellada. 1.2. Getting to know the schools selected for the field study: brief profile 1.2.1. School 1 - 4th Primary School of Thiva 1 School 1 is a public primary school 2 , established by the state in 1974-75. It is situated in Thiva, in the county of Viotia, a city of 22.833 inhabitants according to the census of 2011. Thiva is the most populated municipality in the county of Viotia but Livadia is the capital of the county. Both cities are centres for the processing and commerce of agricultural products. Viotia\u2019s economy is based on agricultural production (Viotikos Kosmos, n.d.). In the 1920s many refugees from Asia Minor were installed and in the last half of the 20th century industrial plants were built in the wider area around Thiva with factories producing textile, plastic, cement etc. The neighborhood of the school is called \u201cPuri\u201d, near the exit of the city towards Livadia, Delfi, Aliartos (where School 2 is situated) and Orhomenos (Municipality of Thiva, 2017). Thiva can be considered underprivileged in its history of refugee and working-class population, taking into consideration the period of de-industrialisation and the high unemployment rates of the region thenceforth. Even though the city is relatively wealthy compared to other areas of Viotia-Sterea Ellada, the particular neighbourhood of School 1 is considered disadvantaged because it is situated near a settlement of Roma population. However, 1 School 1 website: http://4dim-thivas.voi.sch.gr/ 2 A Primary School in Greece includes Grades 1st to 7th and pupils ranging from 6 to 12 years old. ",
        "this school attracts only a few Roma pupils as there is another school in the area allocated to the Roma population. The school has been developing innovative practices of informal learning for six years, (i.e. 2011) when the current Headteacher took office. Innitially they began as an initiative within the school and continued with the funding through a programme on the implementation of innovative educational activities in schools called \u201cMathenume Parea\u201d (Learning Together) of the Latsis Foundation funding body3 (Latsis Foundation 2016). Although it began as a group work of a few teachers, gradually the whole school community got engaged. These practices also stand out as a model for other schools. At the moment, the school has 245 pupils between 6-12 years old. It employs 27 teachers (including special education teaching support). It also employs one person for the canteen and one cleaner (three years ago, there was also a school guard who was made redundant). There are also school counselors of primary education (higher administrative staff), who are not specific to each school but allocated to many schools of a local educational area and report to the Regional Directorate of Primary Education of Central Greece. The school has a very good image among other schools, the municipality, the broader community and the regional directorate of Primary Education and it attracts many students. There is a limited number of students allocated to each school according to residence and the school has to reject many applications each year. As one teacher put it \u201cWe have become VIP. The whole county knows the school\u201d. The work of the school was made public in the media, different websites of the local community and in the wider academic community (Thiva Real News 2015, ExeisMhnyma blog n.d.). The initial goal of the school in the school year 2011-12 was to improve the school building and the yard, and a refurbishment took place (the walls were painted, the yard was restructured, interactive educational toys inside and outside the building were put). The next goal was to improve the educational level of pupils and school performance, to enhance cooperation between teachers and to avoid conflicts among pupils, which was a common issue in the school. This was done through the innovation of the \u201cInformal Learning Environments\u201d. The ongoing goal is to improve cooperation among the teaching staff. The teachers\u2019 cooperation is enhanced through regular meetings of all teaching staff involved in each grade (rather than a plenary meeting). For example, all teachers of all classes of Grade 1, including specialisations (e.g. IT teacher, PE teacher) and the headteacher meet once at the end of every term (trimester) as a group and discuss the pupils\u2019 progress and the innovative programme\u2019s progress in general. This is an interesting governance tool and internal monitoring mechanism that is quite rare in Greek schools. The goal for this school year (which is partly met so far) is, \u201cto make parents do things for themselves (...) I don\u2019t want someone else to tell them what to do. We\u2019ve done that. I want to see if I can organise experiential seminars\u201d (Headteacher)4. The general goal is to open the school to the wider community and to have active parental involvement, \u201cto communicate our work to them, to participate, not to have them on the opposite side, to understand the difficulties we go through, because there is usually a wrong impression about our work\u201d (teacher). 3 The John S. Latsis Public Benefit Foundation is a non-profit, national organisation which was established in 2005. Its goal is to plan and fund programmes on education, science, health, social welfare, culture and the environment. http://www.latsis-foundation.org/eng 4 These are seminars that the headteacher plans to organize within the school. Such seminars are usually run by psychologists who work with parents in small groups and are based on group work and experiential learning rather than on lectures and note taking. Their goal is to empower parents and sensitise them on issues regarding child rearing and school life. ",
        "8 1.2.2. School 2 - 2nd Primary School of Aliartos 5 Aliartos is a town of 4.402 inhabitants according to the 2011 census. \u0399t is 20.9 km from Thiva and 23 km from Livadia (Dhmos, n.d.). It is a small town near the dried lake Kopaida, with a central high street with few shops. In the School Headteacher\u2019s own words, \u201cthe people here are very poor. It was very difficult to send the children to attend a theatrical play in Athens\u201d. School 2 is a public primary school which was established in 1990. It now has 169 pupils between 6 and 12 yearsold (grades 1-6 th ). It employs 23 teachers. There is one member of staff working in the school canteen and one cleaner. This school is involved in social inclusion and social awareness programmes. Its Headteacher has also established communication and unofficial mentoring with the Headteacher in school 1, where the Headteacher in School 1 was mentoring the Headteacher in School 2. Even though the Headteacher took office one and a half year ago, the change has been impressive and innovation applications were worth researching. I The image of the school in the broader community of Aliartos is very good. Parents share this good impression because the student applications for the current school year have increased. \u201cThey [administrators from the Regional Directorate of education of Central Greece, other teachers] find out [about the school] and they say \u201cWhat is happening in this school?\u201d [\u2026] Our website has many visitors. [\u2026] It has reached 42000\u201d (Headteacher) 6 . The Headteacher\u2019s first goal was to make the building and the yard \u201clook like a school\u201d. The second goal was to improve the school climate, which appeared to have been problematic before the headteacher took office in terms of relations among the teachers and school governance staff. The main, ongoing goal is to develop a school culture and create active citizens, caring and respectful human beings. The goal of the Headteacher as far as teaching staff is concerned, was to create a school environment where teachers would be enabled to participate in programmes and projects (both internal school programmes but also projects at a national level). This year the goal is to create libraries and renew the computer lab. There is also a growing interest among the teaching staff in research and a recent tendency to do research (at least bibliographic) before beginning a new programme. The goals are put to practice through constant discussion within the Teachers\u2019 Union of the school and through the experiential learning of rules 7 . According to the Headteacher, the teaching staff have clear roles and responsibilities and are running different programmes in their classes (e.g. literacy development, environmental sensitisation etc.). Many presentations are organised for pupils. The parents\u2019 association of the school is involved in terms of financial help and material needs but also discretely kept at a distance, as the Headteacher alluded. It is a school that is open to change and to innovation; it invites pupils to attend extra- curricular activities in the afternoons: \u201cThe school doesn\u2019t close. \u201cAfter 4 and that\u2019s it\u201d [is out of the question in this school]. It also opens on Saturdays. There is chess, tennis, theatre games and robotics. 8 \u201d (Headteacher) 5 School 2 website: http://2dimotikosxoleioaliartou.blogspot.gr/ 6 However, School 2 is not as known at a national level as School 1 because its innovative projects are more recently applied. 7 There is an orientation to experiential \u201clearning by doing\u201d in this school rather than teaching as transmission of factual knowledge and indoctrination. 8 These optional educational programmes take place in the afternoon and evening, after 4.00 pm.

        "2. Two perspectives on the school innovation process: what supports and what limits innovation? 2.1. 4th Primary School of Thiva 9 2.1.1. Presenting the innovative approaches practised in the school The innovation of \u201cInformal Learning Environments\u201d was initiated by the school Headteacher in collaboration with the teachers\u2019 union. The practice started in 2011, when the present Headteacher assumed her post, and was further encouraged by the School Counselor of Early Childhood Education affiliated to the Regional Directorate of Primary Education of Central Greece (part of the Ministry of Education) 10 . The idea stemmed out of a discussion between the Headteacher and the School Counselor; there was no existing school that worked as a model. The proposal for the renovation of the yard was first approved by the Teachers\u2019 Union of the school. It involved the renovation of the school yard and its use for learning purposes and developed without funding for the first three years (with the parents\u2019 support and individual sponsors). (See Annex III Link to video before and after the yard\u2019s renovation). Then the school submitted a proposal to the Latsis Foundation (http://www.latsis-foundation.org/) for funding. It was successful and ran as a funded programme called \u201cCome to our school yard\u201d (\u201cEla stin avli mas\u201d) for two years. The programme lasted until 2016 and the school is currently applying for another funding programme. The Headteacher in collaboration with the teachers, their teaching needs and pupils\u2019 interests came up with three axes of the innovative programme: \u201cLove of reading\u201d (2nd and 3rd grade), \u201cEnvironmental education\u201d (4th grade) and \u201cPhysics\u201d (5th and 6th grade). Emphasis was placed on the renovation of the schoolyard and the practices organised in it. Each teacher developed the programme in their own way. In the \u201cLove of reading\u201d the teachers and pupils read and worked on 7 books on the concept of \u201cdifference\u201d on topics of autism, difference in colour, blindness etc. Writers were invited, there was a workshop for creative writing (the pupils wrote and published a book). They also made a game of cards based on the story. The story on blindlness was then published into a very neat edition written in Braille. Under the pergola there are reading corners (see Annex III for L. Denezaki\u2019s webpage). For the \u201cEnvironmental education\u201d project, feeders and nests for birds were constructed. Pupils and teachers searched the web for information on birds that were visiting their schoolyard. They visited an environmental park, they talked with ornithologists who gave them a lot of information on the life of birds (teacher). The environmental project was cross-thematic because it developed language, maths, folklore studies and drawing 11 . As far as \u201cPhysics\u201d is concerned (Energy/photovoltaic) \u201c[...] a specialist presented the (photovoltaic) connection, they prepared a theatrical play in order to understand how solar energy is turned into electric [...] 12 . We went to a wind-energy park [\u2026] and we saw how the wind turbine can save energy \u201c(teacher). They also issued a magazine reporting the school\u2019s events and work. 13 This innovation was a collective effort of the headteacher, the teachers\u2019 union, the children and the parents. It was initially the headteacher who organised and supervised 9 School 1 website: http://4dim-thivas.voi.sch.gr/ 10 The role of the School Counselor is to provide teachers with scientific and pedagogic guidance, promote educational research and participate in educational evaluation (Government Gazette 1340/16-10-02). 11 It involved measuring, designing and drawing the feeders and nests, learning proverbs with birds etc. 12 The initial plan for the Physics project was different. They wanted to construct \u201ca model of a hydroelectric factory in a much smaller scale\u201c but they could not find experts available to help them (teacher). 13 http://4dim-thivas.voi.sch.gr/index.php/news/138-ela-stin-avli-mas-mia-eidiki-ekdosi ",
        "10 the actual construction of the schoolyard. In the beginning 6-7 teachers were interested but gradually everyone entered the programme and is currently in charge of something. They all carried stuff, painted walls, drew etc. The nature of certain projects such as the construction of the feeders could not be done by a single teacher but required cooperation of many teachers, parents, children and technicians. The school adopted a female dog, Hera, that lived in the schoolyard and each class looked after her by turns. As far as maintenance is concerned, \u201cwhat you see is maintained by children [\u2026] Every year around April the rain has fallen, the paint has faded, the plants need pruning [\u2026] each grade is divided into groups and they all get their part\u201d (Headteacher). Before the Headteacher assumed her post, there was a lack of inspiration and cooperation among teachers: \u201cwhen I first came here [\u2026], we were doing standardised things [\u2026] every time I tried to do something different, there were barriers\u201d (teacher) The innovation addressed aesthetic needs: \u201cit shouldn\u2019t look like a hospital [...] children should like it\u201d (Headteacher). It also addressed disciplinary needs: \u201cWe observed that children wander in the yard aimlessly [\u2026] they don\u2019t do anything creative, they don\u2019t play, they fight with each other, they fall down and hurt themselves. So, we decided to ban football and offer them something else instead\u201d (teacher). The teaching staff observed the pedagogic needs: the goal of the Informal Learning Environments was to enhance inclusion through differentiated pedagogy (teacher). Teachers had to \u201cescape the narrow road of the prescribed teaching material and the examinations\u201d and to \u201ccreate a strong team of play before creating a team of work\u201d (teacher). Another goal was to sensitise children on environmental issues: \u201cthe starting point was [...] a class on different types of birds and on the destruction of nature by humans. And [...] a wounded bird [\u2026] the pupils were concerned and discussed what they could do about it [...]\u201d (teacher). It also addressed practical needs of the lighting of the yard. As far as material and financial resources are concerned, they received 3000 euros from the Latsis Foundation and they bought a photovoltaic, books, the material for the feeders and were able to go on two excursions for free. They also received help from the parents\u2019 association 14 . The funding from the municipality is quite limited due to a lack of financial resources 15 . A lot of time was required to plan the projects in advance in order to have a good result, and more time was allowed for discussion among the teachers for reflection on the progress of the projects as well. As far as the human resources are concerned, apart from pupils and teachers, there were also scientists (ornithologists, mechanics) and craftspeople (e.g. carpenter, workers) involved. Overall, it took 6 years to plan and implement these innovative approaches. Now the Programme Latsis has ended but the practices are sustainable. 2.1.2. Main enablers for innovations The main enablers originate from the school headteacher and the (regional) school counselor of Primary Education. When Ms N. became the school headteacher, \u201cwho had a vision for the school, many changes occurred\u201d (teacher). Apart from good planning in advance and hard work stemming from the Headteacher herself, teamwork and inspiration was important. The school counselor is also open to innovation and change: \u201cThe counselor liberates us. She tells us \u201cDo things, there is enough time.\u201d (teacher). The Headteacher points out the need to be actively involved and passionate about a project in order for it to thrive: \u201cYou need to have a \u201csoul\u201d, to love what you do. You cannot do this thing formally\u201d. The Headteacher inspired a sense of teamwork among the 14 The school also organises a Christmas Bazaar and teachers and pupils sing the carrols to collect extra money. 15 However, the administrators in the municipality appear very interested in the innovative practices of School 1 and aim for collaborations between the school and the municipality. But, according to the Headteacher, the municipality appears to benefit more from this collaboration rather than the school (e.g. the school provided some of the birds\u2019 nests for the municipality\u2019s park). ",
        "teaching staff which was evident especially during the focus group discussion. Her enthusiasm, outgoing personality and availability was a key for the school community and the development and sustainability of all innovative practices taking place in the school. \u201cMy door never closes. Even if it\u2019s freezing cold. They come and tell me their problems\u201d (Headteacher). \u201cThe magic word is that everyone knows about everything. The teachers know that they are one team and they will deal with anything together (Headteacher). \u201cEveryone was delighted. This is probably because we are all open to anything and ready to discuss anything.\u201d (teacher) Both pupils and parents accepted the innovation. Pupils became more attracted to the school and parents appeared to appreciate the change in both their children\u2019s attitude towards schooling and in the actual condition of the school yard and building 16 . The school is supported by the parents\u2019 association. Parents of current and former students supported the school financially drawing from their limited financial resources. Teacher Ch. points out that active parental involvement is no coincidence in this school: there is an ongoing cooperation and communication between parents and teachers; there is Parents\u2019 School and many seminars are organised for parents. This has created an environment of mutual trust 17 . Financial support is further secured through sponsors in the Headteacher\u2019s networking: \u201cI draw on my own social connections to benefit the school\u201d (Headteacher). These sponsors are private companies that have supported the school and are part of the social network of the headteacher. In general, attracting such support is not easy and requires constant effort and vigilance by the Headteacher. Another enabler, at the systemic level, is the fact that informal learning environments as an innovation has entered the discussion on Greek education mainly with regards to the attainment of \u201cquality of education\u201d and the promotion of inclusive education. One of the means in order to reach the strategic goal of the improvement of the quality of the educational systems within the EU is by rendering education more attractive to students; informal learning environments are one of the suggestions in order to \u201copen\u201d education to the wider community and make it more appealing (Vavouraki et al. 2008). The development of informal learning environments is suggested as a means for promoting inclusive education, supporting pupils from underprivileged backgrounds and/or with special learning needs (Aggelidis & Avraamidou 2011). 2.1.3. Main barriers for innovations Some barriers in terms of communication and trust between parents and teachers on issues regarding the children and families in general, originated from the fact that Thiva is a small community and that parents and teaching staff doubted the confidential character of their communication. Barriers were also identified in the attitudes of the teaching staff, as expressed by one teacher \u201c[...] Unfortunately there is negativity, there is a selfishness that doesn\u2019t let teachers ask questions\u201d, in the sense that they do not want to sound ignorant and in need of help. According to her, some teachers are reluctant to make improvements and changes in their work. Another problem is that the teachers are not self-confident enough. There is this \u201cdevaluation of their work, this misery in these recent years\u201d. The problem lies on a lack of culture for innovation and a weak system of CPD for teaching staff (while there is a recent shift in ITE to embrace innovation), as further discussed in section 3. 16 Even though the parents played a role in terms of material support, they did not have a say on the actual pedagogic practices and programme. This was, mainly due to the governance model and attitude of the Headteacher 17 The term \u201cparents\u2019 schools\u201d involves optional schools for adults that provide knowledge on family issues and child rearing. They particularly focus on psychological and health issues and counselling on problems encountered in the family (Hourdaki 2000). ",
        "12 The headteacher identified a barrier at an administrative/legislative level: she had to have specialised legal knowledge in order to understand and complete certain administrative tasks - \u201cI had to be a lawyer for certain issues\u201d (e.g. an official complaint for a member of staff) (Headteacher). She also pointed out the lack of administrative staff: \u201cAll the paperwork is carried out by the Headteacher who also has 8 hours of teaching per week\u201d (Headteacher). An important barrier is financial constraints, which preoccupy not only the Headteacher but also the teachers themselves: \u201cAn additional reason of distress for teachers is how to cope with material/financial resources\u201d (Headteacher). A teacher identified time constraints this current year. During the previous years, there were gaps in between the daily school schedule that helped teachers prepare for various projects, while this year there are no such breaks, which requires that the teachers prepare much more at home for all innovative programmes. Certain barriers could be identified at the school level. The first grade did not participate in the programme due to administrative barriers (one teacher was appointed later in the school year) and personal reasons (the other teacher had a very young baby and not much extra time). The Headteacher identifies a very important weakness at the system level: the lack of regular internal evaluation in school units which does not help monitor pedagogic practices in a systematic way 18 . According to the staff in School 1, it is possible to foresee the future barriers for innovative pedagogies and organisational practices and prepare for them with prior teacher training and a well-prepared pilot programme 19 . According to the Headteacher there should be a pilot period of innovative pedagogies of 2-3 months for goal setting, trials, reevaluation of goals and feedback. In more general terms, she points out the lack of administrative staff who would provide legal advice/support to the Headteachers and the teacher\u2019s union. Another point from the teachers\u2019 perspective is that more training on writing and self-reflection is required for teachers (teacher) 20 . 2.1.4. Main achievements According to the Headteacher, the school has reached the goal to improve learning levels (school performance), enhance cooperation among teachers and avoid, as much as possible, conflicts among pupils. Pupils have accepted rules through experience: \"Because they see a nice schoolyard and can do things there, they look after it\u201d (Headteacher). Experiential learning also encouraged children and enhanced their talents: As one teacher said \u201csomeone not particularly strong in language or maths may excel in drawing\u201d. Group dynamics are promoted because children \u201csupport each other more during playtime rather than inside the classroom\u201d and pupils are more drawn to 18 This is considered a barrier at the system level because the initial educational policy measure was to centrally coordinate internal evaluations in schools: Internal evaluation (self-evaluation) of the school unit was established as mandatory in 2010 (law 3848/2010, article 32) and was applied during the school year 2013-14 but was abolished by the SYRIZA/ANEL government in 2015. The concept of evaluation and self-evaluation in schools has also been regarded as controversial in the Greek educational community, it is associated with possible redundancies and received a lot of resistance. These attitudes and the fact that the Greek educational system is very centralised and bureaucratic are the main reasons that prevent internal evaluation to take place without central coordination at the system level. As noted in section 3.4 a decentralised governance with a sensitivity to the local context would be an important policy change at the system level to provide more freedom to the school unit. In fact, a model of self-evaluation of the school unit has been developed originally by J. Solomon\u2019s work (1999), further appraised and developed in Bagakis (2005) towards the decentralization of the system and the relative autonomy of the school unit. 19 Even though School 1 did not have some teacher training prior to the implementation of the innovative practices, the first year of implementation was a trial and error period. 20 An important idea that transcends many ITE university programmes is that of the teacher as researcher (Androusou & Avgitidou 2013). In this framework, understanding the educational context and writing about it as a researcher appears to be very important. ",

According to the same teacher, the Informal Learning Environments help teachers understand the pupils\u2019 progress: \u201cYou can see, first and foremost, a happy child and also someone who learns and develops\u201d. In the beginning of the school year in Grade 1 some children could read; by Christmas all children of Grade 1 were able to read and write. As far as mathematics is concerned, pupils\u2019 excitement was such \u201cthat they wanted to do more, something that we don\u2019t usually see in maths classes\u201d according to a teacher. In educational visits of the school (e.g. to museum) where there are also pupils from other schools attending \u201cyou can\u2019t help but compare and see how disciplined our children are, how more eager to learn, how more well-behaved they are\u201d (teacher). These effects especially reached the weaker students, because they became part of a group and were asked to do things they could not do inside the classroom (Headteacher). Those \u201cwho didn\u2019t want to hear about physics when we started this project, started looking for things, gathering information\u201d (focus group interview). In the 5th grade last year there were also children from non-privileged backgrounds who could be considered as \u201clow achievers\u201d: they were those who asked most questions, as teachers in the focus group pointed out. Some girls who had been more silent before, appeared to be more engaged, asking more questions. The less confident pupils were also positively influenced: children who may not have been strong in maths or language but were good in arts and crafts. A younger member of staff noted that \u201cuntil recently I would teach something in class in the traditional way and only 3 out of 16 would study; now you see that this has changed and that you like it too\u201c (focus group interview). These changes on weaker pupils were not planned, and surprised most teachers. There were direct effects on teachers in being more relaxed and self-confident because of the support they received from the group: \"because I first started working on projects here I was very stressed [\u2026] when I get stuck somebody will help [\u2026] so then you see how much you like working like this\u201c (focus group interview). There were also many \u201cindirect effects\u201d in the broader community, outside school and pupils. A sense of a \u201cwider community\u201d was constructed and people in small businesses were sensitised to help. Parents of prior students helped, which reflects their ongoing trust in the school regardless of whether their children still attended or not. More effects on pupils are likely to materialise in the future as the results are cumulative according to the Headteacher. These achievements are sustainable because all teachers continue the projects in class and remind pupils of what they had done during the projects. The school\u2019s achievements were acknowledged in the community: \u201cThe fact that the Mayor came and acknowledged our work has its own meaning, too\u201d (focus group interview). 2.1.5. Sustainability of innovative practices The Informal Learning Environments are now part of the learning process and the activities in the schoolyard are well integrated in the teaching and learning process: \u201cvery often it takes place automatically, for example one day in Maths my students couldn\u2019t understand something [...] and immediately I took them outside at the schoolyard, and this happens very often\" (focus group interview). In general, the Headteacher and teachers have an innovations-oriented outlook:\u201d the school supports such programmes and is going for whatever stimulates our interest\u201d (focus group interview). However, the innovations discussed in this section are supervised by the headteacher. Their sustainability lies on the fact that she coordinates the practices and ensures their funding and support through private sponsors. Therefore, leadership in school 1 is a key enabling factor, acknowledged by all participants, not only for the development of innovations but also for their sustainability. ",
        "14 2.1.6. Monitoring, evaluation, learning loops and planning of innovative approaches There are some constant monitoring mechanisms in school 1 among teaching staff (there is always feedback during the meetings of the teaching staff in order to \u201ckeep track\u201d of the above-discussed innovations but there are no official monitoring and evaluation practices. The reason why there is no official general evaluation (where the whole community would participate) is that the teachers are afraid of the parents\u2019 opinion. \u201cWill they come and tell us if we\u2019re doing our job properly?\u201d was the teachers\u2019 ongoing concern according to the Headteacher. Periodical internal evaluations take place to \u201ckeep track\u201d of above-discussed innovations. Some teachers distribute questionnaires and interview pupils as a form of evaluation. The Headteacher monitors and evaluates the innovative approach by observing whether the pupils are making progress, what parents say, what the image of the school is and to what extent others are trying to follow their example; however, this is not documented systematically. Teachers ask pupils questions in an internal evaluation process such as \u201cWhat did you like in the programme, what would you like to change\u201d (focus group interview). As the Headteacher put it, \u201cThe feel we get is through informal processes\u201d. Successful practices are reflected in prior students: \u201cEven when they finish primary school and we see them in high school, they don\u2019t forget and they come back here and ask for everything that takes place in the school\u201d (focus group interview). There are some learning practices established. Some of them are well-established and constant (a teachers\u2019 union meeting by grade), some others are ad hoc (e.g. unofficial mentoring). Through the teachers\u2019 union meeting by grade (something they do in the last four years), teachers in school 1 learn from their own experiences and discuss how to improve certain practices in the future. \"Teachers come to my office and we discuss the issues that each class faces\u201d (Headteacher). Informal mentoring is an important learning tool: useful support was offered by academics and researchers to the headteacher, especially when she first took office. She, in turn, offered informal mentoring to other teachers in her school; this was done on a voluntary basis, free of charge. School 1 has adapted practices on how to learn from other relevant actors because this is a part of the philosophy of the school. They are constantly looking for ideas from School Counselors and are expecting the Counselors\u2019 guidance. They get informed about various programmes and they are also searching for programmes themselves, aiming to collaborate either with non-profit organisations, or the Directorate of Primary or Secondary Education. The school collaborates with two organisations for drug prevention and rehabilitation, \u201cProtasi zois\u201d (http://www.protasizois.gr/indexen.html), and OKANA (http://www.okana.gr/2012-04-03-07-49-40) 21 . 2.1.7. Stakeholders\u2019 engagement Apart from students and parents, the Latsis Foundation funded and supported the project at a formal level through the platform they offered. Parents provided financial and practical help (e.g. sewing, helping with the recording in the environmental project etc). The municipality (especially the environmental department) provided them with technicians and craftspeople. The municipality acknowledged the school\u2019s work in the end 22 .The key actors and organisations in the education system helping to promote and mainstream school innovations were: 21 There is a general reluctance of public schools to collaborate either with the private sector or with NGOs, because issues of conflict regarding decision making arise, as we discussed with one representative of Ministry of Education. 22 The municipality was unable to support the school financially due to limited resources; in the end it was the school that offered resources to their municipality (nests for the municipality park), after the municipality officers\u2019 requests. This offer was acknowledged by the Mayor. ",
        "\uf0b7 The School Counselor who disseminates information and supports the teachers and Headteacher. She \u201cis flexible, supportive and open to innovations\u201d, as the headteacher pointed out. 23 \uf0b7 The Regional Directorate of Primary Education, the school headteacher and the teachers \uf0b7 Academics and researchers in the context of a research project supported the headteacher in her first steps. 2.1.8. Mainstreaming and transferring innovations The ideas of innovative practices came to school 1 from the Headteacher\u2019s and teachers\u2019 readings and internet search rather than from other schools. It was only the idea for the environmental project that came from a teacher\u2019s own schooling experience in Germany: \"I grew up abroad and there this was a common practice in every school, bird nests, weather stations, tree planting [...] and this is how it began, I recalled what I did there as a student and I tried to see what is happening here.\" The Headteacher had been in close contact with academics some years ago, through a research programme on Supportive Education 24 and got helpful feedback, encouragement and unofficial mentoring which is at the heart of the innovative processes of the school. Part of these innovative approaches were mainstreamed to other schools within the region of Sterea Ellada. \u201cThe school worked as a multiplier\u201d inside and outside the county, as far as the city of Patras (teacher). The refurbishment of the schoolyard mostly inspired the headteacher of school 2 and the Headteachers of the two schools are communicating a lot with each other. These mainstreaming attempts were successful in school 2. To a lesser extent, they were mainstreamed in two other primary schools in Thiva who also made interactive toys in the yard. A teacher has cooperated with yet another primary school in the city. The mainstreaming was facilitated by the school counselor who disseminates information: \u201cThe Counselor goes to Aliartos and tells them \u201cthey did X\u201d\u201d (Headteacher). An additional factor is the Headteacher\u2019s \u201cgenerous personality\u201d (teacher) who is available to help other colleagues. There is a process for the dissemination of innovation, in presentations in the Regional Directorate of Primary Education of Central Greece (part of the Ministry of Education) that was encouraged by the school counselor. The members of teaching staff of School 1 have been invited to present their work, and different teachers have given presentations individually. Ch. has shown their work in Levadia and Chalkida. One of the reasons they published the aforementioned magazine was in order to make their work known. \u201c[\u2026] we decided it would be a good idea to spread the word. [\u2026] For others to see that it is not that difficult after all\u201d (Ch.). They also participate in the eTwinning platform. The main challenges encountered in the process of transferring innovations are related to local issues. The headteacher of the school 1 argues that the headteacher of school 2 is facing the problems she had been facing 6 years ago, when she had been first appointed 23 In the workshop, one school counselor who had been a source of inspiration for School1 pointed out that there were many problems in the first phases of the development of innovation, presented her contribution for the construction of school yards and the introduction of informal learning environments and argued that there was a huge difference between her proposals and the implementation that was about to take place by the local administration. She stressed the fact that the implementation of innovation requires constant supervision and monitoring of the administrative processes by the scientific experts. 24 This specific programme was part of the \u201cPilot Programmes of Supportive Education\u201d [Pilotika Programmata Enishitikis Didaskalias] with Prof. G. Varnava-Skoura scientific coordinator, as part of the Operational Programme \u201cEducation and Lifelong Learning\u201d \u0399\u0399 of the 2nd CSF, 1997 \u2013 2000. Supportive education programmes operate within school hours in primary and secondary education and their goal is to help children tackle problems of school performance. ",
        "16 (problems of creating a team of colleagues, establishing mutual trust etc.). Another challenge is the fact that the School 2 is situated in a much smaller town (with more limited resources and a smaller, possibly more \u201csuspicious\u201d community). A more general challenge in the communication and dissemination of innovation is that the teachers do not want to share their ideas or their work: \u201cthe teacher is a bit of an oyster\u201d (Headteacher). In fact, teachers are quite demotivated to present their work to their colleagues on special dates appointed for this task at a regional educational level; on the contrary, presenting one\u2019s work is perceived as showing off and lack of camaraderie (see also section 2.2.4). 25 Although the practices in School 1 did inspire others, the results could have been better had the information been more widely diffused: \u201cThere should be another way for these things to be mainstreamed, such as a platform for the dissemination of practices\u201d (Headteacher). Another problem is the time pressure due to the heavy teaching load. According to one of the youngest members of teaching staff in school 1, many young teachers view innovative practices as time consuming, which require personal investment and more physical presence in the school. Transferability of innovations is possible, with personal work and investment in theoretical study to make connections with educational practice according to one of the teachers However, the teaching staff and conditions are different and much harder to replicate elsewhere according to the Headteacher. The headteacher makes the point that location is crucial and she expressed reservations about transferability in a large city such as Athens. She argues that \u201con the one hand, there is too much gossip [here, among the parents], on the other hand, they help with school issues. [In Athens]it would be much more difficult because I could not have the parents as assistants\u201d. The headteacher further points out that in a large city such as Athens there are other practical difficulties such as long distances, commuting and also more hectic everyday life. Transferability can be difficult in terms of leadership. As a teacher puts it, \u201cmaybe in other schools with another headteacher, there would be another kind of problems\u201d. Transferability problems may occur due to the infrastructure: \u201cIf you go to the centre of Thiva in the schoolyards there is cement but here there is soil [...] so the fact that there was already a base on which we could work facilitated us a lot\". Last but not least, idiosyncratic issues play a role. As a teacher points out, \u201cit is my character to dare and try out new things. Someone else who doesn\u2019t dare could have done more, if there was more support and information available\u201d. 2.2. 2nd Primary School of Aliartos 2.2.1. Presenting the innovative approaches practised in the school The main innovative approach in the school is the programme \u201cI Care and I Act\u201d (\u201cNiazome ke Dro\u201d) which started in the school year 2015-16 at a national level. It is run by Lambrakis Foundation and the NGO \u201cDesmos\u201d in schools in 10 different regions in Greece 26 . This is a programme for the support of volunteer work and active citizenship 27 . \u201cThis programme cultivates volunteerism, the culture of solidarity, empathy and it mainly aims to cultivate active citizenship [...] you can do it everywhere, not only in schools but with everyone, children and adults\u201d (focus group interview). Part of it includes \"service 25 The lack of team spirit among different schools and different levels was evident during the Change Workshop. 26 The Lambrakis Foundation (n.d.) is a non-profit private institution of public interest with a focus on education and culture. It undertakes research, projects, training and awareness activities in critical areas for Greece and Europe and creates educational resources. The NGO Desmos aims to create networks for the utilization of private initiative in response to the humanitarian crisis in Greece http://desmos.org/who-we-are/?lang=en. 27 http://noiazomaikaidrw.gr/ ",
        "learning\u201d, a programme in which pupils offer services (e.g. feeding people in the church, collecting olives from trees) and learn about volunteering (see school blog in Annexe III). This innovative programme was initiated by the urge to \u201csee the real social problems that we have. [...] to respect first themselves, our neighbour and the nature\u201d (Headteacher). \u201cWe try since last year to improve our school, to change the things that we didn\u2019t like in the past [...] especially we try our students to be active participants, to have experiential learning, we organise some global days of rights and try to engage children to make constructions and handicrafts\u201d (focus group interview). The pupils themselves suggested that they built a library in their school and it was under construction during the fieldwork period. These innovations were initiated in 2015 by the Headteacher who found out about the programme \u201cNiazome ke Dro\u201d and was encouraged by the (regional) school counselor of Primary Education. It began as a project run by 3 people but it gradually became a collective effort this current year. Although last year more schools had started, only a part of them (66) continued. This current school year (2016-17) 150 schools are taking part. Two more schools in the area are participating, one in Livadia and another one in Thiva. It took them one year to plan and implement the innovation and they continue this current year. Last year they did not cooperate with any other school because they were trying to find out how the programme worked, being very demanding, according to the headteacher. Innovations were put in place with careful planning in the beginning. \u201cThe headteacher asked us who wants to participate and we decided that the upper grades should take part because the programme is very demanding\u201d, a teacher described the process. It continued with \u201cthe help of a coordinator, a teacher [in School 2] who is also working on his PhD on educational innovation [\u2026] [He] went to Athens this year [..] We have now become a very strong team\u201d (Headteacher). This teacher-coordinator is in close contact with an external coordinator appointed by the programme organisers. There was a meeting in Athens for the coordinators and after a week another meeting for everyone. More and more teachers of the school joined this programme. This year\u2019s focus is environmental and social issues and service learning. Through this innovation, as the coordinator himself puts it, \"a community is being created that is informal but there is exchange in it\". As far as financial and material resources are concerned, the programme did not give them any money \u201cbut in the end, they gave us money for an excursion and we visited various libraries\u201d. \u201cThe money that the school board gives to schools; the parents\u2019 association this programme gave us some money for a trip, 500 euros which were used to pay the bus in order to go on a trip to Athens and then we ourselves put our personal work and we tried with love to work as much as possible. On our own, we first discussed about it but also the parents\u2019 association was of great help, last year they were involved a lot, they showed interest and they continue to do so this year [...]\u201d (teacher). Other innovative practices were the projects on \u201cLove of reading\u201d, \u201cPlay\u201d and \u201cThe Sea\u201d that two teachers in the 1 st grade had begun. They also apply \u201cteam teaching\u201d which the Headteacher defined as two classes attending one lesson. 2.2.2. Main enablers for innovations The school climate that the school headteacher has created is an important enabler, according to members of the teaching staff and the headteacher herself. She has a protective, motherly attitude towards the younger members of the staff. She has also intentionally undertaken all administrative work, in order to ease the teachers\u2019 workload and make them focus extensively on their teaching duties. Four teachers are mothers of young children and have limited time resources. However, they manage to work some extra time for these projects (during the breaks, after the end of class and at home), receiving full support from the headteacher. A young teacher mentions that she had been ",
        "18 very reluctant to try out new things in her first year. She underlines how crucial the support of the current headteacher was in trying out new innovative practices. Although there is a model of \u201cshared leadership\u201d practiced at school, the Headteacher is firm in her decisions and works very hard, creating a particular work ethic: \u201cAnd when the headteacher goes first, the rest of us are ashamed to stay behind \"(Headteacher). An important enabler is teamwork and a sense of common goals. As a teacher puts it, \u201cI am two months in this school; however, I feel that I have a common goal, that I have to help. This is my job\u201d. As a young teacher mentions, \u201cit is also very important that we are here because we want to be here, not because it is obligatory [\u2026] Everything starts with the will, [\u2026] the encouragement. Specifically, K. [the Headteacher] helps. Because she acts as a model - she has innovative features herself and that helps\u201d. There is a common view that all interviewees shared: \u201cOur team works very well [...] we support each other\u201d (Headteacher). \u201dOn your own you are afraid, there is insecurity\u201d (focus group interview). Also, having a good time as a team is crucial: \u201call three of us used to come in the afternoon with our coffees and worked together\" (Headteacher). Parental involvement is also an enabler. As one teacher observes, \u201cmy students\u2019 parents are always receptive. Active participation will slowly come\u201d. The parents\u2019 association is active on financial matters but the headteacher has set her own limits as far as parents\u2019 interference: Parents do make a contribution as far as financial/material needs of the schools are concerned (purchasing books, a copying machine etc.) but do not have a say as far as educational practices are concerned. A sense of continuity is also important. A teacher points out: \"The fact that there is a continuity could be assumed as a memory. A memory that helps us organise the programme\". At the system level, the fact that this innovation is part of a larger enabler is indeed an enable in that the school receives guidance from an external coordinator. However, the help they received last year from the external coordinator was valuable but could not systematically address the local needs of the school unit. The help of the current external coordinator was not extensively discussed as the project had only just begun. 2.2.3. Main barriers for innovations The limited financial resources are an important barrier. As the headteacher points out, \u201cwe don\u2019t expect anything from the state anymore. There is no money\u201d. The headteacher mentions the lack of clear orientation as a barrier: \u201cAt the beginning of the programme, we also didn\u2019t know where we were going. So maybe this is why many teachers from other schools gave up\u201d. Another problem, according to her, at the first stage was low participation: \u201cIn the beginning (first year) only 2-3 teachers wanted to join the programme\u201d. There was difficulty in finding financial resources in the beginning of the innovative project. For example, they received many rejections for offers of library shelves. There are many mistakes that come from the lack of experience, according to teachers in the focus group. Inflexible rules in legal acts and circulars is a barrier to innovation and a teacher told us that \u201cyou can get out of the classroom (to make the lesson more experiential) but not very often\u201d. Time constraints are another barrier: \u201cYou have your class and at the same time you try to do an innovative programme. It needs time\u201d. However, this same teacher adds that it is possible to be a little bit flexible and integrate things. There is also an age barrier because, according to the headteacher, older teachers do not participate much, due to deeply embedded attitudes on innovation and hierarchy structures Even though the continuity of the programme is considered an enabler, the turnover of staff members is a problem. \u201cIt could be seen as an obstacle or difficulty, the fact that each year the teachers change and there is no permanent staff. \"This year, all are new, we are two that we were here since last year so we know what we do, we have to get ",
        "into the mood, the others must also get in the mood and this is difficult, there is disparity\" (focus group interview). 28 When the teacher does not receive any support from the headteacher, it is considered problematic: \u201cA teacher himself does not even take the initiative, he needs the headteacher\u2019s help. If the headteacher is positive to your idea, she will help you with the papers and all the practical issues. While now you say something and you know that the other will listen to you and if she can she will solve it immediately\u201d (focus group interview) Problems of location and travelling costs are also identified by teachers: \u201cWe do not have here many alternatives [for action] and it is difficult for us to move around, the bus costs us a lot [\u2026] We wanted to go to the oil press, only two kilometres from here, and the municipality offered to give us its minibus, but it did not have any seatbelts\u201d (Headteacher). A teacher, finally, identifies the lack of a \u201clearning community\u201d (in the sense of a group of teachers that share similar learning goals and practices) as a barrier. However, as a teacher eloquently points out: \"There are always problems. You're dealing with people. It is not a company, you have got a different role. You have both the education role and the role of the manager and you try to combine them\". It is possible to foresee the future barriers for innovative pedagogies and organisational practices and prepare for them. According to the headteacher, \u201cexperience is a good ally\u201d. The research climate also contributes to foreseeing barriers. According to the teacher/coordinator of the innovative programme, \u201cI systematically evaluate something and I see what succeeded and what failed. Last year they saw informally that the programme went well. So, we continued. What went wrong? For example, not many experiential actions took place. You try next time to correct it. If there is a systematic evaluation of the programmes [you gain such knowledge]. And you become more predictive. Every year you see what is missing and you add it later\u201d and adds: \u201cWe should have started from research, namely we should have searched more, we should have put our goals on a better basis from the beginning\". He actually suggests a qualitative research approach for evaluating innovation. 2.2.4. Main achievements Many changes were pointed out in the focus group, as far as pupils are concerned: \u201cIn general, they are positive, their attitudes have changed and they have overcome their selfishness to a great extent \u201c. \u201cI see that they have started taking initiatives, they suggest things by themselves (...) they are more willing [to do things], and they care for the others\u201d. \u201cChildren\u2019s behaviour changed, they tried to see in another way their fellow people, they showed social sensitivity [...] this year they are more sensitive and they try to help others, to offer help.\u201d It seems that the goal to establish a better environment for pupils has been achieved: \u201c... pupils had some disagreements, as everyone, and quarrels, and we tried to put them all together in a team by working with a common goal in order to become capable of showing their emotions to their peers\u201d. Pupils were able to see the added value of innovative pedagogies, as compared to more standard practices: \u201cThey saw that it is fun [...] to draw, to play, to get out in nature\u201d (focus group interview). Changes have happened to the broader community (outside school and pupils): \"[...] so yes, kids have changed, we also have changed and the parents. All the school\u201d. (focus group interview). According to a teacher, \u201cParents also have become more sensitive and 28 The non-permanent, deputy teachers choose which areas and schools to apply for. What both headteachers shared was their effort to make deputy teachers trust them and apply for the same school every year so as to build a stable team. The teachers prefer bigger towns in general. In general, the heavy workload that innovations require is a reason why some teachers avoid schools that try out innovative practices, as we discussed this issue in the focus group in school 1. ",
        "20 they try to offer as much as they can\u201d. The volunteer work is affecting the community: \u201cWe now work with the local community. They [the pupils] collect food for the church.\u201d These changes were planned but they are only now materialised as the innovation implementation is relatively new. Other effects regarding changes in attitudes are likely to materialise in the future, as they take more time to change: \u201cWhen you cultivate attitudes you cannot expect (changes) in a year\u201d, a teacher told us. The teachers are moving in small steps, and they are constantly implementing innovative practices: \u201cWe did simple things last year, one more step this year, one more next year, we constantly try to do more. Innovations never end and we try to do what we can to improve ourselves and our children\u201d. (focus group interview). A teacher (coordinator) who is more research-oriented, observed which part of attitudes had not yet developed in pupils: \u201cI checked the pre-existing knowledge. They [pupils] knew basic concepts. They didn\u2019t know much about activism\u201d. 2.2.5. Sustainability of innovative practices All of the above-presented innovations and achievements are sustainable, according to the Headteacher. They continue only for a second year but she appears determined to apply for similar programmes in the future, whether she is in a Headteacher or not. However, the innovative pedagogical programmes had been introduced due to the Headteacher\u2019s individual effort and perseverance and there is no deep-seated innovative culture; she expressed the concern that if she ceases from being a Headteacher, this culture will most probably cease as well. We also noticed that the Headteacher was more controlling and more protective of the teaching staff and delegated less work to them. 2.2.6. Monitoring, evaluation, learning loops and planning of innovative approaches School 2 evaluates if innovative practices were successful. However, there are no constant monitoring mechanisms to \u201ckeep track\u201d of the above-discussed innovations. \u201cThere is no formal evaluation [in general]. Informal of course, because without evaluation we cannot do anything [\u2026] Informal evaluation takes place through presentations\u2019 29 . Informal evaluation also takes place in the discussions among the teaching staff\u201d (focus group interview). In the particular programme \u201cNiazome ke Dro\u201d, there is an evaluative questionnaire at the end of the school year addressed to teachers and another one addressed to pupils. The questionnaires that the pupils filled in checked their understandings of the concepts developed in the programme (e.g. \u201cvolunteering\u201d and \u201csolidarity\u201d). The Headteacher and teachers were very positive towards a research-based school climate and evaluation: \u201cI believe that all these innovative practices should be evaluated in a systematic way. We are still in the beginning and more time is needed\u201d. As the teacher/coordinator of the innovative practice told us, \u201cI think more qualitative analysis is needed (...) we need interviews, structured observations [\u2026]I believe that this year we will do something [...] to see what results we will have [...] To explore students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 views\u201d. There are periodical evaluations (internal/external) in school 2 to \u201ckeep track\u201d of above- discussed innovations. \u201cThe presentation we did [in the forum of schools of the \u201cNiazome ke dro\u201d programme] in the end is a form of evaluation [...] we had also completed a questionnaire electronically... that had to do with the evaluation of the programme [...] we had also books. Last year at the beginning of the year we tried to clarify the terms in a world cafe, to check the pre-existing knowledge and then at the end of the year to see what students understood and evaluate the programme [...] and we had questionnaires 29 As mentioned above, the school counselor organizes a presentation day/workshop in the Regional Directorate in the beginning of each school year where teachers in schools of the Region voluntarily present educational programmes and innovative practices that they tried out the previous school year. ",
        "at the end to be completed by the students [...] it was a questionnaire to clarify the concepts, which they completed on their own without our help in order for us to find out what they understood\u201d (focus group interview). Even though there are not many mechanisms for learning and planning innovation, the members of staff are working constantly to find new ideas: \u201cIt is only in the forum that we see practices from other schools, this helps us because they give some ideas [\u2026] We the teachers (...) learn to work together, we first do this [...] as an example for imitation [\u2026] We are doing many internet searches non-stop to find new ideas [\u2026] Because we also don\u2019t know many things yet, we are still learning, besides in school every day we learn, we tried to do as much as we could and we continue in order to improve our school this year\u201d(focus group interviews). School 2 learns from its own experiences and discusses how to improve certain practices in the future. \u201cEssentially, we've done two meetings [within the school year, as part of the innovation programme]. Because you see that there is a wide exchange of views and knowledge. And secondly, there is electronic networking between us\u201d, the coordinator told us. According to the same informant, there are also ad hoc procedures: \u201cYou try to make use of everyone\u2019s knowledge. There are ideas. There is networking, the forum, but many times it is the personal networking, the social capital. And the contact with the university, with the [school] counselor, with the local community\u201d. Another teacher also described this ad hoc character: \u201cWe get ideas from the internet [...] we search in the evenings at our home to find out what other schools do, what we can do [...] Everyone makes a research first on his own and then we discuss about it altogether. But it is not so organised.\u201d Most staff members (20 out of 23 members) cooperate with each other with allocated roles and regular meetings for planning and discussion. \u201cThere are some mechanisms established for planning innovative approaches (...) we need to make a chart and stick to it, to put in order what we need to do. This will help us but also teachers in the following years\u201d (focus group interviews). 2.2.7. Stakeholders\u2019 engagement The key actors and organisations in the education system helping to promote and mainstream school innovations are the school headteacher, the school counselor, colleagues from other schools, teacher coordinators and external coordinators of the innovative programme. Other stakeholders who participated were the parents\u2019 association, and the Lambrakis Foundation. As the headteacher told us: \u201cThe School Counselor was of great help in the work we did. She opened the path for me. Not only for me\u201d. She also underlined the help she received from other colleagues outside her school: \u201cIn the administrative issues an outstanding teacher from school X helped me\u201d. There is no indication for cooperation between school 2 and universities or the private sector so far. 2.2.8. Mainstreaming and transferring innovations Even though the main innovation was not the same, the idea of innovation application and improvement of the school yard was very much inspired by school 1. The availability and openness of the headteacher in school 1 facilitated the development of an innovation-friendly climate in school 2. \"The Headteacher of School 1 never kept something for herself. She helped me in everything\", the headteacher said. The programme \u201cNiazome ke Dro\u201d has a structured yearly agenda: \u201cin October we discuss what we will do this year, goals and objectives that we have set, and in May we present our programmes, all the schools, we present all the programmes\u201d (focus group interview).\u201d Last year \u201cin the end, in Athens, all the schools came together and presented their programmes. 60 schools took part last year and this year I think 120. There is also communication of information at a regional scale in the Directorate of Primary Education of Central Greece. In the beginning of each year the School Counselor organises a workshop for any school in the area to (optionally) present an innovative practice or ",
        "22 other programme that they have carried out\u201d (focus group interview). The programme has a platform/forum for the exchange of ideas. However, the members of teaching staff did not have time to enter the forum and discuss with others. Even though this platform for communication among schools exists, the interviewees in School 2 appeared not to be involved in the network of schools that take part in \u201cNiazome ke Dro\u201d: last year they were new to the project and did not feel they could participate while this year, during the time of the fieldwork, the programme had just begun. There is cooperation with a school in Thiva but it has not yet been developed into a very close one. The headteacher said that the colleagues from that school \u201csaw my presentation and the teacher said they will also do it. But I don\u2019t know if the context will help her\u201d. There is a high percentage of Roma children in that school, which makes innovative pedagogies more challenging to implement. There were, however, certain barriers that hindered the mainstreaming innovations to other schools and regions. The transportation from one place to another is difficult due to financial constraints. The lack of funding prevented from overcoming these barriers. There is, also, a negative attitude towards the aforementioned (section 2.1.4) optional presentations in the Regional Directorate of Education of Central Greece, as the headteacher mentioned: \u201cPresentations are generally seen by colleagues in other schools as \u201cshowing off\u201d and bragging\u201d. Added to that, there is an impressively low turnout of teachers in the annual teachers\u2019 meetings in the county/region. The headteacher seems to be suggesting that this event is not compulsory enough in the teachers\u2019 consciousness. As far as transferability is concerned, the headteacher raises some issues: \u201eThe school that has undertaken this project consists of Roma students. I don\u2019t know whether this programme will be held there. It's difficult. There they must start from the hygiene. They should have other objectives.\u201d 3. Innovation in schools: lessons learned and policy pointers 3.1. Understanding the barriers: what hinders the school innovation process? The prescribed heavy load of teaching material and the examination system appears to put pressure on individual teachers towards a strict interpretation of the curriculum. There is a widespread idea among teachers that they should adhere to the exact material prescribed by the textbooks. Moving away from such an idea requires a headteacher and school counselor that supports progressive and innovative practices; this is the type of climate that allowed innovative practices to thrive in school 1 (teacher in School 1). During the Change Workshop 30 , the participants addressed the negative side of innovation in schools: in the sense that an introduction of an innovative practice/programme may create groups with different goals and rhythms and may divide teachers within the same school unit. The limited financial resources and support was reported by most participants as problematic. Certain material and financial support was only possible due to the headteachers\u2019 social connections and the interest of the local community in both towns (small shops, private sector). It required continuous effort and energy on the headteachers\u2019 part (Headteachers in both schools). Our own analysis of this point is that the personal effort required in order to secure financial support (by highly motivated headteachers such as those in schools 1 and 2) could possibly be channelled towards 30 The Greek Change workshop took place on 26.04.2017 in the main hall of School 1 in Thiva of Viotia County in Central Greece (Sterea Ellada). Apart from corroborating existing findings, the workshop had the goal of enhancing cooperation among participants and reaching to concrete suggestions about innovation application and mainstreaming at the systemic level. ",
        "other directions regarding the mainstreaming and sustainability of innovations: e.g. dissemination of innovations, mentoring and empowering other headteachers and teaching staff in the wider school area. The centralized character of educational governance in general and the top down approach to innovations in particular appeared to be a barrier that lead to a lack of flexibility of each school unit (representative from Ministry of Education, representative of parents\u2019 association). The lack of local differentiation of the curriculum is another related barrier (representative from Ministry of Education, Headteacher of School 2). The representatives of the Ministry of Education and the parents\u2019 association gave us an overall view at the systemic level which explained why innovative practices are implemented at a superficial level in many schools: a set of general guidelines on pedagogic practices (including innovations) are sent to schools that appear to have neither local nor practical relevance; also headteachers and teachers do not know how to implement at the school level as they do not have adequate training and support in the classrooms. According to the representative of parents\u2019 association it seems as if policymakers have a very limited knowledge of the actual problems faced by pupils and teachers every day at the school level. The Representatives of the Ministry of Education drew attention to the fact that innovations are highly depended on funded projects/programmes and are terminated once the programme is over. The attitudes of the teaching staff (teacher in School 1, both Headteachers), are not helpful for the application and mainstreaming of innovation. There is a strong resistance towards innovative practices among the older teaching staff that appears to be related to their initial education (representative from Ministry of Education, Headteacher of School 2). However, not all stakeholders agreed that resistance to innovation is a matter of age or teaching experience; in fact, workshop participants stressed that it is a matter of personality and worldview. Indeed, since the 1980s and especially in the last two decades, university departments of education have embraced research-based teaching and innovations as compared to Pedagogic Academies before 1980s that promoted a more traditional approach towards teaching. There appears to be a further problem in the teachers\u2019 attitudes: According to the teachers interviewed, there is a lack of self-confidence and no particular drive for professional self-development. Their professional identity is also rather unclear: teachers do not know what is required of them to do and whether innovation is part of their job (teachers in both schools). The representatives of the Ministry of Education have a complementary view: that there is no ongoing teachers\u2019 education that would provide teachers with a systematic support in their teaching. The headteacher in school 2 also adds that there is no bonus or penalty for those teachers who attend the meetings and presentations in the Regional Directorate; in that sense there is no professional motive for self -development apart from individual interest and conscientiousness. The workshop participants added that the lack of teachers\u2019 orientation and self-esteem also stems from poor planning: The teacher's mobility during the school year (teachers are appointed in September or later within the school year, specialisations such as IT teachers need to teach in different schools within the week) prevents the planning of the school and the adoption of innovations. An additional barrier identified in the workshop was that the openness to innovation is not addressed in the criteria for teacher and head teacher selection. The criteria for appointing teachers are purely academic: candidate teachers are asked to take part in written exams (Supreme Council for Civil Personnel Selection/ \u201cASEP\u201d exams, ASEP n.d.) with no connection between theory and educational practice. Successful candidates meet criteria of academic knowledge but there is no way of testing in advance their ability to apply it in the classroom. Another point that the workshop participants made is that the production of research and knowledge in universities is unrelated to school reality. At the same time, few participants pointed out the importance of theory and the fact that many teachers develop a resistance to theory. The participants added that there is a problem with the criteria for appointing head teachers and that certain important features ",
        "24 regarding the head teachers\u2019 culture, emotional intelligence and \u201cvision\u201d towards education are not addressed. A barrier in the first stages of innovation practices is their actual inception and design: there is a lack of research culture at the system level and within the school unit, to enhance systematic research and understanding of the current situation and the school units\u2019 needs (representatives from Ministry of Education, teachers in School 2). Our further analysis and interpretation is that the identity of \u201cteacher-as-researcher\u201d is not adequately promoted in initial teacher education (not all pedagogic departments place equal emphasis on this aspect) and further teacher education; thus, there seems to be no culture among Greek teachers of a research-based teaching. The workshop participants also stressed the fact that there is inadequate connection between theory and practice in initial teacher education. Additionally, there is insufficient dissemination of innovation (Headteacher of School 1) due to a lack of communication structures and processes. This is complemented by the aforementioned misconception that presenting one\u2019s work in front of colleagues is an indication of bragging and lack of camaraderie (headteachers and teachers of both schools). As the representatives of the Ministry of Education pointed out, the school counselor\u2019s role could be further enhanced by the Ministry, so as to provide more support to schools and teaching staff in terms of communication, empowering participants and training. As the participants in the Change Workshop point out, there are insufficient networks for the dissemination of innovation at a regional level. It is noteworthy that the innovations in Schools 1 and 2 where presented in other educational regions in Greece but not in their own region. It appears that there is a counter-motive in presenting one\u2019s (innovative) work in their local educational area in the sense that it may create tensions. A culture of \u201cavoidance of distinction\u201d appear to be in operation among teachers and head teachers. 31 The representative of parents\u2019 association stressed the fact that parents do not have a say in any innovation and policy change. Indeed, the role of the parents and the wider school community is minimal when it comes to official documents/guidelines and innovation design. Issues of parental involvement have become central in the Greek pedagogic scientific discourse only in the last decade and have not yet been incorporated in the (limited) continuous education/training of teachers. Hence teachers do not have any systematic support on how to cooperate with parents on any of their school practices. The point that parental involvement is insufficient in Greece was not corroborated in the Workshop; in fact, the head teachers mentioned that there is no need to involve parents further. At the same time, the delegates of parents\u2019 associations were the most silent members in all discussions. These observations enforce rather than weaken the observation that there is no culture of parental involvement in the Greek educational system (with the exception of early childhood education where some efforts have been made). A general comment of the representative of parents\u2019 association is that the practices which were presented by the Ministry of Education as innovations are not real innovations in practice; they sometimes create rather than solve problems (in order for an innovation to work, the rest of the school does not function properly) and are not followed by adequate, systematic support by the Ministry. The lack of regular evaluation, monitoring and teaching support mechanisms is seen by both headteachers of the two schools and representatives of the Ministry of Education as a general barrier in the Greek educational system. Even though self-evaluation of the school unit had been applied in 2013-14, it did not continue due the change in government in 2015 and the heavy criticism and resistance it received from teachers and teachers\u2019 unions. Even though a Major Programme for Continuous teacher education has 31 This observation is further enforced by the fact that the small-scale character of the Change Workshop initially raised some questions (which were later answered) about the exclusion of other schools/head teachers in the area. ",
        "been piloted and begun in 2010-11, it also received criticism and did not continue (http://www.epimorfosi.edu.gr/). In general, participants of each level underlined the barriers that involved their own level of action and interest. The teachers and headteachers focused mostly on school-level barriers and the stakeholders/policymakers focused on system-level barriers (type of governance, innovative practices programmes). We also need to point out that the barriers at the systemic level involved the innovations that derive centrally from the Ministry of Education. The innovations analysed in both case studies, however, are not centrally directed but they are coordinated by large private foundations and NGOs. 3.2. Spotting the supporters: what facilitates the school innovation process? There seems to be a common ground among participants in the field work that the headteacher of the school can make a difference and that s/he is responsible for the climate that is cultivated within the school unit (Headteachers and teachers of both schools, Representative of Ministry of Education, Representative of parents\u2019 association). This finding is further corroborated by our own observations of the teams during the focus groups. Teachers appeared empowered and inspired by their headteachers in both schools. The role of the school counselor can be empowering in promoting and disseminating innovations (Headteachers of both schools, representatives of Ministry of Education). S/he is the one who can work as an enabler of new things, as the one who would \u201callow\u201d teachers to overcome the strict limitations of the (central and single) school curriculum (teacher in school 1). (However, the formal role of the counselor has been downgraded in recent legislations). Additionally, the teaching staff make a difference and put the innovations forward (Headteachers of both schools, Representative of Ministry of Education). According to the headteacher in school 1, it is the teachers who have embraced innovations and each member of the teaching team has offered to implement them in their own creative way. The headteachers of both schools stressed the fact that they have chosen a governance model of the school based on trust, mutual empowerment and sharing: everyone knows about everything. They both embrace shared governance but there are clear rules and firm decision making on the part of the headteacher (Headteachers of both schools). The headteacher in school 2 tries to ease the teaching staff of heavy administrative work and carries out more administrative work by herself so as to let teachers focus solely on their teaching work. Parents\u2019 associations and parent boards of a larger scale appear to secure the application and (limited) financial support of school practices (representative of parents\u2019 association). The views of (head)/teachers and policymakers are complementary. While policymakers and the representative of parents\u2019 association focus on the barriers at the system-level that most schools face, the (head)/teachers in schools 1 and 2 stressed the enabling circumstances at the school level which make them the exception to the rule, i.e. how they became empowered and promoted innovation within the school unit, despite difficulties at the system level. E.g. even though the programme \u201cEla stin avli mas\u201d was terminated for school 1, this innovation is sustainable and there is constant search for further innovations due to the educational climate and teamwork of the teaching staff in this school. 3.3. Reflecting on the transferability of school innovations into the local contexts and their sustainability The innovations centrally proposed by the Ministry of Education lack sensitivity on the local circumstances and context of the region where each school unit is located. Representatives of the Ministry of Education and the members of staff in both school in ",
        "26 particular who are situated in a small town away from Athens and other bigger cities, underlined the problems of applying innovative practices from a distance. Attending seminars and getting feedback from members of the innovative practices programmes is a problem for schools of the Greek periphery (this was particularly the case for school 2). Representatives of the Ministry of Education stressed the fact that policymakers and legislators do not take into consideration that innovation (and the curriculum in general) cannot materialise in the same way everywhere. A general observation is that the pupil population in both schools come from socio- economically underprivileged backgrounds. However, the percentage of pupils from highly marginalised social groups (esp. Roma pupils in Sterea Ellada) in both schools is low. According to the headteachers from both schools, there appears to be a difficulty to deal with the \u201cother\u201d and incorporate innovative practices in schools with a high percentage of Roma children. The main barrier in the mainstreaming and sustainability of innovation is the termination of funding of specific programmes. Once the programmes are over, the innovation practices become stalled (representative from Ministry of Education). It requires a well- established climate that promotes innovation, supported by both the headteacher and the school counselor, in order to make innovations sustainable. Additionally, ongoing effort is required in the first years of establishing innovations to create a well-functioning team of teachers (Headteachers from both schools). These are pre-requirements regarding the human capital in order for innovation transferability to work. Neither school counselors, nor the headteachers or the teachers are well prepared and supported throughout an innovation practice. There is no systematic, large scale training of teachers and teacher trainers on innovation. This lack of support is reflected in the poor sustainability of innovative practices (Representative of Ministry of Education). 3.4. Policy pointers \uf0a7 Policy pointer 1: Decentralised governance with a sensitivity to the local context. (More flexibility of Regional Directorates and sub-regions, empowered role of school counselors. The design of a curriculum that would allow more flexibility and introduction of innovation that would take into account the local character of the region and needs of the particular social groups. Reduction of teaching material by 1/3). \uf0b7 Policy pointer 2: Research-based innovative practices that address real needs of the school system, community and unit. (The design of innovative practices needs to be based on the knowledge of the national educational system, on actual research and pilot studies and to address the pupils\u2019 learning needs and level. Timely administrative planning at a central (MoEd) and regional level). \uf0a7 Policy pointer 3: Regular teacher training and support of the teachers in the classrooms for the development and sustainability of innovation (organised by the school counsellors of the region, in collaboration with universities). Teacher training needs to be obligatory and has to embrace and promote innovation through adequate, systematic support in the classrooms. Each theoretical issue/theme/innovation should be followed by its application in the school/classroom. \uf0a7 Policy pointer 4: Upgrade of the role of the School Counselors. (To have an active role in the transfer of theoretical knowledge into practice, in the communication among schools, in organising teachers\u2019 training and support modelling innovative practices systematically in the classrooms. Each school counselor needs to have a clearer role as an expert but the local area of their responsibility needs to be narrowed down (less schools per counselor). An interdisciplinary committee consisting of school counsellors and other experts (psychologists, educationalists, economists etc.) needs to be formed in order to provide better support to each school unit). ",
        "\uf0a7 Policy pointer 5: Cooperation with Universities and research centres. (In terms of initial and continuous teacher training and in-service teaching practice). \uf0a7 Policy pointer 6: Empowerment and training of headteachers. The state/MoEd needs to reconsider the criteria for the selection of head teachers: they should have administrative, leadership and pedagogical skills. Leaders need to be empowered and trained systematically by the state (responsibility of the MoEd). A Network of head teachers would be helpful. \uf0a7 Policy pointer 7 : Establish platforms of communication and dissemination of innovation at the level of the Regional Directorate. (Enable communication among schools on a practical level within the region with the counselor having a key role). \uf0a7 Policy pointer 8: Re-address teachers\u2019 attitudes regarding their role and empowerment regarding their professional identity. (Approach innovation as central in teachers\u2019 job description and identity. Work towards changing attitudes concerning presentation and sharing one\u2019s work. Provide teachers with clear professional motivation, financial incentives in order to attend workshops, engage in innovative programmes, present their work etc., with adequate support regarding teaching practice but also firm theoretical background through regular training).
