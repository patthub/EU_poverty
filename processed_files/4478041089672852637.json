        "T R A I N I N G NEW SKILLS ITALY Italy is supporting job creation in its many successful SMEs by giving work- ers the skills they need to improve competitiveness and boost export- led performance. ESF funding is also focusing on helping more women and people from disadvantaged groups into work, while building stronger entrepreneurial links between univer- sities, graduate students and industry. THE ESF IN ITALY: SOME EXAMPLES Bright ideas take off In Umbria, the \u2018Ideas\u2019 project launched by the regional research agency gave promising young entrepreneurs a fl ying start. Potential businessmen and women with bright ideas for innovative products and services were able to spend six months in successful companies in France, Spain, Denmark and Sweden, among other countries. The purpose was to give them fi rst-hand experience of good practice in innovation and entrepreneurship and then to bring this knowledge back to Umbria. The expertise gained covered a wide range of sectors, such as pharmaceuticals and tourism. Holding fast to young people To support Italy\u2019s world-beating musical tradition and culture, the Pergolese Spontini Foundation launched the \u2018Sipario\u2019 project to train people for jobs in the performing arts of music and theatre. Thirteen vocational training courses, covering skills such as singing, dance and orchestral conducting, were provided to over 150 young people from across Europe. Backstage skills, such as costume design, lighting and scenography, were also covered, and a(cid:3) er taking part in musical productions, many of the participants were helped to fi nd jobs in the creative sector in Italy.

        "M I C R O - F I N A N C E NET WOR KING At the core of Italy\u2019s economic policy is the intention to increase the competitiveness and productivity of its workforce. To achieve this, Italy needs to improve workers skills such that they can benefi t from the move to more pro- ductive and innovation-led industrial sectors. For this, the school and university system needs strengthening and must off er the training and skills people require to fi nd better jobs. As part of this eff ort, Italy aims to reduce its school drop-out rate to less than 16 % and increase the number of young people with tertiary qualifi cations to 40 % by 2020. Better R&D performance and well-qualifi ed graduates are needed to support the many Italian SMEs which \u2013 although generally strong export- ers \u2013 they o(cid:3) en lack the technical and man- agement skills to grow and create more jobs. Italy also needs to get more young people into work \u2013 especially in the south of the country which lags in jobs and skills compared to the north. To remove other bottlenecks to economic growth, it must also help more women and older workers into jobs \u2013 with training and other measures \u2013 as part of a move towards more inclusive labour markets. By 2020, Italy aims to have 2.2 million fewer people in the at-risk-of- poverty group, and training and skills accompa- nied by help in overcoming obstacles to work are integral to achieving this target. ESF spending in Italy For 2007-2013, Italy is receiving EUR 6.9 bil- lion in ESF funding. With national co-funding, this brings the total ESF spending on jobs to EUR 15.3 billion, the second highest in Europe. Italian ESF programmes are target- ing the adaptability of companies and work- ers, the education, training and employability of individuals at all levels, and improving social inclusion of vulnerable groups. There are also programmes for transnational employment projects and for enhancing pub- lic administration in the south of the country. INVESTING IN PEOPLE AND JOBS: THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ITALY More adaptable and employable workers In the Italian regions, the ESF is supporting a wide range of projects to protect jobs and help the unemployed back to work \u2013 indeed, close to 2 million people have already participated in such activities. An example is Piedmont\u2019s employment initiative which is supporting jobs for young people and adults through in-house training and apprenticeships \u2013 with a focus on female employment. Elsewhere, projects are helping more women get jobs through wage support for employ- ers and activities to help balance work and home commitments \u2013 such as with childcare facilities and fl exible work arrangements. One example is the childcare voucher system for working parents in the Emilia-Romagna region. Immigrants who need the language and citizenship skills to get jobs are another focus of ESF activities, such as the training courses in professional restaurant and hotel skills off ered in Turin to improve their job prospects and help them integrate into Italian society. And the northern South Tyrol region is helping its mountain communities with projects to build sustainable commu nities and employment and help more women into higher education \u2013 aimed at reversing the emigration of its qualifi ed citizens. Linking learning and labour Many projects are addressing the transition from the world of education and training into the workplace by promoting skills develop- ment and partnerships with companies in vocational training activities. For example, wide-scale projects run by the Ministry of Education are providing thousands of stu- dents in southern regions with opportunities for traineeships in companies and language training. Constant monitoring of skills gaps in Italy\u2019s regions and economic sectors is driv- ing projects for work placements and train- ing where they are needed most. A project for improving the professionalism, market- ing skills and language abilities of tourist guides in the Liguria region is one example of this, while training for 500 additional cruise- operator staff to crew new Italian-built cruise ships is another. Many projects are boosting university edu- cation and links to industry. For example, EUR 46 million in subsidies is available to companies and research centres in Sicily for postgraduate studies, industrial R&D and internships \u2013 designed to boost the region\u2019s innovation performance and retain its young talent. And Tuscany is using ESF funding to send its postgraduate students for aca- demic courses and internships in Silicon Valley in California \u2013 with the aim of building vital innovation and technology skills in the Tuscan region. Another example is training in renewable energy systems for graduates in the Ascoli Piceno region that supports job creation and the region\u2019s SME expertise in photovoltaic-system manufacturing.
