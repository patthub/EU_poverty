        "I (Acts adopted under the EC Treaty/Euratom Treaty whose publication is obligatory) REGULATIONS REGULATION (EC) No 450/2008 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 23 April 2008 laying down the Community Customs Code (Modernised Customs Code) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EURO- PEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Commu- nity, and in particular Articles 26, 95, 133 and 135 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 2 ), Whereas: (1) The Community is based upon a customs union. It is advis- able, in the interests both of economic operators and of the customs authorities in the Community, to assemble cur- rent customs legislation in a Community Customs Code (hereinafter referred to as the Code). Based on the concept of an internal market, the Code should contain the general rules and procedures which ensure the implementation of the tariff and other common policy measures introduced at Community level in connection with trade in goods between the Community and countries or territories out- side the customs territory of the Community, taking into account the requirements of those common policies. Cus- toms legislation should be better aligned on the provisions relating to the collection of import charges without change to the scope of the tax provisions in force. (2) In accordance with the Communication from the Commis- sion concerning the protection of the Community\u2019s finan- cial interests and the Action Plan for 2004-2005, it is appropriate to adapt the legal framework for the protec- tion of the financial interests of the Community. (3) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code ( 3 ) was based upon integration of the customs procedures applied sepa- rately in the respective Member States during the 1980s. That Regulation has been repeatedly and substantially amended since its introduction, in order to address specific problems such as the protection of good faith or the tak- ing into account of security requirements. Further amend- ments to the Code are necessary as a consequence of the important legal changes which have occurred in recent years, at both Community and international level, such as the expiry of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community and the entry into force of the 2003 and 2005 Acts of Accession, as well as the Amendment to the International Convention on the simplification and harmonisation of customs procedures (hereinafter referred to as the revised Kyoto Convention), the accession of the Community to which was approved by Council Decision 2003/231/EC ( 4 ). The time has now come to streamline customs procedures and to take into account the fact that electronic declarations and processing are the rule and paper-based declarations and processing the exception. For all of these reasons, further amendment of the present Code is not sufficient and a complete overhaul is necessary. ( 1 ) OJ C 309, 16.12.2006, p. 22.

        "(4) It is appropriate to introduce in the Code a legal frame- work for the application of certain provisions of the cus- toms legislation to trade in goods between parts of the customs territory to which the provisions of Council Direc- tive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax ( 1 ) apply and parts of that terri- tory where those provisions do not apply, or to trade between parts where those provisions do not apply. Con- sidering the fact that the goods concerned are Community goods and the fiscal nature of the measures at stake in this intra-Community trade, it is justifiable to introduce, through implementing measures, appropriate simplifica- tions to the customs formalities to be applied to those goods. (5) The facilitation of legitimate trade and the fight against fraud require simple, rapid and standard customs proce- dures and processes. It is therefore appropriate, in line with the Communication from the Commission on a simple and paperless environment for customs and trade, to sim- plify customs legislation, to allow the use of modern tools and technology and to promote further the uniform appli- cation of customs legislation and modernised approaches to customs control, thus helping to ensure the basis for efficient and simple clearance procedures. Customs proce- dures should be merged or aligned and the number of pro- cedures reduced to those that are economically justified, with a view to increasing the competitiveness of business. (6) The completion of the internal market, the reduction of barriers to international trade and investment and the rein- forced need to ensure security and safety at the external borders of the Community have transformed the role of customs authorities giving them a leading role within the supply chain and, in their monitoring and management of international trade, making them a catalyst to the competi- tiveness of countries and companies. Customs legislation should therefore reflect the new economic reality and the new role and mission of customs authorities. (7) The use of information and communication technologies, as laid down in the future Decision of the European Par- liament and of the Council on a paperless environment for customs and trade, is a key element in ensuring trade facili- tation and, at the same time, the effectiveness of customs controls, thus reducing costs for business and risk for soci- ety. It is therefore necessary to establish in the Code the legal framework within which that Decision can be imple- mented, in particular the legal principle that all customs and trade transactions are to be handled electronically and that information and communication systems for customs operations are to offer, in each Member State, the same facilities to economic operators. (8) Such use of information and communication technologies should be accompanied by harmonised and standardised application of customs controls by the Member States, to ensure an equivalent level of customs control throughout the Community so as not to give rise to anti-competitive behaviour at the various Community entry and exit points. (9) In the interests of facilitating business, while at the same time providing for the proper levels of control of goods brought into or out of the customs territory of the Com- munity, it is desirable that the information provided by economic operators be shared, taking account of the rel- evant data-protection provisions, between customs authorities and with other agencies involved in that con- trol, such as police, border guards, veterinary and environ- mental authorities, and that controls by the various authorities be harmonised, so that the economic operator need give the information only once and that goods are controlled by those authorities at the same time and at the same place. (10) In the interests of facilitating certain types of business, all persons should continue to have the right to appoint a rep- resentative in their dealings with the customs authorities. However, it should no longer be possible for that right of representation to be reserved under a law laid down by one of the Member States. Furthermore, a customs representa- tive who complies with the criteria for the granting of the status of authorised economic operator, should be entitled to provide his services in a Member State other than the one where he is established. (11) Compliant and trustworthy economic operators should, as \u2018authorised economic operators\u2019, be able to take maximum advantage of widespread use of simplification and, taking account of security and safety aspects, benefit from reduced levels of customs control. They may thus enjoy the status of \u2018customs simplification\u2019 authorised economic operator or the status of \u2018security and safety\u2019 authorised economic operator. They may be granted one or other status, or both together. (12) All decisions, that is to say, official acts by the customs authorities pertaining to customs legislation and having legal effect on one or more persons, including binding information issued by those authorities, should be covered by the same rules. Any such decisions should be valid throughout the Community and should be capable of being annulled, amended except where otherwise stipu- lated, or revoked where they do not conform to the cus- toms legislation or its interpretation. (13) In accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, it is necessary, in addition to the right of appeal against any decision taken by the customs authorities, to provide for the right of every person to be heard before any decision is taken which would adversely affect him. (14) The streamlining of customs procedures within an elec- tronic environment requires the sharing of responsibilities between the customs authorities of different Member States. It is necessary to ensure an appropriate level of effective, dissuasive and proportionate sanctions through- out the internal market. ( 1 ) OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1.

        "(15) In order to secure a balance between, on the one hand, the need for customs authorities to ensure the correct applica- tion of customs legislation and, on the other, the right of economic operators to be treated fairly, the customs authorities should be granted extensive powers of control and economic operators a right of appeal. (16) In order to minimise the risk to the Community, its citi- zens and its trading partners, the harmonised application of customs controls by the Member States should be based upon a common risk management framework and an elec- tronic system for its implementation. The establishment of a risk management framework common to all Member States should not prevent them from controlling goods by random checks. (17) It is necessary to establish the factors on the basis of which import or export duties and other measures in respect of trade in goods are applied. It is also appropriate to lay down clear provisions for issuing proofs of origin in the Community, where the exigencies of trade so require. (18) It is desirable to group together all cases of incurrence of a customs debt on importation, other than following the submission of a customs declaration for release for free cir- culation or temporary admission with partial relief, in order to avoid difficulties in determining the legal basis on which the customs debt was incurred. The same should apply in cases of incurrence of a customs debt on exportation. (19) Since the new role of customs authorities implies the shar- ing of responsibilities and cooperation between inland and border customs offices, the customs debt should, in most cases, be incurred at the place where the debtor is estab- lished, as the customs office competent for that place can best supervise the activities of the person concerned. (20) Furthermore, in line with the revised Kyoto Convention, it is appropriate to provide for a reduced number of cases where administrative cooperation between Member States is required in order to establish the place where the cus- toms debt was incurred and to recover the duties. (21) The rules for special procedures should allow for the use of a single guarantee for all categories of special procedures and for that guarantee to be comprehensive, covering a number of transactions. (22) In order to ensure better protection of the financial inter- ests of the Community and of the Member States, a guar- antee should cover non-declared or incorrectly declared goods included in a consignment or in a declaration for which it is provided. For the same reason, the undertaking of the guarantor should also cover amounts of import or export duty which fall to be paid following post-release controls. (23) In order to safeguard the financial interests of the Commu- nity and of the Member States and to curb fraudulent prac- tices, arrangements involving graduated measures for the application of a comprehensive guarantee are advisable. Where there is an increased risk of fraud it should be pos- sible to prohibit temporarily the application of the com- prehensive guarantee, taking account of the particular situation of the economic operators concerned. (24) It is appropriate to take account of the good faith of the person concerned in cases where a customs debt is incurred through non-compliance with customs legislation and to minimise the impact of negligence on the part of the debtor. (25) It is necessary to lay down the principle of how to deter- mine the status of Community goods and the circum- stances pertaining to the loss of such status, and to provide a basis for determining when that status remains unaltered in cases where goods temporarily leave the customs terri- tory of the Community. (26) It is appropriate, where an economic operator has pro- vided, in advance, the information necessary for risk-based controls on the admissibility of the goods, to ensure that quick release of goods is then the rule. Fiscal and trade policy controls should primarily be performed by the cus- toms office competent in respect of the premises of the economic operator. (27) The rules for customs declarations and for the placing of goods under a customs procedure should be modernised and streamlined, in particular by requiring that customs declarations be, as a rule, made electronically and provid- ing for only one type of simplified declaration. (28) Since the revised Kyoto Convention favours the lodging, registering and checking of the customs declaration prior to the arrival of the goods and, furthermore, the dissocia- tion of the place where the declaration is lodged from the place where the goods are physically located, it is appro- priate to provide for centralised clearance at the place where the economic operator is established. Centralised clearance should include the facility for the use of simpli- fied declarations, deferment of the date of the submission of a complete declaration and required documents, peri- odic declaration and deferred payment. (29) In order to help to ensure neutral conditions for competi- tion throughout the Community, it is appropriate to lay down at Community level the rules governing the destruc- tion or disposal otherwise of goods by the customs authori- ties, these being matters which have previously required national legislation. (30) It is appropriate to lay down common and simple rules for the special procedures (transit, storage, specific use and processing), supplemented by a small set of rules for each category of special procedure, in order to make it simple for the operator to choose the right procedure, to avoid errors and to reduce the number of post-release recoveries and repayments. 4.6.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 145/3 ",
        "(31) The granting of authorisations for several special proce- dures with a single guarantee and a single supervising cus- toms office should be facilitated and there should be simple rules on the incurrence of a customs debt in these cases. The basic principle should be that goods placed under a special procedure, or the products made from them, are to be assessed at the time when the customs debt is incurred. However, it should also be possible, where economically justified, to assess the goods at the time when they were placed under a special procedure. The same principles should apply to usual forms of handling. (32) In view of the increased security-related measures intro- duced into the Code under Regulation (EC) No 648/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 April 2005 amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code ( 1 ), the placing of goods into free zones should become a customs proce- dure and the goods should be subject to customs controls at entry and with regard to records. (33) Given that the intention of re-exportation is no longer nec- essary, the inward processing suspension procedure should be merged with processing under customs control and the inward processing drawback procedure abandoned. This single inward-processing procedure should also cover destruction, except where destruction is carried out by, or under the supervision of, customs. (34) Security-related measures relating to Community goods brought out of the customs territory of the Community should apply equally to the re-export of non-Community goods. The same basic rules should apply to all types of goods, with the possibility of exceptions where necessary, such as for goods only transiting through the customs ter- ritory of the Community. (35) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedure for the exercise of implementing powers con- ferred on the Commission ( 2 ). (36) It is appropriate to provide for the adoption of measures implementing this Code. These measures should be adopted in accordance with the management and regula- tory procedures provided for in Articles 4 and 5 of Deci- sion 1999/468/EC. (37) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to define the conditions and criteria necessary for the effec- tive application of this Code. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential ele- ments of this Regulation or to supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC. (38) It is appropriate, in order to ensure an effective decision- making process, to examine questions relating to the preparation of a position to be taken by the Community in committees, working groups and panels established by or under international agreements dealing with customs legislation. (39) In order to simplify and rationalise customs legislation, a number of provisions presently contained in autonomous Community acts have, for the sake of transparency, been incorporated into the Code. The following Regulations, together with Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92, should therefore be repealed: Council Regulation (EEC) No 3925/91 of 19 December 1991 concerning the elimination of controls and formali- ties applicable to the cabin and hold baggage of persons taking an intra-Community flight and the baggage of per- sons making an intra-Community sea crossing ( 3 ) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1207/2001 of 11 June 2001 on procedures to facilitate the issue or the making out in the Community of proofs of origin and the issue of certain approved exporter authorisations under the provisions governing preferential trade between the European Com- munity and certain countries ( 4 ). (40) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely, to lay down rules and procedures applicable to goods brought into or out of the customs territory of the Community in order to enable the Customs Union to function effectively as a cen- tral pillar of the internal market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: ( 1 ) OJ L 117, 4.5.2005, p. 13.

Any person directly or indirectly involved in the accom- plishment of customs formalities or in customs controls shall, at the request of the customs authorities and within any time limit specified, provide those authorities with all the requisite docu- ments and information, in an appropriate form, and all the assis- tance necessary for the completion of those formalities or controls. 2. The lodging of a summary declaration or customs declara- tion, or notification, or the submission of an application for an authorisation or any other decision, shall render the person con- cerned responsible for the following: (a) the accuracy and completeness of the information given in the declaration, notification or application; (b) the authenticity of any documents lodged or made available; (c) where applicable, compliance with all of the obligations relat- ing to the placing of the goods in question under the customs procedure concerned, or to the conduct of the authorised operations.

Section 2 Customs representation Article 11 Customs representative 1. Any person may appoint a customs representative. Such representation may be either direct, in which case the cus- toms representative shall act in the name of and on behalf of another person, or indirect, in which case the customs represen- tative shall act in his own name but on behalf of another person. A customs representative shall be established within the customs territory of the Community. 2. Member States may define, in accordance with Community law, the conditions under which a customs representative may provide services in the Member State where he is established. However, without prejudice to the application of less stringent criteria by the Member State concerned, a customs representative who complies with the criteria laid down in Article 14(a) to (d) shall be entitled to provide such services in a Member State other than the one where he is established. 4.6.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 145/11 ",

Article 12 Empowerment 1. When dealing with the customs authorities, a customs rep- resentative shall state that he is acting on behalf of the person rep- resented and specify whether the representation is direct or indirect. A person who fails to state that he is acting as a customs repre- sentative or who states that he is acting as a customs representa- tive without being empowered to do so shall be deemed to be acting in his own name and on his own behalf. 2. The customs authorities may require any person stating that he is acting as a customs representative to produce evidence of his empowerment by the person represented. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down derogations from the first subparagraph, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). Section 3 Authorised economic operator Article 13 Application and authorisation 1. An economic operator who is established in the customs territory of the Community and who meets the conditions set out in Articles 14 and 15 may request the status of authorised eco- nomic operator. The customs authorities shall, if necessary following consultation with other competent authorities, grant that status, which shall be subject to monitoring. 2. The status of authorised economic operator shall consist in two types of authorisations: that of a \u2018customs simplification\u2019 authorised economic operator and that of a \u2018security and safety\u2019 authorised economic operator. The first type of authorisation shall enable economic operators to benefit from certain simplifications in accordance with the cus- toms legislation. Under the second type of authorisation the holder thereof shall be entitled to facilitations relating to security and safety. Both types of authorisations may be held at the same time. 3. The status of authorised economic operator shall, subject to Articles 14 and 15, be recognised by the customs authorities in all Member States, without prejudice to customs controls. 4. Customs authorities shall, on the basis of the recognition of the status of authorised economic operator and provided that the requirements related to a specific type of simplification provided for in the customs legislation are fulfilled, authorise the operator to benefit from that simplification. 5. The status of authorised economic operator may be sus- pended or revoked in accordance with the conditions laid down pursuant to Article 15(1)(g). 6. The authorised economic operator shall notify the customs authorities of all factors arising after that status was granted which may influence its continuation or content. Article 14 Granting of status The criteria for the granting of the status of authorised economic operator shall be the following: (a) a record of compliance with customs and tax requirements; (b) a satisfactory system of managing commercial and, where appropriate, transport records, which allows appropriate cus- toms controls; (c) proven solvency; (d) pursuant to Article 13(2), in cases where an authorised eco- nomic operator wishes to take advantage of the simplifica- tions provided for in accordance with the customs legislation, practical standards of competence or professional qualifica- tions directly related to the activity carried out; (e) pursuant to Article 13(2), in cases where an authorised eco- nomic operator wishes to take advantage of facilitations with regard to customs controls relating to security and safety, appropriate security and safety standards. Article 15 Implementing measures 1. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down rules in respect of the following: (a) the granting of the status of authorised economic operator; L 145/12 EN Official Journal of the European Union 4.6.2008 ",

Before taking a decision which would adversely affect the person or persons to whom it is addressed, the customs authori- ties shall communicate the grounds on which they intend to base their decision to the person or persons concerned, who shall be given the opportunity to express their point of view within a period prescribed from the date on which the communication was made. Following the expiry of that period, the person concerned shall be notified, in the appropriate form, of the decision, which shall set out the grounds on which it is based.

The customs authorities shall, however, suspend implemen- tation of such a decision in whole or in part where they have good reason to believe that the disputed decision is inconsistent with customs legislation or that irreparable damage is to be feared for the person concerned. 3. In the cases referred to in paragraph 2, where the disputed decision has the effect of causing import duties or export duties to be payable, suspension of that decision shall be conditional upon the provision of a guarantee, unless it is established, on the basis of a documented assessment, that such a guarantee would be likely to cause the debtor serious economic or social difficulties. The Commission may, in accordance with the regulatory proce- dure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures for the imple- mentation of the first subparagraph of this paragraph. Section 7 Control of goods Article 25 Customs controls 1. The customs authorities may carry out all the customs con- trols they deem necessary. Customs controls may in particular consist of examining goods, taking samples, verifying declaration data and the existence and authenticity of documents, examining the accounts of economic operators and other records, inspecting means of transport, inspecting luggage and other goods carried by or on persons and carrying out official enquiries and other similar acts. 2. Customs controls, other than random checks, shall prima- rily be based on risk analysis using electronic data-processing techniques, with the purpose of identifying and evaluating the risks and developing the necessary counter-measures, on the basis of criteria developed at national, Community and, where avail- able, international level. Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, shall develop, maintain and employ a common risk management framework, based upon the exchange of risk information and analysis between customs administrations and establishing, inter alia, common risk evaluation criteria, control measures and pri- ority control areas. Controls based upon such information and criteria shall be car- ried out without prejudice to other controls carried out in accor- dance with paragraphs 1 and 2 or with other provisions in force. 3. The Commission, without prejudice to paragraph 2 of this Article, shall, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt implementing measures laying down the following: (a) common risk management framework; (b) common criteria and priority control areas; (c) the risk information and analysis to be exchanged between customs administrations. Article 26 Cooperation between authorities 1. Where, in respect of the same goods, controls other than customs controls are to be performed by competent authorities other than the customs authorities, customs authorities shall, in close cooperation with those other authorities, endeavour to have those controls performed, wherever possible, at the same time and place as customs controls (one-stop-shop), with customs authorities having the coordinating role in achieving this. 2. In the framework of the controls referred to in this Section, customs and other competent authorities may, where necessary for the purposes of minimising risk and combating fraud, exchange with each other and with the Commission data received in the context of the entry, exit, transit, transfer, storage and end- use of goods, including postal traffic, moved between the customs territory of the Community and other territories, the presence and movement within the customs territory of non-Community goods and goods placed under the end-use procedure, and the results of any control. Customs authorities and the Commission may also exchange such data with each other for the purpose of ensuring a uniform application of Community customs legislation. Article 27 Post-release control The customs authorities may, after releasing the goods and in order to ascertain the accuracy of the particulars contained in the summary or customs declaration, inspect any documents and data relating to the operations in respect of the goods in question or to prior or subsequent commercial operations involving those goods. Those authorities may also examine such goods and/or take samples where it is still possible for them to do so. Such inspections may be carried out at the premises of the holder of the goods or his representative, of any other person directly or indirectly involved in those operations in a business capacity or of any other person in possession of those documents and data for business purposes.

Paragraph 1 shall apply without prejudice to either of the following: (a) security and safety checks; (b) checks linked to prohibitions or restrictions. 3. The Commission shall, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures for the implementation of this Article, laying down the cases in which and the conditions under which customs controls and formalities may be applied to the following: (a) the cabin and hold baggage of the following: (i) persons taking a flight in an aircraft which comes from a non-Community airport and which, after a stopover at a Community airport, continues to another Community airport; (ii) persons taking a flight in an aircraft which stops over at a Community airport before continuing to a non- Community airport; (iii) persons using a maritime service provided by the same vessel and comprising successive legs departing from, calling at or terminating in a non-Community port; (iv) persons on board pleasure craft and tourist or business aircraft; (b) cabin and hold baggage: (i) arriving at a Community airport on board an aircraft coming from a non-Community airport and transferred at that Community airport to another aircraft proceed- ing on an intra-Community flight; (ii) loaded at a Community airport onto an aircraft proceed- ing on an intra-Community flight for transfer at another Community airport to an aircraft whose destination is a non-Community airport. Section 8 Keeping of documents and other information; charges and costs Article 29 Keeping of documents and other information 1. The person concerned shall, for the purposes of customs controls, keep the documents and information referred to in Article 9(1) for at least three calendar years, by any means acces- sible by and acceptable to the customs authorities. In the case of goods released for free circulation in circumstances other than those referred to in the third subparagraph, or goods declared for export, that period shall run from the end of the year in which the customs declarations for release for free circulation or export are accepted. In the case of goods released for free circulation duty-free or at a reduced rate of import duty on account of their end-use, that period shall run from the end of the year in which they cease to be subject to customs supervision. In the case of goods placed under another customs procedure, that period shall run from the end of the year in which the cus- toms procedure concerned has ended. 2. Without prejudice to Article 68(4), where a customs con- trol in respect of a customs debt shows that the relevant entry in the accounts has to be corrected and the person concerned has been notified of this, the documents and information shall be kept for three years beyond the time limit provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article. Where an appeal has been lodged or where court proceedings have begun, the documents and information must be kept for the period provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article or until the appeals procedure or court proceedings are terminated, which- ever is the later. Article 30 Charges and costs 1. Customs authorities shall not impose charges for the per- formance of customs controls or any other application of the cus- toms legislation during the official opening hours of their competent customs offices. However, the customs authorities may impose charges or recover costs where specific services are rendered, in particular the following: (a) attendance, where requested, by customs staff outside offi- cial office hours or at premises other than customs premises; 4.6.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 145/17 ",

The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down measures for the implementation of the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). CHAPTER 3 Currency conversion and time limits Article 31 Currency conversion 1. The competent authorities shall publish, and/or make avail- able on the Internet, the rate of exchange applicable where the conversion of currency is necessary for one of the following reasons: (a) because factors used to determine the customs value of goods are expressed in a currency other than that of the Member State where the customs value is determined; (b) because the value of the euro is required in national curren- cies for the purposes of determining the tariff classification of goods and the amount of import and export duty, including value thresholds in the Community Customs Tariff. 2. Where the conversion of currency is necessary for reasons other than those referred to in paragraph 1, the value of the euro in national currencies to be applied within the framework of the customs legislation shall be fixed at least once a year. 3. The Commission shall, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures for the implementation of this Article. Article 32 Time limits 1. Where a period, date or time limit is laid down in the cus- toms legislation, such period shall not be extended or reduced and such date or time limit shall not be deferred or brought forward unless specific provision is made in the provisions concerned. 2. The rules applicable to periods, dates and time limits set out in Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time limits ( 1 ) shall apply, except where otherwise specifically provided for in Community customs legislation.

Where the goods concerned fulfil the conditions included in the measures laid down in points (d) to (g) of paragraph 2, the measures referred to in those provisions shall apply, at the request of the declarant, instead of those provided for in point (c) of that paragraph. Such application may be made retrospectively, pro- vided that the time limits and conditions laid down in the relevant measure or in the Code are complied with. 4. Where application of the measures referred to in points (d) to (g) of paragraph 2, or the exemption from measures referred to in point (h) thereof, is restricted to a certain volume of imports or exports, such application or exemption shall, in the case of tar- iff quotas, cease as soon as the specified volume of imports or exports is reached. In the case of tariff ceilings such application shall cease by virtue of a legal act of the Community. 5. The Commission shall, in accordance with the management procedure referred to in Article 184(3), adopt measures for the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article. Article 34 Tariff classification of goods 1.

For the application of non-tariff measures, \u2018tariff classifica- tion\u2019 of goods shall consist in the determination of one of the sub- headings or further subdivisions of the Combined Nomenclature, or of any other nomenclature which is established by Commu- nity provisions and which is wholly or partly based on the Com- bined Nomenclature or which provides for further subdivisions to it, under which those goods are to be classified. 3. The subheading or further subdivision determined in accor- dance with paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be used for the purpose of applying the measures linked to that subheading. CHAPTER 2 Origin of goods Section 1 Non-preferential origin Article 35 Scope Articles 36, 37 and 38 lay down rules for the determination of the non-preferential origin of goods for the purposes of applying the following: (a) the Common Customs Tariff with the exception of the mea- sures referred to in Article 33(2)(d) and (e); (b) measures, other than tariff measures, established by Commu- nity provisions governing specific fields relating to trade in goods; (c) other Community measures relating to the origin of goods. Article 36 Acquisition of origin 1. Goods wholly obtained in a single country or territory shall be regarded as having their origin in that country or territory. 2. Goods the production of which involved more than one country or territory shall be deemed to originate in the country or territory where they underwent their last substantial transformation. Article 37 Proof of origin 1. Where an origin has been indicated in the customs declara- tion pursuant to customs legislation, the customs authorities may require the declarant to prove the origin of the goods. 2. Where proof of origin of goods is provided pursuant to cus- toms legislation or other Community legislation governing spe- cific fields, the customs authorities may, in the event of reasonable doubt, require any additional evidence needed in order to ensure that the indication of origin does comply with the rules laid down by the relevant Community legislation. 3. A document proving origin may be issued in the Commu- nity where the exigencies of trade so require.

CHAPTER 3 Value of goods for customs purposes Article 40 Scope The customs value of goods, for the purposes of applying the Common Customs Tariff and non-tariff measures laid down by Community provisions governing specific fields relating to trade in goods, shall be determined in accordance with Articles 41 to 43. Article 41 Method of customs valuation based on the transaction value 1. The primary basis for the customs value of goods shall be the transaction value, that is the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the customs territory of the Community, adjusted, where necessary, in accordance with mea- sures adopted pursuant to Article 43. 2. The price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the buyer to the seller or by the buyer to a third party for the benefit of the seller for the imported goods and includes all payments made or to be made as a condition of sale of the imported goods. 3. The transaction value shall apply provided that the follow- ing conditions are satisfied: (a) there are no restrictions as to the disposal or use of the goods by the buyer, other than any of the following: (i) restrictions imposed or required by a law or by the pub- lic authorities in the Community; (ii) limitations of the geographical area in which the goods may be resold; (iii) restrictions which do not substantially affect the customs value of the goods; (b) the sale or price is not subject to some condition or consid- eration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the goods being valued; (c) no part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of the goods by the buyer will accrue directly or indirectly to the seller, unless an appropriate adjustment can be made in accordance with measures adopted pursuant to Article 43; (d) the buyer and seller are not related or the relationship did not influence the price. Article 42 Secondary methods of customs valuation 1. Where the customs value of goods cannot be determined under Article 41, it shall be determined by proceeding sequen- tially from point (a) to paragraph 2(d) of this Article, until the first point under which the customs value of goods can be determined. The order of application of points (c) and (d) shall be reversed if the declarant so requests. 2. The customs value, pursuant to paragraph 1, shall be: (a) the transaction value of identical goods sold for export to the customs territory of the Community and exported at or about the same time as the goods being valued; (b) the transaction value of similar goods sold for export to the customs territory of the Community and exported at or about the same time as the goods being valued; (c) the value based on the unit price at which the imported goods, or identical or similar imported goods, are sold within the customs territory of the Community in the greatest aggre- gate quantity to persons not related to the sellers; (d) the computed value.

Where the customs value cannot be determined under para- graph 1, it shall be determined, on the basis of data available in the customs territory on the Community, using reasonable means consistent with the principles and general provisions of the following: (a) the agreement on implementation of Article VII of the Gen- eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; (b) Article VII of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; (c) this chapter. Article 43 Implementing measures The Commission shall, in accordance with the regulatory proce- dure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt the measures laying down the following: (a) the elements which, for the purposes of determining the cus- toms value, must be added to the price actually paid or pay- able, or which may be excluded; (b) elements which are to be used to determine the computed value; (c) the method of determination of the customs value in specific cases, and with regard to goods for which a customs debt is incurred after the use of a special procedure; (d) any further conditions, provisions and rules necessary for the application of Articles 41 and 42.

A customs debt shall be incurred at the time of acceptance of the customs declaration. 3. The declarant shall be the debtor. In the event of indirect representation, the person on whose behalf the customs declara- tion is made shall also be a debtor. Where a customs declaration in respect of one of the procedures referred to in paragraph 1 is drawn up on the basis of informa- tion which leads to all or part of the import duties not being col- lected, the person who provided the information required to draw up the declaration and who knew, or who ought reasonably to have known, that such information was false shall also be a debtor. Article 45 Special provisions relating to non-originating goods 1. Where a prohibition of drawback of, or exemption from, import duties applies to non-originating goods used in the manu- facture of products for which a proof of origin is issued or made out in the framework of a preferential arrangement between the Community and certain countries or territories outside the cus- toms territory of the Community or groups of such countries or territories, a customs debt on importation shall be incurred in respect of those non-originating goods, through the acceptance of the re-export notification relating to the products in question. 2. Where a customs debt is incurred pursuant to paragraph 1, the amount of import duty corresponding to that debt shall be determined under the same conditions as in the case of a customs debt resulting from the acceptance, on the same date, of the cus- toms declaration for release for free circulation of the non- originating goods used in the manufacture of the products in question for the purpose of ending the inward-processing procedure. 3. Article 44(2) and (3) shall apply mutatis mutandis . However, in the case of non-Community goods as referred to in Article 179, the person who lodges the re-export notification shall be the debtor. In the event of indirect representation, the person on whose behalf the notification is lodged shall also be a debtor. Article 46 Customs debt incurred through non-compliance 1.

The time at which the customs debt is incurred shall be either of the following: (a) the moment when the obligation the non-fulfilment of which gives rise to the customs debt is not met or ceases to be met; (b) the moment when a customs declaration is accepted for the placing of goods under a customs procedure where it is established subsequently that a condition governing the plac- ing of the goods under that procedure or the granting of a duty exemption or a reduced rate of import duty by virtue of the end-use of the goods was not in fact fulfilled. 3. In cases referred to under points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1, the debtor shall be any of the following: (a) any person who was required to fulfil the obligations concerned; (b) any person who was aware or should reasonably have been aware that an obligation under the customs legislation was not fulfilled and who acted on behalf of the person who was obliged to fulfil the obligation, or who participated in the act which led to the non-fulfilment of the obligation; (c) any person who acquired or held the goods in question and who was aware or should reasonably have been aware at the time of acquiring or receiving the goods that an obligation under the customs legislation was not fulfilled. 4.

Article 47 Deduction of an amount of import duty already paid 1. Where a customs debt is incurred, pursuant to Article 46(1), in respect of goods released for free circulation at a reduced rate of import duty on account of their end-use, the amount of import duty paid when the goods were released for free circulation shall be deducted from the amount of the import duty corresponding to the customs debt. The first subparagraph shall apply mutatis mutandis where a cus- toms debt is incurred in respect of scrap and waste resulting from the destruction of such goods. 2. Where a customs debt is incurred, pursuant to Article 46(1), in respect of goods placed under temporary admission with par- tial relief from import duties, the amount of import duty paid under partial relief shall be deducted from the amount of the import duty corresponding to the customs debt. Section 2 Customs debt on exportation Article 48 Export and outward processing 1. A customs debt on exportation shall be incurred through the placing of goods liable to export duties under the export pro- cedure or the outward-processing procedure. 2. The customs debt shall be incurred at the time of acceptance of the customs declaration. 3. The declarant shall be the debtor. In the event of indirect representation, the person on whose behalf the customs declara- tion is made shall also be a debtor. Where a customs declaration is drawn up on the basis of infor- mation which leads to all or part of the export duties not being collected, the person who provided the information required for the declaration and who knew, or who should reasonably have known, that such information was false shall also be a debtor. Article 49 Customs debt incurred through non-compliance 1. For goods liable to export duties, a customs debt on expor- tation shall be incurred through non-compliance with either of the following: (a) one of the obligations laid down in customs legislation for the exit of the goods; (b) the conditions under which the goods were allowed to leave the customs territory of the Community with total or partial relief from export duties. 2. The time at which the customs debt is incurred shall be one of the following: (a) the moment at which the goods actually leave the customs territory of the Community without a customs declaration; (b) the moment at which the goods reach a destination other than that for which they were allowed to leave the customs territory of the Community with total or partial relief from export duties; (c) should the customs authorities be unable to determine the moment referred in point (b), the expiry of the time limit set for the production of evidence that the conditions entitling the goods to such relief have been fulfilled.

Section 3 Provisions common to customs debts incurred on importation and exportation Article 50 Prohibitions and restrictions 1. The customs debt on importation or exportation shall be incurred even if it relates to goods which are subject to measures of prohibition or restriction on importation or exportation of any kind. 2. However, no customs debt shall be incurred on either of the following: (a) the unlawful introduction into the customs territory of the Community of counterfeit currency; (b) the introduction into the customs territory of the Commu- nity of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances other than where strictly supervised by the competent authorities with a view to their use for medical and scientific purposes. 3. For the purposes of penalties as applicable to customs offences, the customs debt shall nevertheless be deemed to have been incurred where, under the law of a Member State, customs duties or the existence of a customs debt provide the basis for determining penalties. Article 51 Several debtors Where several persons are liable for payment of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to one customs debt, they shall be jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the debt. Article 52 General rules for calculation of the amount of import or export duty 1. The amount of the import or export duty shall be deter- mined on the basis of those rules for calculation of duty which were applicable to the goods concerned at the time at which the customs debt in respect of them was incurred. 2. Where it is not possible to determine precisely the time at which the customs debt is incurred, that time shall be deemed to be the time at which the customs authorities conclude that the goods are in a situation in which a customs debt has been incurred. However, where the information available to the customs authori- ties enables them to establish that the customs debt had been incurred prior to the time at which they reached that conclusion, the customs debt shall be deemed to have been incurred at the earliest time that such a situation can be established. Article 53 Special rules for calculation of the amount of import duty 1. Where costs for storage or usual forms of handling have been incurred within the customs territory of the Community in respect of goods placed under a customs procedure, such costs or the increase in value shall not be taken into account for the cal- culation of the amount of import duty where satisfactory proof of those costs is provided by the declarant. However, the customs value, quantity, nature and origin of non- Community goods used in the operations shall be taken into account for the calculation of the amount of import duty. 2. Where the tariff classification of goods placed under a cus- toms procedure changes as a result of usual forms of handling within the customs territory of the Community, the original tariff classification for the goods placed under the procedure shall be applied at the request of the declarant. 3. Where a customs debt is incurred for processed products resulting from the inward-processing procedure, the amount of import duty corresponding to such debt shall, at the request of the declarant, be determined on the basis of the tariff classification, customs value, quantity, nature and origin of the goods placed under the inward-processing procedure at the time of acceptance of the customs declaration relating to those goods. 4. Where customs legislation provides for a favourable tariff treatment of goods, or for relief or total or partial exemption from import or export duties, pursuant to Article 33(2)(d) to (g), Articles 130 to 133 or Articles 171 to 174, or pursuant to Coun- cil Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 of 28 March 1983 setting up a Community system of reliefs from customs duty ( 1 ), such favour- able tariff treatment, relief or exemption shall also apply in cases where a customs debt is incurred pursuant to Articles 46 or 49 of this Regulation, on condition that the failure which led to the incurrence of a customs debt did not constitute an attempt at deception.

Article 55 Place where the customs debt is incurred 1. A customs debt shall be incurred at the place where the cus- toms declaration or the re-export notification referred to in Articles 44, 45 and 48 is lodged or where the supplementary dec- laration referred to in Article 110(3) is to be lodged. In all other cases, the place where a customs debt is incurred shall be the place where the events from which it arises occur. If it is not possible to determine that place, the customs debt shall be incurred at the place where the customs authorities conclude that the goods are in a situation in which a customs debt is incurred. 2. If the goods have been entered for a customs procedure which has not been discharged, and the place cannot be deter- mined, pursuant to the second or third subparagraphs of para- graph 1, within a specified period of time, the customs debt shall be incurred at the place where the goods were either placed under the procedure concerned or were introduced into the customs ter- ritory of the Community under that procedure. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down the period of time referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scru- tiny referred to in Article 184(4). 3. Where the information available to the customs authorities enables them to establish that the customs debt may have been incurred in several places, the customs debt shall be deemed to have been incurred at the place where it was first incurred. 4. If a customs authority establishes that a customs debt has been incurred under Article 46 or Article 49 in another Member State and the amount of import or export duty corresponding to that debt is lower than EUR 10 000, the customs debt shall be deemed to have been incurred in the Member State where the finding was made. CHAPTER 2 Guarantee for a potential or existing customs debt Article 56 General provisions 1. This Chapter shall apply to guarantees both for customs debts which have been incurred and for those which may be incurred, unless otherwise specified. 2. Customs authorities may require a guarantee to be provided in order to ensure payment of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to a customs debt. Where the relevant provi- sions so provide, the guarantee required may also cover other charges as provided for under other relevant provisions in force. 3. Where the customs authorities require a guarantee to be provided, it shall be required from the debtor or the person who may become the debtor. They may also permit the guarantee to be provided by a person other than the person from whom it is required. 4. Without prejudice to Article 64, the customs authorities shall require only one guarantee to be provided in respect of spe- cific goods or a specific declaration. The guarantee provided for a specific declaration shall apply to the amount of import or export duty corresponding to the cus- toms debt and other charges in respect of all goods covered by or released against that declaration, whether or not that declaration is correct. If the guarantee has not been released, it may also be used, within the limits of the secured amount, for the recovery of amounts of import or export duty and other charges payable following post- release control of those goods. 5. At the request of the person referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, the customs authorities may, in accordance with Article 62(1) and (2), authorise the provision of a comprehensive guarantee to cover the amount of import or export duty corre- sponding to the customs debt in respect of two or more opera- tions, declarations or customs procedures. 6. No guarantee shall be required from States, regional and local government authorities or other bodies governed by public law, in respect of the activities in which they engage as public authorities. 7. The customs authorities may waive the requirement for pro- vision of a guarantee where the amount of import or export duty to be secured does not exceed the statistical threshold for decla- rations laid down in accordance with Article 12 of Council Regu- lation (EC) No 1172/95 of 22 May 1995 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods by the Community and its Member States with non-member countries ( 1 ).

The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down the following: \u2014 conditions for the implementation of this Article, \u2014 cases, other than those laid down in paragraph 6 of this Article, in which no guarantee is to be required, \u2014 exceptions to paragraph 8 of this Article, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). Article 57 Compulsory guarantee 1. Where it is compulsory for a guarantee to be provided, and subject to the rules adopted pursuant to paragraph 3, the customs authorities shall fix the amount of such guarantee at a level equal to the precise amount of import or export duty corresponding to the customs debt and of other charges where that amount can be established with certainty at the time when the guarantee is required. Where it is not possible to establish the precise amount, the guar- antee shall be fixed at the maximum amount, as estimated by the customs authorities, of import or export duty corresponding to the customs debt and of other charges which have been or may be incurred. 2. Without prejudice to Article 62, where a comprehensive guarantee is provided for the amount of import or export duty corresponding to customs debts and other charges which vary in amount over time, the amount of such guarantee shall be set at a level enabling the amount of import or export duty correspond- ing to customs debts and other charges to be covered at all times. 3. The Commission shall, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures for the implementation of paragraph 1 of this Article. Article 58 Optional guarantee Where the provision of a guarantee is optional, such guarantee shall in any case be required by the customs authorities if they consider that the amount of import or export duty correspond- ing to a customs debt and other charges are not certain to be paid within the prescribed period. Its amount shall be fixed by those authorities so as not to exceed the level referred to in Article 57. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down when a guarantee is optional shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). Article 59 Provision of a guarantee 1. A guarantee may be provided in one of the following forms: (a) by a cash deposit or by any other means of payment recog- nised by the customs authorities as being equivalent to a cash deposit, made in euro or in the currency of the Member State in which the guarantee is required; (b) by an undertaking given by a guarantor; (c) by another form of guarantee which provides equivalent assurance that the amount of import or export duty corre- sponding to the customs debt and other charges will be paid. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down the forms of guar- antee referred in point (c) of the first subparagraph of this para- graph, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). 2. A guarantee in the form of a cash deposit or payment deemed equivalent to a cash deposit shall be given in accordance with the provisions in force in the Member State in which the guarantee is required. Article 60 Choice of guarantee The person required to provide a guarantee may choose between the forms of guarantee laid down in Article 59(1). However, the customs authorities may refuse to accept the form of guarantee chosen where it is incompatible with the proper functioning of the customs procedure concerned. The customs authorities may require that the form of guarantee chosen be maintained for a specific period. Article 61 Guarantor 1. The guarantor referred to in Article 59(1)(b) must be a third person established in the customs territory of the Community. The guarantor must be approved by the customs authorities requiring the guarantee, unless the guarantor is a credit institu- tion, financial institution or insurance company accredited in the Community in accordance with Community provisions in force. 4.6.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 145/25 ",
        "2. The guarantor shall undertake in writing to pay the secured amount of import or export duty corresponding to a customs debt and other charges. 3. The customs authorities may refuse to approve the guaran- tor or the type of guarantee proposed where either does not appear certain to ensure payment within the prescribed period of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to the cus- toms debt and of other charges. Article 62 Comprehensive guarantee 1. The authorisation referred to in Article 56(5) shall be granted only to persons who satisfy the following conditions: (a) they are established in the customs territory of the Community; (b) they have a record of compliance with customs and tax requirements; (c) they are regular users of the customs procedures involved or are known to the customs authorities to have the capacity to fulfil their obligation in relation to those procedures. 2. Where a comprehensive guarantee is to be provided for cus- toms debts and other charges which may be incurred, an eco- nomic operator may be authorised to use a comprehensive guarantee with a reduced amount or to have a guarantee waiver provided that he fulfils the following criteria: (a) a satisfactory system of managing commercial and, where appropriate, transport records, which allows appropriate cus- toms controls; (b) proven solvency. 3. The Commission shall, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures govern- ing the procedure for granting authorisations under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. Article 63 Additional provisions relating to the use of guarantees 1. In cases where a customs debt may be incurred in the frame- work of special procedures, paragraphs 2 and 3 shall apply. 2. The guarantee waiver authorised in accordance with Article 62(2) shall not apply to goods which are considered to present increased risks of fraud. 3. The Commission shall, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures: (a) implementing paragraph 2 of this Article; (b) temporarily prohibiting the use of a comprehensive guaran- tee with a reduced amount referred to in Article 62(2); (c) as an exceptional measure in special circumstances, tempo- rarily prohibiting the use of a comprehensive guarantee in respect of goods which have been identified as being subject to large-scale fraud while under a comprehensive guarantee. Article 64 Additional or replacement guarantee Where the customs authorities establish that the guarantee pro- vided does not ensure, or is no longer certain or sufficient to ensure, payment within the prescribed period of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to the customs debt and other charges, they shall require any of the persons referred to in Article 56(3) either to provide an additional guarantee or to replace the original guarantee with a new guarantee, according to his choice. Article 65 Release of the guarantee 1. The customs authorities shall release the guarantee imme- diately when the customs debt or liability for other charges is extinguished or can no longer arise. 2. Where the customs debt or liability for other charges has been extinguished in part, or may arise only in respect of part, of the amount which has been secured, a corresponding part of the guarantee shall be released accordingly at the request of the per- son concerned, unless the amount involved does not justify such action. 3. The Commission may, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures for the implementation of this Article. CHAPTER 3 Recovery and payment of duty and repayment and remission of the amount of import and export duty Section 1 Determination of the amount of import or export duty, notification of the customs debt and entry in the accounts Article 66 Determination of the amount of import or export duty 1.

Article 67 Notification of the customs debt 1. The customs debt shall be notified to the debtor in the form prescribed at the place where the customs debt is incurred, or is deemed to have been incurred in accordance with Article 55. The notification referred to in the first subparagraph shall not be made in the following situations: (a) where, pending a final determination of the amount of import or export duty, a provisional commercial policy mea- sure taking the form of a duty has been imposed; (b) where the amount of import or export duty payable exceeds that determined on the basis of a decision made in accor- dance with Article 20; (c) where the original decision not to notify the customs debt or to notify it with an amount of import or export duty at a fig- ure less than the amount of import or export payable was taken on the basis of general provisions invalidated at a later date by a court decision; (d) in cases where the customs authorities are exempted under the customs legislation from notification of the customs debt. The Commission shall, in accordance with the regulatory proce- dure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures for the imple- mentation of point (d) of the second subparagraph of this paragraph. 2. Where the amount of import or export duty payable is equal to the amount entered in the customs declaration, release of the goods by the customs authorities shall be equivalent to notifying the debtor of the customs debt. 3. Where paragraph 2 of this Article does not apply, the cus- toms debt shall be notified to the debtor within 14 days of the date on which the customs authorities are in a position to deter- mine the amount of import or export duty payable. Article 68 Limitation of the customs debt 1. No customs debt shall be notified to the debtor after the expiry of a period of three years from the date on which the cus- toms debt was incurred. 2. Where the customs debt is incurred as the result of an act which, at the time it was committed, was liable to give rise to criminal court proceedings, the three year period laid down in paragraph 1 shall be extended to a period of 10 years. 3. Where an appeal is lodged under Article 23, the periods laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall be suspended, for the duration of the appeal proceedings, from the date on which the appeal is lodged. 4. Where liability for a customs debt is reinstated pursuant to Article 79(5), the periods laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall be considered as suspended from the date on which the repayment or remission application was submitted in accor- dance with Article 84, until a decision on the repayment or remis- sion is taken. Article 69 Entry in the accounts 1. The customs authorities referred to in Article 66 shall enter in their accounts, in accordance with the national legislation, the amount of import or export duty payable as determined in accor- dance with that Article. The first subparagraph shall not apply in cases referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 67(1). The customs authorities need not enter in the accounts amounts of import or export duty which, pursuant to Article 68, corre- spond to a customs debt which could no longer be notified to the debtor. 2. The Member States shall determine the practical procedures for the entry in the accounts of the amounts of import or export duty. Those procedures may differ according to whether, in view of the circumstances in which the customs debt was incurred, the customs authorities are satisfied that those amounts will be paid. Article 70 Time of entry in the accounts 1. Where a customs debt is incurred as a result of the accep- tance of the customs declaration of goods for a customs proce- dure, other than temporary admission with partial relief from import duties, or of any other act having the same legal effect as such acceptance, the customs authorities shall enter the amount of import or export duty payable in the accounts within 14 days of the release of the goods. However, provided that payment has been guaranteed, the total amount of import or export duty relating to all the goods released to one and the same person during a period fixed by the customs authorities, which may not exceed 31 days, may be covered by a single entry in the accounts at the end of that period. Such entry in the accounts shall take place within 14 days of the expiry of the period concerned. 2. Where goods may be released subject to certain conditions which govern either the determination of the amount of import or export duty payable or its collection, entry in the accounts shall take place within 14 days of the day on which the amount of import or export duty payable is determined or the obligation to pay that duty is fixed. However, where the customs debt relates to a provisional com- mercial policy measure taking the form of a duty, the amount of import or export duty payable shall be entered in the accounts within two months of the date of publication in the Official Jour- nal of the European Union of the Regulation establishing the defini- tive commercial policy measure. 4.6.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 145/27 ",

Paragraph 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis with regard to the amount of import or export duty to be recovered or which remains to be recovered where the amount of import or export duty payable has not been entered in the accounts in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, or has been determined and entered in the accounts at a level lower than the amount payable. 5. The time limits for entry in the accounts laid down in para- graphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply in unforeseeable circumstances or in cases of force majeure .

Amounts of import or export duty, corresponding to a cus- toms debt notified in accordance with Article 67, shall be paid by the debtor within the period prescribed by the customs authorities. Without prejudice to Article 24(2), that period shall not exceed 10 days following notification to the debtor of the customs debt. In the case of aggregation of entries in the accounts under the conditions laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 70(1), it shall be so fixed as not to enable the debtor to obtain a longer period for payment than if he had been granted deferred payment in accordance with Article 74. Extension of that period may be granted by the customs authori- ties at the request of the debtor where the amount of import or export duty payable has been determined in the course of post- release control as referred to in Article 27. Without prejudice to Article 77(1), such extensions shall not exceed the time necessary for the debtor to take the appropriate steps to discharge his obligation. 2. If the debtor is entitled to any of the payment facilities laid down in Articles 74 to 77, payment shall be made within the period or periods specified in relation to those facilities. 3. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down the conditions for the suspension of the time limit for payment of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to a customs debt in the following situations: (a) where an application for remission of duty is made in accor- dance with Article 84; (b) where goods are to be confiscated, destroyed or abandoned to the State; (c) where the customs debt was incurred pursuant to Article 46 and there is more than one debtor, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). Those measures shall lay down, in particular, the period of the suspension, taking into account the time which is reasonable for the conclusion of any formalities or for the recovery of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to the customs debt. Article 73 Payment 1. Payment shall be made in cash or by any other means with similar discharging effect, including by adjustment of a credit bal- ance, in accordance with national legislation. 2. Payment may be made by a third person instead of the debtor. 3. The debtor may in any case pay all or part of the amount of import or export duty without awaiting expiry of the period he has been granted for payment.

If those periods are calendar months, Member States may provide that the amount of import or export duty in respect of which pay- ment has been deferred is to be paid by the 16th day of the month following the calendar month in question. Article 76 Implementing measures The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down the rules for defer- ment of payment in cases where the customs declaration is sim- plified in accordance with Article 109, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). Article 77 Other payment facilities 1. The customs authorities may grant the debtor payment facilities other than deferred payment on condition that a guar- antee is provided. Where facilities are granted pursuant to the first subparagraph, credit interest shall be charged on the amount of import or export duty. The rate of credit interest shall be the interest rate applied by the European Central Bank to its most recent main refinanc- ing operation carried out before the first calendar day of the half- year in question (the reference rate), plus one percentage point. For a Member State which is not participating in the third stage of economic and monetary union, the reference rate referred to above shall be the equivalent rate set by its national central bank. In that case, the reference rate in force on the first calendar day of the half-year in question shall apply for the following six months. 2. The customs authorities may refrain from requiring a guar- antee or from charging credit interest where it is established, on the basis of a documented assessment of the situation of the debtor, that this would create serious economic or social difficulties. 3. The Commission may, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures for the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2. Article 78 Enforcement of payment and arrears 1. Where the amount of import or export duty payable has not been paid within the prescribed period, the customs authori- ties shall secure payment of that amount by all means available to them under the law of the Member State concerned. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down measures in respect of securing payment from guarantors within the framework of a special procedure, shall be adopted in accordance with the regu- latory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). 2. Interest on arrears shall be charged on the amount of import or export duty from the date of expiry of the prescribed period until the date of payment. The rate of interest on arrears shall be the interest rate applied by the European Central Bank to its most recent main refinancing operation carried out before the first calendar day of the half-year in question (the reference rate), plus two percentage points. For a Member State which is not participating in the third stage of economic and monetary union, the reference rate referred to above shall be the equivalent rate set by its national central bank. In that case, the reference rate in force on the first calendar day of the half-year in question shall apply for the following six months. 3. Where a customs debt has been notified pursuant to Article 67(3), interest on arrears shall be charged over and above the amount of import or export duty, from the date on which the customs debt was incurred until the date of its notification. The rate of interest on arrears shall be set in accordance with paragraph 2. 4. The customs authorities may refrain from charging interest on arrears where it is established, on the basis of a documented assessment of the situation of the debtor, that to charge it would create serious economic or social difficulties. 4.6.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 145/29 ",
        "5. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down the cases, in terms of time and amounts, in which the customs authorities may waive the collection of interest on arrears, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). Section 3 Repayment and remission of the amount of import or export duty Article 79 Repayment and remission 1. Subject to the conditions laid down in this Section, amounts of import or export duty shall, provided that the amount to be repaid or remitted exceeds a certain amount, be repaid or remit- ted on the following grounds: (a) overcharged amounts of import or export duty; (b) defective goods or goods not complying with the terms of the contract; (c) error by the competent authorities; (d) equity. In addition, where an amount of import or export duty has been paid and the corresponding customs declaration is invalidated in accordance with Article 114, that amount shall be repaid. 2. Subject to the rules of competence for a decision, where the customs authorities themselves discover within the periods referred to in Article 84(1) that an amount of import or export duty is repayable or remissible pursuant to Articles 80, 82 or 83, they shall repay or remit on their own initiative. 3. No repayment or remission shall be granted when the situ- ation which led to the notification of the customs debt results from deception by the debtor. 4. Repayment shall not give rise to the payment of interest by the customs authorities concerned. However, interest shall be paid where a decision granting repay- ment is not implemented within three months of the date on which that decision was taken, unless the failure to meet the dead- line was outside the control of the customs authorities. In such cases, the interest shall be paid from the date of expiry of the three-month period until the date of repayment. The rate of interest shall be established in accordance with Article 77. 5. Where the competent authority has granted repayment or remission in error, the original customs debt shall be reinstated insofar as it is not time-barred under Article 68. In such cases, any interest paid under the second subparagraph of paragraph 4 must be reimbursed. Article 80 Repayment and remission of overcharged amounts of import or export duty An amount of import or export duty shall be repaid or remitted insofar as the amount corresponding to the customs debt initially notified exceeds the amount payable, or the customs debt was notified to the debtor contrary to points (c) or (d) of Article 67(1). Article 81 Defective goods or goods not complying with the terms of the contract 1. An amount of import duty shall be repaid or remitted if the notification of the customs debt relates to goods which have been rejected by the importer because, at the time of release, they were defective or did not comply with the terms of the contract on the basis of which they were imported. Defective goods shall be deemed to include goods damaged before their release. 2. Repayment or remission of import duties shall be granted provided the goods have not been used, except for such initial use as may have been necessary to establish that they were defective or did not comply with the terms of the contract and provided they are exported from the customs territory of the Community. 3. Instead of being exported, at the request of the person con- cerned, the customs authorities shall permit the goods to be placed under the inward-processing procedure, including for destruction, or the external transit, the customs warehousing or the free-zone procedure. Article 82 Repayment or remission on account of error by the competent authorities 1. In situations other than those referred to in the second sub- paragraph of Article 79(1) and in Articles 80, 81 and 83, an amount of import or export duty shall be repaid or remitted where, as a result of an error on the part of the competent authorities, the amount corresponding to the customs debt ini- tially notified was lower than the amount payable, provided the following conditions are met: (a) the debtor could not reasonably have detected that error; (b) the debtor was acting in good faith. 2. Where the preferential treatment of the goods is granted on the basis of a system of administrative cooperation involving the authorities of a country or territory outside the customs territory of the Community, the issue of a certificate by those authorities, should it prove to be incorrect, shall constitute an error which could not reasonably have been detected within the meaning of paragraph 1(a). L 145/30 EN Official Journal of the European Union 4.6.2008 ",
        "The issue of an incorrect certificate shall not, however, constitute an error where the certificate is based on an incorrect account of the facts provided by the exporter, except where it is evident that the issuing authorities were aware or should have been aware that the goods did not satisfy the conditions laid down for entitlement to the preferential treatment. The debtor shall be considered to be in good faith if he can dem- onstrate that, during the period of the trading operations con- cerned, he has taken due care to ensure that all the conditions for the preferential treatment have been fulfilled. The debtor may not rely on a plea of good faith if the Commis- sion has published a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union stating that there are grounds for doubt concerning the proper application of the preferential arrangements by the ben- eficiary country or territory. Article 83 Repayment and remission in equity In situations other than those referred to in the second subpara- graph of Article 79(1) and in Articles 80, 81 and 82, an amount of import or export duty shall be repaid or remitted in the inter- est of equity where a customs debt is incurred under special cir- cumstances in which no deception or obvious negligence may be attributed to the debtor. Article 84 Procedure for repayment and remission 1. Applications for repayment or remission in accordance with Article 79 shall be submitted to the appropriate customs office within the following periods: (a) in the case of overcharged duties, error by the competent authorities or equity, within three years of the date of notifi- cation of the customs debt; (b) in the case of defective goods or goods not complying with the terms of the contract, within one year of the date of noti- fication of the customs debt; (c) in the case of invalidation of a customs declaration, within the period specified in the rules applicable to invalidation. The period specified in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph shall be extended where the applicant provides evidence that he was prevented from submitting his application within the pre- scribed period as a result of unforeseeable circumstances or force majeure . 2. Where an appeal has been lodged under Article 23 against the notification of the customs debt, the relevant period specified in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article shall be suspended, from the date on which the appeal is lodged, for the duration of the appeal proceedings. Article 85 Implementing measures The Commission shall, in accordance with the regulatory proce- dure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures for the imple- mentation of this Section. Those measures shall lay down, in particular, the cases in which the Commission shall, in accordance with the management procedure referred to in Article 184(3), decide whether remission or repayment of an amount of import or export duty is justified. CHAPTER 4 Extinguishment of customs debt Article 86 Extinguishment 1. Without prejudice to Article 68 and the provisions in force relating to non-recovery of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to a customs debt in the event of the judicially established insolvency of the debtor, a customs debt on importa- tion or exportation shall be extinguished in any of the following ways: (a) by payment of the amount of import or export duty; (b) subject to paragraph 4, by remission of the amount of import or export duty; (c) where, in respect of goods declared for a customs procedure entailing the obligation to pay duties, the customs declara- tion is invalidated; (d) where goods liable to import or export duties are confiscated; (e) where goods liable to import or export duties are seized and simultaneously or subsequently confiscated; (f) where goods liable to import and export duties are destroyed under customs supervision or abandoned to the State; (g) where the disappearance of the goods or the non-fulfilment of obligations arising from the customs legislation results from the total destruction or irretrievable loss of those goods as a result of the actual nature of the goods or unforeseeable circumstances or force majeure , or as a consequence of instruc- tion by the customs authorities; for the purpose of this point, goods shall be considered as irretrievably lost when they have been rendered unusable by any person; (h) where the customs debt was incurred pursuant to Article 46 or 49 and where the following conditions are fulfilled: (i) the failure which led to the incurrence of a customs debt had no significant effect on the correct operation of the customs procedure concerned and did not constitute an attempt at deception; (ii) all of the formalities necessary to regularise the situation of the goods are subsequently carried out; 4.6.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 145/31 ",
        "(i) where goods released for free circulation duty-free, or at a reduced rate of import duty by virtue of their end-use, have been exported with the permission of the customs authorities; (j) where it was incurred pursuant to Article 45 and where the formalities carried out in order to enable the preferential tar- iff treatment referred to in that Article to be granted are cancelled; (k) where, subject to paragraph 5 of this Article, the customs debt was incurred pursuant to Article 46 and evidence is pro- vided to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that the goods have not been used or consumed and have been exported from the customs territory of the Community. 2. In the event of confiscation, as referred to in paragraph 1(d), the customs debt shall, nevertheless, for the purposes of penalties applicable to customs offences, be deemed not to have been extin- guished where, under the law of a Member State, customs duties or the existence of a customs debt provide the basis for determin- ing penalties. 3. Where, in accordance with paragraph 1(g), a customs debt is extinguished in respect of goods released for free circulation duty-free or at a reduced rate of import duty on account of their end-use, any scrap or waste resulting from their destruction shall be deemed to be non-Community goods. 4. Where several persons are liable for payment of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to the customs debt and remission is granted, the customs debt shall be extinguished only in respect of the person or persons to whom the remission is granted. 5. In the case referred to in paragraph 1(k), the customs debt shall not be extinguished in respect of any person or persons who attempted deception. 6. Where the customs debt was incurred pursuant to Article 46, it shall be extinguished with regard to the person whose behaviour did not involve any attempt at deception and who contributed to the fight against fraud. 7. The Commission may, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures for the implementation of this Article. TITLE IV GOODS BROUGHT INTO THE CUSTOMS TERRITORY OF THE COMMUNITY CHAPTER 1 Entry summary declaration Article 87 Obligation to lodge an entry summary declaration 1. Goods brought into the customs territory of the Commu- nity shall be covered by an entry summary declaration, with the exception of means of transport temporarily imported and means of transport and the goods carried thereon only passing through the territorial waters or the airspace of the customs territory of the Community without a stop within that territory. 2. Except where otherwise specified in the customs legislation, an entry summary declaration shall be lodged at the competent customs office before the goods are brought into the customs ter- ritory of the Community. Customs authorities may accept, instead of the lodging of the entry summary declaration, the lodging of a notification and access to the entry summary declaration data in the economic operator\u2019s computer system. 3. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down the following: (a) the cases, other than those referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, in which the requirement for an entry summary dec- laration may be waived or adapted and the conditions under which it may be so waived or adapted; (b) the deadline by which the entry summary declaration is to be lodged or made available before the goods are brought into the customs territory of the Community; (c) the rules for exceptions from and variations to the deadline referred to in point (b); (d) the rules for determining the competent customs office at which the entry summary declaration is to be lodged or made available and where risk analysis and risk-based entry con- trols are to be carried out, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). In adopting those measures, account shall be taken of the following: (a) special circumstances; (b) the application of those measures to certain types of goods traffic, modes of transport or economic operators; (c) international agreements which provide for special security arrangements. Article 88 Lodgement and responsible person 1. The entry summary declaration shall be lodged using an electronic data-processing technique. Commercial, port or trans- port information may be used provided it contains the necessary particulars for an entry summary declaration. L 145/32 EN Official Journal of the European Union 4.6.2008 ",
        "Customs authorities may, in exceptional circumstances, accept paper-based entry summary declarations, provided that they apply the same level of risk management as that applied to entry summary declarations made using an electronic data-processing technique and that the requirements for the exchange of such data with other customs offices can be met. 2. The entry summary declaration shall be lodged by the per- son who brings the goods into the customs territory of the Com- munity or who assumes responsibility for the carriage of the goods into that territory. 3. Notwithstanding the obligations of the person referred to in paragraph 2, the entry summary declaration may be lodged instead by one of the following persons: (a) the importer or consignee or other person in whose name or on whose behalf the person referred to in paragraph 2 acts; (b) any person who is able to present the goods in question or to have them presented to the competent customs authority. 4. Where the entry summary declaration is lodged by a per- son other than the operator of the means of transport by which the goods are brought on to Community customs territory, that operator shall lodge with the appropriate customs office a notifi- cation of arrival in the form of a manifest, a dispatch note or a load sheet containing the information required in order to enable all the goods transported which are to be covered by an entry summary declaration to be identified. The Commission shall, in accordance with the regulatory proce- dure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures stipulating the information which must appear on the notification of arrival. Paragraph 1 shall apply, mutatis mutandis , to the notification of arrival mentioned in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. Article 89 Amendment of entry summary declaration 1. The person who lodges the entry summary declaration shall, at his request, be permitted to amend one or more particulars of that declaration after it has been lodged. However, no such amendment shall be possible after any of the following events: (a) the customs authorities have informed the person who lodged the entry summary declaration that they intend to examine the goods; (b) the customs authorities have established that the particulars in question are incorrect; (c) the customs authorities have allowed the removal of the goods from the place where they were presented. 2. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down exceptions to paragraph 1(c) of this Article, defining, in particular, the following: (a) criteria for establishing grounds for amendments after removal; (b) the data elements which may be amended; (c) the time limit after removal within which amendment may be permitted, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). Article 90 Customs declaration replacing entry summary declaration The competent customs office may waive the lodging of an entry summary declaration in respect of goods for which, prior to the expiry of the deadline referred to in point (b) of the first subpara- graph of Article 87(3), a customs declaration is lodged. In that case, the customs declaration shall contain at least the particulars necessary for the entry summary declaration. Until such time as the customs declaration is accepted in accordance with Article 112, it shall have the status of an entry summary declaration. CHAPTER 2 Arrival of goods Section 1 Entry of goods into the customs territory of the Community Article 91 Customs supervision 1. Goods brought into the customs territory of the Commu- nity shall, from the time of their entry, be subject to customs supervision and may be subject to customs controls. Where appli- cable, they shall be subject to such prohibitions and restrictions as are justified on grounds of, inter alia, public morality, public policy or public security, the protection of the health and life of humans, animals or plants, the protection of the environment, the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value and the protection of industrial or commer- cial property, including controls on drug precursors, goods infringing certain intellectual property rights and cash entering the Community, as well as to the implementation of fishery con- servation and management measures and of commercial policy measures. 4.6.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 145/33 ",
        "They shall remain under such supervision for as long as is neces- sary to determine their customs status and shall not be removed therefrom without the permission of the customs authorities. Without prejudice to Article 166, Community goods shall not be subject to customs supervision once their customs status is established. Non-Community goods shall remain under customs supervision until their customs status is changed, or they are re-exported or destroyed. 2. The holder of goods under customs supervision may, with the permission of the customs authorities, at any time examine the goods or take samples, in particular in order to determine their tariff classification, customs value or customs status. Article 92 Conveyance to the appropriate place 1. The person who brings goods into the customs territory of the Community shall convey them without delay, by the route specified by the customs authorities and in accordance with their instructions, if any, to the customs office designated by the cus- toms authorities, or to any other place designated or approved by those authorities, or into a free zone. Goods brought into a free zone shall be brought into that free zone directly, either by sea or air or, if by land, without passing through another part of the customs territory of the Community, where the free zone adjoins the land frontier between a Member State and a third country. The goods shall be presented to the customs authorities in accor- dance with Article 95. 2. Any person who assumes responsibility for the carriage of goods after they have been brought into the customs territory of the Community shall become responsible for compliance with the obligation laid down in paragraph 1. 3. Goods which, although still outside the customs territory of the Community, may be subject to customs controls by the cus- toms authority of a Member State as a result of an agreement con- cluded with the relevant country or territory outside the customs territory of the Community, shall be treated in the same way as goods brought into the customs territory of the Community. 4. Paragraph 1 shall not preclude application of any special provisions with respect to letters, postcards and printed matter and their electronic equivalents held on other media or to goods carried by travellers, goods transported within frontier zones or in pipelines and wires as well as any other traffic of negligible economic importance, provided that customs supervision and customs control possibilities are not thereby jeopardised. 5. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to means of transport and goods carried thereon only passing through the territorial waters or the airspace of the customs territory of the Community without a stop within that territory. Article 93 Intra-Community air and sea services 1. Articles 87 to 90, 92(1) and 94 to 97 shall not apply to goods which have temporarily left the customs territory of the Community while moving between two points in that territory by sea or air, provided that carriage has been effected by a direct route and by an air or regular shipping service without a stop out- side the customs territory of the Community. 2. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down special provi- sions for air and regular shipping services, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). Article 94 Conveyance under special circumstances 1. Where, by reason of unforeseeable circumstances or force majeure , the obligation laid down in Article 92(1) cannot be com- plied with, the person bound by that obligation or any other per- son acting on that person\u2019s behalf shall inform the customs authorities of the situation without delay. Where the unforesee- able circumstances or force majeure do not result in total loss of the goods, the customs authorities shall also be informed of their pre- cise location. 2. Where, by reason of unforeseeable circumstances or force majeure , a vessel or aircraft covered by Article 92(5) is forced to put into port or to land temporarily in the customs territory of the Community and the obligation laid down in Article 92(1) cannot be complied with, the person who brought the vessel or aircraft into the customs territory of the Community, or any other per- son acting on that person\u2019s behalf, shall inform the customs authorities of the situation without delay. 3. The customs authorities shall determine the measures to be taken in order to permit customs supervision of the goods referred to in paragraph 1, or of the vessel or aircraft and any goods thereon in the circumstances specified in paragraph 2, and to ensure, where appropriate, that they are subsequently conveyed to a customs office or other place designated or approved by the authorities.

Notwithstanding the obligations of the person described in paragraph 1, presentation of the goods may be effected instead by one of the following persons: (a) any person who immediately places the goods under a cus- toms procedure; (b) the holder of an authorisation for the operation of storage facilities or any person who carries out an activity in a free zone. 3. The person presenting the goods shall make a reference to the entry summary declaration or customs declaration which has been lodged in respect of the goods. 4. Paragraph 1 shall not preclude application of any special provisions with respect to letters, postcards and printed matter and their electronic equivalents held on other media or to goods carried by travellers, goods transported within frontier zones or in pipelines and wires as well as any other traffic of negligible eco- nomic importance, provided that customs supervision and cus- toms control possibilities are not thereby jeopardised. Article 96 Unloading and examination of goods 1. Goods shall be unloaded or trans-shipped from the means of transport carrying them solely with the permission of the cus- toms authorities in places designated or approved by those authorities. However, such permission shall not be required in the event of an imminent danger necessitating the immediate unloading of all or part of the goods. In that case, the customs authorities shall immediately be informed accordingly. 2. The customs authorities may at any time require goods to be unloaded and unpacked for the purpose of examining them, taking samples or examining the means of transport carrying them. 3. Goods presented to customs shall not be removed from the place where they have been presented without the permission of the customs authorities. Section 3 Formalities after presentation Article 97 Obligation to place non-Community goods under a customs procedure 1. Without prejudice to Articles 125 to 127, non-Community goods presented to customs shall be placed under a customs procedure. 2. Except as otherwise provided, the declarant shall be free to choose the customs procedure under which he wishes to place the goods, under the conditions for that procedure, irrespective of their nature or quantity, or their country of origin, consignment or destination. Article 98 Goods deemed to be placed in temporary storage 1. Except where goods are immediately placed under a cus- toms procedure for which a customs declaration has been accepted, or have been placed in a free zone, non-Community goods presented to customs shall be deemed to have been placed under temporary storage, in accordance with Article 151. 2. Without prejudice to the obligation laid down in Article 87(2) and the exceptions or waiver provided for by the measures adopted under Article 87(3), where it is found that non- Community goods presented to customs are not covered by an entry summary declaration, the holder of the goods shall lodge such a declaration immediately. Section 4 Goods moved under a transit procedure Article 99 Waiver for goods arriving under transit Article 92, with the exception of the first subparagraph of para- graph 1 thereof, and Articles 95 to 98 shall not apply when goods already under a transit procedure are brought into the customs territory of the Community. Article 100 Provisions applicable to non-Community goods after a transit procedure has ended Articles 96, 97 and 98 shall apply to non-Community goods moving under a transit procedure, once such goods have been presented to the customs office of destination in the customs ter- ritory of the Community, in accordance with the rules governing transit. 4.6.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 145/35 ",

Article 102 Loss of customs status of Community goods Community goods shall become non-Community goods in the following cases: (a) where they are moved out of the customs territory of the Community, insofar as the rules on internal transit or the measures laid down in accordance with Article 103 do not apply; (b) where they have been placed under the external transit pro- cedure, a storage procedure or the inward-processing proce- dure, insofar as the customs legislation so allows; (c) where they have been placed under the end-use procedure and are either subsequently abandoned to the State, or are destroyed and waste remains; (d) where the declaration for release of goods for free circulation is invalidated after release in accordance with measures adopted pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 114(2).

The Commission shall, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures defining the various roles and responsibilities of competent customs offices, and notably of the following: (a) the customs offices of entry, import, export or exit; (b) the customs offices carrying out the formalities for the plac- ing of goods under a customs procedure; (c) the customs offices granting authorisations and supervising customs procedures. Article 106 Centralised clearance 1. Customs authorities may authorise a person to lodge, or make available, at the customs office responsible for the place where he is established a customs declaration for goods which are presented to customs at another customs office. In such cases, the customs debt shall be deemed to be incurred at the customs office at which the customs declaration is lodged or made available. 2. The customs office at which the customs declaration is lodged or made available shall carry out the formalities for the verification of the declaration, the recovery of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to any customs debt and for granting release of the goods. 3. The customs office at which the goods are presented shall, without prejudice to its own controls for security and safety pur- poses, carry out any examination justifiably requested by the cus- toms office at which the customs declaration is lodged or made available and shall allow release of the goods, taking into account information received from that office. 4.

Those measures shall take account of the following: \u2014 with regard to point (c), where more than one Member State is involved, compliance by the applicant with the criteria laid down in Article 14 for the granting of the status of autho- rised economic operator, \u2014 with regard to point (d), the place where the applicant\u2019s main accounts for customs purposes are held or accessible, facili- tating audit-based controls, and where at least part of the activities to be covered by the authorisation are to be carried out. Article 107 Types of customs declaration 1. The customs declaration shall be lodged using an electronic data-processing technique. The customs authorities may allow the customs declaration to take the form of an entry in the declarant\u2019s records, provided that the customs authorities have access to those data in the declarant\u2019s electronic system and that the require- ments for any necessary exchange of such data between customs offices are met. 2. Where this is provided for in the customs legislation, the customs authorities may accept a paper-based customs declara- tion, or a customs declaration made orally or by any other act whereby goods can be placed under a customs procedure. 3. The Commission shall, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures for the implementation of this Article. Section 2 Standard customs declarations Article 108 Content of a declaration and supporting documents 1. Customs declarations shall contain all the particulars neces- sary for application of the provisions governing the customs pro- cedure for which the goods are declared.

The supporting documents required for application of the provisions governing the customs procedure for which the goods are declared shall be made available to the customs authorities at the time when the declaration is lodged. 3. When a customs declaration is lodged using an electronic data-processing technique, the customs authorities may also allow supporting documents to be lodged using that technique. Cus- toms authorities may accept, instead of the lodging of those docu- ments, access to the relevant data in the economic operator\u2019s computer system. However, upon request by the declarant, the customs authorities may allow those documents to be made available after release of the goods. 4. The Commission shall, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures for the implementation of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article. Section 3 Simplified customs declarations Article 109 Simplified declaration 1. The customs authorities shall, provided that the conditions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article are fulfilled, authorise any person to have goods placed under a customs procedure on the basis of a simplified declaration which may omit certain of the particulars and supporting documents referred to in Article 108. 2. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, relating to the conditions under which the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is to be given, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). 3. The Commission may, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures concern- ing the specifications to which the simplified declarations must correspond. Article 110 Supplementary declaration 1. In the case of a simplified declaration pursuant to Article 109(1), the declarant shall furnish a supplementary decla- ration containing the further particulars necessary to complete the customs declaration for the customs procedure concerned. The supplementary declaration may be of a general, periodic or recapitulative nature. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down exceptions to the first subparagraph of this paragraph, shall be adopted in accor- dance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). 2. The supplementary declaration and the simplified declara- tion referred to in Article 109(1) shall be deemed to constitute a single, indivisible instrument taking effect on the date on which the simplified declaration is accepted in accordance with Article 112. Where the simplified declaration takes the form of an entry in the declarant\u2019s records and access to those data by the customs authorities, the declaration shall take effect from the date on which the goods are entered in the records. 3. The place where the supplementary declaration is to be lodged in accordance with the authorisation shall be deemed, for the purposes of Article 55, to be the place where the customs dec- laration has been lodged. Section 4 Provisions applying to all customs declarations Article 111 Person lodging a declaration 1. Without prejudice to Article 110(1), a customs declaration may be made by any person who is able to present or make avail- able all of the documents which are required for the application of the provisions governing the customs procedure in respect of which the goods are declared. That person shall also be able to present the goods in question or to have them presented to the competent customs office. However, where acceptance of a customs declaration imposes particular obligations on a specific person, the declaration must be made by that person or by his representative. 2. The declarant shall be established in the customs territory of the Community. However, the following declarants shall not be required to be established within the Community: \u2014 persons who lodge a declaration for transit or temporary admission, \u2014 persons who declare goods occasionally, provided that the customs authorities deem this to be justified. 3. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down the cases in which, and the conditions under which, the requirements referred to in paragraph 2 may be waived, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). Article 112 Acceptance of a declaration 1. Declarations which comply with the conditions laid down in this Chapter shall be accepted by the customs authorities immediately, provided that the goods to which they refer have been presented to customs or, to the satisfaction of the customs authorities, are made available for customs controls. L 145/38 EN Official Journal of the European Union 4.6.2008 ",
        "Where the declaration takes the form of an entry in the declarant\u2019s records and access to those data by the customs authorities, the declaration shall be deemed to have been accepted at the moment at which the goods are entered in the records. The customs authorities may, without prejudice to the legal obligations of the declarant or to the application of security and safety controls, waive the obligation for the goods to be presented or to be made available for customs control. 2. Without prejudice to Article 110(2) or the second subpara- graph of paragraph 1 of this Article, where a customs declaration is lodged at a customs office other than the office at which the goods are presented, the declaration shall be accepted when the office at which the goods are presented confirms the availability of the goods for customs controls. 3. The date of acceptance of the customs declaration by the customs authorities shall, except where otherwise provided, be the date to be used for the application of the provisions govern- ing the customs procedure for which the goods are declared and for all other import or export formalities. 4. The Commission shall, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures laying down detailed rules for the implementation of this Article. Article 113 Amendment of a declaration 1. The declarant shall, at his request, be permitted to amend one or more of the particulars of the declaration after the decla- ration has been accepted by customs. The amendment shall not render the declaration applicable to goods other than those which it originally covered. 2. No such amendment shall be permitted where it is requested after any of the following events: (a) the customs authorities have informed the declarant that they intend to examine the goods; (b) the customs authorities have established that the particulars in question are incorrect; (c) the customs authorities have released the goods. 3. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down exceptions to paragraph 2(c) of this Article, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). Article 114 Invalidation of a declaration 1. The customs authorities shall, at the request of the declarant, invalidate a declaration already accepted in the following cases: (a) where they are satisfied that the goods are immediately to be placed under another customs procedure; (b) where they are satisfied that, as a result of special circum- stances, the placing of the goods under the customs proce- dure for which they were declared is no longer justified. However, where the customs authorities have informed the declarant of their intention to examine the goods, a request for invalidation of the declaration shall not be accepted before the examination has taken place. 2. The declaration shall not be invalidated after the goods have been released. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down exceptions to the first subparagraph of this paragraph, shall be adopted in accor- dance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). Section 5 Other simplifications Article 115 Facilitation of the drawing-up of customs declarations for goods falling under different tariff subheadings Where a consignment is made up of goods falling within differ- ent tariff subheadings, and dealing with each of those goods in accordance with its tariff subheadings for the purpose of drawing-up the customs declaration would entail a burden of work and expense disproportionate to the import duties charge- able, the customs authorities may, at the request of the declarant, agree that import duties be charged on the whole consignment on the basis of the tariff subheadings of the goods which are subject to the highest rate of import or export duty. The Commission may, in accordance with the regulatory proce- dure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures for the imple- mentation of this Article. Article 116 Simplification of customs formalities and controls 1.

The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down in particular rules in respect of the following: (a) the granting of the authorisations referred to in paragraph 1; (b) the cases in which review of the authorisations is to be car- ried out and the conditions under which their use is to be monitored by the customs authorities; (c) the conditions under which the authorisations are granted; 4.6.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 145/39 ",
        "(d) the conditions under which an economic operator may be authorised to carry out certain customs formalities which should in principle be carried out by the customs authorities, including the self-assessment of import and export duties, and to perform certain controls under customs supervision; (e) identification of the customs authority competent for the granting of the authorisations; (f) consultation with and provision of information to other cus- toms authorities, where appropriate; (g) the conditions under which the authorisations may be sus- pended or revoked; (h) the specific role and responsibilities of the competent cus- toms offices involved, particularly in respect of the controls to be applied; (i) the form of, and any time limit for, the completion of formalities, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). Those measures shall take account of the following: \u2014 the customs formalities to be completed and customs con- trols to be performed for security and safety purposes on goods brought into or leaving the customs territory of the Community, \u2014 the rules adopted pursuant to Article 25(3), \u2014 with regard to point (d), where more than one Member State is involved, the applicant shall hold the status of authorised economic operator in accordance with Article 14, \u2014 with regard to point (e), the place where the applicant\u2019s main accounts for customs purposes are held or accessible, facili- tating audit-based controls, and where at least part of the activities to be covered by the authorisation are to be carried out. CHAPTER 3 Verification and release of goods Section 1 Verification Article 117 Verification of a customs declaration The customs authorities may, for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of the particulars contained in a customs declaration which they have accepted: (a) examine the declaration and all of the supporting documents; (b) require the declarant to present other documents; (c) examine the goods; (d) take samples for analysis or for detailed examination of the goods. Article 118 Examination and sampling of goods 1. Transport of the goods to the places where they are to be examined and where samples are to be taken, and all the handling necessitated by such examination or taking of samples, shall be carried out by or under the responsibility of the declarant. The costs incurred shall be borne by the declarant. 2. The declarant shall have the right to be present or repre- sented when the goods are examined and when samples are taken. Where the customs authorities have reasonable grounds for so doing, they may require the declarant to be present or represented when the goods are examined or samples are taken or to provide them with the assistance necessary to facilitate such examination or taking of samples. 3. Provided that samples are taken in accordance with the pro- visions in force, the customs authorities shall not be liable for pay- ment of any compensation in respect thereof but shall bear the costs of their analysis or examination. Article 119 Partial examination and sampling of goods 1. Where only part of the goods covered by a customs decla- ration is examined, or samples are taken, the results of the partial examination, or of the analysis or examination of the samples, shall be taken to apply to all the goods covered by the same declaration. However, the declarant may request a further examination or sampling of the goods if he considers that the results of the par- tial examination, or of the analysis or examination of the samples taken, are not valid as regards the remainder of the goods declared. The request shall be granted, provided that the goods have not been released or that, if they have been released, the declarant proves that they have not been altered in any way. 2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, where a customs declara- tion covers two or more items, the particulars relating to each item shall be deemed to constitute a separate declaration. L 145/40 EN Official Journal of the European Union 4.6.2008 ",
        "3. The Commission shall, in accordance with the management procedure referred to in Article 184(3), adopt measures laying down the procedure to be followed in the event of divergent results of examinations pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article. Article 120 Results of the verification 1. The results of verifying the customs declaration shall be used for the application of the provisions governing the customs procedure under which the goods are placed. 2. Where the customs declaration is not verified, paragraph 1 shall apply on the basis of the particulars contained in the declaration. 3. The results of the verification made by the customs authori- ties shall have the same conclusive force throughout the customs territory of the Community. Article 121 Identification measures 1. The customs authorities or, where appropriate, economic operators authorised to do so by the customs authorities, shall take the measures necessary to identify the goods where identifi- cation is required in order to ensure compliance with the provi- sions governing the customs procedure for which those goods have been declared. Those identification measures shall have the same legal effect throughout the customs territory of the Community. 2. Means of identification affixed to the goods or means of transport shall be removed or destroyed only by the customs authorities or, where they are authorised to do so by the customs authorities, by economic operators, unless, as a result of unfore- seeable circumstances or force majeure , their removal or destruc- tion is essential to ensure the protection of the goods or the means of transport. Article 122 Implementing measures The Commission may, in accordance with the regulatory proce- dure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures for the imple- mentation of this Section. Section 2 Release Article 123 Release of the goods 1. Without prejudice to Article 117, where the conditions for placing the goods under the procedure concerned are fulfilled and provided that any restriction has been applied and the goods are not subject to any prohibition, the customs authorities shall release the goods as soon as the particulars in the customs decla- ration have been verified or are accepted without verification. The first subparagraph shall also apply where verification as referred to in Article 117 cannot be completed within a reason- able period of time and the goods are no longer required to be present for verification purposes. 2. All the goods covered by the same declaration shall be released at the same time. For the purposes of the first subparagraph, where a customs dec- laration covers two or more items, the particulars relating to each item shall be deemed to constitute a separate customs declaration. 3. Where the goods are presented at a customs office other than the office at which the customs declaration has been accepted, the customs authorities involved shall exchange the information necessary for the release of the goods, without preju- dice to appropriate controls. Article 124 Release dependent upon payment of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to the customs debt or provision of a guarantee 1. Where the placing of goods under a customs procedure gives rise to a customs debt, the release of the goods shall be con- ditional upon the payment of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to the customs debt or the provision of a guarantee to cover that debt. However, without prejudice to the third subparagraph, the first subparagraph shall not apply to temporary admission with par- tial relief from import duties. Where, pursuant to the provisions governing the customs proce- dure for which the goods are declared, the customs authorities require the provision of a guarantee, those goods shall not be released for the customs procedure in question until such guar- antee is provided. 2. The Commission may, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 184(2), adopt measures laying down exceptions to the first and third subparagraphs of para- graph 1 of this Article. CHAPTER 4 Disposal of goods Article 125 Destruction of goods Where the customs authorities have reasonable grounds for so doing, they may require goods which have been presented to cus- toms to be destroyed and shall inform the holder of the goods accordingly. The costs of destruction shall be borne by the holder of the goods. 4.6.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 145/41 ",
        "Article 126 Measures to be taken by the customs authorities 1. The customs authorities shall take any necessary measures, including confiscation and sale, or destruction, to dispose of goods in the following cases: (a) where one of the obligations laid down in customs legisla- tion concerning the introduction of non-Community goods into the customs territory of the Community has not been fulfilled, or the goods have been withheld from customs supervision; (b) where the goods cannot be released for any of the following reasons: (i) it has not been possible, for reasons attributable to the declarant, to undertake or continue examination of the goods within the period prescribed by the customs authorities; (ii) the documents which must be produced before the goods can be placed under, or released for, the customs procedure requested have not been made available; (iii) payments or a guarantee which should have been made or provided in respect of import or export duties, as the case may be, have not been made or provided within the period prescribed; (iv) they are subject to prohibitions or restrictions; (c) where the goods have not been removed within a reasonable period after their release; (d) where, after their release, the goods are found not to have ful- filled the conditions for that release; (e) where goods are abandoned to the State in accordance with Article 127. 2. Non-Community goods which have been abandoned to the State, seized or confiscated shall be deemed to be placed under the temporary storage procedure. Article 127 Abandonment 1. Non-Community goods and goods placed under the end- use procedure may with prior permission of the customs authori- ties be abandoned to the State by the holder of the procedure or, where applicable, the holder of the goods. 2. Abandonment shall not entail any expense for the State. The holder of the procedure or, where applicable, the holder of goods, shall bear the costs of any destruction or other disposal of goods.

Release for free circulation shall confer on non-Community goods the customs status of Community goods. CHAPTER 2 Relief from import duties Section 1 Returned goods Article 130 Scope and effect 1. Non-Community goods which, having originally been exported as Community goods from the customs territory of the Community, are returned to that territory within a period of three years and declared for release for free circulation shall, at the request of the person concerned, be granted relief from import duties. L 145/42 EN Official Journal of the European Union 4.6.2008 ",
        "2. The three-year period referred to in paragraph 1 may be exceeded in order to take account of special circumstances. 3. Where, prior to their export from the customs territory of the Community, the returned goods had been released for free cir- culation duty-free or at a reduced rate of import duty because of a particular end-use, relief from duty under paragraph 1 shall be granted only if they are to be released for free circulation for the same end-use. Where the end-use for which the goods in question are to be released for free circulation is no longer the same, the amount of import duty shall be reduced by any amount collected on the goods when they were first released for free circulation. Should the latter amount exceed that levied on the release for free circu- lation of the returned goods, no repayment shall be granted. 4. Where Community goods have lost their customs status as Community goods pursuant to Article 102(b) and are subse- quently released for free circulation, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article shall apply mutatis mutandis . 5. The relief from import duties shall be granted only if goods are reimported in the state in which they were exported. Article 131 Cases in which no relief from import duties is granted Relief from import duties provided for in Article 130 shall not be granted in the following cases: (a) goods exported from the customs territory of the Commu- nity under the outward-processing procedure, unless one of the following applies: (i) those goods remain in the state in which they were exported; (ii) the rules adopted in accordance with Article 134 allow for this; (b) goods which have benefited from measures laid down under the common agricultural policy involving their export out of the customs territory of the Community, except where the rules adopted in accordance with Article 134 allow for this. Article 132 Goods previously placed under the inward-processing procedure 1. Article 130 shall apply mutatis mutandis to processed prod- ucts which were originally re-exported from the customs territory of the Community subsequent to an inward-processing procedure. 2. At the request of the declarant and provided he submits the necessary information, the amount of import duty on the goods covered by paragraph 1 of this Article shall be determined in accordance with Article 53(3). The date of acceptance of the re-export notification shall be regarded as the date of release for free circulation. 3. The relief from import duties provided for in Article 130 shall not be granted for processed products which were exported in accordance with Article 142(2)(b), unless it is ensured that no goods will be placed under the inward-processing procedure. Section 2 Sea-fishing and products taken from the sea Article 133 Products of sea-fishing and other products taken from the sea Without prejudice to Article 36(1), the following shall be exempt from import duties when they are released for free circulation: (a) products of sea-fishing and other products taken from the territorial sea of a country or territory outside the customs territory of the Community by vessels solely registered or recorded in a Member State and flying the flag of that state; (b) products obtained from products referred to in point (a) on board factory-ships fulfilling the conditions laid down in that point.

Article 138 Discharge of a procedure 1. In cases other than the transit procedure and without preju- dice to Article 166, a special procedure shall be discharged when the goods placed under the procedure, or the processed products, are placed under a subsequent customs procedure, have left the customs territory of the Community, or have been destroyed with no waste remaining, or are abandoned to the State in accordance with Article 127. 2. The transit procedure shall be discharged by the customs authorities when they are in a position to establish, on the basis of a comparison of the data available to the customs office of departure and those available to the customs office of destination, that the procedure has ended correctly. 3.

Without prejudice to the provisions applicable to supplies or to victualling storage, where the procedure concerned so pro- vides, paragraph 1 of this Article shall not preclude the use or consumption of goods of which the release for free circulation or temporary admission would not entail application of import duties or measures laid down under the common agricultural or commercial policies. In the case of such use or consumption, no customs declaration for the release for free circulation or temporary admission proce- dure shall be required. Such declaration shall, however, be required if such goods are subject to a tariff quota or ceiling. Article 160 Bringing goods out of a free zone Without prejudice to legislation in fields other than customs, goods in a free zone may be exported or re-exported from the customs territory of the Community, or brought into another part of the customs territory of the Community.

Article 161 Customs status Where goods are brought out of a free zone into another part of the customs territory of the Community or placed under a cus- toms procedure, they shall be regarded as non-Community goods unless their customs status as Community goods has been proven by the certificate referred to in Article 158(2) or by any other sta- tus document provided for in Community customs legislation. However, for the purposes of applying export duties and export licences or export control measures laid down under the common agricultural or commercial policies, such goods shall be regarded as Community goods, unless it is established that they do not have the customs status of Community goods. CHAPTER 4 Specific use Section 1 Temporary admission Article 162 Scope 1. Under the temporary admission procedure non-Community goods intended for re-export may be used in the customs terri- tory of the Community, with total or partial relief from import duties, and without being subject to any of the following: (a) other charges as provided for under other relevant provisions in force; (b) commercial policy measures, insofar as they do not prohibit the entry or exit of goods into or from the customs territory of the Community. 2.

        "(c) the holder of the procedure is established outside the customs territory of the Community, except where otherwise pro- vided for in the customs legislation; (d) the requirements for total or partial duty relief laid down in the Community customs legislation are met. Article 163 Period during which goods may remain under the temporary admission procedure 1. The customs authorities shall determine the period within which goods placed under the temporary admission procedure must be re-exported or placed under a subsequent customs pro- cedure. Such period must be long enough for the objective of authorised use to be achieved. 2. The maximum period during which goods may remain under the temporary admission procedure for the same purpose and under the responsibility of the same authorisation holder shall be 24 months, even where the procedure was discharged by placing the goods under another special procedure and subse- quently placing them under the temporary admission procedure again. 3. Where, in exceptional circumstances, the authorised use cannot be achieved within the periods referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the customs authorities may, at the duly justified request of the authorisation holder, extend those periods for a reasonable duration. Article 164 Situations covered by temporary admission The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down the cases in which, and the conditions under which, the temporary admission proce- dure may be used and total or partial relief from import duties may be granted, shall be adopted in accordance with the regula- tory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). In adopting those measures, account shall be taken of interna- tional agreements and of the nature and the use of the goods. Article 165 Amount of import duty in case of temporary admission with partial relief from import duties 1. The amount of import duties in respect of goods placed under the temporary admission procedure with partial relief from import duties shall be set at 3 % of the amount of import duty which would have been payable on those goods had they been released for free circulation on the date on which they were placed under the temporary admission procedure. That amount shall be payable for every month or fraction of a month during which the goods have been placed under tempo- rary admission with partial relief from import duty. 2. The amount of import duty shall not exceed that which would have been payable if the goods in question had been released for free circulation on the date on which they were placed under the temporary admission procedure. Section 2 End-use Article 166 End-use procedure 1. Under the end-use procedure, goods may be released for free circulation under a duty exemption or at a reduced rate of duty on account of their specific use. They shall remain under cus- toms supervision. 2. Customs supervision under the end-use procedure shall end in the following cases: (a) where the goods have been used for the purposes laid down for the application of the duty exemption or reduced rate of duty; (b) where the goods are exported, destroyed or abandoned to the State; (c) where the goods have been used for purposes other than those laid down for the application of the duty exemption or reduced duty rate and the applicable import duties have been paid. 3. Where a rate of yield is required, Article 167 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the end-use procedure. CHAPTER 5 Processing Section 1 General provisions Article 167 Rate of yield Except where a rate of yield has been specified in Community leg- islation governing specific fields, the customs authorities shall set either the rate of yield or average rate of yield of the processing operation or where appropriate, the method of determining such rate. 4.6.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 145/51 ",
        "The rate of yield or average rate of yield shall be determined on the basis of the actual circumstances in which processing opera- tions are, or are to be, carried out. That rate may be adjusted, where appropriate, in accordance with Articles 18 and 19. Section 2 Inward processing Article 168 Scope 1. Without prejudice to Article 142, under the inward- processing procedure non-Community goods may be used in the customs territory of the Community in one or more processing operations without such goods being subject to any of the following: (a) import duties; (b) other charges as provided for under other relevant provisions in force; (c) commercial policy measures, insofar as they do not prohibit the entry or exit of goods into or from the customs territory of the Community. 2. The inward-processing procedure may be used in cases other than repair and destruction only where, without prejudice to the use of production accessories, the goods placed under the procedure can be identified in the processed products. In the case referred to in Article 142, the procedure may be used where compliance with the conditions laid down in respect of equivalent goods can be verified. 3. In addition to paragraphs 1 and 2, the inward-processing procedure may also be used for the following goods: (a) goods intended to undergo operations to ensure their com- pliance with technical requirements for their release for free circulation; (b) goods which have to undergo usual forms of handling in accordance with Article 141. Article 169 Period for discharge 1. The customs authorities shall specify the period within which the inward-processing procedure is to be discharged, in accordance with Article 138. That period shall run from the date on which the non-Community goods are placed under the procedure and shall take account of the time required to carry out the processing operations and to discharge the procedure. 2. The customs authorities may grant an extension, of reason- able duration, of the period specified pursuant to paragraph 1, on submission of a duly justified request by the holder of the authorisation. The authorisation may specify that a period which commences in the course of a calendar month, quarter or semester shall end on the last day of a subsequent calendar month, quarter or semester respectively. 3. In cases of prior exportation in accordance with Article 142(2)(b), the customs authorities shall specify the period within which the non-Community goods must be declared for the procedure. That period shall run from the date of acceptance of the export declaration relating to the processed products obtained from the corresponding equivalent goods. Article 170 Temporary re-export for further processing Subject to authorisation by the customs authorities, some or all of the goods placed under the inward-processing procedure, or the processed products, may be temporarily re-exported for the purpose of further processing outside the customs territory of the Community, in accordance with the conditions laid down for the outward-processing procedure. Section 3 Outward processing Article 171 Scope 1. Under the outward-processing procedure Community goods may be temporarily exported from the customs territory of the Community in order to undergo processing operations. The processed products resulting from those goods may be released for free circulation with total or partial relief from import duties at the request of the holder of the authorisation or any other per- son established in the customs territory of the Community pro- vided that that person has obtained the consent of the holder of the authorisation and the conditions of the authorisation are fulfilled. 2. Outward processing shall not be allowed for the following Community goods: (a) goods the export of which gives rise to repayment or remis- sion of import duties; (b) goods which, prior to exportation, were released for free cir- culation under a duty exemption or at a reduced rate of duty by virtue of their end-use, for as long as the purposes of such end-use have not been fulfilled, unless those goods have to undergo repair operations; (c) goods the export of which gives rise to the granting of export refunds; L 145/52 EN Official Journal of the European Union 4.6.2008 ",
        "(d) goods in respect of which a financial advantage other than refunds referred to in point (c) is granted under the common agricultural policy by virtue of the exportation of those goods. 3. In cases not covered by Articles 172 and 173 and where ad valorem duties are involved, the amount of the import duty shall be calculated on the basis of the cost of the processing operation undertaken outside the customs territory of the Community. The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, laying down the rules for such calculation and the rules where specific duties are involved, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 184(4). 4. The customs authorities shall specify the period within which goods temporarily exported must be reimported into the customs territory of the Community in the form of processed products, and placed under release for free circulation, in order to be able to benefit from total or partial relief from import duties. They may, extend that period, for a reasonable duration, on sub- mission of a duly justified request by the holder of the authorisation. Article 172 Goods repaired free of charge 1. Where it is established to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that goods have been repaired free of charge, either because of a contractual or statutory obligation arising from a guarantee or because of a manufacturing or material defect, they shall be granted total relief from import duties. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply where account was taken of the manufacturing or material defect at the time when the goods in question were first released for free circulation. Article 173 Standard exchange system 1. Under the standard exchange system an imported product, hereinafter referred to as a \u2018replacement product\u2019, may, in accor- dance with paragraphs 2 to 5, replace a processed product. 2. The customs authorities shall authorise the standard exchange system to be used where the processing operation involves the repair of defective Community goods other than those subject to measures laid down under the common agricul- tural policy or to the specific arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products. 3. Replacement products shall have the same eight-digit Com- bined Nomenclature code, the same commercial quality and the same technical characteristics as the defective goods had the lat- ter undergone repair. 4. Where the defective goods have been used before export, the replacement products must also have been used. The customs authorities shall, however, waive the requirement set out in the first subparagraph if the replacement product has been supplied free of charge, either because of a contractual or statu- tory obligation arising from a guarantee or because of a material or manufacturing defect. 5. The provisions which would be applicable to the processed products shall apply to the replacement products. Article 174 Prior importation of replacement products 1. The customs authorities shall, under the conditions they lay down, and at the request of the person concerned, authorise replacement products to be imported before the defective goods are exported. In the event of such prior importation of a replacement product, a guarantee shall be provided covering the amount of the import duty that would be payable should the defective goods not be exported in accordance with paragraph 2. 2. The defective goods shall be exported within a period of two months from the date of acceptance by the customs authorities of the declaration for the release for free circulation of the replace- ment products. 3. Where, in exceptional circumstances, the defective goods cannot be exported within the period referred to in paragraph 2, the customs authorities may, at the duly justified request of the person concerned, extend that period for a reasonable duration.

        "REGULATION (EC) No 451/2008 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 23 April 2008 establishing a new statistical classification of products by activity (CPA) and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 3696/93 (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EURO- PEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Commu- nity, and in particular Article 285(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 1 ), Whereas: (1) Regulation (EEC) No 3696/93 ( 2 ) established the statistical classification of products by activity (CPA) in the European Economic Community. (2) In order to reflect the technological development and structural changes of the economy, an up-to-date CPA should be established. (3) The structuring of a product classification in accordance with the production activity involved avoids proliferation of unrelated coding schemes, and facilitates the identifica- tion by producers of relevant markets. (4) There is a need to create a reference framework within which statistical data on production, consumption, exter- nal trade and transport can be compared. (5) An up-to-date CPA is central to the Commission\u2019s ongo- ing efforts to overhaul Community statistics; it is expected to convey, through more comparable and relevant data, better economic governance at Community and national level. (6) In order to function, the internal market requires statistical standards applicable to the collection, transmission and publication of national and Community statistics so that enterprises, financial institutions, governments and all other operators in the internal market can be provided with reliable and comparable statistical data. To this end, it is vital that the various categories of the CPA be inter- preted uniformly in all the Member States. (7) Reliable and comparable statistics are necessary to enable enterprises to assess their competitiveness, and are useful to the Community institutions in preventing distortions of competition. (8) The establishment of a common statistical classification of products by economic activity does not per se oblige Mem- ber States to collect, publish or supply data. Only if the Member States use product classifications linked to the Community classification is it possible to provide inte- grated information with the reliability, speed, flexibility and degree of detail required for the management of the internal market. (9) Provision should be made to enable the Member States, in order to meet their national requirements, to integrate into their national classifications additional categories based on the CPA. (10) The international comparability of economic statistics requires that the Member States and the Community insti- tutions use classifications of products which are directly linked to the Central Product Classification (CPC) Ver. 2, as adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission. (11) Use of the CPA requires that the Commission be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee established by Coun- cil Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom ( 3 ) in particular as regards examining problems arising from the implementation of the CPA and incorporating amendments to the CPA. (12) The establishment of a new statistical classification of products implies a need to amend specifically references to the CPA. It is therefore necessary to repeal Regulation (EEC) No 3696/93. (13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers con- ferred on the Commission ( 4 ). In particular, the Commis- sion should be empowered to amend the CPA in order to take account of technological or economic developments and align it with other economic and social classifications. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Deci- sion 1999/468/EC.

        "(14) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the establish- ment of a new CPA, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective. (15) The Statistical Programme Committee has been consulted, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Subject matter and scope 1. This Regulation establishes a new common CPA within the Community in order to ensure relevance with respect to the eco- nomic reality and comparability between national, Community and international classifications and hence national, Community and international statistics. 2. The term \u2018product\u2019 shall refer to outputs of economic activi- ties, whether goods or services. 3. This Regulation shall apply to the use of the classification for statistical purposes only. Article 2 The levels and the structure of the CPA 1. The CPA shall comprise: (a) a first level, comprising headings identified by an alphabeti- cal code (sections); (b) a second level, comprising headings identified by a two-digit numerical code (divisions); (c) a third level, comprising headings identified by a three-digit numerical code (groups); (d) a fourth level, comprising headings identified by a four-digit numerical code (classes); (e) a fifth level, comprising headings identified by a five-digit numerical code (categories); and (f) a sixth level, comprising headings identified by a six-digit numerical code (subcategories). 2. The CPA is set out in the Annex. Article 3 Use of the CPA The Commission shall use the CPA for all statistics classified according to products by activity. Article 4 National classifications of products by economic activity 1. Member States may use the CPA for aggregated or detailed, national, specific or functional adaptation based on the subcat- egories of the CPA. 2. Those classifications shall be related to the CPA in accor- dance with the following rules: (a) classifications that are more aggregated than the CPA shall comprise precise aggregations of CPA subcategories; (b) classifications that are more detailed than the CPA shall com- prise headings that are wholly contained within CPA subcategories. The classifications that are derived in accordance with this para- graph may have a different coding. 3. Member States may use a national classification of products by economic activity derived from the CPA.

        "REGULATION (EC) No 452/2008 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 23 April 2008 concerning the production and development of statistics on education and lifelong learning (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EURO- PEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Commu- nity, and in particular Article 285(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, After consultation of the European Economic and Social Committee, Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 1 ), Whereas: (1) The Council Resolution of 5 December 1994 on the pro- motion of education and training statistics in the European Union ( 2 ) requested the Commission, in close cooperation with the Member States, to expedite the development of education and training statistics. (2) The European Council held in Brussels on 22 and 23 March 2005 agreed to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy. It concluded that Europe must renew the basis of its competitiveness, increase its growth potential and its productivity and strengthen social cohesion, placing the main emphasis on knowledge, innovation and the optimisation of human capital. In that respect, the employability, adaptability and mobility of citizens is vital for Europe. (3) To attain these objectives, European systems of education and training must adapt to the requirements of the knowl- edge society and the need for an enhanced level of educa- tion and better quality employment. Statistics on education, training and lifelong learning are of the highest importance as a basis for political decisions. (4) Lifelong learning is a key element in developing and pro- moting a skilled, trained and adaptable workforce. In the Presidency Conclusions of the Spring 2005 European Council it was stressed that \u2018human capital is Europe\u2019s most important asset\u2019. The Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs including the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, endorsed by the Council in its Deci- sion 2005/600/EC ( 3 ), aim to contribute better to the Lis- bon strategy and to establish comprehensive lifelong learning strategies. (5) The adoption in February 2001 of the Council Report \u2018Objectives of the education and training systems\u2019 and the adoption in February 2002 of the work programme for 2001-2011 on the follow-up to this report constitute an important step in honouring the commitment to modern- ise and improve the quality of the education and training systems of the Member States. Indicators and reference lev- els of European average performance (\u2018benchmarks\u2019) are among the instruments of the open method of coordina- tion which are important for the \u2018Education and Training 2010\u2019 work programme. The Ministers of Education took a decisive step in May 2003 by agreeing on five European benchmarks to be attained by 2010, while stressing they do not define national targets or prescribe decisions to be taken by national governments. (6) On 24 May 2005, the Council adopted Conclusions on \u2018New indicators in education and training\u2019 ( 4 ). In these Con- clusions the Council invited the Commission to present to the Council strategies and proposals for the development of new indicators in nine particular areas of education and training and also stressed that the development of new indicators should fully respect the responsibility of Mem- ber States for the organisation of their education systems and should not impose undue administrative or financial burdens on the organisation and institutions concerned, or inevitably lead to an increased number of indicators used to monitor progress. (7) The Council also adopted, in November 2004, Conclu- sions on European cooperation in vocational education and training, and agreed that priority should be given at European level to \u2018the improvement of the scope, precision and reliability of vocational education and training statis- tics in order to enable evaluation of progress\u2019.

        "(8) Comparable statistical information at Community level is essential for the development of education and lifelong learning strategies and for the monitoring of progress in their implementation. Statistical production should be based on a framework of coherent concepts and compa- rable data in view of the establishment of an integrated European statistical information system on education, training and lifelong learning. (9) When applying this Regulation, account should be taken of the notion of people at a disadvantage in the labour market referred to in the Guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States. (10) The Commission (Eurostat) is collecting data on vocational training in enterprises in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1552/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the statistics relating to vocational training in enterprises ( 1 ). However, a broader legal framework is necessary to ensure the sustainable pro- duction and development of statistics on education and lifelong learning, covering at least all relevant existing and planned activities. The Commission (Eurostat) is collecting annual data on education from the Member States on a voluntary basis, through a joint action carried out with the Unesco Institute for Statistics (UIS) and with the Organisa- tion for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), usually referred to as the \u2018UOE data collection\u2019. The Com- mission (Eurostat) is also collecting data on education, training and lifelong learning through other household sources such as the European Union Labour Force Sur- vey ( 2 ) and the Community statistics on income and living conditions ( 3 ) as well as through their ad-hoc modules. (11) Since policy formulation and monitoring in the field of education and lifelong learning is of a dynamic nature and adapts to an evolving environment, the statistical regula- tory framework should provide for a certain degree of flex- ibility in a limited and controlled manner, taking into account the burden for respondents and the Member States. (12) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the creation of common statistical standards that permit the production of harmonised data cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective. (13) The production of specific Community statistics is gov- erned by the rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics ( 4 ). (14) This Regulation ensures full respect for the right to the pro- tection of personal data as provided for in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. (15) The transmission of data subject to statistical confidential- ity is governed by the rules set out in Regulation (EC) No 322/97 and in Council Regulation (Euratom, EEC) No 1588/90 of 11 June 1990 on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical Office of the European Communities ( 5 ). (16) Commission Regulation (EC) No 831/2002 of 17 May 2002 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 on Community statistics concerning access to confidential data for scientific purposes ( 6 ) established the conditions pursuant to which access to confidential data transmitted to the Community authority may be granted. (17) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers con- ferred on the Commission ( 7 ). (18) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to select and specify the subjects of the statistics, their char- acteristics in response to policy or technical needs, the breakdown of characteristics, the observation period and deadlines for transmission of results, the quality require- ments including the required precision and the quality reporting framework. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accor- dance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny pro- vided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.

        "2. Whenever possible, the Commission (Eurostat) shall seek cooperation with the UIS, the OECD and other international organisations with a view to ensuring international comparabil- ity of data and to avoid duplication of effort, in particular as regards the development and improvement of statistical concepts and methods and the delivery of statistics by the Member States. 3. Whenever significant new data requirements or insufficient quality of data are identified and before any data collection, the Commission (Eurostat) shall institute pilot studies to be com- pleted on a voluntary basis by the Member States. Such pilot stud- ies shall be carried out in order to assess the feasibility of the relevant data collection, taking into consideration the benefits of the availability of the data in relation to the collection costs and the burden on respondents. Pilot studies shall not necessarily lead to corresponding implementing measures. Article 5 Transmission of micro-data on individuals When necessary for the production of Community statistics, Member States shall transmit confidential micro-data resulting from sample surveys to the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with the provisions on the transmission of data subject to confi- dentiality set out in Regulation (EC) No 322/97 and in Regula- tion (Euratom, EEC) No 1588/90. Member States shall ensure that the transmitted data do not permit the direct identification of the statistical units (individuals). Article 6 Implementing measures 1.

Scope The data collection shall cover all domestic educational activities regardless of ownership of, or sponsorship by, the insti- tutions concerned (whether public or private, national or foreign) and of the education delivery mechanism. Correspond- ingly, the coverage of the data collections shall extend to all student types and age groups. 3. Subjects covered Data shall be collected on: (a) students\u2019 enrolment, including the characteristics of the students; (b) entrants; (c) graduates and graduations; (d) education expenditure; (e) educational personnel; (f) foreign languages learnt; (g) class sizes; allowing the calculation of indicators on the inputs, processes and outputs of the education and training systems. Appropriate information (metadata) shall be transmitted by Member States, describing specificities of national educa- tion and training systems and their correspondence with international classifications as well as any deviations from the specifications of the data request and any other information which is essential for the interpretation of data and the com- pilation of comparable indicators. 4. Periodicity Data and metadata shall be supplied annually, if not otherwise specified, within the deadlines agreed between the Com- mission (Eurostat) and the national authorities taking into account the latest agreements between the UIS, the OECD and the Commission (Eurostat). Domain 2: Participation of adults in lifelong learning 1. Aim The aim of this survey shall be to provide comparable data on participation and non-participation of adults in lifelong learning.

        "2. Scope The statistical unit shall be the individual, covering at least the population age range of 25-64 years. In the case of the collection of information through a survey, proxy answers shall be avoided, wherever possible. 3. Subjects covered Subjects covered by the survey shall be: (a) participation and non-participation in learning activities; (b) characteristics of these learning activities; (c) information on self-reported skills; (d) socio-demographic information. Data on participation in social and cultural activities shall also be collected on a voluntary basis as explanatory variables useful for further analysis of the participants and non-participants\u2019 profiles. 4. Data sources and sample size The data source shall be a sample survey. Administrative data sources may be used to reduce the burden on respon- dents. Sample size shall be established on the basis of precision requirements that shall not require effective national sample sizes to be larger than 5 000 individuals, calculated on the assumption of simple random sampling. Within these limits, specific subpopulations shall require particular sampling considerations. 5. Periodicity Data shall be collected every five years. The first year of implementation shall be 2010, at the earliest. Domain 3: Other statistics on education and lifelong learning 1. Aim The aim of this data collection shall be to provide further comparable data on education and lifelong learning to support specific policies at the Community level not included in Domains 1 and 2. 2. Scope Other statistics on education and lifelong learning shall refer to the following aspects: (a) statistics on education and the economy, required at Community level for monitoring policies on education, research, competitiveness and growth; (b) statistics on education and the labour market, required at Community level for monitoring employment policies; (c) statistics on education and social inclusion, required at Community level for monitoring policies on poverty, social inclusion and migrant integration. For the aspects listed above, the necessary data shall be acquired from existing Community statistical sources. 4.6.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 145/233 ",
        "REGULATION (EC) No 453/2008 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 23 April 2008 on quarterly statistics on Community job vacancies (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EURO- PEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Commu- nity, and in particular Article 285(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank ( 2 ), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 3 ), Whereas: (1) On 8 December 2003, the Council endorsed the develop- ment and publication of a structural indicator on job vacancies. (2) The Action Plan on EMU Statistical Requirements, which was endorsed by the Council on 29 September 2000, and subsequent progress reports on the implementation of that plan, identified as a priority the development of a legal basis covering job vacancy statistics. (3) The Employment Committee established by Council Deci- sion 2000/98/EC ( 4 ) endorses the need for an indicator for job vacancies in order to monitor the European Employ- ment Strategy laid down in Council Decision 2005/600/EC of 12 July 2005 on Guidelines for the employment poli- cies of the Member States ( 5 ). (4) Decision No 1672/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 2006 establishing a Community Programme for Employment and Social Soli- darity \u2014 Progress ( 6 ), provides for the financing of the rel- evant actions, including, as specified therein, improving the understanding of the employment situation and pros- pects, in particular through analysis and studies and the development of statistics and common indicators within the framework of the European Employment Strategy. (5) Data on job vacancies broken down, inter alia, by eco- nomic activity are required by the Commission in the framework of the European Employment Strategy for monitoring and analysis of the level and structure of labour demand. (6) Readily available quarterly data on job vacancies are required by the Commission and by the European Central Bank to monitor short-term changes in job vacancies. Sea- sonally adjusted job vacancy data facilitate the interpreta- tion of quarterly changes. (7) Data provided on job vacancies should be relevant and complete, accurate and comprehensive, timely, coherent, comparable, and readily accessible to users. (8) The benefits of collecting complete data at Community level on all segments of the economy should be balanced against the reporting possibilities of, and the response bur- den on, small and medium-sized enterprises in particular. (9) Particular efforts should be made to include in the statis- tics as soon as possible all data concerning units with fewer than 10 employees. (10) To determine the scope of the statistics to be compiled and the level of detail required by economic activity, it is nec- essary to apply the version of the statistical classification system for economic activities in the Community (NACE) that is currently in force. (11) In the production and dissemination of Community statis- tics under this Regulation, the national and Community statistical authorities should take account of the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice, which was adopted by the Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom ( 7 ) on 24 February 2005 and attached to the Recommenda- tion of the Commission on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities. (12) It is important that the data be shared with the social part- ners at national and Community level and that the social partners be informed concerning the implementation of this Regulation. Furthermore, Member States should make a particular effort to ensure that school career guidance services and vocational training bodies receive the data. ( 1 ) OJ C 175, 27.7.2007, p. 11.

        "(13) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics ( 1 ) provides a general legislative framework for the production of Community statistics and applies, therefore, to the production of job vacancy statistics. (14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers con- ferred on the Commission ( 2 ). (15) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to define certain concepts; determine certain reference dates, formats and deadlines; set out the framework for feasibil- ity studies, and adopt measures pursuant to the results of those studies. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non- essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC. (16) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the produc- tion of Community job vacancy statistics, cannot be suffi- ciently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of sub- sidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is neces- sary to achieve that objective. (17) The Statistical Programme Committee has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Subject matter and scope 1. This Regulation lays down the requirements for the regular quarterly production of statistics on Community job vacancies. 2.

Covering agriculture, forestry and fishing activities, as defined by the NACE in force, shall be optional. Member States that wish to provide data for those sec- tors shall do so in accordance with this Regulation. Owing to the growing importance of personal care services (residential care activities and social work activities without accommodation) for job creation, Member States are also requested to transmit, on an optional basis, data on job vacancies for such services. The data shall be broken down by economic activity in accor- dance with the NACE in force at section level. 3. Covering public administration and defence, compulsory social security, education, human health and social work activi- ties, arts, entertainments and recreation and activities of member- ship organisations, repair of computers and personal and household goods and other personal service activities, as defined by the NACE in force, within the scope of this Regulation, and of units with fewer than 10 employees, shall be determined taking into account the feasibility studies referred to in Article 7. Article 2 Definitions For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply: 1. \u2018job vacancy\u2019 shall mean a paid post that is newly created, unoccupied, or about to become vacant: (a) for which the employer is taking active steps and is pre- pared to take further steps to find a suitable candidate from outside the enterprise concerned; and (b) which the employer intends to fill either immediately or within a specific period of time. The concepts \u2018active steps to find a suitable candidate\u2019 and \u2018specific period of time\u2019 shall be defined in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 9(2).

        "REGULATION (EC) No 454/2008 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 21 May 2008 amending Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movements of pet animals, as regards the extension of the transitional period THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EURO- PEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Commu- nity, and in particular Articles 37 and 152(4)(b) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), After consulting the Committee of the Regions, Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 2 ), Whereas: (1) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 ( 3 ) lays down the animal health requirements applicable to non-commercial move- ments of pet animals and the rules applying to checks on such movements. (2) In addition, Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 pro- vides that for a transitional period of five years from the date of entry into force of that Regulation, the entry of pet dogs and cats into the territories of Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom is subject to special requirements, taking into account the particular situations in those Mem- ber States with regard to rabies. (3) Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 provides that for a transitional period of five years from the date of entry into force of that Regulation, those Member States which have special rules for the control of echinococcosis and ticks on that date may make the entry of pet animals into their territories subject to compliance with those require- ments. Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom apply their specific entry rules relating to echi- nococcosis; Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom require pet dogs and cats to undergo additional treatment against ticks that must also be certified in the animals\u2019 passports. (4) The transitional regimes provided for in Articles 6 and 16 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 expire on 3 July 2008. Article 23 of that Regulation provides that the transitional regimes are to be reviewed before the end of the transi- tional period. (5) To that end and pursuant to Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003, the Commission was required to submit to the European Parliament and to the Council, before 1 February 2007, a report on the need to maintain the serological test, together with appropriate proposals for determining the regime to be applied after the transitional regimes provided for in Articles 6, 8 and 16 of that Regu- lation. That report should be based on the experience gained so far and on a risk evaluation, to be based on a sci- entific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). (6) At the Commission\u2019s request, EFSA issued a scientific opin- ion to assist the Commission in proposing appropriate, science-based amendments to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003. In addition the Commission had also to consider reports by Member States on their experience with the implementation of Articles 6, 8 and 16 of that Regulation. (7) However, because the scientific assessment has taken longer than envisaged, the Commission\u2019s report has been delayed. To enable sufficient account to be taken of the conclusions of the report, the expiry of the transitional regimes should be postponed. (8) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 is hereby amended as follows: 1. in Article 6(1), the introductory phrase shall be replaced by the following: \u20181.
