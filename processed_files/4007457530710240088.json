Geographically, we brought the international community together to help the ongoing reform and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and the Central African Republic. We began to implement the historic Iran nuclear agreement, and we supported a peace deal in Colombia which ended the world's longest internal conflict. In terms of our cross-cutting strategic priorities, we continued to help improve long-term resilience and stability in our partner countries, through the promotion of good governance and human rights, and by strengthening our security and crises management toolbox. We stepped up our efforts to address the root causes, challenges and opportunities of migration, supporting host communities in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey in particular. We provided financial support to the countries along the Western Balkans migration route. And we continued to deliver education in emergencies, mainstream gender equality throughout all of our actions, and redouble our efforts to tackle climate change. Thanks to our efforts almost 200 000 people received new skills and training to improve their economic and job prospects; more than 1 million gained access to sustainable energy; and over 12 million hectares of our rich natural heritage and biodiversity were better protected. This is just a snapshot of the many stories of hope that you will read in the pages of this report. In an increasingly challenging and unpredictable world, we showed that inclusive and supportive global action can bring real results for citizens, both at home and abroad. FOREWORD 2016 was another year of profound challenges, both at home and abroad. Ongoing tensions on our Eastern border, in the Middle East, and in Africa directly affected the security and prosperity of our citizens, while continuing to fuel one of the deadliest years on record for migrants and refugees en route to Europe. Omran, the young Syrian boy sitting in an ambulance covered in the debris of war, became the symbol of this ongoing instability. In the midst of this uncertainty the EU stood true to our founding values, and stood firm against protectionism and the temptation to retreat behind borders. We continued to show solidarity with those who need it the most; to shape world events and not just react to them; and to adapt our policy responses in order to deliver on our global promises. The new Global Strategy for the EU's Foreign and Secu- rity Policy reaffirmed the core priorities and principles of our external actions, and set out a roadmap for a more credible, responsible and responsive EU. We published proposals for a new European Consensus on Development, and a new partnership with the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of states beyond 2020. President Juncker also announced a new External Investment Plan, designed to drive major sustainable investment in Africa and the European Neighbourhood. Together with our Member States, the EU was once again the largest donor of development and humanitarian aid, supporting over 120 million people in more than 80 coun- tries. We rolled out our revised European Neighbourhood Policy, focusing on stabilisation and economic development, and started to identify with each partner the most urgent shared priorities for co-operation on improved governance, economic growth, security, mobility, and energy and climate change. We continued to advance the enlargement agenda, reaffirming the \"fundamentals first\" approach, addressing High Representative Mogherini High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy / Vice-President of the Commission Commissioner Mimica Member of the European Commission for International Cooperation and Development Commissioner Hahn Member of the European Commission for European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations Commissioner Stylianides Member of the European Commission for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management \u00a9 E U \u00a9 E U \u00a9 E U \u00a9 E U ",
        "2017 Annual Report on the implementation of the European Union\u2019s instruments for financing external actions in 2016 6 7 GLOBAL COMMITMENTS In 2016, the European Union started engaging in discussions about the Future of Europe, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed at the UN General Assembly in 2015, and it also laid out a Global Strategy for the EU's Foreign and Security Policy (Global Strategy). Global Strategy for the EU's Foreign and Security Policy (Global Strategy) A Stronger Global Actor The 2016 Global Strategy aims to create a \u201cShared Vision\" and \"Common Action\u201d for a \"stronger Europe\" (1) . The strategy sets out core EU interests and principles, and provides a road map for a more credible, responsible and responsive EU in the world, which will guide EU actions for many years to come. The objectives of EU external action and the vision of the 2030 Agenda are fully consistent, and the SDGs will be a cross-cutting dimension for the implementation of the EU's Global Strategy. In line with this strategy, the EU in 2016 focused on its five priority policy areas: investing in the resilience of states and societies to the East and South of Europe and providing an integrated approach to conflicts and crises; strengthening security and defence; reinforcing the internal/ external policy nexus, with special attention to migration; updating existing or preparing new regional and thematic strategies; and stepping up public diplomacy efforts. During 2016, the EU and its Member States remained the world's largest provider of development funding, contributing more than half of official development assistance (ODA) globally. The European Commission alone disbursed over EUR 10.3 billion in ODA on behalf of the EU with the aim of reducing poverty in the world, ensuring sustainable economic, social and environmental development, and promoting democracy, the rule of law, good governance and the respect of human rights. In response to the many human-made and natural disasters that took place in 2016, the EU's humanitarian aid budget in 2016 was the highest ever, at EUR 2.3 billion (including EDF reinforcements) providing relief assistance including food, shelter, protection, healthcare and clean water to more than 120 million people in over 80 countries. 1 http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/top_stories/pdf/eugs_review_web.pdf 2 http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/fpi/documents/140311_icsp_reg_230_2014_en.pdf 3 JOIN(2016) 18 final, 6.4.2016 The EU works continuously for a peaceful world and has led and supported negotiations to reduce tensions around the world. In 2016 these included the start of the imple- mentation of the historic international agreement on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme and the peace agreement between the Government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) movement in Colombia . Throughout the year, the EU also continued to play a leading role in international efforts addressing crises in Ukraine and working with its international partners to provide support in Syria, Iraq and Libya against the activities of Da'esh. The Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP) (2) is one of the instruments through which the EU can fulfil its role as a \"Stronger Global Actor\" by increasing the efficiency and coherence of the Union's actions in the areas of crisis response, conflict prevention, peace-building and crisis preparedness, and in addressing global and trans-re- gional threats. Crisis response actions allow an immediate reaction to unforeseen events; a key asset to enable the EU to quickly establish political projects that can help with sensitive diplomatic processes and conflict situations, and to create new avenues for dialogue and conflict resolution. This Instrument also caters for the need to provide support for building and strengthening the capacity of civil society and other organisations involved in peace-building. The EU further increased third countries' resilience and preparedness to protect their strategic assets when threat- ened by a range of potential hybrid attacks from terrorism to organised crime and Chemical, Biological, Radioactive and Nuclear (CBRN) risk mitigation, as shown by the Joint Communication on Countering Hybrid Threats (3) .

        "2017 Annual Report on the implementation of the European Union\u2019s instruments for financing external actions in 2016 8 9 New Consensus on Development Post-Cotonou Gender In September 2015, the international community responded to arising new trends and global challenges by adopting the 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (4) . In response to this, the European Commission presented in 2016 a proposal for a new European Consensus on Development (5) , which aligns EU development policy with the 2030 Agenda while taking due account of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The new European Consensus on Devel- opment, signed in June 2017, after trilateral discussions with the European Parliament and the Council, provides a shared vision and framework for action for development cooperation for the European Union and its Member States. The current Cotonou Partnership Agreement between the EU and 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) coun- tries will expire in 2020. The agreement has been the largest, most comprehensive and longest-lasting geographical partnership in the world . It has helped to reduce poverty, increase stability and integrate the ACP countries into the global economy. Since its foundation, the EU has been committed to gender equality and women's and girls\u2019 rights and empowerment. The Gender Action Plan in External Relations 2016- 2020 (7) sets out an ambitious framework for action to support inclusion of gender perspectives in all EU programme designs, policy and political dialogues with partner coun- tries, and in international negotiations, and to strengthen partnerships with all relevant stakeholders. It covers four Following wide consultation, the 2016 Joint Communication \"A renewed partnership with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific\" (6) , set out the building blocks required to create a stronger, renewed political partnership with the ACP countries based on a true partnership of equals and finding common solutions to common concerns. main pillars: ensuring the physical and psychological integrity of girls and women, including through fighting all forms of violence and harmful practices; economic and social empowerment; strengthening women\u2019s voice and participation; and shifting institutional culture. In 2016 the groundwork for delivery was set up such as national analysis studies. It promotes a coherent approach to people, planet, pros- perity, peace and partnership (the \"five Ps\" of the 2030 Agenda). Poverty eradication remains the primary objective, while integrating comprehensively the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable develop- ment. The Consensus on Development reaffirms the EU's commitment to Policy Coherence for Development (PCD), which requires taking into account the objectives of development cooperation in policies which are likely to affect developing countries, as an important contribution for the achievement of the SDGs in partner countries. MAINSTREAMING GENDER ISSUES IN ZAMBIA Development cooperation with Zambia, specifically through the European Development Fund (EDF) portfolio, demonstrates good practice in strength- ening gender mainstreaming , with consistent attention to gender equality across the different programmes and activities. For example, attention to women traders in the agriculture sector, a focus on gender issues in gov- ernance, and the integration of gender issues in the policy dialogue. 4 Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development , Resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 September 2015 (UNGA A/RES/70/1) 5 Final text: OJ 2017/C 210/01, 30 June 2017 6 JOIN(2016) 52 final, 22.11.2016 7 SWD(2015) 182 final, 21.9.2015; Council conclusions 13183/15, 26.10.2015 Gender equality ",
        "2017 Annual Report on the implementation of the European Union\u2019s instruments for financing external actions in 2016 10 11 The EU flagship initiative the Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA+) updated its strategy to reflect the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda and organised a global learning event in Brussels in September attracting over 250 participants from 45 countries. The GCCA+ approved seven new country actions in 2016, continuing its support to the most vulnerable countries (Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and least devel- oped countries (LDCs)). In total, contributions from the EU and its member states to support developing countries in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and coping with the impacts of climate change stood at EUR 20.2billion in 2016 (out of which EUR 2.7 billion from the EU budget and the European Development Fund, and EUR 1.9 billion from the European Investment Bank). (8) In 2016 the EU undertook human rights dialogues and consultations with 43 partner countries and regional groupings and continued supporting human rights civil society organisations and human rights defenders. A new multi-sector approach was introduced to fight corrup- tion. This will further strengthen connexions across a wide array of sectors (justice, public administration reform, security sector reform, improvement of the business environment and customs reform) and actors exercising some form of oversight and control function (civil society, media, whis- tle-blowers, Supreme Audit Institutions, and Parliaments). In addition to sound policies, major investments will be needed to meet the SDGs, in particular in developing countries. ODA in the form of grants remains essential, but must be complemented with other tools and sources of finance such as domestic resource mobilisation or private investments. The implementation of the innovative action agenda agreed upon in 2015 at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa (11) that addresses all sources of finance, and covers cooperation on a range of issues including technology, science, innovation, trade and capacity building was taken forward in 2016. Sustainable Energy and Climate Change Human Rights and Good Governance Financing for Development Under the Partnership Instrument (9) , the EU continued to adopt new climate actions with strategic partners such as China, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea. These actions underpin the leading global role of the EU in addressing climate change and supporting the transition towards low carbon economies. The European Commission is working to improve access to reliable and sustainable sources of energy as a \u201cgreen\u201d engine for growth. Through commitments made in 2016, the European Commission aims to improve access to energy for 40 million people globally (30 million in Africa), increase renewable energies by six and a half gigawatts (GW) globally and five GW in Africa, and save 15 million tonnes globally (11 tonnes in Africa) of carbon dioxide emissions annually by 2020. Supporting partner countries in their transformation of security systems is a key element for improving govern- ance. Upholding fundamental freedoms and assessing in a participatory way the security needs of different groups, including the most vulnerable, are among the key objec- tives of the new EU-wide strategic framework to support Security Sector Reform (SSR) (10) . The proposed European External Investment Plan (EIP) (12) is a clear illustration of the EU\u2019s strong commitment to deliver on this agenda. The EIP enacts the agenda's new philosophy on broad means of implementation to achieve the SDGs. The new European Fund for Sustainable Development will be the EU's main tool to attract private and public invest- ments to poor and fragile countries. It represents a new integrated way of working with the EU\u2019s partner countries, Member States, international financial institutions, other donors and the private sector to improve investment in Africa and the EU Neighbourhood to promote decent job creation, sustainable development and tackle the root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement. 8 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/10/17/climate-finance-eu/ 9 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32014R0234 10 JOIN(2016) 31 final, 5.7.2016 11 https://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffd3/ 12 Commission Communication COM(2016) 581final; http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-3006_en.htm FARMER FIELD SCHOOLS IN MALAWI To tackle climate change in Malawi and promote a resilient agriculture, the GCCA+ developed the Farmer Field Schools to enhance sustainable agriculture .

        "2017 Annual Report on the implementation of the European Union\u2019s instruments for financing external actions in 2016 12 13 GLOBAL IMPACT In 2016, the EU stepped up efforts to deliver on its commitments on migration and mobility in line with the 2015 European Agenda on Migration (13) . The European Commission services responded to the immediate situations created by large-scale influx of refugees and migrants, while also addressing the root causes of migration. Tack- ling the longer-term challenges \u2013 and opportunities \u2013 of migration and forced displacement is an integral part of the EU\u2019s integrated development policy and cooperation. To address the challenges brought about by rising numbers of migrants and refugees, risking their lives to reach Europe, the EU took a series of measures. Following the EU-Turkey Statement of 18 March 2016 (14) and the effective closure of the Western Balkans route, migrant crossings and lives lost were significantly reduced. Despite those efforts, 2016 saw the greatest loss of lives so far in terms of migrants and refugees en route to Europe, with deaths on the Central Mediterranean route from Libya rising rapidly. The EU increased its support and dialogue with all stakeholders active on migration issues in Libya, with a view to improving the management of migration flows. The new results-oriented Partnership Framework (15) was launched in June 2016, establishing a new EU approach on migration by reinforcing cooperation with its priority partner countries. Combining immediate and longer-term measures, the framework aims to save lives, combat smuggling and trafficking, and address the root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement. In April 2016, the European Commission published its Communication \"Lives in Dignity: from Aid-dependence to Self-reliance; Forced Displacement and Development\" (16) , reinforcing the EU's development-oriented approach on forced displacement . This policy framework, which Migration and Mobility Security and Development nexus includes support to both displaced populations and host communities, represented an important EU contribution to the World Humanitarian Summit that took place in May 2016 and guides the EU\u2019s financial assistance on forced displacement. In terms of financial assistance , and due to the rapidly evolving migration situation described above, the EU funding was quickly mobilised, including the EUR 3 billion contribution by the EU and its Member States coordinated through the EU Facility for Refugees in Turkey (17) , and the EU Regional Trust Fund in response to the Syrian crisis (18) . At the end of 2016, two EU Compacts with Jordan and Lebanon were also set-up, helping to provide education and employment for those displaced due to the Syrian crisis in their host communities. Established in November 2015, the EU Emergency Trust Fund for stability and addressing root causes of irregular migration and displaced persons in Africa (19) provides a new implementing tool to tackle the root causes of irregular migration. It allows the EU to be more coor- dinated, flexible and responsive to the real needs on the ground than ever before. In its first full year of operation, the Trust Fund for Africa enabled the approval of over 100 projects for over EUR 1.5 billion. 13 COM(2015) 240 final, 13.5.2015 14 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/03/18-eu-turkey-statement/ 15 COM(2016) 385 final, 7.6.2016 16 COM(2016) 234 final, 26.4.2016 17 Commission Decision C(2015)9500 18 Commission Decision C(2014)9614 19 Commission Decision C(2015)7293 The EU\u2019s Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP) addresses security related crisis response needs as a prerequisite for development cooperation. Actions financed under the IcSP promote security through support to mediation, peacebuilding, immediate delivery of peace dividends, combatting arms-trafficking, support to the security sector, and other related actions. In July 2016, an amendment to the IcSP was proposed to allow the EU to extend its assistance under IcSP to include the financing of capacity building for security and development (CBSD) with an increased focus on the secu- rity-development nexus in the design of its programmes. (20) The amendment would allow the EU to provide training and mentoring, non-lethal equipment and infrastructure improvements, and support, under exceptional circumstances, to the military actors of partner countries in the context of a wider security sector reform process or capacity building in support of development and security for development. This is in line with the overarching objective of sustainable development and where there is a consensus between the European Union and the partner country concerned that this approach is essential for preserving or re-establishing the conditions necessary for sustainable development, including in crises and fragile and destabilised contexts. 20 COM(2016)447 final/2 5.7.2016 Horn of Africa BETTER MIGRATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME The Better Migration Management (BMM) Programme under the Horn of Africa window of the EU Trust Fund for Africa aims at better management of migration at the regional level. This is achieved through capacity building programmes and the provision of equipment to government institutions engaged in the Khartoum Process (a continuous dialogue for enhanced cooperation on migration and mobility). Support is provided to help generate and use statistical data on migration, investigate, prosecute and bring to trial cases of trafficking and smuggling, or to improve border management. Assistance is also provided to develop policies on trafficking and smuggling, ensure the protection of victims, and raise awareness of the perils of irregular migration, as well as options for legal migration and mobility.

        "2017 Annual Report on the implementation of the European Union\u2019s instruments for financing external actions in 2016 14 15 The EU attaches great importance to the link between humanitarian aid, required as an immediate response to crisis situations, and more medium and long-term devel- opment action. The humanitarian aid-development nexus is complex and requires increased coordination. The common humanitarian aid-development agenda has long been referred to as Linking Relief, Rehabilitation and Development (LRRD) and represents a major aim of international assistance. The need to further invest in this approach was reaffirmed in the Council Conclusions of 12 May 2016 on the World Humanitarian Summit (21) . Humanitarian aid and Development nexus For example, to address the challenge of the post Da\u2019esh stabilisation in Iraq there needs to be a swift coordinated response. For this reason, the European Commission has coordinated humanitarian and development actions to take long term development into consideration early in the process and the European Commission services have jointly prepared a Comprehensive Plan of Action integrating all activities and plans in a LRRD concept, with the intention of further close programming with Member States and other like-minded donors. 21 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/fac/2016/05/12/ ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESULTS The European Commission regularly monitors and reports on the results of EU-funded actions across the world by means of the EU International Cooperation and Development Results Framework. EU-funded projects and programmes that ended between mid-2015 and mid-2016 contributed to the following selection of results globally: GOOD GOVERNANCE 923 000 people benefited directly from legal aid programmes, central to ensuring equality before the law by providing the right to counsel and the right to a fair trial. CONFLICT PREVENTION, PEACE BUILDING AND SECURITY 314 000 people benefited directly from programmes that specifically aimed to support civilian post-conflict peace building and/or conflict prevention. SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION 1 118 000 people received rural advisory services to add value to their produce and improve the links between farmers and markets. ENERGY (22) 1 103 000 people were provided with access to sustainable energy services. EDUCATION 84 000 teachers were trained, providing a foundation for future learning and skills. HEALTH 165 000 000 insecticide-treated bed nets were distributed, to prevent the spread of malaria. (23) NATURAL RESOURCES, ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE 12 694 000 hectares of protected areas were managed, to help ensure biological diversity and to preserve natural heritage. TRANSPORT 4 100 km of roads were constructed, rehabilitated or maintained to provide better access to transportation, particularly for the most disadvantaged groups. EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL PROTECTION 198 000 people benefited from Vocational and Educational Training (VET)/skills development and other active labour market programmes intended to improve employability, productivity and competitive- ness in partner countries. TRADE AND PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT 13 000 firms gained access to credit, to help them avoid risks and make investments. EU action \u2013 Key Results in 2016 22 Does not include results from blending investments 23 The EU ongoing support to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria contributed to these results.

        "2017 Annual Report on the implementation of the European Union\u2019s instruments for financing external actions in 2016 17 16 GLOBAL REACH In April 2016, the African Union Commission and European Commission met in Addis Ababa to discuss priority areas of the Joint Africa-EU Strategy (JAES) (24) including migration, peace, security and sustainable growth. Strengthening this strategic Africa-EU Partnership was a key political and cooperation priority in 2016 and the EU continued its efforts to boost sustainable and inclusive growth across Africa. The Joint Communication \"A renewed partnership with the countries of Africa, Caribbean and Pacific\" (25) outlined a vision that aims to transform the partnership into a stronger alliance that can effec- tively contribute to building peaceful, stable, prosperous and resilient states and societies across the continent. EU cooperation with Africa in the area of peace and security significantly increased in 2016 with substantial support provided under the African Peace Facility (APF) to reinforce the African Peace and Security Architecture and to finance African-led Peace Support Operations, such as the Multinational Joint Task Force against Boko Haram (MNJTF). THE EU REGIONAL TRUST FUND IN RESPONSE TO THE SYRIAN CRISIS IN ACTION: HEALTH, LIVELIHOODS AND CAPACITY BUILDING A EUR 53 million flagship programme in five countries with the Red Cross/ Red Crescent (RCRC) is benefitting at least 700 000 refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Northern Iraq, Jordan and Egypt, with targeted projects on livelihoods, health and capacity-building. MIKES COMBAT POACHING The Minimising the Illegal Killing of Elephants and other Endangered Species (MIKES) project aims to generate reliable and impartial data on the status and threats to key endangered species in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific , help improve law enforcement to combat wildlife poaching and trafficking, and establish an emergency response system for sudden increases in illegal killing and trade. The European Commission continued to implement its medium-term enlargement strategy , as set out in the Communication on EU Enlargement policy adopted in November 2016 (26) . Strong focus remains on the principle of \"fundamentals first\" in the accession process within 2016 saw the roll-out of the revised European Neighbour- hood Policy (ENP) (27) . The ENP puts stabilisation in the EU\u2019s neighbouring countries as an important EU political priority. Over the past year, the EU has intensified its relations with ENP countries by launching negotiations on Partnership Priorities both in the East and in the South. Relations with Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova were taken forward through the continued implementation of the respective Association Agreements. In 2016, the European Union continued its policy dialogue with the Union for the Mediterranean to promote regional cooperation in the South. In the Enlargement region In the European Neighbourhood which the rule of law, fundamental rights, strengthening democratic institutions, including public administration reform, as well as economic development and competi- tiveness are core issues. The EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis , was established in December 2014 to enable a coherent and integrated EU aid response to the crisis. The fund\u2019s initial geographical focus was on Syria's neighbouring countries: Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, but was expanded to Iraq in 2015, and to the Western Balkans as other non-EU countries affected by the refugee crisis. By the end of 2016, the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis had mobilised EUR 932 million in agreed contributions, of which EUR 815 million was from the EU Budget, with contributions from Member States amounting to EUR 92 million and EUR 24 million from Turkey. In Africa Sahel & Lake Chad Syrian crisis MIKES \u20ac 918.5 million \u20ac 53 million EU TRUST FUND FOR AFRICA IN ACTION: THE SAHEL AND LAKE CHAD By the end of 2016, 65 projects amounting to EUR 918.5 million had been approved under the Sahel and Lake Chad window of the EU Trust Fund for Africa covering important countries of origin and transit for migration including Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal. Projects include enhancing the resilience of the most vulnerable groups in the countries of origin, fostering youth employment, private sector development and entrepreneurship, sup- porting the work of civil society in combating radicalisation, as well as food and nutrition security, health and education services, and social protection. 24 https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/regions/africa/continental-cooperation/joint-africa-eu-strategy_en 25 JOIN(2016) 52 final, 22.11.2016 26 COM(2016) 715, 9.11.2016 27 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1334_en.htm ",
