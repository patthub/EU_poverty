        "EN 7 EN ANNEX EU/EGYPT ACTION PLAN 1. Introduction The Arab Republic of Egypt and the European Union as key partners and, near neighbours, reaffirm their commitment to deepen their political, economic and social relations on the basis of their close cooperation and strategic partnership that has developed in the last few decades and within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and the Association Agreement embodying the objectives and principles of the Barcelona Declaration, and complementing its multilateral process. The evolving regional and international context of Egypt-EU relations has fostered greater scope for cooperation. On the one hand, the enlargement of the EU on 1 May 2004 which has brought a historical shift for the Union in political, geographic and economic terms, paved the way for the European Neighbourhood Policy that aims to deepen the EU\u2019s relations with its neighbouring countries to the East and South. On the other hand, Egypt continues to pursue its dynamic foreign policy aiming to strengthen its relations with its international partners in particular the EU, its commitment to further integration with the global economy, and its efforts for further political and economic development and modernization. Thus, a major opportunity has evolved for Egypt and the EU to further develop their strategic partnership through an increasingly close and enhanced relationship. This will involve a significant degree of economic integration and deepening of political, cultural and social co-operation, aiming to promote peace, stability, security, growth, development and prosperity in the Euro- Mediterranean region as well as modernization of the Egyptian economy and society. In this regard, the Action Plan between Egypt and the EU within the European Neighbourhood Policy sets ambitious objectives based on joint ownership, common interests, reciprocal commitments, differentiation, shared values and implementation of national plans and reform programmes, politically, economically, socially and institutionally. Egypt and the EU agree, through the current Action Plan, to enter into intensified political, security, economic, trade, investment, scientific, technological and cultural relations, and shared responsibility in establishing an area of peace and stability including the prevention and settlement of conflicts in the region and to reinvigorate regional and sub-regional cooperation. The level of ambition of the EU-Egypt relationship, leading to continuing trade liberalization including in agriculture and services, a stake in the EU\u2019s internal market, , increased financial support and enhanced political cooperation, will depend on the degree of commitment to common values as well as the implementation of jointly agreed priorities to mutual benefits. The pace of progress of the relationship will acknowledge fully the efforts and concrete achievements in meeting those commitments. Recognizing Egypt\u2019s efforts and reform priorities to further develop and modernise all sectors of the Egyptian society and economy based on the respect of her identity, specificities and national priorities, the Action Plan aims to support such efforts and priorities as reflected in the National Development Plan 2002-2007, President Mubarak\u2019s Electoral Platform for 2005\u00a8and the Government\u2019s statement to the parliament in January 2006. ",
        "EN 8 EN These include national priorities aiming to: improve quality of life and standard of living; increase employment opportunities and reduce unemployment; reduce poverty and expand the coverage of social security; eradicate illiteracy and develop education and higher education; consolidate the role of institutions, promote the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms; continue maintaining and ensuring judiciary independence; expand the participation in political life; enhance human resources and institutional capacity building; increase rates of economic growth and investments; increase female participation in development; achieve a significant expansion in the production and exports capacities; improve industrial potentials; promote innovation, scientific research and technological development and preserve the environment. This Action Plan is a first step in a process covering a timeframe of three to five years. Its implementation will help fulfil the provisions and aims of the Association Agreement (AA) and will encourage and support Egypt\u2019s national development, modernization and reform objectives. It will furthermore help to devise and implement policies and measures to promote economic growth, employment and social cohesion, to reduce poverty and protect the environment, thereby contributing to the long term objective of sustainable development. Implementation of the Action Plan will also help, where appropriate, further integration into European Union economic, social and technological structures and significantly increase the possibility to advance the approximation of Egyptian legislation, norms and standards to those of the European Union in appropriate areas, thereby enhancing prospects for trade, investment and growth. The Action Plan will take into account the balance between the acceleration necessary for dynamic implementation and modernization of the Egyptian economy and the imperatives of a sustainable socio-economic development. Egypt\u2019s unique geographical position and her historical and strategic relations with the Arab and African countries, and her key role for peace and stability in the Middle East, as well as the EU\u2019s increasing role on the global arena and its enhanced contribution to peace, security and economic development in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, enable Egypt and EU, through this Action Plan to further develop their cooperation on regional and international issues, particularly referring to the Middle East Peace Process, disarmament and arms control, including illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons, non proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems in the Middle East and elsewhere, and the fight against terrorism; to enhance and to promote dialogue between cultures and civilizations and to promote South-South trade and cooperation. In order to contribute to the realization of the ambitious objectives of this Action Plan, the EU will provide appropriate financial support through the different available financial instruments. The AA is the legal framework governing the bilateral relations between Egypt and the EU. New Partnership Perspectives The European Neighbourhood Policy and Egypt\u2019s policy to deepen its relationship with the EU open New Partnership Perspectives: \u2022 The perspective of moving beyond the existing relationship to a significant degree of economic integration including through a stake in the EU\u2019s Internal Market, which aims to ",

The European Commission is furthermore proposing a new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) for this purpose, also covering cross-border and transnational cooperation between Egypt and EU Member States. There will also be support for infrastructure investment as well as for the development of the private sector and partnership through the European Investment Bank and FEMIP. \u2022 Prospect of gradual opening of or reinforced co-operation in relevant European Community programmes, promoting i.a. cultural, educational, environmental, technological and scientific links. \u2022 Support for meeting EU and international norms and standards and for modernization efforts including through technical assistance and twinning, as well as targeted support and advise for legislative approximation through mechanisms such as TAIEX. \u2022 Enhanced direct cooperation between administrations based on the bodies set up by the Association Agreement in particular institutionalised thematic sub-committees.
