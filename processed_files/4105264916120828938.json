        "With 73.4 out of 100 points , Finland ranks fourth in the EU on the Gender Equality Index. Finland\u2019s score is 6 points above the EU\u2019s score. Between 2005 and 2017, its score only increased 1.4 points (+ 0.4 points since 2015). Finland is progressing towards gender equality at a slower pace than other EU Member States. Its ranking has dropped one position since 2005. Finland\u2019s scores are the highest in the domains of health (89.7 points) and money (87.6 points). Gender inequalities are most pronounced in the domain of knowledge (61.1 points), although this score has improved since 2005 (+ 4.5 points). Since 2005, Finland\u2019s scores have improved the most in the domain of money (+ 7.5 points) and decreased in the domains of time (- 4.2 points) and power (- 1.7 points). Progress has stalled in the domains of work (+ 0.7 points) and health (+ 0.5 points). Between 2005 and 2017, Finland\u2019s Index scores improved. In the same period, Finland\u2019s scores were higher than the EU\u2019s, but improved more slowly. The gap between Finland and the EU has decreased over time. 1 100 EL HU SK RO PL LT HR CZ CY BG LV EE PT MT IT AT DE EU-28 SI LU ES BE IE NL UK FI FR DK SE FI 73.4 EU 67.4 Full inequality Full equality 20 17 2005 \u25b2 Increase since 2005 \u25b2 5.4 \u25b2 1.4 Each year we score EU Member States and the EU as a whole to see how far they are from reaching gender equal- ity. The Index uses a scale of 1 to 100, where 1 is for total inequality and 100 is for total equality. The scores are based on the gaps between women and men and levels of achievement in six core domains: work, money, knowledge, time, power and health. Two additional domains are integrated into the Index but do not have an impact on the final score. The domain of intersecting inequalities highlights how gender inequalities manifest in combination with age, dis/ability, country of birth, education and family type. The domain of violence against women measures and analyses women\u2019s experiences of violence. In addition to providing a snapshot into the Index scores, the Gender Equality Index 2019 includes a thematic focus on work-life balance.

        "Work Finland\u2019s score in the domain of work is 74.9, remaining stable since 2005 (+ 0.2 points since 2015) and there are no significant changes in either participation or segregation and quality of work. The employment rate (of people aged 20-64) is 75 % for women and 78 % for men. With the overall employment rate of 76 %, Finland has not reached its national EU 2020 employment target of 78 %. The full-time equivalent (FTE) employment rate decreased from 48 % to 46 % for women and from 58 % to 54 % for men between 2005 and 2017, narrowing the gender gap (from 10 percentage points (p.p.) to 8 p.p.). Between women and men in couples with children, the gap is far wider than in couples without children (19 p.p. and less than 1 p.p.). Around 22 % of women work part-time, compared to 12 % of men. On average, women work 35 hours per week and men work 38 hours. The uneven concentration of women and men in different sectors of the labour market remains an issue: 40 % of women work in education, health and social work, compared to 9 % of men. Fewer women (8 %) than men (42 %) work in science, tech- nology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) occupations. Money Finland\u2019s score in the domain of money is 87.6, showing progress of 7.5 points since 2005 (+ 1.2 points since 2015), with improvements in the economic and financial situations of women and men. Finland moved forward six positions and ranks third in the EU in the domain of money. Although mean monthly earnings of both women and men increased (+ 29 % and + 25 % respectively) from 2006 to 2014, the gender gap persists: women earn 19 % less than men. In couples with children, women earn 24 % less than men (23 % less for women in couples without children). The risk of poverty decreased for women (- 1 p.p.) and increased for men (+ 1 p.p.) between 2005 and 2017: 12 % of both women and men are at risk. People facing the highest risk of poverty are single women (27 %) and single men (30 %), and peo- ple with low education levels (23 %). Inequalities in income distribution decreased among both women and men between 2005 and 2017. Women earn on average around 83 cents for every euro a man makes per hour, resulting in a gender pay gap of 17 %. The gender pension gap is 23 %. Knowledge Finland\u2019s score in the domain of knowledge is 61.1, a 4.5-point increase from 2005 (- 0.2 points since 2015). There are improvements in both attainment and participation and seg- regation. Finland ranks 13th in the domain of knowledge in the EU. The share of women tertiary graduates (37 %) continues to be higher than the share of men (30 %), although tertiary attainment has increased for both women and men since 2005. The gender gap is wider within the 25-49 age group (17 p.p.) and between women and men in couples with children (13 p.p.). Finland has met its national EU 2020 target of having 42 % of people aged 30-34 with tertiary education. The current rate is 44 % (with 53 % for women and 36 % for men). Participation in lifelong learning increased for both women (from 33 % to 35 %) and men (from 26 % to 28 %) between 2005 and 2017. Finland has the third highest participation rate in the EU. Participation in lifelong learning decreas- es with age. Despite improvements in the sub-domain of segregation, the uneven concentration of women and men in different study fields in tertiary education remains a challenge for Finland. More than half of women students (51 %) study education, health and welfare, or humanities and arts, compared to less than one-fifth of men students (18 %). \u25b2 0.7 \u25b2 0.6 88.9 63.1 Participation Segregation and quality of work 74.9 \u25b2 0.7 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25b2 11.3 \u25b2 2.3 79.2 96.9 Financial resources Economic situation 87.6 \u25b2 7.5 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25b2 5.2 \u25b2 3.8 83.0 45.0 Attainment and participation Segregation 61.1 \u25b2 4.5 \u25b2 increase since 2005 ",
        "Time Finland\u2019s score in the domain of time has not changed since the last edition of the Index, because new data is not available. The next data update for this domain is expected in 2021. More frequent time-use data would help to track progress in this domain. In the domain of time, Finland\u2019s score is 77.4, well above the EU\u2019s score of 65.7. Gen- der inequalities in time-share for care responsibilities have increased since 2005. Women take on more responsibilities in caring for their family: 36 % of women care for and educate their family members for at least one hour per day, compared to 26 % of men; the gender gap has increased (from 6 p.p. to 10 p.p.). These shares are higher among women (87 %) and men (77 %) in couples with children. More women (86 %) than men (57 %) do cooking and housework every day for at least one hour. Women are more likely than men to participate in sporting, cultural or leisure activities outside the home (60 % compared to 45 %). Nearly the same proportions of women (15 %) and men (16 %) are involved in voluntary or charitable activities. Power Finland\u2019s score in the domain of power is 66.7, with a 1.7-point decrease since 2005 (+ 1.4 points since 2015). This is the third highest score in the EU in this domain. In all three sub-domains (political, economic and social power), Finland\u2019s scores have decreased since 2005. The share of women ministers dropped from 47 % in 2005 to 37 % in 2018. The share of women members of parliament increased (from 38 % to 42 %) over the same period, and 46 % of members of regional assemblies are women in Finland. Regressions in economic decision-making are driven by a drop in the share of wom- en on the board of the central bank (from 38 % to 25 %). The share of women on the boards of the largest publicly listed companies increased from 20 % to 34 %, between 2005 and 2018. In the sub-domain of social power, women comprise 43 % of board members of research-funding organisations and publicly owned broadcasting organisations, as well as 30 % of board members of the highest decision-making bodies of national Olympic sports organisations. Health Finland\u2019s score in the domain of health is 89.7, with no significant change since 2005 (no change since 2015). This is Finland\u2019s top scoring domain, despite ranking 10th among EU Member States (1.6 points above the EU\u2019s score). Although gender equal- ity in the domain remained stable (with no new data for health behaviour), there are improvements in health status. Self-perceptions of good health increased by 1 p.p. for women (from 68 % to 69 %) and by 3 p.p. for men (from 69 % to 72 %) between 2005 and 2017. Health satisfaction increases with a person\u2019s level of education and decreases in proportion to their age. Both life expectancy and healthy life years increased in Finland, between 2005 and 2016. Women on average live five years longer than men (84 compared to 79 years). Healthy life years increased from 53 to 57 years for women and 52 to 59 years for men. Adequate access to health services has not changed, and Finland ranks 22nd in this sub-domain. Reports of unmet needs for medical services slightly increased for wom- en (from 5 % to 6 %) and did not change for men (3 %), between 2005 and 2017. Fewer women (6 %) and men (5 %) report unmet needs for dental care, compared to 7 % of both in 2005. Women and men with disabilities report higher unmet medical needs (12 % and 8 %), compared to women and men without disabilities (4 % and 3 %). \u25bc 7.1 \u25bc 1.8 82.2 72.9 Care activities Social activities 77.4* \u25bc 4.2 \u25bc decrease since 2005 * Scores not updated since 2017 edition. \u25bc 2.4 \u25bc 1.6 \u25bc 1.3 78.8 52.5 71.5 Political Economic Social 66.7 \u25bc 1.7 \u25bc decrease since 2005 \u25b2 1.7 \u2014 \u25bc 0.2 90.9 81.9* 96.8 Status Behaviour Access 89.7 \u25b2 0.5 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25bc decrease since 2005 * Scores not updated since 2017 edition.

        "Violence Violence against women is both a consequence and cause of persisting gender inequalities in the areas of work, health, money, power, knowledge and time. In con- trast to other domains, the domain of violence does not measure differences between women\u2019s and men\u2019s situ- ations but examines women\u2019s experiences of violence. For this reason, the domain of violence is not captured in the calculations of the Gender Equality Index. Instead, it is calculated as a separate composite measure of three aspects: prevalence, severity and disclosure of violence against women. The calculation of scores relied on the 2014 European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights survey data results. No EU-wide survey on gender-based violence has been carried out since then. Until the com- pletion of the next survey, the scores cannot be updated. Finland signed and ratified the Council of Europe Con- vention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention) in April 2015. The domain of violence presents updated data on three additional indicators to help monitor femicide, female genital mutilation and trafficking in human beings. How- ever, not all Member States collect such data and im- provements in data collection are necessary. Finland recorded 12 women victims of intentional hom- icide by an intimate partner and four women victims of intentional homicide by a family member in 2016. The country does not provide data estimating the proportion of girls (in the resident migrant population) at risk of fe- male genital mutilation. Statistics on trafficking in human beings are gathered and reported. There were 86 reg- istered women victims of trafficking in human beings in 2016. Comparable data, disaggregated by sex, is essential to the development of EU-wide strategies on preventing and eliminating violence against women across Member States. Thematic focus on work-life balance Gender Equality Index 2019 focuses on work-life balance \u2014 an issue of high political importance in the EU. In addi- tion to work-life balance related indicators captured by the Index (e.g. in the domains of work, time and knowledge), the thematic focus presents additional indicators \u2014 a work-life balance scoreboard (WLB scoreboard). The WLB scoreboard cuts across three broad areas: paid work, unpaid work (care) and education and training. It presents 15 indicators in six specific areas of concern: parental leave policies; caring for children and childcare services; informal care for older persons and persons with disabilities and long-term care services; transport and infrastructure; flexi- ble working arrangements; and lifelong learning. Parental leave policies Parental leave helps parents balance their caring duties and work life. However, it is often unavailable to potential parents as their eligibility might be dependent on crite- ria such as whether a person is in paid work; if they are an employee or self-employed; the sector in which they work; the length of service; or leave might not be acces- sible to same-sex couples or migrants. Changes in the labour market, such as the spread of atypical forms of employment (e.g. temporary contracts and on-demand work, bogus self-employment, voucher-based work) have increased concerns about parents\u2019 access to leave, espe- cially in cases where it is based on definitions of tradition- al standard employment. In 2016, all women and men potential parents, aged 20- 49, were eligible for parental leave in Finland. In contrast to most of the EU countries, eligibility for parental leave is not constrained by employment status, duration or type of employment. Same-sex parents are also eligible for pa- rental leave in Finland. ",
        "Informal childcare and childcare services As the number of dual-earning and single-parent families grows, new needs for childcare services appear. High qual- ity, available, accessible and affordable childcare services are essential to allow parents to stay in or join the labour market and reduce the gender gap in employment. In Finland, 55 % of all informal carers of children are wom- en. Overall, 56 % of women and 50 % of men are involved in caring for or educating their children or grandchildren at least several times a week. The share of women and men caring for or educating their children or grandchildren in Finland is the same as in the EU overall (56 % of women and 50 % of men). The gender gaps are wider between women and men working in the public sector, 76 % of women and 62 % of men are informal carers in the public sector. Finland has reached one of the Barcelona targets to have at least 33 % of children below the age of three and 90 % of children between the age of three and school age in childcare. About 33 % of children below the age of three are under some form of formal care arrangements, and 23 % of children this age are in formal childcare for at least 30 hours a week. Formal childcare is provided for 86 % of children from age three to the minimum compulsory school age (and 61 % are in formal childcare for at least 30 hours a week). Around 13 % of housholds report unmet needs for formal childcare services in Finland. Lone mothers are more likely to report higher unmet needs for formal childcare ser- vices (22 %), compared to couples with children (12 %). Informal care for older persons and persons with disabilities and long-term care services Available, accessible, and affordable care services and infra- structure are crucial if people with caring responsibilities are to maintain a healthy balance between their care duties and work life. This is especially relevant for women, who are of- ten more engaged than men in both formal and informal care of older persons and/or persons with disabilities. In light of emerging demographic trends, such as ageing soci- eties, lower birth rates and consequently the decline of the working age population, the need for formal and informal long-term care services becomes more important than ever. Most informal carers for older persons and/or persons with disabilities in Finland are women (65 %). The shares of wom- en and men involved in informal care for older persons and/ or people with disabilities several days a week or every day are 15 % and 8 %. The proportion of women involved in in- formal care is the same as the EU average, while the involve- ment of men is 2 p.p. lower. About 22 % of women and 10 % of men aged 50-64 take care of older persons and/or per- sons with disabilities, in comparison to 8 % of women and 7 % of men in the 20-49 age group. Around 42 % of women carers for older persons and/or persons with disabilities are employed, compared to 58 % of men combining care with professional responsibilities. There are also fewer women than men informal carers working in the EU. But the gender gap is slightly wider in Finland than in the EU (15 p.p. com- pared to 14 p.p. for the EU). In the 50-64 age group, 66 % of women informal carers work, compared to 64 % of men. Around 25 % of women and men in Finland report unmet needs for professional home care services. Transport and infrastructure Access to affordable and quality public infrastructure, such as care and educational facilities, health services and trans- portation, impacts women\u2019s and men\u2019s opportunities to balance paid work with other activities. The uneven division of caring duties and household tasks between women and men influences the ways in which they use or need certain types of transport and infrastructure. Time spent commut- ing is a good indication of whether existing public infra- structure helps or hinders women and men in juggling their everyday activities. In Finland, men spend slightly more time commuting to and from work than women (around 49 minutes per day for men and 47 minutes for women). Couples with and without children spend similar amounts of time commuting, with men travelling a bit longer than women in both cases. Sin- gle women spend around 49 minutes commuting per day compared to 44 minutes per day for single men. Women working part-time spend 46 minutes travelling from home to work and back, while men commute 42 minutes, com- pared to 48 minutes for women and 50 minutes for men working full-time. Generally, men are more likely to travel directly to and from work, whereas women make more multi-purpose trips, to fit in other activities such as school drop-offs or grocery shopping. ",

If carefully designed, keeping in mind the different needs of women and men, flexible working arrangements can make it easier to balance work and family life. They can support people with caring responsibilities to enter the la- bour market, as full-time employees. More women (44 %) than men (35 %) have no control over their working time arrangements. Access to flexible working arrangements is higher in Finland than in the EU where 57 % of women and 54 % of men have no possibility to change their working time arrangements. Access to flexible working time arrangements is significantly higher in the private sec- tor, although women face more restrictions in both sectors. About 36 % of women and 30 % of men have no control over their working time arrangements in the private sector, compared to 55 % and 52 % in the public sector. Around one third of both women (32 %) and men (34 %) part-time workers transitioned to full-time work in 2017, al- though there are more women than men working part-time in Finland. The gender gap in Finland is narrower than in the EU, where 14 % of women and 28 % of men moved from part-time to full-time work. Lifelong learning Constant advances in technology require workers to con- tinuously upskill and stay up-to-date with new develop- ments and technologies over the course of their careers. Lifelong learning is a catalyst for gender equality as it gives women and men greater choice in their work options and more opportunities to achieve their full potential. Insuffi- cient financial resources and time-related barriers such as conflicts with work schedules and/or family responsibilities can prevent access to lifelong learning for both women and men. Lifelong learning can help women re-enter the labour market after career breaks due to care responsibilities. Finland has the second highest participation rate in life- long learning (27 %) in the EU. At the same time, Finland has the third widest gender gap in the EU (8 p.p.). Women (aged 25-64) are more likely to participate in education and training than men, regardless of their employment status. Around 34 % of women employees participate in education and training, compared to 26 % of men employees. Conflicts with work schedules are a greater barrier to participation in lifelong learning for men (38 %) than for women (35 %). Fam- ily responsibilities are reported as barriers to engagement in education and training for 26 % of women compared to 15 % of men. Both work schedules and family responsibilities are less of an obstacle for participation in lifelong learning in Finland than in the EU overall. In the EU, 38 % of women and 43 % of men report their work schedule as an obstacle, and 40 % of women and 24 % of men report that family respon- sibilities hinder participation in lifelong learning.
