        "SUMMARY 1 Since the last 2008 Demography Report was published in 2008, the EU population has passed the 500 million mark while continuing to develop along lin es that were already discernible two years ago. The EU\u2019s demographic picture has become clearer: growth is fuelled mainly by immigration, whereas the population is becoming older and more diverse. The impact of the economic crisis is still difficult to assess. In its October 2006 Communication entitled \u2018 The Demographic Future of Europe \u2014 from Challenge to Opportunity \u2019 (6) , the Commission presented its views on the demographic challenges the EU was facing and on options for tackling them. The Communication e xpressed confidence in Europe\u2019s ability to cope with demographic change and an ageing population in particular, but also stressed the need to act in five key policy areas: demographic renewal, employment, productivity, integration of migrants and sustainable public finances. This third Demographic Report aims to provide the latest facts and figures that are needed for an informed debate on these issues. In addition to the EU- level overview, data are provided as far as possible for each EU-27 Member State, enabling policy makers and stakeholders to compare their own country's situation with that of other Member States, to understand the specific characteristics of their country and, possibly, to identify other countries that could provide interesting experiences from which to learn. This year the report is a joint undertaking between the Directorate General for \u2018 Employment, social affairs and inclusion \u2019 and Eurostat, and draws on Eurostat's experience in demographic analysis. It consists of two parts, a short annex on migration in the recession and a country annex. Part I looks at historical and recent trends in fertility, life expectancy and migration - the three drivers of population change. It includes a review of population structure by age and family composition. Part II explores an increasingly important phenomenon that was identified in a recent Eurobarometer survey: the increasing number of European citizens who seek opportunities across national borders for study, work, life experience and inspiration, resulting in different forms of international connectedness across national borders. 1. MORE, OLDER AND MORE DIVERSE EUROPEANS 1.1. New patterns lead to slight increases in fertility Gradual but nonetheless major changes are affecting the population of Europe. Two main positive trends are emerging: a slight increase in fertility and greater life expectancy. Lowest-low fertility \u2013 below 1.3 children per woman \u2013 has ended in all Member State and the most recent figure for EU-27 was 1.6 and could rise to over 1.7 if adjustments for the postponement of births (the so- called \u2018tempo effect\u2019) are taken into account. This small adjustment does not make up for the shortfall in relation to the replacement ( 6 ) COM(2006) 571, adopted on 12 October 2006. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 11 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "Demography Report, 2010 2 ratio of 2.1, but it could contribute to a slower rate of population decline in the medium/longer term, in conjunction with a possible increase in fertility as EU Member States become wealthier. The modest increase in fertility results from somewhat new family building patterns: countries with fewer marriages, more cohabitation, more divorces and an older average age of women at childbirth tend to have higher fertility rates. Changing social perceptions of the role of marriage and greater fragility of relationships have resulted in more extramarital births, including to lone parents, or in childlessness. The impact of family policies on these trends is difficult to assess since cultural factors play an important role. However, the data suggest that postponement of childbearing to a later age is accompanied in some countries (France, Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands for instance) by higher fertility rates and relatively generous public support for parents. At the other end of the scale, in countries such as Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, a lower age at childbirth is not associated with a high fertility rate.. This would also be consistent with the first indications that fertility rises again with wealth, after decades of decaying fertility as countries grew richer. The emerging evidence reinforces the case for having better policies that can help parents to cope with the constraints of a modern society. 1.2. An \"ageing\" population structure Although it is difficult to predict the impact of policies, an analysis of the impact of changes in population structure is more straightforward. Low fertility rates are only one side of the coin, the other being a decline in the number of deaths or, in more positive terms, an increase in life expectancy. In 2009, the median age of the population was 40.6, and it is projected to reach 47.9 years by 2060. The EUROPOP2008 projections prepared by Eurostat and presented in the previous Demography Report indicate that by 2014 the working age population (20-64) will start to shrink, as the large baby-boom cohorts born immediately after World War II are now entering their sixties and retiring. The number of people aged 60 and above in the EU is now rising by more than two million every year, roughly twice the rate observed until about three years ago. The working population is also ageing, as the proportion of older workers in employment increases compared to the cohorts made up of younger workers. Every year about 5 million children are born in the EU-27 and over 2 million people immigrate from third countries. Births outnumber deaths by several hundred thousand persons each year, whereas net migration is well over a million. As a result, migration accounts for the largest proportion of the EU's population growth. In 2008 life expectancy for the EU-27 was 76.4 for men and 82.4 for women. Differences among Member States are still very significant, ranging from almost 13 years for men to 8 for women. Infant mortality in 2009 was also still relatively high in some countries like Romania (10.1 \u2030) and Bulgaria (9.0 \u2030), even though a reduction of about 50% for EU-27 has been achieved over the last 15 years. Socio-economic status appears to play a major role, especially in some Central European countries. Consequently, by improving the life expectancy of disadvantaged groups, a general increase in overall life expectancy is also to be expected. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 12 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "Summary 3 A possible development is the improvement in healthy life expectancy by delaying the stage at which physical condition starts to deteriorate rapidly, thereby postponing death to a later age. More evidence and analysis is required on this important subject. Policies which address the ageing of the population and the work force focus on enabling older workers to remain active and productive for a longer proportion of their life span. One of the benefits of an ageing population is that it offers more opportunities for flexible arrangements during the life course. A longer active life allows for extended or recurring periods in education; greater working-time flexibility during the intense years when childbearing and career commitments coincide; occasional career breaks when it becomes necessary to take care of family members; and productive retirement through volunteering and general engagement in the civil society. 1.3. Europe on the move Migration, especially from non-EU countries, could provide a (temporary) respite from population ageing, since most people migrate primarily as young adults (aged 25-34). As young cohorts of foreigners feed progressively into the older national cohorts, the total population is rejuvenated and diversity increases. Unprecedented levels of immigration both from third countries and within the EU-27 (intra-EU mobility) over the past decade have substantially increased the proportion of EU-27 inhabitants who do not live in their own native country or culture. EU-27 Member States are host to some 20 million non-EU-nationals. A further 10 million EU nationals are living in another Member State, and about 5 million non-nationals have acquired EU citizenship since 2001. As most migrants are relatively young and have arrived quite recently, they contribute to the size of the EU-27 labour force. In the future, the labour force will increasingly include people with a migration background. Among EU nationals, in addition to the approximately 8% of foreign-born ( 7 ) people residing in the EU, a further 5% have at least one foreign-born parent, and this category will continue to grow. By 2060, persons of all nationalities with at least one foreign-born parent are expected to account for close to a third of the EU-27 population. An even larger percentage of the work-force will be of foreign descent. These trends imply that additional efforts are needed to ensure that immigrants have the opportunity to integrate into their host society and, crucially, to enable them to contribute to the labour market by making full use of their education. A mobile population can be seen as an asset to the host countries. As more people seek experience abroad, they can contribute to a more efficient and productive economy, while also enhancing their personal skills. 2. AN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE AND MOBILE EU POPULATION As the flows of migration from non-EU countries and mobility between Member States have intensified, a growing proportion of the working-age population (15% in 2008) was either born abroad or has at least one parent who was born abroad. ( 7 ) Here foreign-born includes those who were born in a different Member State than the one in which they reside. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 13 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "Demography Report, 2010 4 Changing patterns of migration and mobility in Europe are making national sentiments and feelings about belonging to a particular nation more diffuse and complex, especially in the case of mobility between EU Member States. Although traditional long-term, employment-driven, male-dominated migration still takes place, other forms of migration and mobility are emerging. Mobility flows have also changed: some of the major traditional emigration Member States have become poles of attraction for migrants. Large-scale migration and mixing of cultures are clearly not new phenomena in the history of the EU. Past flows have had a different impact on the size and structure of the population in most EU-27 Member States, and they have contributed to a more European outlook among its citizens. Immigrants often want to maintain a close attachment to their country of origin, but these linkages tend to weaken over time. The integration of immigrants across generations occurs rather rapidly. In most countries with a substantial proportion of second-generation immigrants, these fare far better in education and on the labour market than first-generation immigrants and almost as well as those of no foreign descent; this applies to descendants of mobile people from other Member States and of immigrants from non-EU countries. Nevertheless, even after three generations \u2013 the time it usually takes for full integration \u2013 descendants of migrants maintain some attachment to the countries of their ancestors, through their knowledge of foreign languages, for example. Alongside traditional migration and mobility, new forms of mobility are taking place. People are moving abroad for shorter periods, mainly to other Member States, to seek work, pursue their education or other life opportunities. These mobile people tend to be well-educated young adults, towards the higher end of the occupational scale. Increasingly, this form of mobility is based on personal preferences and life choices, and not only on economic opportunities. The increased propensity to be mobile could be of great benefit to the EU by enabling a better matching of skills and language ability with job opportunities. The results of a Eurobarometer survey ( 8 ) point to the presence of a diverse, growing number of mobile young people characterised by a common interest in looking beyond national borders. The Eurobarometer survey also indicates that around one in five of the EU-27 respondents has either worked or studied in another country at some point, lived with a partner from another country or owns a property abroad. Half of these respondents have ties to other countries by ancestry; the other half are most often young and well educated and consciously making a life choice that brings them into contact with other countries. They share a strong willingness, if not propensity, to move abroad, up to four times greater than those who do not have any connections with another country. Given that this phenomenon is likely to become even more important in the future, policy makers may want to consider its implications in planning for the socio- economic future of the European population. 3. DEMOGRAPHIC POLICY IN THE RECESSION Before the economic recession, EU Member States' commitment to implementing the policy goals in the Lisbon agenda had begun to show results in the form of employment for young people, women, older workers ( 8 ) Eurobarometer EBS 346 at at http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_346_en.pdf KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 14 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "Summary 5 and migrants. When the recession struck, the first groups to be affected were younger people and immigrants. Governments faced increasing difficulties in balancing support for families, consolidation of budgets, assistance for young people and immigrants in a shrinking labour market, and funding for retirement schemes. It is too early to draw any firm conclusions about the effect of the crisis on fertility and life expectancy. Recent experience with past recessions indicates that both fertility and mortality may initially decrease slightly, only to return to their pre-recession levels shortly after the crisis has ended. New Eurostat data on residence permits throws light on the reasons for migration from non-EU countries. The available data show that the decline in migration is largely due to a reduction in migration for employment and family reasons, while the number of residence permits issued for education and other reasons increased slightly from 2008 to 2009. 4. WHAT IS BEING DONE In June 2010 the European Council adopted the new 10-year Europe 2020 strategy for more jobs and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth ( 9 ). The strategy sets out to reorientate existing policies from crisis management to medium- and longer-term goals to promote growth and employment and ensure the future sustainability of public finances. The latter is a precondition for sustainable social cohesion in the EU. The recession has not diminished the commitment of Member States to respond to the demographic challenge; on the contrary, the commitment appears to have been reinforced. The strategy adopted in addressing demographic change seems to dovetail with the overall thrust of the new Europe 2020 strategy. In the wake of the recession, and despite the bleak outlook for public finances, the European Commission is convinced that the demographic dimension deserves to be taken fully into account by Member States when they are formulating their exit strategies from the current recession. The need to mobilise the EU\u2019s demographic potential was already highlighted in October 2006 in the Commission Communicatio n on Europe\u2019s Demographic Future ( 10 ). This Communication suggested that the problem of low fertility should be addressed by creating better conditions for families to deal with the problem of a shrinking labour force by raising employment rates and productivity levels, by relying on immigration and better integration and, finally, by preserving the ability to meet the future needs of an ageing society by creating sustainable public finances. Member States are responsible for deciding how they realise their potential. The Communication highlighted the type of support that the EU can offer to Member States in terms of existing policy coordination. At the request of the Member States, and with the support of the European Parliament, this process is complemented by the activities organised under the umbrella of the European ( 9 ) http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm ( 10 ) http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2006:0571:FIN:EN:PDF.

        "Demography Report, 2010 6 Alliance for Families ( 11 ) and the planned European Year 2012 for Active Ageing ( 12 ). The success of the strategy hinges largely on the EU\u2019s ability to face up to the major demographic transformations of this coming decade. Europe \u2019 s future depends to a great extent on its capacity to tap the strong potential of the two fastest growing segments in its population: older people and immigrants. Three policy areas appear crucial to boost economic growth and achieve greater social cohesion: \u2013 The promotion of active ageing: older people, and in particular ageing baby-boomers, can look forward to many more years of healthy life, and they possess valuable skills and experience. More opportunities for active ageing will allow them to continue to contribute to society, even after retirement. \u2013 The integration of migrants and their descendants: this is crucial for Europe because migrants will make up an even larger share of Europe\u2019s labour force. The low employment rate of migrants is both socially and financially unaffordable. \u2013 The reconciliation of paid work and family commitments: people with caring responsibilities still lack adequate support and suitable arrangements for combining their different responsibilities. As a result, economic growth is hampered because too many people are not able to exploit their high level of skills and education on the labour market. Women are particularly affected because of the persistent gender \u2013 employment and pay gaps. At the same time, Europe needs to find ways of maintaining greater productivity while preparing for increasing levels of ageing-related expenditure, despite the demise of public finances as a result of the recession.

        "\u00dcBERBLICK 7 Seit der Ver\u00f6ffentlichung des letzten Demografieberichts im Jahr 2008 hat die EU-Bev\u00f6lkerung die 500-Millionen-Marke \u00fcberschritten und sich weiter in die bereits vor zwei Jahren erkennbare Richtung entwickelt. Mittlerweile liegt ein klareres Bild der demografischen Situation in der EU vor: Das Wachstum wird haupts\u00e4chlich durch Immigration gen\u00e4hrt, w\u00e4hrend die Bev\u00f6lkerung immer \u00e4lter und vielf\u00e4ltiger wird. \u00dcberdies sind die Auswirkungen der Wirtschaftskrise noch schwierig abzusch\u00e4tzen. Im Oktober 2006 hat die Kommission die Mitteilung \u2018Die demografische Zukunft Europas \u2013 Von der Herausforderung zur Chance\u2019 ( 13 ) herausgegeben und ihre Ansichten zu den demografischen Herausforderungen der EU und den m\u00f6glichen Herangehensweisen vorgestellt. In der Mitteilung wurde zum Ausdruck gebracht, dass man darauf vertraue, Europa werde mit dem demografischem Wandel und insbesondere der alternden Bev\u00f6lkerung zurechtkommen, aber es wurde auch Handlungsbedarf in f\u00fcnf politischen Schl\u00fcsselbereichen ermittelt: demografische Erneuerung, Besch\u00e4ftigung, Produktivit\u00e4t, Integration von Migranten und zukunftsf\u00e4hige \u00f6ffentliche Finanzen. Mit diesem dritten Demografiebericht sollen die aktuellen Fakten und Zahlen vorgelegt werden, die f\u00fcr eine fundierte Debatte \u00fcber diese Punkte vonn\u00f6ten sind. Neben dem EU-weiten \u00dcberblick werden soweit m\u00f6glich Daten f\u00fcr alle 27 Mitgliedstaaten der EU vorgelegt, die politische Entscheidungstr\u00e4ger und Interessenvertreter nutzen k\u00f6nnen, um die Situation ihres Landes mit der anderer Mitgliedstaaten zu vergleichen, um die besonderen Merkmale ihres Landes zu verstehen und um etwaige andere L\u00e4nder zu ermitteln, die \u00fcber interessante Erfahrungen berichten, von denen man lernen kann. Der diesj\u00e4hrige Bericht ist das Ergebnis eines Gemeinschaftsprojekts zwischen DG \u2018 Besch\u00e4ftigung, Soziales und Integration \u2019 und Eurostat und st\u00fctzt sich auf die Erfahrung von Eurostat im Bereich demografischer Untersuchungen. Er besteht aus zwei Teilen, einem kurzen Anhang zur Abwanderung in Zeiten der Rezession und einem L\u00e4nderanhang. Teil I befasst sich mit den fr\u00fcheren und aktuellen Entwicklungstrends in puncto Geburtenh\u00e4ufigkeit, Lebenserwartung und Migration, den drei Faktoren, die Bev\u00f6lkerungsver\u00e4nderungen ausl\u00f6sen. Darin enthalten ist ein \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Bev\u00f6lkerungsstruktur nach Alter und Familienzusammensetzung. In Teil II wird ein zunehmend an Bedeutung gewinnendes Ph\u00e4nomen untersucht, das in einer k\u00fcrzlich durchgef\u00fchrten Eurobarometer-Studie ermittelt wurde. Die Studie war der steigenden Zahl europ\u00e4ischer B\u00fcrger gewidmet, die sich ins Ausland begeben, um dort zu studieren, zu arbeiten, Lebenserfahrung zu sammeln oder nach Anregungen suchen, was zu unterschiedlichen Formen internationaler Verbundenheit \u00fcber Staatsgrenzen hinweg f\u00fchrt.

        "Demography Report, 2010 8 1. VERMEHRT \u00c4LTERE UND VIELF\u00c4LTIGERE EUROP\u00c4ER 1.1. Neue Lebensweisen f\u00fchren zu geringf\u00fcgiger Steigerung der Geburtenh\u00e4ufigkeit Die Bev\u00f6lkerung Europas ist von allm\u00e4hlichen Ver\u00e4nderungen betroffen, die jedoch betr\u00e4chtliche Ausma\u00dfe erreichen. Es sind zwei positive Haupttrends auszumachen: ein leichter Anstieg der Geburtenrate und eine h\u00f6here Lebenserwartung. Die Geburtenrate befindet sich in keinem Mitgliedstaat mehr auf niedrigstem Niveau (weniger als 1,3 Kinder pro Frau). Neuesten Zahlen f\u00fcr die EU-27 zufolge lag sie bei 1,6 und k\u00f6nnte bei Bereinigung um die Geburtenverschiebung (der sogenannte \u2018Tempoeffekt\u2019) auf \u00fcber 1,7 steigen. Diese kleine Anpassung kann das Defizit in Bezug auf die Ersatzrate von 2,1 nicht ausgleichen. Sie k\u00f6nnte jedoch zusammen mit einer m\u00f6glichen Zunahme der Geburtenrate bei zunehmendem Wohlstand in den EU- Mitgliedstaaten mittel- bis l\u00e4ngerfristig zu einem langsameren Bev\u00f6lkerungsr\u00fcckgang beitragen. Der m\u00e4\u00dfige Anstieg der Geburtenzahlen ergibt sich aus ziemlich neuen Mustern der Familienzusammensetzung: In L\u00e4ndern, in denen weniger geheiratet wird, mehr ehe\u00e4hnliche Gemeinschaften bestehen, es mehr Scheidungen gibt und Frauen, die Kinder geb\u00e4ren, ein h\u00f6heres Durchschnittsalter haben, liegt die Geburtenrate tendenziell h\u00f6her. Die sich ver\u00e4ndernde gesellschaftliche Wahrnehmung der Bedeutung des Heiratens und die geringere Dauerhaftigkeit von Beziehungen haben zu mehr au\u00dferehelichen Geburten, auch alleinerziehender Eltern, bzw. Kinderlosigkeit gef\u00fchrt. Es ist schwierig, den Einfluss der Familienpolitik auf diese Trends zu ermitteln, da eine wichtige Rolle kulturellen Faktoren zukommt. Die Daten lassen allerdings darauf schlie\u00dfen, dass das sp\u00e4tere Kinderkriegen in einigen L\u00e4ndern (z. B. Frankreich, D\u00e4nemark, Finnland und die Niederlande) mit h\u00f6heren Geburtenraten und relativ gro\u00dfz\u00fcgiger staatlicher Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr die Eltern einhergeht. Auf der anderen Seite besteht f\u00fcr Eltern in L\u00e4ndern, wie z. B. Rum\u00e4nien, die Slowakei und Ungarn, die ein niedrigeres Alter bei Geburt der Kinder aufweisen kein Zusammenhang mit einer hohen Geburtenrate herstellen.,. Dies w\u00fcrde auch mit den ersten Anzeichen \u00fcbereinstimmen, die darauf hindeuten, dass die Geburtenraten mit steigendem Wohlstand auch wieder steigen, nachdem zuvor jahrzehntelang genau das Gegenteil der Fall gewesen war. Aus den vorliegenden Anhaltspunkten geht hervor, dass wir eine bessere Politik ben\u00f6tigen, die Eltern dabei unterst\u00fctzt, mit den Zw\u00e4ngen einer modernen Gesellschaft zurechtzukommen. 1.2. Eine \u201ealternde\u201c Bev\u00f6lkerungsstruktur Es ist schwierig, die Auswirkungen politischer Ma\u00dfnahmen vorherzusagen. Eine Analyse der Konsequenzen einer sich ver\u00e4ndernden Bev\u00f6lkerungsstruktur ist da einfacher. Niedrige Geburtenraten sind nur die eine Seite, auf der anderen steht ein R\u00fcckgang der Sterblichkeitsziffer oder positiv ausgedr\u00fcckt eine l\u00e4ngere Lebenserwartung. 2009 betrug das durchschnittliche Bev\u00f6lkerungsalter 40,6. Hochrechnungen zufolge wird es 2060 bei 47,9 Jahren liegen. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 18 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "\u00dcberblick 9 Laut den Eurostat-Projektionen EUROPOP2008, die im vorangegangenen Demografiebericht enthalten waren, wird sich ab 2014 ein R\u00fcckgang der Erwerbsbev\u00f6lkerung (20 \u2013 64) bemerkbar machen, da die Babyboomer, die direkt nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg geboren wurden, jetzt Anfang 60 sind und in Rente gehen. Die Zahl der 60- und \u00dcber-60-J\u00e4hrigen in der EU steigt gegenw\u00e4rtig um \u00fcber 2 Millionen jedes Jahr, rund doppelt so schnell wie noch vor drei Jahren. Auch die Erwerbsbev\u00f6lkerung altert, da der Anteil \u00e4lterer Arbeitnehmer in Arbeit verglichen mit den j\u00fcngeren Arbeitnehmergruppen zunimmt. Jedes Jahr werden rund 5 Millionen Kinder in der EU-27 geboren und wandern \u00fcber 2 Millionen Menschen aus Drittl\u00e4ndern ein. Jedes Jahr werden mehr Geburten als Sterbef\u00e4lle gez\u00e4hlt, wobei die Differenz mehrere Hunderttausend betr\u00e4gt, und werden unter dem Strich weit \u00fcber eine Million Einwanderer verzeichnet. Die Zuwanderung tr\u00e4gt folglich am meisten zum Wachstum der EU-Bev\u00f6lkerung bei. 2008 lag die Lebenserwartung von M\u00e4nnern in der EU-27 bei 76,4 und von Frauen bei 82,4 Jahren. Es gibt nach wie vor signifikante Unterschiede zwischen den Mitgliedstaaten, die von knapp 13 Jahren f\u00fcr M\u00e4nner bis zu 8 bei Frauen reichen. Au\u00dferdem war die S\u00e4uglingssterblichkeit 2009 in einigen L\u00e4ndern wie Rum\u00e4nien (10,1 \u2030) und Bulgarien (9,0 \u2030) noch immer relativ hoch, auch wenn in den vergangenen 15 Jahren ein R\u00fcckgang von um die 50 % in der EU-27 erreicht wurde. Eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Rolle scheint dabei der sozio\u00f6konomische Status zu spielen, insbesondere in einigen mitteleurop\u00e4ischen L\u00e4ndern. Infolgedessen darf eine Erh\u00f6hung der Lebenserwartung insgesamt erwartet werden, wenn die Lebenserwartung von benachteiligten Gruppen verbessert wird. Eine m\u00f6gliche Entwicklung ist die Verbesserung der gesunden Lebenserwartung, durch Verz\u00f6gerung des Stadiums, in dem der Gesundheitszustand sich rasch zu verschlechtern beginnt, und dadurch die Verschiebung hin zu einem h\u00f6heren Sterbealter. Zu dieser Frage sind weitere Belege und Untersuchungen n\u00f6tig. Programme, die sich mit der alternden Bev\u00f6lkerung und Erwerbsbev\u00f6lkerung befassen, sorgen schwerpunktm\u00e4\u00dfig daf\u00fcr, dass \u00e4ltere Arbeitnehmer l\u00e4nger im aktiven und produktiven Erwerbsleben bleiben k\u00f6nnen. Einer der Vorteile einer alternden Bev\u00f6lkerung liegt darin, dass sich mehr M\u00f6glichkeiten f\u00fcr flexible Vereinbarungen im Laufe des Lebens bieten. Ein l\u00e4ngeres aktives Leben erm\u00f6glicht ausgedehnte oder wiederkehrende Weiterbildungsphasen, eine h\u00f6here Arbeitszeitflexibilit\u00e4t w\u00e4hrend der Jahre, in denen Kinder und berufliche Verpflichtungen nur schwer miteinander vereinbart werden k\u00f6nnen, die Unterbrechung der beruflichen Laufbahn, wenn man sich um Familienangeh\u00f6rige k\u00fcmmern muss, und ein produktives Ausscheiden aus dem Arbeitsleben durch ehrenamtliche Mitarbeit und allgemeines gesellschaftliches Engagement. 1.3. Europa in Bewegung Die Migration, insbesondere aus Nicht-EU-Staaten, k\u00f6nnte die \u00dcberalterung der Bev\u00f6lkerung (vor\u00fcbergehend) stoppen, da in erster Linie junge Erwachsene (im Alter von 25 \u2013 34) in andere L\u00e4nder abwandern. Durch die j\u00fcngeren ausl\u00e4ndischen Personengruppen, die zunehmend zu den \u00e4lteren nationalen Personengruppen hinzukommen, verj\u00fcngt sich die Gesamtbev\u00f6lkerung und erh\u00f6ht sich die Vielfalt. Aufgrund der Einwanderung sowohl aus Drittl\u00e4ndern als auch aus der EU-27 (innereurop\u00e4ische Mobilit\u00e4t) in bislang unbekanntem Ausma\u00df w\u00e4hrend des KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 19 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "Demography Report, 2010 10 vergangenen Jahrzehnts hat sich der Anteil der EU-27 Einwohner, die nicht in ihrem Heimatland oder Kulturkreis leben, betr\u00e4chtlich erh\u00f6ht. In den Mitgliedstaaten der EU-27 leben rund 20 Millionen Nicht-EU- Staatsb\u00fcrger. Weitere 10 Millionen EU-Staatsb\u00fcrger leben in einem anderen Mitgliedstaat und etwa 5 Millionen Menschen haben seit 2001 die EU- Staatsb\u00fcrgerschaft erworben. Da die meisten Einwanderer relativ jung sind und erst vor recht kurzer Zeit in die EU gekommen sind, leisten sie einen gro\u00dfen Beitrag zur Erwerbsbev\u00f6lkerung der EU-27. In der Zukunft wird sich die erwerbst\u00e4tige Bev\u00f6lkerung zunehmend aus Menschen mit Migrationshintergrund zusammensetzen. Von den EU-Staatsb\u00fcrgern haben neben den rund 8 % der EU-Ans\u00e4ssigen ausl\u00e4ndischer Herkunft ( 14 ) weitere 5 % mindestens ein im Ausland geborenes Elternteil, und dieser Anteil wird weiter wachsen. Man geht davon aus, dass der Anteil der Personen aller Staatsangeh\u00f6rigkeiten mit mindestens einem im Ausland geborenen Elternteil bis zum Jahr 2060 knapp ein Drittel der Bev\u00f6lkerung der EU-27 betragen wird. Bei der Erwerbsbev\u00f6lkerung wird ein noch gr\u00f6\u00dferer Teil ausl\u00e4ndischer Abstammung sein. Diese Trends erfordern, dass zus\u00e4tzliche Anstrengungen unternommen werden, um sicherzustellen, dass Immigranten die M\u00f6glichkeit haben, sich in die Gesellschaft ihres Gastlandes zu integrieren. Noch wichtiger ist es, ihnen zu erm\u00f6glichen, sich ihrem Bildungsniveau entsprechend am Arbeitsmarkt zu beteiligen. Eine mobile Bev\u00f6lkerung kann eine Bereicherung f\u00fcr die Gastl\u00e4nder sein. Immer mehr Menschen m\u00f6chten Auslandserfahrung machen. Dadurch k\u00f6nnen sie zu einer effizienteren und produktiveren Wirtschaft beitragen und au\u00dferdem ihre pers\u00f6nlichen Kompetenzen verbessern. 2. EINE ZUNEHMEND VIELF\u00c4LTIGE UND MOBILE EU- BEV\u00d6LKERUNG Da die Zuwanderung aus Drittl\u00e4ndern und die Mobilit\u00e4t zwischen den Mitgliedstaaten zunimmt, stammt ein wachsender Teil der Erwerbsbev\u00f6lkerung (15 % im Jahr 2008) aus dem Ausland oder verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber mindestens ein Elternteil, das im Ausland geboren wurde. Durch die sich ver\u00e4ndernden Muster der Zuwanderung und Mobilit\u00e4t innerhalb Europas wird das Gef\u00fchl der Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit zu einer bestimmten Nation diffuser und komplexer, insbesondere im Falle der Freiz\u00fcgigkeit zwischen den EU-Mitgliedstaaten. Wenngleich die traditionelle langfristige, besch\u00e4ftigungsbedingte und m\u00e4nnerdominierte Zuwanderung nach wie vor existiert, immigrieren zunehmend auch Frauen und bilden mittlerweile in einigen Mitgliedstaaten die Mehrheit. Auch die Richtung der Mobilit\u00e4t hat sich ge\u00e4ndert: Einige der Mitgliedstaaten, aus denen traditionell viele Auswanderer stammten, sind mittlerweile sehr beliebte Einwanderungsl\u00e4nder. Es ist definitiv kein neues geschichtliches Ph\u00e4nomen, dass die B\u00fcrger der EU in andere L\u00e4nder abwandern und die Kulturen sich vermischen. Fr\u00fchere Migrationsstr\u00f6me haben sich unterschiedlich auf die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und Struktur der Bev\u00f6lkerung in den meisten EU-27-Mitgliedstaaten ausgewirkt und bei den B\u00fcrgern zu einer verst\u00e4rkt europ\u00e4ischen Perspektive beigetragen. Einwanderer m\u00f6chten h\u00e4ufig eine enge Bindung zu ihrem Herkunftsland ( 14 ) Zur Gruppe der im Ausland Geborenen z\u00e4hlen hier Personen, die in einem anderen Mitgliedstaat geboren sind als dem, in dem sie wohnen.

        "\u00dcberblick 11 aufrechterhalten, diese Verkn\u00fcpfungen nehmen jedoch mit der Zeit tendenziell ab. Die generations\u00fcbergreifende Integration von Einwanderern erfolgt recht z\u00fcgig. In den meisten L\u00e4ndern, in denen ein betr\u00e4chtlicher Anteil an Einwanderern der zweiten Generation lebt, schneiden diese in der Schule und im Berufsleben deutlich besser als die erste Generation und fast so gut wie die Einwohner ohne ausl\u00e4ndische Wurzeln ab. Dies gilt sowohl f\u00fcr Nachk\u00f6mmlinge von Migranten aus anderen Mitgliedstaaten als auch f\u00fcr diejenigen aus Drittl\u00e4ndern. Trotz allem sind die Nachkommen von Migranten auch noch in der dritten Generation \u2013 der \u00fcblichen Dauer bis zu vollst\u00e4ndigen Integration \u2013 in gewisser Weise mit dem Herkunftsland ihrer Vorfahren verbunden, beispielsweise in Form von Fremdsprachenkenntnissen. Neben der traditionellen Migration und Mobilit\u00e4t sind auch neue Formen der Mobilit\u00e4t zu erkennen. Umz\u00fcge ins Ausland finden haupts\u00e4chlich innerhalb der Mitgliedstaaten und f\u00fcr k\u00fcrzere Zeitr\u00e4ume auf der Suche nach Arbeit, im Rahmen der Ausbildung oder zwecks Wahrnehmung sonstiger M\u00f6glichkeiten statt. Bei diesem mobilen Teil der Bev\u00f6lkerung handelt es sich in der Regel um gut ausgebildete junge Menschen, die eher am oberen Ende der Berufsskala angesiedelt sind. Diese Form der Mobilit\u00e4t basiert zunehmend auf pers\u00f6nlichen Pr\u00e4ferenzen und der Wahl eines bestimmten Lebensstils, und nicht ausschlie\u00dflich auf wirtschaftlichen Gr\u00fcnden. Die erh\u00f6hte Mobilit\u00e4tsneigung k\u00f6nnte f\u00fcr die EU von gro\u00dfem Nutzen sein, da so ein besserer Abgleich von Kompetenzen und Sprachkenntnissen mit Stellenangeboten m\u00f6glich wird. Die Ergebnisse einer Eurobarometer-Studie ( 15 ) deuten auf das Vorhandensein einer vielf\u00e4ltigen und wachsenden Anzahl mobiler junger Menschen hin, die sich dadurch auszeichnen, dass sie allesamt gerne einen Blick \u00fcber die eigenen Landesgrenzen hinweg werfen m\u00f6chten. Der Eurobarometer-Studie ist ferner zu entnehmen, dass ungef\u00e4hr ein F\u00fcnftel der Teilnehmer aus den 27 EU-L\u00e4ndern irgendwann im Laufe des Lebens entweder im Ausland gearbeitet oder studiert hat, mit einem Partner aus einem anderen Land liiert war oder Immobilien im Ausland besitzt. Bei der H\u00e4lfte dieser Befragten sind Vorfahren aus anderen L\u00e4ndern der Grund f\u00fcr die Verbindung, bei der anderen H\u00e4lfte handelt es sich meistens um junge und gut ausgebildete Menschen, die sich bewusst f\u00fcr eine bestimmte Lebensform entscheiden, um andere L\u00e4nder kennenzulernen. Ihre Bereitschaft, wenn nicht gar Lust, auszuwandern, ist bis zu viermal h\u00f6her als bei Personen, die keinerlei Verbindungen zu einem anderen Land haben. Da dieses Ph\u00e4nomen k\u00fcnftig wahrscheinlich noch st\u00e4rker an Bedeutung gewinnt, sollte die Politik die damit verbundenen Konsequenzen in die Planung der sozio\u00f6konomischen Zukunft der europ\u00e4ischen Bev\u00f6lkerung mit einbeziehen. 3. BEV\u00d6LKERUNGSPOLITIK W\u00c4HREND DER REZESSION Vor Beginn der Rezession hatte das Engagement der EU-Mitgliedstaaten im Hinblick auf die Umsetzung der politischen Zielsetzungen des Vertrags von Lissabon bereits erste Ergebnisse in Form von Besch\u00e4ftigung f\u00fcr junge Menschen, Frauen, \u00e4ltere Arbeitnehmer und Einwanderer gezeigt. Die ersten, die die Rezession zu sp\u00fcren bekamen, waren j\u00fcngere Menschen und Einwanderer. Den Regierungen fiel es zunehmend schwer, die Unterst\u00fctzung ( 15 ) Eurobarometer EBS 346 abrufbar unter http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_346_en.pdf KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 21 1/07/11 08:08 ",

Es ist noch zu fr\u00fch f\u00fcr sichere Schlussfolgerungen in Bezug auf die Auswirkungen der Krise auf die Geburtenh\u00e4ufigkeit und Lebenserwartung. Die in vergangenen Rezessionsperioden gemachte Erfahrung zeigt, dass sowohl die Geburtenrate als auch die Sterblichkeit anfangs leicht zur\u00fcckgehen, aber dann kurz nach Ende der Krise wieder auf den Stand vor der Krise steigen. Neue Wohnsitzdaten von Eurostat lassen R\u00fcckschl\u00fcsse auf die Gr\u00fcnde f\u00fcr die Einwanderung aus Drittl\u00e4ndern zu. Den verf\u00fcgbaren Daten ist zu entnehmen, dass der Zuwanderungsr\u00fcckgang haupts\u00e4chlich darauf zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren ist, dass weniger Menschen aus beruflichen und famili\u00e4ren Gr\u00fcnden auswandern, w\u00e4hrend die Zahl der zu Studien- und sonstigen Zwecken ausgestellten Aufenthaltsgenehmigungen zwischen 2008 und 2009 leicht angestiegen ist. 4. WAS WIRD UNTERNOMMEN? Im Juni 2010 verabschiedete der Europ\u00e4ische Rat die neue zehnj\u00e4hrige Strategie Europa 2020 f\u00fcr mehr Besch\u00e4ftigung und intelligentes, nachhaltiges und integratives Wachstum ( 16 ). Die Strategie dient der Neuausrichtung vorhandener politischer Ma\u00dfnahmen weg vom Krisenmanagement hinzu mittel- bis l\u00e4ngerfristigen Zielsetzungen zur F\u00f6rderung von Wachstum und Besch\u00e4ftigung sowie zur Sicherstellung der zuk\u00fcnftigen Tragf\u00e4higkeit \u00f6ffentlicher Finanzen. Letzteres ist eine Grundvoraussetzung f\u00fcr den sozialen Zusammenhalt in der EU. Die Rezession hat das Engagement der Mitgliedstaaten, sich den demografischen Herausforderungen zu stellen, nicht geschm\u00e4lert. Die Mitgliedstaaten scheinen im Gegenteil noch st\u00e4rker dazu entschlossen zu sein. Die Strategie, mit der man den demografischen Ver\u00e4nderungen begegnen wollte, stimmt anscheinend genau mit dem Grundtenor der neuen Strategie Europa 2020 \u00fcberein. Als Folge der Rezession \u2013 und trotz der tr\u00fcben Aussichten f\u00fcr die \u00f6ffentlichen Haushalte \u2013 ist die Europ\u00e4ische Kommission davon \u00fcberzeugt, dass der demografische Aspekt von den Mitgliedstaaten bei der Ausarbeitung ihrer Strategien zur \u00dcberwindung der derzeitigen Rezession umfassend ber\u00fccksichtigt werden muss. Bereits im Oktober 2006 hat die Kommission in ihrer Mitteilung zur demografischen Zukunft Europas ( 17 ) hervorgehoben, dass sich die EU die demografischen M\u00f6glichkeiten zunutze machen sollte. In der Mitteilung hie\u00df es, man solle das Problem der niedrigen Geburtenraten durch Schaffung besserer Bedingungen f\u00fcr Familien angehen, damit das Problem der schrumpfenden Erwerbsbev\u00f6lkerung gel\u00f6st w\u00fcrde, indem man die Besch\u00e4ftigungsquote und Produktivit\u00e4tsrate erh\u00f6ht, sich auf Zuwanderung und bessere Integration st\u00fctzt und letztendlich auch die zuk\u00fcnftigen Bed\u00fcrfnisse einer alternden Gesellschaft durch Schaffung tragf\u00e4higer \u00f6ffentlicher Haushalte erf\u00fcllt. Es liege in der Verantwortung der Mitgliedstaaten, zu entscheiden, wie sie ihr Potenzial verwirklichen.

        "\u00dcberblick 13 Mitteilung wurde die Art der Unterst\u00fctzung hervorgehoben, welche die EU den Mitgliedstaaten im Hinblick auf die Koordinierung der bestehenden politischen Ma\u00dfnahmen anbieten kann. Auf Ersuchen der Mitgliedstaaten und mit Unterst\u00fctzung des Europ\u00e4ischen Parlaments wird dieser Prozess durch die Aktivit\u00e4ten erg\u00e4nzt, die unter dem Dach der Europ\u00e4ischen Allianz f\u00fcr Familien ( 18 ) und des geplanten Europ\u00e4ischen Jahres f\u00fcr aktives Altern 2012 ( 19 ) organisiert werden. Der Erfolg der Strategie ist weitgehend an die F\u00e4higkeit der EU gebunden, sich den gro\u00dfen demografischen Ver\u00e4nderungen des kommenden Jahrzehnts zu stellen. Die Zukunft Europas h\u00e4ngt in hohem Ma\u00dfe davon ab, ob das hohe Potenzial der beiden am schnellsten wachsenden Bev\u00f6lkerungsteile genutzt werden kann: \u00e4ltere Menschen und Einwanderer. Es lassen sich drei politische Bereiche ausmachen, die f\u00fcr die F\u00f6rderung des Wirtschaftswachstums und die Schaffung eines st\u00e4rkeren sozialen Zusammenhalts entscheidend sein d\u00fcrften: \u2013 Die F\u00f6rderung des aktiven Alterns: \u00c4ltere Menschen und insbesondere die \u00e4lter werdende Generation der Babyboomer k\u00f6nnen sich auf ein langes gesundes Leben freuen und verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber wertvolle Kompetenzen und Erfahrungen. Durch ein gr\u00f6\u00dferes Angebot an M\u00f6glichkeiten des aktiven Alterns k\u00f6nnen diese Personengruppen auch nach ihrer Pensionierung noch einen sozialen Beitrag leisten. \u2013 Die Integration von Migranten und deren Nachkommen: Dieser Punkt ist f\u00fcr Europa von entscheidender Bedeutung, da Migranten sogar einen noch gr\u00f6\u00dferen Teil der Erwerbsbev\u00f6lkerung ausmachen werden. Die niedrigen Besch\u00e4ftigungsquoten von Migranten sind sowohl in sozialer als auch finanzieller Hinsicht nicht tragbar. \u2013 Die Vereinbarkeit von bezahlter Arbeit und famili\u00e4ren Verpflichtungen: Personen mit Betreuungsverantwortung erhalten immer noch keine angemessene Unterst\u00fctzung und geeignete Optionen, um ihre unterschiedlichen Pflichten miteinander zu vereinbaren. Als Folge davon wird das Wirtschaftswachstum blockiert, weil zu viele Menschen ihre erstklassigen Kompetenzen und erworbenen Kenntnisse auf dem Arbeitsmarkt nicht in vollem Umfang nutzen k\u00f6nnen. Besonders Frauen sind aufgrund der hartn\u00e4ckigen geschlechterbezogenen Kluft in Bezug auf Beruf und Gehalt betroffen. Gleichzeitig m\u00fcssen in Europa aber auch Wege gefunden werden, wie eine h\u00f6here Produktivit\u00e4t aufrechterhalten werden kann, w\u00e4hrend man sich auf steigende Kosten in Verbindung mit einer alternden Gesellschaft einstellen muss, und das vor dem Hintergrund schrumpfender \u00f6ffentlicher Haushalte infolge der Rezession.

Le tableau d\u00e9mographique de l\u2019UE a gagn\u00e9 en pr\u00e9cision : la croissance est principalement aliment\u00e9e par l\u2019immigration, tandis que la popu lation vieillit et se diversifie. L\u2019influence de la crise \u00e9conomique est toujours difficile \u00e0 \u00e9valuer. En octobre 2006, dans sa communication intitul\u00e9e \u00abL\u2019avenir d\u00e9mographique de l\u2019Europe, transformer un d\u00e9fi en opportunit\u00e9\u00bb ( 20 ) , la Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses points de vue sur les d\u00e9fis d\u00e9mographiques rencontr\u00e9s par l\u2019UE et sur les options pour les relever. La communication a exprim\u00e9 sa confiance en la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019Europe \u00e0 faire face aux changements d\u00e9mographiques et au vieillissement de la population en particulier, mais a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019agir dans cinq secteurs cl\u00e9s : le renouveau d\u00e9mographique, l\u2019emploi, la productivit\u00e9, l\u2019int\u00e9gration des migrants et les finances publiques soutenables Ce troisi\u00e8me Rapport sur la d\u00e9mographie vise \u00e0 fournir les derniers chiffres et donn\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires pour un d\u00e9bat \u00e9clair\u00e9 sur ces questions. Outre la vue d\u2019ensemble au niveau communautaire, les chiffres sont donn\u00e9s, dans la mesure du possible, pour l\u2019ensemble des 27 \u00c9tats membres de l\u2019UE, permettant aux d\u00e9cideurs politiques et aux parties prenantes de comparer la situation de leur propre pays avec celle des autres \u00c9tats membres, de comprendre les caract\u00e9ristiques sp\u00e9cifiques de leur pays et, si possible, d\u2019identifier d\u2019autres pays qui pourraient apporter d\u2019 int\u00e9ressantes exp\u00e9riences dont on pourrait s\u2019instruire. Cette ann\u00e9e, le rapport est r\u00e9alis\u00e9 en collaboration avec la Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00ab Emploi, affaires sociales et inclusion \u00bb et Eurostat, et tire parti de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience d'Eurostat en mati\u00e8re d\u2019analyse d\u00e9mo graphique.

        "R\u00e9sum\u00e9 15 1. DES EUROP\u00c9ENS PLUS NOMBREUX, PLUS \u00c2G\u00c9S, VIVANT DANS UNE PLUS GRANDE DIVERSIT\u00c9 1.1. Des mod\u00e8les nouveaux entra\u00eenent une l\u00e9g\u00e8re augmentation de la f\u00e9condit\u00e9 Des changements progressifs, mais n\u00e9anmoins significatifs, touchent la population en Europe. Deux tendances positives principales \u00e9mergent : une l\u00e9g\u00e8re augmentation de la f\u00e9condit\u00e9 et une plus grande esp\u00e9rance de vie. La tr\u00e8s faible f\u00e9condit\u00e9 \u2013 inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 1,3 enfant par femme \u2013 n\u2019 est plus de mise dans l\u2019ensemble des \u00c9tats membres. Le chiffre le plus r\u00e9cent pour l\u2019Europe des 27 s\u2019est \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 1,6 et pourrait grimper \u00e0 plus d\u20191,7 si les ajustements pour le report des naissances (les d\u00e9nomm\u00e9s \u00ab effets de tempo \u00bb) sont pris en consid\u00e9ration. Ce petit ajustement ne compense pas le d\u00e9ficit par rapport au seuil de renouvellement de 2,1, mais pourrait contribuer \u00e0 un ralentissement du taux de la baisse de la population \u00e0 moyen/plus long terme, parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 une possible augmentation de la f\u00e9condit\u00e9 \u00e0 mesure d\u2019un enrichissement des \u00c9tats membres de l\u2019UE. La progression modeste de la f\u00e9condit\u00e9 est le r\u00e9sultat de mod\u00e8les quelque peu nouveaux en termes de sch\u00e9ma familial : des pays avec moins de mariages, davantage de concubinage, plus de divorces et une moyenne plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00e2ge des femmes au moment de l\u2019accouchement tendent \u00e0 engendrer une f\u00e9condit\u00e9 plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e. Le changement des perceptions sociales quant au r\u00f4le du mariage et une plus grande fragilit\u00e9 des relations sont \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019un nombre plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 de naissances extraconjugales, y compris dans les familles monoparentales, ou d\u2019une inf\u00e9condit\u00e9. L\u2019impact des politiques familiales sur ces tendances est difficile \u00e0 \u00e9valuer dans la mesure o\u00f9 les facteurs culturels jouent un r\u00f4le important. Cependant, les donn\u00e9es sugg\u00e8rent que l\u2019ajournement de la maternit\u00e9 \u00e0 un \u00e2ge plus avanc\u00e9 s\u2019accompagne dans quelques pays (France, Danemark, Finlande et Pays -Bas par exemple) de taux de f\u00e9condit\u00e9 plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s et d\u2019aides publiques relativement g\u00e9n\u00e9reuses po ur les parents. \u00c0 l\u2019autre extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9chelle, dans des pays comme la Roumanie, la Slovaquie et la Hongrie, un \u00e2ge inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 l\u2019accouchement n\u2019est pas associ\u00e9 \u00e0 un taux de f\u00e9condit\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9. Cette situation serait \u00e9galement en phase avec les premiers \u00e9l\u00e9ments indiquant que la f\u00e9condit\u00e9 s\u2019accro\u00eet encore avec la richesse, apr\u00e8s des d\u00e9cennies de f\u00e9condit\u00e9 en berne alors que les pays s\u2019enrichissaient. Cette \u00e9vidence \u00e9mergente \u00e9taie la th\u00e8se selon laquelle il est n\u00e9cessaire de disposer de meilleures politiques pouvant aider les parents \u00e0 faire face aux co ntraintes d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 moderne. 1.1. Une structure de la population \u00ab vieillissante \u00bb Bien qu\u2019il soit difficile de pr\u00e9dire l\u2019influence des politiques, une analyse de l\u2019impact des changements dans la structur e de la population est plus simple. Les faibles taux de f\u00e9condit\u00e9 ne constituent qu\u2019un des deux aspects du ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne, l\u2019autre aspect \u00e9tant une baisse du nombre des d\u00e9c\u00e8s, ou en termes plus positifs, d\u2019une hausse de l\u2019esp\u00e9rance de vie. En 2009, l\u2019\u00e2ge moyen de la population \u00e9tait de 40,6 et il devrait atteindre, selon les pr\u00e9visions, 47,9 ans d\u2019ici 2060. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 25 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "Demography Report, 2010 16 Les projections EUROPOP2008, pr\u00e9par\u00e9es par Eurostat et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent Rapport sur la d\u00e9mographie, indiquent que d\u2019ici 2014, la population active (20-64) commencera \u00e0 se contracter alors que d\u2019importantes cohortes de \u00ab baby-boomers \u00bb n\u00e9s imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la Seconde Guerre atteignent d\u00e9sormais la soixantaine et prennent leur retraite. Le nombre d\u2019individus \u00e2g\u00e9s de 60 ans et plus au sein de l\u2019UE cro\u00eet actuellement de plus de deux millions chaque ann\u00e9e, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s deux fois le taux observ\u00e9 jusqu\u2019il y a encore trois ans. La population active vieillit \u00e9galement du fait de l\u2019accroissement de la proportion des travailleurs plus \u00e2g\u00e9s en activit\u00e9 par rapport aux groupes de travailleurs plus jeunes. Chaque ann\u00e9e, environ 5 millions d\u2019enfants voient le jour dans l\u2019Europe des 27 et plus de 2 millions de personnes immigrent de pays tiers. Les naissances d\u00e9passent les d\u00e9c\u00e8s de plusieurs centaines de milliers de personnes chaque ann\u00e9e tandis que l\u2019immigration nette est nettement sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 un million. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019immigration repr\u00e9sente la part la plus importante de la croissance de la population de l\u2019UE. En 2008, l\u2019esp\u00e9rance de vie pour l\u2019Europe des 27 \u00e9tait de 76,4 ans pour les hommes et de 82,4 ans pour les femmes. Les \u00e9carts parmi les \u00c9tats membres sont toujours tr\u00e8s significatifs, allant de presque 13 ans pour les hommes \u00e0 8 ans pour les femmes. La mortalit\u00e9 infantile en 2009 est aussi toujours relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9e dans certains pays tels que la Roumanie (10,1 \u2030) et la Bulgarie (9,0 \u2030), m\u00eame si une baisse d\u2019environ 50 % pour l\u2019UE -27 a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e au cours des 15 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Le statut socio-\u00e9conomique semble jouer un r\u00f4le majeur, notamment da ns certains pays d\u2019Europe centrale. Par cons\u00e9quent, en am\u00e9liorant l\u2019esp\u00e9rance de vie des cat\u00e9gories d\u00e9savantag\u00e9es, une hausse g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019esp\u00e9rance de vie globale devrait \u00e9galement se profiler. Une \u00e9volution possible serait l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de l\u2019esp\u00e9rance de vie en bonne sant\u00e9, en retardant le moment auquel les conditions physiques commencent \u00e0 se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer rapidement, reportant de ce fait la mort \u00e0 un \u00e2ge ult\u00e9rieur. Ce sujet important exige d\u2019autres preuves et analyses. Les politiques abordant le vieillissement de la population et la main- d\u2019\u0153uvre visent \u00e0 permettre aux travailleurs plus \u00e2g\u00e9s de rester actifs et productifs pendant une plus longue p\u00e9riode de leur vie. L\u2019un des avantages d\u2019une population vieillissante est qu\u2019elle offre plus de possibilit\u00e9s e n termes de souplesse des dispositions au cours de la vie. Une plus longue vie active permet des p\u00e9riodes prolong\u00e9es ou p\u00e9riodiques en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9ducation ; une plus grande flexibilit\u00e9 du temps de travail pendant les ann\u00e9es d\u2019effervescence o\u00f9 la maternit\u00e9 et les engagements professionnels co\u00efncident ; une interruption de carri\u00e8re temporaire quand il devient n\u00e9cessaire de prendre soin de membres de la famille ; et une retraite productive via le volontariat et un engagement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans la vie sociale. 1.2. L\u2019Europe en mouvement L\u2019immigration, notamment en provenance des pays non membres de l\u2019UE, pourrait fournir un sursis (provisoire) au vieillissement de la population, puisque la plupart des personnes \u00e9migrent principalement lorsqu\u2019elles sont de jeunes adultes (25-34 ans). Alors que les groupes de jeunes \u00e9trangers entrent progressivement dans les cohortes nationales plus \u00e2g\u00e9es, l\u2019ensemble de la population rajeunit et la diversit\u00e9 s\u2019accro\u00eet. Des niveaux sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent d\u2019immigration provenant tant de pays tiers que de l\u2019UE -27 (mobilit\u00e9 intracommunautaire) au cours de la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie ont sensiblement KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 26 1/07/11 08:08 ",

Parmi les ressortissants de l\u2019UE, outre le taux approximatif de 8 % de personnes r\u00e9sidant dans l\u2019UE et n\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger ( 21 ), 5 % suppl\u00e9mentaires ont au moins un parent n\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, et cette cat\u00e9gorie continuera \u00e0 cro\u00eetre. En 2060, les personnes de toute nationalit\u00e9 ayant au moins un parent n\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger devraient repr\u00e9senter pr\u00e8s d\u2019un tiers de la population de l\u2019UE -27. Un pourcentage encore plus important de la main- d\u2019\u0153uvre sera d\u2019origine \u00e9trang\u00e8re. Ces tendances impliquent que des efforts suppl\u00e9mentaires sont n\u00e9cessaires pour garantir que les immigr\u00e9s aient l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de s\u2019int\u00e9grer dans leur soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019accueil et, fondamentalement, de leur permettre de contribuer au march\u00e9 du travail en utilisant pleinement leurs qualifications. Une population mobile peut \u00eatre per\u00e7 ue comme un atout par les pays d\u2019accueil. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 de plus en plus de gens recherchent une exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, ils peuvent contribuer \u00e0 une \u00e9conomie plus efficace et productive tout en renfor\u00e7ant leurs comp\u00e9tences personnelles. 2. UNE POPULATION EUROP\u00c9ENNE DE PLUS EN PLUS DIVERSE ET MOBILE Alors que les flux migratoires en provenance des pays non membres de l\u2019UE et la mobilit\u00e9 entre \u00c9tats membres se sont intensifi\u00e9s, une proportion croissante de la population active (15 % en 2008) est n\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger ou a au moins un parent n\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. L\u2019\u00e9volution des sch\u00e9mas migratoires et de la mobilit\u00e9 en Europe rendent le sentiment national relatif \u00e0 l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une nation particuli\u00e8re plus diffus et complexe, en particulier dans le cas de la mobilit\u00e9 entre les \u00c9tats membres de l\u2019UE. Bien que l\u2019immigration traditionnelle \u00e0 long terme, motiv\u00e9e par l\u2019emploi, principalement masculine, soit toujours \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du jour, les femmes immigrantes sont de plus de plus pr\u00e9sentes et sont d\u00e9sormais majoritaires dans certains \u00c9tats membres. Les flux de mobilit\u00e9 ont \u00e9galement chang\u00e9 : certains des principaux \u00c9tats membres traditionnels d\u2019\u00e9migration sont devenus des p\u00f4les d\u2019attraction pour les migrants. La migration \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle et le m\u00e9lange des cultures ne sont \u00e9videmment pas un nouveau ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne dans l\u2019histoire de l\u2019UE. Les flux pass\u00e9s ont eu un impact diff\u00e9rent sur la taille et la structure de la population dans la plupart des \u00c9tats membres de l\u2019UE -27 et ils ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 une perspective plus europ\u00e9enne parmi ses citoyens. Les immigr\u00e9s souhaitent souvent conserver un attachement proche \u00e0 leur pays d\u2019origine, mais ces liens tendent \u00e0 s\u2019amenuiser au fil du temps. ( 21 ) L\u2019expression \u00ab n\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger \u00bb inclut ici les personnes n\u00e9es dans un \u00c9tat membre diff\u00e9rent de celui dans lequel elles r\u00e9sident.

        "Demography Report, 2010 18 L\u2019int\u00e9gration des immigr\u00e9s \u00e0 travers les g\u00e9n\u00e9rations s\u2019effectue plut\u00f4t rapidement. Dans la p lupart des pays disposant d\u2019une proportion substantielle d\u2019immigr\u00e9s de la seconde g\u00e9n\u00e9ration, ceux -ci r\u00e9ussissent nettement mieux sur le plan de l\u2019\u00e9ducation tout comme sur le march\u00e9 du travail que les immigr\u00e9s de la premi\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ration et presque aussi bien que les individus sans origine \u00e9trang\u00e8re ; cela s\u2019applique aux descendants des migrants provenant des autres \u00c9tats membres et des immigr\u00e9s en provenance des pays non membres de l\u2019UE. N\u00e9anmoins, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s trois g\u00e9n\u00e9rations, \u2013 le temps habituellement n\u00e9cessaire pour une int\u00e9gration totale \u2013 les descendants des migrants conservent un certain attachement aux pays de leurs anc\u00eatres, par leur connaissance des langues \u00e9trang\u00e8res par exemple. Parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 l\u2019immigration et \u00e0 la mobilit\u00e9 traditionnelles, il e xiste de nouvelles formes de mobilit\u00e9. Les individus se d\u00e9placent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, principalement dans d\u2019autres \u00c9tats membres, pour des p\u00e9riodes plus courtes en vue de chercher du travail, de poursuivre leur formation ou pour toute autre opportunit\u00e9 de vie. Ces individus mobiles tendent \u00e0 \u00eatre de jeunes adultes instruits, dirig\u00e9s vers l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure de l\u2019\u00e9chelle professionnelle. Cette forme de mobilit\u00e9 est bas\u00e9e de plus en plus sur des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences personnelles et des choix de vie, et pas seulement sur des opportunit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques. La propension accrue \u00e0 la mobilit\u00e9 pourrait \u00eatre tr\u00e8s b\u00e9n\u00e9fique \u00e0 l\u2019UE en permettant une meilleure mise en ad\u00e9quation des qualifications et des capacit\u00e9s linguistiques avec les offres d\u2019emploi. Les r\u00e9sultats d\u2019une enqu\u00eate Euro barom\u00e8tre ( 22 ) mettent en \u00e9vidence la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un nombre vari\u00e9 et croissant de jeunes gens mobiles caract\u00e9ris\u00e9s par un int\u00e9r\u00eat commun pour ce qui se fait au-del\u00e0 des fronti\u00e8res nationales. L\u2019enqu\u00eate Eurobarom\u00e8tre indique \u00e9galement qu\u2019une personne sond\u00e9e s ur cinq de l\u2019UE -27 a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 ou travaill\u00e9 dans un autre pays \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, v\u00e9cu avec un conjoint d\u2019un autre pays ou poss\u00e8de un bien immobilier \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. La moiti\u00e9 de ces personnes sond\u00e9es a des liens avec d\u2019autres pays par ascendance ; l\u2019autre moit i\u00e9 est le plus souvent jeune et instruite et effectue consciemment un choix de vie qui la met en contact avec d\u2019autres pays. Ils partagent une forte volont\u00e9, sinon une propension \u00e0 se d\u00e9placer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quatre fois plus que les personnes qui ne disposent d\u2019aucune connexion avec un autre pays. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne est susceptible de devenir bien plus important \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, il est possible que les d\u00e9cideurs politiques souhaitent tenir compte de ses implications dans la planification de l\u2019av enir socio-\u00e9conomique de la population europ\u00e9enne. 3. POLITIQUE D\u00c9MOGRAPHIQUE AU COURS DE LA R\u00c9CESSION Avant la r\u00e9cession \u00e9conomique, l\u2019engagement des \u00c9tats membres de l\u2019UE \u00e0 mettre en application les objectifs politiques inscrits dans le programme du trait\u00e9 de Lisbonne avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 donner des r\u00e9sultats sous la forme de l\u2019emploi des jeunes, des femmes, des travailleurs plus \u00e2g\u00e9s et des migrants. Quand la r\u00e9cession est survenue, les premiers groupes \u00e0 \u00eatre affect\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les jeunes et les immigr\u00e9s. Les gouvernements ont fait face \u00e0 des difficult\u00e9s croissantes en \u00e9quilibrant soutien aux familles, consolidation des budgets, aide aux jeunes et aux immigr\u00e9s sur un march\u00e9 du travail en contraction, et en finan\u00e7ant les r\u00e9gimes de retraite.

Les nouvelles donn\u00e9es d\u2019Eurostat sur les permis de s\u00e9jour mettent en lumi\u00e8re les raisons de l\u2019immigration en provenance des pays non membres de l\u2019UE. Les donn\u00e9es disponible s montrent que la baisse de l\u2019immigration est en grande partie due \u00e0 une r\u00e9duction de l\u2019immigration pour des raisons professionnelles et familiales, alors que le nombre de permis de s\u00e9jour d\u00e9livr\u00e9s pour les \u00e9tudes et d\u2019autres raisons a l\u00e9g\u00e8rement augment\u00e9 de 2008 \u00e0 2009. 4. MESURES PRISES En juin 2010, le Conseil europ\u00e9en a adopt\u00e9 la nouvelle strat\u00e9gie Europe2020 pour les dix ans \u00e0 venir afin de cr\u00e9er davantage d\u2019emplois et parvenir \u00e0 une croissance intelligente, durable et exhaustive ( 23 ). La strat\u00e9gie d\u00e9finit une r\u00e9orientation des politiques existantes depuis la gestion de la crise jusqu\u2019aux objectifs \u00e0 moyen et plus long terme pour favoriser la croissance et l\u2019emploi et pour assurer la durabilit\u00e9 future des finances publiques. Ce dernier point est une cond ition pr\u00e9alable pour la coh\u00e9sion sociale durable dans l\u2019UE. La r\u00e9cession n\u2019a pas amenuis\u00e9 l\u2019engagement des \u00c9tats membres \u00e0 relever le d\u00e9fi d\u00e9mographique. Au contraire, cet engagement semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 renforc\u00e9. La strat\u00e9gie adopt\u00e9e pour aborder la mutation d\u00e9mographique semble concorder avec la pouss\u00e9e globale de la nouvelle strat\u00e9gie Europe 2020.

        "INTRODUCTION 21 The Commission's Europe 2020 Strategy has identified concern about population ageing, together with globalisation, climate change, competitiveness and macroeconomic imbalances, as one of the key challenges that the European Union needs to overcome. Sixty years ago the number of births rose sharply and remained high for about 20 to 30 years. Now the first of those baby-boomers, have reached the age of 60 and have started retiring. This marks a turning point in the demographic development of the European Union and makes it all the more important to consider the policy responses that are required by this major change. Population ageing, long discussed as a looming prospect, has now become a reality. This Report is the third in a series of biennial European Demography Reports to which the Commission committed itself in its 2006 Communication 'The Demographic Future of Europe \u2014 From Challenge to Opportunity'. This Communication showed that Europe has reasons to envisage its demographic future with confidence. Population ageing is above all the result of economic, social and medical progress, as well as greater control over the timing of births and the number of children that people have. The same progress affords Europe significant opportunities for responding to the challenges of demographic change, notably in five key areas: \u2013 better support for families; \u2013 promotion of employment; \u2013 raising productivity and economic performance; \u2013 better support for immigration and the integration of migrants; \u2013 sustainable public finances ( 27 ). Major reforms and decisive action are necessary to meet these challenges. The Communication stressed that there is only a small window of opportunity, of about 10 years, during which further employment growth remains possible. Increasing the number of highly productive and high quality jobs is the key to ensuring that Europe's economy and societies will be able to meet the needs of ageing populations. The current economic crisis has not invalidated the EU\u2019s strategy; on the contrary, it has made the speedy implementation of this strategy more urgent. The 2006 Communication announced that every two years the Commission would hold a European Forum on Demography to take stock of the latest demographic developments and to review where the European Union and the Member States stand in responding to demographic change. The first Forum took place on 30-31 October 2006, the second on 24-25 November 2008 and the third on 22-23 November 2010. The purpose of the present Demography Report is to provide the up-to-date facts and figures that are needed for an informed debate with the stakeholders taking part in the Forum and, in particular, with the group of government experts on demography, involved in the conception of this report. As far as possible, data are provided for all EU-27 Member States, allowing policy makers and stakeholders to compare their own country \u2019 s situation with that of others, to understand the specific characteristics of their country and, perhaps, to identify countries that provide interesting examples of practice from which lessons could be learned. In so doing, the report responds to request from Member States wishing to learn from the range of national experience across the European Union.

        "1. INTRODUCTION Table I.1.1: Main demographic trends: main findings Life expectancy continues to rise, especially from gains at older ages. Since there are large discrepancies among and within countries, there is scope for raising average life-spans for the less- advantaged groups. The most recent large wave of immigrants, that has swollen the cohorts of foreigners in mediterranean countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain, has abated in 2008. Fertility is slightly on the rise. Lowest-low fertility, i.e. below 1.3 children per woman, has ended in every Member State and the average is approaching 1.6 as of 2008. The EU population ages at varying speed. Populations that are currently the oldest, such as Germany's and Italy's, will age rapidly for the next twenty years, then stabilise. Some populations that are currently younger, mainly in the East of the EU, will undergo ageing at increasing speed and by 2060 will have the oldest populations in the EU. Fertility indicators confirm the ongoing postponement of births to later ages in life. An adjustment for this \u2018tempo\u2019 effect would raise the 2008 fertility rate in the EU to just over 1.7. This is still well below the replacement rate of 2.1. Not only people are living longer lives; they may be living longer healthy lives. There is evidence that the process of ageing, during which people become progressively disabled until they die, is not becoming slower; rather, it is progressively delayed. However, some data indicate that healthy life expectancy fell from 2007 to 2009, and there is a need for more information on this subject. Immigrants tend to be less-well educated and employed in jobs below their qualifications. 27 As the 500-millionth person was born \u2013 or arrived from abroad as an immigrant \u2013 EU-27 was, and still is, undergoing major demographic changes. These changes are slow, but they are very significant. Indicators observed just before the recession suggest that fertility seems to be increasing again, albeit only slowly. Life expectancy keeps rising. The labour force keeps growing and EU-27 has attracted large numbers of migrants. When ten new countries joined the EU-27 in 2004, most of them had known little economic migration. Then, many of them experienced significant emigration but, recently, some of them have attracted migrants. Life expectancy in these countries had not improved much in the 1990s, and had even regressed in some countries, but in the early 2000's, the figures started to catch up with the 15 pre-2004 Member States. In the meantime, EU-27 has developed some peculiar demographic patterns. (cid:2) Across countries, those where there are more marriages do not necessarily report more births \u2013 on the contrary. (cid:2) A younger average age at childbirth goes with lower fertility rates. (cid:2) Wealth and life expectancy are not strongly linked; some Member States are poorer than others and yet their citizens live longer. (cid:2) There may be signs that as countries become wealthier, fertility increases. Other patterns of change are less surprising in a developed, ageing society. The population of working age has been increasing less and will start shrinking soon. The first decade of the 21 st century has seen large waves of immigrants come from outside the EU. The first post-World War II \u2018 baby boomers \u2019 are entering their 60s, and are retiring. From now on, the older population will keep swelling. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 37 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "2. FERTILITY 28 Fertility is increasing, albeit slightly. Most of the increase is in countries that have experienced extremely low fertility in the recent past, that is, fertility below 1.3 children per woman. At the same time, women are delaying motherhood, giving birth much later in their lives. 2.1. RECOVERY OF FERTILITY In 2009, around 5.4 million children were born in the EU-27, compared to about 7.5 million at the beginning of the 1960s. The highest annual total for the EU-27 was recorded in 1964, with 7.7 million live births. Over the past 30 years, the total number of live births has been growing again, albeit moderately, after reaching a low in 2002 (less than 5 million live births, see Graph I.2.1). Graph I.2.1: Number of live births in EU-27, 1980-2009 01234567 1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008 M i l l i o n Source: Eurostat (online data code: demo_gind), The slowdown in population growth in the EU-27 is due partly to lower fertility. The main indicator of fertility is the Total Fertility Rate (TFR): this is the mean number of children that would be born alive to a woman during her lifetime if she were to pass through her childbearing years conforming to the age-specific fertility rates of a given year. A total fertility rate of around 2.1 children per woman is considered to be the replacement level, that is, the average number of children per woman required to keep the population size constant in the absence of inward or outward migration. A TFR below 1.3 children per woman is describe d as \u2018lowest -low fertility\u2019. TFR is used as an indicator for the fertility level and is comparable across countries, since it takes into account changes in the size and structure of the population. Table I.2.1 shows the TFR in the EU-27 and in all Member States for selected years. The total fertility rate declined steeply between 1980 and 2000-2003 in many Member States, falling far below replacement level. In 2000, values had fallen below 1.3 in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Spain, Italy, Slovenia and Slovakia. After reaching a minimum between 2000 and 2003, in the six years to 2009, the TFR had risen in most Member States, and in 2009, all EU-27 countries were displaying rates above 1.3.

        "Part I Main Demographic Trends 29 Cyprus and Italy); in 2009 it was down to 0.8, with Ireland and Latvia representing the two extremes. Among the countries for which 1980 data are available, in eight Member States (Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom), the 2009 TFR is equal to or higher than that in 1980. On the other hand, the TFR fell by more than 40 % between 1980 and 2009 in Romania and Portugal. In absolute terms, the decline in the total fertility rate was steepest in Ireland, from 3.21 to 2.07. Groups of countries with similar trends in TFR can be identified in Table I.2.1. A steady increase in TFR is found in Denmark, the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Finland. A small group composed of Cyprus, Malta and Portugal displays a steadily- declining TFR since 1980. In other Member States, the trend is more often in the form of a U-shaped curve, with the TFR bottoming out around 2000 or 2003, and recovering by 2009. By contrast, Germany, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta and Portugal had lower fertility in 2009 than in 2000. The (slight) increase in fertility between 2000 and 2009 may be partly due to a catching-up process, following postponement of the decision to have children. When women give birth later in life, the total fertility rate first decreases, then recovers. While in 2003, EU-27 TFR was 1.47 children per woman, by 2009 it had risen to 1.60. The lowest value in 2009 was in Latvia (1.31 children per woman), while rates in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, France, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom were above 1.8. 2.2. WOMEN STILL POSTPONING BIRTHS Over the past 30 years, the timing of births has also changed significantly: the mean age of women at childbirth has been postponed ( 28 ). The highest ages at childbirth in 2009, as shown in Table I.2.2, were in Ireland (31.2 years) and Italy (31.1 years), whereas the lowest were in Bulgaria (26.6 years) and Romania (26.9 years). The difference between the highest and the lowest mean age at childbirth was 4.6 years. In 2009, women in the following 13 Member States tended to have their children when they were aged 30 or over: Denmark, Germany, ( 28 ) A more appropriate indicator to measure birth postponement would be the mean age of women at first childbirth; however, this indicator cannot be produced for all Member States due to lack of data. Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Finland and Sweden. Table I.2.2 shows that in the past 30 years, mean age at childbirth rose by as much as six years in Luxembourg. The difference is striking between Member States that joined the EU after 2004 and the others: in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Malta, Romania and Slovakia, the mean age rose relatively little (and in some cases even fell) between 1980 and 1990, whereas the rise was more marked in the other Member States. However, since 1990, a catching-up is also taking place in Member States that joined the EU after 2004. In fact, since 1990, while mean age at childbirth has been rising most rapidly in countries that joined the EU after 2004, the trend appears to be gradually slowing down in the other Member States.

Graph I.2.2 shows that many of the countries with the highest total fertility rate also display a high mean age for women at childbirth. Based on the point representing the EU-27, four different groups of Member States can be identified. One group is composed of Denmark, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden, where both the TFR and the mean age at childbirth are above the EU-27 average. In the diagonally opposite quadrant lie most of the countries that joined the EU after 2004, plus Austria and Portugal. In these Member States, both the TFR and the mean age of mothers at childbirth are below the EU-27 values. The third group of Member States shows mothers with a higher age at childbirth and lower TFR as compared to the EU-27 average: this is the case in Germany, Greece, Spain, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Slovenia. The fourth and last group is composed of Belgium, Estonia and the United Kingdom, countries for which the TFR is higher than the EU-27 value, but where the mean age of mothers is lower. However, the age at childbirth is still above 29 in these countries. At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, women in the EU-27 appear to be having fewer children while they are young, and more later. While the fertility rates of women aged under 30 have declined since the 1980s, those of women aged 30 and over have risen, which would seem to confirm that the long-term decline in fertility rates within the EU-27 is associated with the postponement of childbirth. Graph I.2.3 compares fertility rates of mothers aged 30 and over between 2000 and 2009. The proportion has increased in all the EU-27 countries.

REVISITING FERTILITY TRENDS The postponement of births introduces a bias in total fertility rates, since fertility rates are computed in a given year using information across different cohorts of women. Postponement results in the TFR being underestimated. Because it is possible to estimate the postponement effect, the TFR can be adjusted.

The adjustment seems to be smaller (fewer than 0.15 children per woman) in countries such as Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden, indicating that, in these countries, the postponement process seems to be coming to an end. By contrast, the adjustment is most marked in the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Slovakia, where it is over 0.4 children per woman. These findings suggest that, at least in these countries, the unadjusted TFR indicator may significantly underestimate actual fertility. ( 29 ) The adjusted TFR is calculated by the Vienna Institute of Demography (VID), for more information please refer to http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/datasheet/index.html. Postponement does not bias fertility estimates for ever. Eventually, even unadjusted TFR increases, as more births are recorded for women at higher ages. In fact, the difference between the 2008 and 2006 TFR is generally in the same direction and is often proportional to the difference between the tempo-adjusted and unadjusted TFR, thus lending support to the tempo estimate. An estimate of just over 1.7 children per woman in the EU-27, as suggested by the tempo adjustment, does not, however, result in a sustainable rate. A large inflow of immigrants would still be required to prevent the size of the population from shrinking in the long run. This adjusted estimate is much higher than the current 1.6, at which the population would shrink naturally at a much faster rate. If, in addition, socio-economic development plays a positive role in increasing fertility (see Box I.7.1), observed fertility might rise to a level above the 1.7 children tempo estimate. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely that the increase will reach the replacement level of 2.1, or that the ageing of the population in Europe will be reversed. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 42 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "3. MORTALITY 33 Over the past 50 years, life expectancy at birth has increased by about 10 years for both men and women in the EU-27. Further gains will be achieved mostly from the reduction in mortality at older ages. While life expectancy is rising in all Members States, there are still major differences between and within countries. In some cases, improvements in education and standards of living have contributed to longer life expectancy, suggesting that it could be extended further in future. 3.1. MORTALITY TRENDS OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS Since 1980, the annual number of deaths in the EU-27 has remained fairly stable at around 4.9 million. A peak was reached in 1993, with about 5 million deaths. Graph I.3.1: Number of deaths in EU-27, 1980-2009 01234567 1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008 M i l l i o n Source: Eurostat (online data code: demo_gind) The total number of deaths depends on the size of the cohorts reaching the end of their life cycle and on mortality rates. A simple but very powerful way of illustrating the trend in mortality is to consider life expectancy at birth. Economic development and the improvement of environmental conditions and health systems across Europe have resulted in a continuous rise in life expectancy at birth. This process has been going on for longer in Europe than in most other countries of the world, making the EU-27 a world leader for life expectancy. The gradual reduction in mortality is the most important factor contributing to the ageing of the population in the EU-27, in conjunction with the reduction in fertility. 3.2. RECENT GAINS IN LIFE EXPECTANCY In the 16 years between 1993 and 2009 (see Table I.3.1), the rise in life expectancy at birth for men in the EU-27 Member States has ranged from a minimum of 2.5 years (in Bulgaria) to a maximum of 7.5 years (in Estonia); for women, the rise has ranged from 2.3 years (in Bulgaria) to 6.2 years (in Estonia).

In 2009, the differences were 11.9 years for men and 7.7 years for women. Thus, while life expectancy has been rising in all countries, it has gone up slightly more in some of the countries where it was lower. There has been some catching up. 3.2.1. Life expectancy by gender In all EU-27 Member States, women live longer than men, but the difference varies substantially between countries (see Graph I.3.2). In 2009, the gender gap in life expectancy at birth varied from four years in the United Kingdom and Sweden to over 11 years in Lithuania. In the Baltic States, women can expect to live more than 10 years longer than men; the difference is under five years in six Member States (Denmark, Greece, Malta, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom). During the 16-year period, the gender gap decreased, with the exception of Romania, where the difference between the sexes increased by 0.1 years. The reduction in the gender gap was largest in Luxembourg (7.4 years in 1993 and 5.2 years in 2009) and the Netherlands (6.1 years in 1993 and 4.2 years in 2009). As people live longer, interest has shifted to the older generations; Table I.3.2 shows life expectancy at age 65 by sex.

        "Demography Report, 2010 36 3.2.2. Gains in life expectancy at older ages Improvements in life expectancy at birth are achieved by lowering mortality throughout the life cycle. Therefore, when analysing changes in life expectancy at birth over time, it is useful to estimate the contribution of specific age groups to changes in life expectancy. Tables I.3.4 and I.3.5 report the percentage breakdown of changes in life expectancy, known as the \u2018Arriaga decomposition\u2019, for men and women between 1993 and 2009 by age groups, for each of the 27 Member States and the EU-27 aggregate. Gains in life expectancy by age group (Arriaga decomposition) In Tables I.3.4 and I.3.5, the last column is the absolute difference between life expectancy at birth in 2009 and life expectancy at birth in 1993 (according to available data). The columns to its left represent the percentage contribution from mortality decreases in the corresponding age group to the total increase in life expectancy: positive values indicate that mortality has decreased in that age group, thus contributing to longer life expectancy. For example, taking the row for EU-27, life expectancy for men at birth increased in total by 1.9 years: 4.8 % of this increase is due to lower infant mortality (deaths before the first birthday), 2.0 % is due to lower mortality at ages 1-9, and similarly for older age groups. Since the decomposition is based on 2 years of data, results should be interpreted with caution in countries recording a small number of deaths. In most countries, the decline in mortality was particularly marked for men in their sixties and seventies and for women aged over 60 years old. In more detail, for men, more than 50 % of the rise in life expectancy at birth is found to occur between the ages of 60 and 79 in Denmark (51.1 %), Ireland (63.0 %), Cyprus (56.0 %), the Table I.3.4: Distribution of gains in life expectancy by age group, men, 1993 and 2009 at birth 0 1 - 9 10 - 19 20 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 49 50 - 59 60 - 69 70 - 79 \u2265 80 Total EU-27 4.8 2.0 2.7 4.9 5.1 11.7 6.7 18.9 25.5 17.7 100% 1.9 BE 8.8 1.7 2.7 5.3 4.4 7.8 6.6 20.4 28.0 14.3 100% 4.1 BG 18.3 7.9 3.8 7.1 13.9 17.3 8.6 3.0 12.5 7.6 100% 2.5 CZ 10.0 2.6 2.6 4.2 5.6 11.2 16.8 20.4 20.2 6.3 100% 4.9 DK 5.2 2.2 2.7 2.8 8.0 9.0 10.0 25.9 25.2 9.0 100% 4.3 DE 4.1 1.6 2.9 4.9 7.0 8.9 11.6 23.0 23.0 13.1 100% 5.0 EE 11.4 4.0 5.9 9.3 12.3 18.3 15.3 13.8 6.1 3.5 100% 7.5 IE 4.5 1.7 1.1 0.5 -1.6 2.9 14.9 30.4 32.6 13.0 100% 4.8 EL 14.8 1.5 1.5 1.3 2.4 3.9 4.5 25.9 23.8 20.4 100% 2.9 ES 6.4 2.2 3.0 11.0 12.8 7.8 8.7 16.3 19.5 12.4 100% 4.6 FR 6.1 2.0 3.2 8.1 10.5 9.4 8.7 19.6 18.8 13.6 100% 4.5 IT 6.5 2.4 2.9 5.6 7.1 5.9 12.9 24.7 22.3 9.7 100% 4.6 CY 8.6 4.6 7.1 -0.5 0.9 7.8 11.1 25.7 30.3 4.2 100% 3.9 LV 6.5 5.1 1.8 12.3 16.2 21.0 18.3 10.1 4.7 4.0 100% 3.5 LT 16.7 5.0 3.3 11.5 13.8 23.5 14.9 3.8 6.5 0.9 100% 4.4 LU 6.9 2.5 4.2 9.9 7.6 7.3 9.3 21.4 24.4 6.4 100% 5.9 HU 10.3 2.3 1.7 5.8 17.5 21.3 13.9 13.5 9.2 4.5 100% 5.6 MT 22.9 4.0 5.8 1.3 1.5 8.1 12.8 21.2 15.2 7.2 100% 3.1 NL 5.0 1.6 2.6 2.8 4.1 6.1 11.7 25.3 27.6 13.0 100% 4.7 AT 5.4 1.5 3.8 6.4 6.0 8.6 11.8 21.6 22.6 12.2 100% 4.8 PL 19.0 2.7 2.0 3.8 7.1 11.1 13.7 18.1 15.6 7.0 100% 4.4 PT 8.2 4.9 5.8 11.2 8.7 4.1 9.3 18.9 18.8 10.1 100% 5.5 RO 25.6 10.9 2.6 5.7 12.2 12.4 8.4 7.4 8.8 5.9 100% 3.9 SI 6.8 0.9 2.9 7.1 8.8 10.9 17.3 21.9 15.7 7.8 100% 6.5 SK 10.7 1.3 2.4 4.1 8.0 16.3 18.5 19.9 14.0 4.8 100% 3.6 FI 4.0 2.4 1.2 3.0 4.7 8.4 12.0 22.5 28.7 13.1 100% 4.5 SE 5.6 0.9 1.4 0.9 4.9 7.6 12.3 23.3 28.3 14.7 100% 3.9 Increase (in years) in life expectancy Age EU-27: 2002-2008; IT, UK: 2008 instead of 2009; LV: 2002 instead of 1993; MT: 1995 instead of 1993.

The ages 80 and above contribute more than 25 % to the rise in life expectancy at birth for women in Belgium, Ireland, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and Sweden. On the other the other hand, in some of the other countries, lower infant mortality (defined as deaths of children under one year of age) had a greater impact on life expectancy at birth between the two years analysed; above 20 % for men in Malta (22.9 %) and Romania (25.6 %), and for women in Romania (21.6 %). A few countries showed smaller but still substantial (>10 %) gains from lower infant mortality for men or for women: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Cyprus, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. In several Member States, particularly for men, the gains in life expectancy at birth from lower infant mortality are much more significant in percentage terms than the gains due to the older ages (80 or above). This is the case in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Malta, Poland and Romania and, to a lesser extent, in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary and Slovakia. 3.2.3.

Life expectancy among highly educated men and women Another important factor contributing to the disparity in life expectancy is \u2018socio -economic status\u2019. The inverse relationship between stat us and mortality is well known, based on a number of studies ( 31 ): the higher the status, the lower the mortality rates and, consequently, the higher life expectancy. There are significant inequalities in the EU-27 Member States regarding socio- economic status, with negative consequences for health, social cohesion and economic development. In all countries, mortality, health and the age at which people die are strongly influenced by socio-economic factors such as education, employment and income. ( 31 ) For an overview, see for example Mackenbach J.P., Meerding W.J., Kunst A., 2007, Economic implications of socio-economic inequalities in health in the European Union, study supported by the European Commission, DG SANCO, available at http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_determinants/socio_economic s/documents/socioeco_inequalities_en.pdf.

        "Part I Main Demographic Trends 39 Box I.3.1: Living longer healthy lives In comparison with earlier generations, people today spend longer in education, start working later, start having children later and spend fewer years of their life in family building; they die at a later age; life expectancy has increased by about 2 years per decade (1) . People's lives are being stretched out over an ever longer period. The same analysis could be applied to frailty: the period in a person's life when s/he starts to develop a disabling condition that makes them dependent and vulnerable, leading eventually to death. Life expectancy has increased not because frailty lasts longer, but rather because it starts at a later age; as a result, healthy life expectancy has been increasing at about the same rate as life expectancy ( 2 ). Health problems that used to be characteristic at the age of 70 are now characteristic of the age of 80, and conditions that prevailed at age 80 now prevail at age 90. The number of years spent in self- perceived good health has been increasing in most of the countries studied. The findings about frailty need to be examined further. Poor health is more difficult to measure than death and is often reported unreliably. The evidence about the severity of disabilities in old age is mixed, especially for individuals over the age 85: whereas some severe disabilities appear to be declining, some less severe forms of disability and certain illnesses seem to be increasing, although this may be due to earlier diagnosis and greater life expectancy. Some detailed data are available from the Danish Health Interview Survey (3) (Table 1). They show not only that healthy life expectancy has been increasing, but also that the proportion of the remaining life expectancy in good health increased between 1994 and 2005; healthy life expectancy has thus been growing faster than overall life expectancy.

Frailty is being delayed due to advances in public health (treatment and prevention) and living conditions. In principle, prosperity makes better treatment possible; more productive and prosperous populations also expect to be healthier. However, two countries at the same level of per capita income may have different healthy life expectancies, and some countries with modest standards of living perform as well as wealthier ones; as examples in the EU, Spain and Italy, as well as France and Sweden, have the highest life expectancy. Overall, most people in wealthier countries, and increasingly in developing countries, can look forward to relatively long, and mostly healthy, lives. This prospect enables people to make fuller use of their lives, for example by re-allocating their time during their lives and planning their education, employment and retirement over the life span. Greater life expectancy does not necessarily entail the collapse of the social system under the growing mass of frail elderly people. Many older people are in good health and can play an active part in the labour force according to their condition and abilities, contributing to the economy and allowing younger people to extend their education. In J.W. Vaupel's words: 'While the 20th century was the century of redistribution of wealth, the 21st century may be the century of the redistribution of work to older age groups'. .

        "Demography Report, 2010 40 Overall levels of mortality have been declining across socio-economic groups. But differences in life expectancy between higher and lower socio- economic status groups have on the whole remained unchanged. In some cases, the gap has even widened. For the first time, Eurostat has published estimates, based on provisional data, of life expectancy in 2007-2008 by sex, age and educational attainment level for a selected number of EU-27 Member States ( 32 ). These results confirm the inverse relationship between educational attainment as a proxy for \u2018socio - economic status\u2019 and mortality ( 33 ). As reported in Table I.3.7, in most of the countries examined, for both men and women, life expectancy increases with educational attainment. The more education people have, the longer they are expected to live. Life expectancy for women at a given educational attainment level is always higher than that for men at the same level. However, differences between the sexes decline as educational attainment increases. Based on the data in Table I.3.7 , life expectancy \u2018gaps\u2019 or mortality differentials between educational attainment groups can be assessed. They are generally larger among men than among women; in many cases they are twice as large. Also, as can be observed in Graph I.3.5, these gaps are larger among young men. Gaps in life expectancy between men with medium and low educational attainment at any age in Table I.3.7 are also much bigger than between men with high and medium levels. For women at any age, life expectancy gaps between those with high and medium educational attainment and between those with medium and low levels are less pronounced. While life expectancy for women is consistently higher than for men, the differences are smaller ( 32 ) For details see http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_ details/publication?p_product_code=KS-SF-10-024. ( 33 ) Low educational attainment corresponds to pre-primary, primary and lower secondary education (ISCED levels 0, 1, 2); medium corresponds to upper secondary and post secondary non-tertiary education (ISCED levels 3 and 4); high corresponds to tertiary education (ISCED levels 5 and 6). The selection of countries is dependent on data availability: to calculate the required indicator, detailed data are needed broken down by sex, age and educational attainment for both mortality and population stocks. Although all countries can provide mortality data by sex and age, only a few can provide data also by socio- economic characteristics such as educational attainment. between educational attainment groups for women than for men.

Among the other countries examined, differences are less pronounced. The published data highlight another important \u2018mortality advantage\u2019 that women have over men: the life expectancy of men with higher education is lower than the life expectancy of women with the lowest level of educational attainment. In other words, on average, all women live longer than well-educated men. As can be observed in Table I.3.7, this was true in 2008 at all ages for Italy, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Finland and Sweden. For the other countries under study, this was true in about 50 % of cases, mostly at ages 50, 60 and 70. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 50 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "Part I Main Demographic Trends 41 Consequently, by improving the life expectancy of disadvantaged groups, a general increase in overall life expectancy is also to be expected ( 34 ). ( 34 ) The European Commission has raised the issue of health inequalities in the Member States as well as the question of disparities in life expectancy, especially for disadvantaged people. A proposal to address the problem was outlined in the October 2009 European Commission Communication COM/2009/0567 \u2018Solidarity in health: reducing health inequalities in the EU\u2019, a vailable at http://ec.europa.eu/health/social_determinants/policy/com mission_communication/index_en.htm .

        "4. MIGRATION: TRENDS 42 Migration is the main driver of population growth in the most of the EU-27 Member States. Migratory movements are making the EU\u2019s population more diverse and creating new challenges and opportunities for European societies. 4.1. MIGRATION FLOWS The first decade of the 21st century has seen large waves of migration both within the EU and from outside it. The highest inflow in that decade appears to have peaked in 2007. 4.1.1. Migration as one of the key drivers of population growth in EU Member States Migration plays a significant role in the population dynamics of European societies. In recent years, the increase in the population of the EU-27 Member States has mainly been due to high net migration rates ( 35 ). The share of international migration in total population growth in the EU has varied. From 2004 to 2008, the population of EU Member States increased, on average, by 1.7 million per year, solely because inflows outweighed outflows. Although immigration to the EU-27 Member States fell in 2008 and emigration increased, net migration still contributed 71 % of the total population increase. In many EU-27 Member States, immigration is not only increasing the total population, but also bringing in a much younger population. The age structure of the EU-27 Member States' total population at 1 January 2009 and of immigrants to EU Member States in 2008 is illustrated by the age pyramid in Graph I.4.1. ( 35 ) The expression \u2018total net migration\u2019 of the EU Member States is to be distinguished from the expression \u2018total net migration to/from the EU as a whole\u2019: the former also includes international migration between the EU Member States.

        "Part I Main Demographic Trends 43 4.1.2. EU citizens are becoming more mobile Immigrants to EU Member States are of a wide variety of origins, especially since the enlargements of 2004 and 2007. Larger numbers of EU-27 citizens have been included in migration flows. The number of EU-27 citizens migrating to a Member State other than their own country of citizenship increased on average by 12% per year during the period 2002-2008, and peaked in 2007 (see Graph I.4.3). In 2008, 36% of migrants to EU-27 Member States were citizens of another Member State, 2 points lower than was observed in 2007 (38%).

In 2008, non-EU citizens accounted for 49% of all immigrants to EU-27 Member States (see Graph I.4.4). When nationals moving to their country of citizenship are excluded, 57% of immigrants are found to be citizens of countries outside the EU.

Origins of immigrants It is estimated that more than half (55%) of immigrants to the EU in 2008 were previously residing outside the EU, while 44% of immigrants had previously also been residing in an EU-27 Member State (other than the country of immigration). Immigrants to the EU can be further differentiated according to the level of development of the country of previous residence. The Human Development Index (HDI) was used to reflect this structure ( 38 ). According to this indicator, half of all immigrants to the EU previously resided in medium developed countries, slightly fewer in highly developed countries (44%) and only 6% arrived from less developed countries (Graph I.4.6). This distribution is almost in line with the distribution of the total population in those countries, according to the level of development of the countries in question. On the basis of the latest ( 38 ) This index is calculated by the United Nations (UN) under the UN Development Programme. It is a composite index incorporating statistical measures of life expectancy, literacy, educational attainment and GDP per capita. The Eurostat list of countries by the level of development, based on UN\u2019s 2006 clas sification, was used in order to reflect this structure. In this index countries are classified as highly, medium and less developed. Since the countries are evolving, each year they are classified, based on the new values for the statistical indicators included in the index (for details see the UN site at: http://hdr.undp.org/).

Romanians were the most mobile, followed by Poles and Germans (note that these migrants were not necessarily previously residing in their country of citizenship). If returning nationals (see category \u2018EU citizen s (excluding nationals)\u2019 in Table I.4.1) are excluded from the analysis, Romanians still ranked first, followed by Poles and Bulgarians. The EU-27 Member States received 384, 000 Romanian citizens, 266, 000 Polish citizens, Poland and 91, 000 Bulgarian citizens. The remaining 1.8 million immigrants to EU-27 Member States were non-EU citizens. Among them, Moroccans were the biggest group, the only one exceeding 100,000, followed by citizens of China, India, Albania and the Ukraine. Most Moroccans migrating in 2008 went to Spain (almost 94,000) or to Italy (37,000). In the same year, Spain also received the largest share of all Chinese immigrants (28 % or 27,000 in absolute terms). The United Kingdom was the main destination for citizens of India.

        "Part I Main Demographic Trends 45 Box I.4.1: Where immigrants come from Eurostat data on residence permits that were valid at the end of 2009 can be broken down to show the geographical origins of non-EU nationals( 1 ) by continent (Table 1). The total of 16.7 million residence permit holders \u2013 excluding Denmark, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom \u2013 is spread unevenly among the continents of origin. The numbers are roughly proportional to the population of the continents of origin, although Europe is over-represented whereas Asia and North America are under- represented. Each of the five largest EU-27 Member States attracts the majority of the people from a particular continent: most Africans hold permits in France (1.6 million), most Asians in Italy (1.1 million), most Europeans in Germany (2.6 million), and most South Americans in Spain (1.5 million). ( 1 ) EU nationals still needing residence permits under transitional measures are not included in the table below; for the transitional measures see http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&catId= 466 More permits were issued in 2009 in the United Kingdom to immigrants from North America and/or Oceania, than the total number of valid permits at the end of 2009 in any other country. The largest number of authorisations to reside in an EU-27 Member State in 2009 was issued to the citizens of India (190,000), followed by United States (176,000), China (170,000) and Morocco (156,000). These four countries accounted for nearly 30% of all permits issued in EU-27 in 2009. The largest proportion of Indians and Chinese entered the EU for the purpose of education or employment. Respectively 72,000 Chinese and 61,000 Indians were issued with education related permits, whereas 51,000 Chinese and 63,000 Indians entered the EU for employment reasons. By contrast, Moroccans were granted the highest number of permits issued for family reasons in EU (62,000), and only less than 5 per cent (7,000) were granted permission to reside for education reasons. The country ranking based on new permits is similar to the one from other official sources, although there are some differences.

        "Demography Report, 2010 46 4.1.4. Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom reported the highest immigration in EU-27 in 2008 The EU as a whole is attractive for immigrants, but Member States differ as to scale and patterns of migration. The majority of EU-27 Member States in 2008 reported more immigration than emigration, but in Germany, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and the three Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) emigrants outnumbered immigrants. In absolute terms, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom were the EU Member States with the highest immigration. They received more than half (53%) of all immigrants in 2008, but at the same time, they also experienced high emigration. Relative to the size of the resident population, Luxembourg (with 36.3 immigrants per 1,000 inhabitants) had the highest immigration in EU-27 in 2008, followed by Malta with 21.9 and Cyprus with 17.8 (Graph I.4.8). Luxembourg, the country with the highest immigration per capita and one of the smallest countries in EU-27 in terms of population size, also reported the highest rate of emigration in 2008, with 20.6 emigrants per 1,000 inhabitants. 4.1.5. More men than women migrate In 2008, there were more men than women in migration flows to and from EU-27 Member States in general. Around 48% of immigrants were women. By contrast, Cyprus, Italy, Spain, France and Ireland reported that women outnumbered men among immigrants. In Cyprus, this was mainly due to women with Filipino, Sri Lankan and Vietnamese citizenship, whereas in Italy and Spain women outnumbered men in the biggest group of immigrants (with Romanian citizenship in the case of Italy, and Moroccan citizenship in Spain). In addition, among immigrants to Italy, women outnumbered men among citizens of Ukraine, Moldavia, Poland and Russia, while in Spain, the same applied for citizens of Pakistan and Senegal. 4.1.6. Impact on the age structure of the EU population In 2008, immigrants to the EU-27 Member States were, on average, younger than the population of their country of destination. Whereas the median age of the total population of all EU-27 Member States (calculated from five-year age groups) was 40.6 on 1 January 2009, the median age of immigrants in 2008 was 28.4.

MIGRATION: FOREIGN POPULATION 48 The diversity of citizenship can be observed not only in the annual migration flows, but also in the non-national population stock of each EU-27 Member State. 5.1. NON-NATIONALS IN THE EU A total of 31.9 million persons with citizenship of a country different from their country of residence were living on the territory of the EU-27 Member States on 1 January 2009, representing 6.4% of the total EU-27 population. Of these non-nationals, more than a third (11.9 million persons) were citizens of another Member State. 5.1.1. Main countries of residence In absolute terms, the largest numbers of foreign citizens reside in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, France and Italy. Non-nationals in these five countries represent more than 75% of the total EU foreign population (Graph I.5.1).

In 2009, a high proportion of non-nationals (10% or more of the resident population) was also observed in Latvia, Estonia, Cyprus, Spain and Austria, while the countries with the lowest share of non-nationals (less than 1%) were Poland, Romania and Bulgaria. Luxembourg, Ireland, Belgium ( 39 ), Cyprus, Slovakia and Hungary were the only countries where the majority of non-nationals were EU citizens.

Source: Eurostat (online data code: migr_pop1ctz) In the case of Latvia and Estonia, the proportion of non-EU citizens is particularly large due to the high number of \u2018recognised non -citizen s\u2019 . They are mainly citizens of the former Soviet Union, permanently resident in these countries, but who have not acquired Latvian, Estonian or any other citizenship. This phenomenon is also reflected in the median age of the foreign population of these two countries (see Table I.5.7). ( 39 ) Based on latest available data. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 58 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "Part I Main Demographic Trends 49 5.1.2. Main groups of non-nationals The citizenship structure of foreign populations in the EU-27 Member States varies considerably, and is influenced by factors such as labour migration, historical links between countries of origin and destination, and access to established networks in the destination countries. Citizens of Turkey, Romania, Morocco and Poland are the most numerous among the EU\u2019s non - national population (Graph I.5.3). With 2.4 million people, Turks accounted for 7.5 % of all non- nationals living in the EU in 2009. The second biggest group is composed of Romanian citizens living in another EU Member State (6.2 % of the EU total foreign population), followed by Moroccans.

Between 2001 and 2008, the number of non-nationals living in EU Member States increased by 10.2 million.

Third-country nationals generally have much greater incentive to apply for citizenship of an EU Member State than do persons who are already EU citizens and, therefore, already benefit from rights comparable to those of nationals in the host country. In 2008 696,000 persons acquired citizenship of an EU Member State, compared with 707,000 recorded in 2007 (see Table I.5.2). This was the second decrease in consecutive years since 2001. In 2008, the largest number of citizenships were granted by France (137,300), the United Kingdom (129,300) and Germany (94,500); these three countries together accounted for over half of all citizenships granted by EU Member States. Since 2002, these three countries have always granted the largest number of citizenships, but their contribution to the overall EU total decreased from an average of 60 % over the period 2002-2007 to slightly more than 50 % in 2008.

The lowest rates were found in the Czech Republic (3.0), Luxembourg (5.6) and Ireland (6.3). The EU-27 average was 22.6 citizenships granted per 1,000 resident non-nationals (see Graph I.5.4). In 2008, only in two countries were the majority of new citizenships granted to citizens of another EU Member State: Hungary (71.9%) and Luxembourg (56.2%). In Hungary, citizenship was granted mostly to Romanians; in Luxembourg, to former citizens of Portugal, Italy, Belgium and Germany. The largest groups to acquire citizenship of an EU Member State were former citizens of Morocco (63,800), Turkey (49,500), Ecuador (27,300), Algeria (23,000) and Iraq (20,400) (Graph I.5.5).

FOREIGN-BORN POPULATION Persons who have acquired the citizenship of their country of residence are no longer counted as non- nationals. Nevertheless, the foreign background of these people can be captured by the country of birth variable, which records the country in which the birth took place, or the country of residence of the mother at the time of the birth. In some cases, people who were born on the territory of a Member State\u2019s former colony, and who later migrated to that Member State, are recorded as foreign-born, although they have held the citizenship of the reporting country since birth. In other cases, the recorded country of birth no longer exists under the same name or borders, as, for example, the former Yugoslavia, or the former Soviet Union, and those people would be included in the foreign-born population even though they may never have migrated to another country.

        "Demography Report, 2010 52 More than 13 % of the population in Luxembourg, Estonia, Latvia, Austria, Ireland, Sweden and Spain are foreign-born (Table I.5.3). In all of these countries (with the exception of Sweden), more than 10 % of the population are also non-nationals. The specific situation in Sweden can be explained by the fact that it is the Member State with the highest rate of acquisition of citizenship per inhabitant in the EU. In general, the number of foreign-born residents in each Member State exceeds the number of non- nationals (Graph I.5.6). The differences are most significant in Sweden, the Netherlands and Slovenia, where the number of people born abroad is more than double the number of people with foreign citizenship living in these countries. In Luxembourg, the number of foreign-born persons is lower than the number of foreigners. This can be explained by the significantly high share of foreigners from other EU-27 countries (who are less likely to acquire citizenship of their country of residence). There is thus a high number of foreign-born persons who keep their original citizenship and whose descendents are usually native-born foreign citizens. Similarly, in Ireland, most non-native-born people are from EU-27 Member States. In all other countries, the non-EU- born constitute a larger group than the EU-born population.

        "Demography Report, 2010 54 5.4. EDUCATION LEVELS OF THE FOREIGN- BORN The population born outside the host country, being in the prime working ages of 25-54, tends to have lower educational attainment than the native- born population ( 40 ). In the EU as a whole, foreign- born people tend to be marginally under- represented at the high educational level (1 point difference) and over-represented to a much greater extent at the low educational level (12-point difference). ( 40 ) The level of education is aggregated into three levels: low (below the second cycle of secondary education \u2013 up to ISCED level 3c short); medium (second cycle of secondary education \u2013 ISCED levels 3-4 other than 3c short); high (tertiary education \u2013 ISCED levels 5-6). The proportions of the foreign born population with tertiary and low education differ significantly across individual EU Member States. EU Member States do not seem to attract large numbers of tertiary-educated immigrants, even though the proportions who are highly educated foreign-born reach more than 40 % in some Member States (Ireland, Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Estonia and Poland). Several countries tend to attract immigrants with a lower level of education, particularly in the southern EU Members States (Greece, Portugal, Malta, Italy and Spain) and France, where 40 % or more of immigrants have a low level of education (see Table I.5.5). In addition, the data indicate that the proportion of women with tertiary education \u2014 regardless of groups of country of birth \u2014 tends to be slightly higher than for men (see Graph I.5.7).

Source: Eurostat, EU Labour Force Survey There are several explanations for this situation. For instance, migrants can experience problems in having their educational attainment and formal qualifications recognised and accepted. Even if their qualifications are properly recognised, their skills may not match the requirements of the labour market in the host country, or they may have to accept unskilled jobs while they are acquiring necessary skills, for example, by becoming fluent in the host countr y\u2019s language, to enable them to exploit their full potential. The countries where a particularly large proportion of the highly-educated foreign-born population are employed in jobs that only require a lower level of qualification are in southern Europe: Greece (66 %), Spain (55 %), Cyprus (54 %) and Italy (50 %).

        "Part I Main Demographic Trends 57 (see Graph I.5.9). In the EU as a whole, 31 % of tertiary-educated immigrant men were overqualified for their job, compared to 37 % of tertiary-educated immigrant women. By contrast, there is no difference between over-qualification rates of male and female native-born (19 % each). These data reflect the particular difficulties that highly-educated immigrant women may face in integrating into the labour market in host countries. Comparing the data on foreign-born persons to that for non-nationals, a rather similar picture can be observed, but the over-qualification rates for non- nationals are generally slightly higher than those for foreign-born persons. The situation is similar at the European level as a whole, and in the majority of individual Member States. In 2009, 37 % of non-nationals in employment with tertiary-level education were overqualified for their job. Analysing the situation for individual countries, the shares of highly-educated non-nationals performing jobs requiring lower qualifications were highest in the southern countries (Greece, Italy, Cyprus, and Spain). Only in Luxembourg was the proportion of overqualified tertiary- educated non-nationals under 10 % (see Graph I.5.10). 5.5. NON-NATIONALS YOUNGER ON AVERAGE THAN NATIONALS Analysis of the age structure of nationals and non- nationals separately shows that at EU-27 level, the foreign population is younger than the national population, particularly in the lower working-age group. This applies to both men and women and is illustrated by the Graph below.

Apart from Latvia, Estonia and Poland, non-nationals tend to be younger than the national populations in the EU Member States. The lowest median age for this group, around 32, was observed in Denmark and Italy. Similarly, third-country nationals tend to be younger than EU non-nationals in all Member States, with the exception of Bulgaria, Latvia and Estonia. Latvian and Estonian non-EU foreigners have the highest absolute median ages, 52.7 and 49.8 years respectively, in contrast to their relatively young nationals. On the other hand, non- EU citizens in Malta, Spain and the Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland and Denmark) have the very lowest median ages in the EU-27, between 30.6 and 31.2.

        "6. POPULATION CHANGE AND STRUCTURE 59 The population of the EU-27 is growing, while the age structure of the population is becoming older. A turning point occurred in the early 1990s, when net migration became the main driver of population growth and has since far outpaced natural change in the population. The impact of demographic ageing within the EU is likely to be of major significance in the coming decades. Consistently low fertility levels and higher life expectancy will transform the shape of the EU- 27\u2019s age py ramid. The most important change is likely to be the marked transition towards a much older population. This trend is already becoming apparent in several Member States. The share of older persons in the total population will increase significantly in the coming decades, as a greater proportion of the post-war baby-boom generation reaches retirement. This will, in turn, lead to an increased burden on those of working age to provide for social expenditure required by the ageing population. 6.1. POPULATION GROWTH The current demographic situation in the EU-27 is characterised by continuing growth. Although the population of the EU-27 as a whole increased in 2009, the population in eight EU-27 Member States was already declining. 6.1.1. Over half a billion inhabitants in the EU and still growing On 1 January 2010, the population of the EU-27 was estimated to be 501.1 million, 1.4 million people more than in the previous year. Population growth Population growth is the positive population change. Population change in a given year is the difference between the population size on 1 January of the given year and on 1 January of the following year. It consists of two components: natural change (the difference between live births and deaths) and net migration (the difference between the number of immigrants and the number of emigrants). In the context of the \u2018population change\u2019 statistics, Eurostat produces net migration figures by taking the difference between total population change and the natural change; this concept is referred to in this chapter as \u2018net migration plus statistical adjustment\u2019. A positive natural change is also called natural increase. The trend in EU-27 population growth has been unbroken since 1960. However, the rate of population growth has been gradually slowing down in recent decades. In the period 1990-2009, the population of the EU-27 increased on average by about 3.2 per 1000 inhabitants per year, compared to annual average of around 8 per 1000 inhabitants per year in the 1960s (Graph I.6.1). Graph I.6.1: Population on 1 January, EU-27, 1960-2010 350 400 450 500 550 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 Million Source: Eurostat (online data code: demo_pjan) 6.1.2. Net migration as the main driver of population growth in the EU-27 The population of the EU-27 grew by 1.4 million in 2009, due to natural increase (the positive difference between live births and deaths) of 0.5 million and net migration ( 41 ) of 0.9 million. Compared to 2008, both components of population growth, natural change and net migration, decreased in 2009. In terms of crude rates, the population growth of 4.1 per 1000 inhabitants was due to a natural increase of 1.2 and net migration of 2.9 in 2008. In 2009, natural increase accounted for 1.0 and net migration for 1.8 in the total population growth of 2.8 per 1000 inhabitants. Net migration continued to be the main determinant of population growth, by contributing 63 % to the total population increase in the EU-27. The contribution of net migration to total population growth has become more significant than that of natural increase since 1992 (see Graph I.6.2) and has peaked in 2003 (95 %). Since then, the contribution of natural increase to population growth has risen slowly. ( 41 ) Including statistical adjustments. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 69 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "Demography Report, 2010 60 The relatively low contribution of the natural increase to total population growth is the result of two factors: first, net migration in the EU-27 has increased considerably since the mid-1980s; secondly, the number of births has fallen, while the number of deaths has increased. The gap between live births and deaths (see Graph I.6.3) has considerably narrowed since 1960. Since the number of deaths is expected to increase as the baby-boom generation begins to age, and assuming that fertility remains at a relatively low level, a negative natural change (more deaths than births) cannot be excluded in future. If this happens, the extent of population decline or growth will depend on the contribution of migration to total change.

Population growth within EU-27 Member States Although the population of the EU-27 as a whole still grew in 2009, the growth was unevenly distributed across the Member States (see Table I.6.2). In 2009 the population increased in 19 EU Member States. Conversely, the population declined in the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), in the south- eastern countries (Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania), and in Germany and Malta.

        "Part I Main Demographic Trends 61 Analysing the two components of population change at a national level, eight types of change can be distinguished, separating growth from decline, and the relative weights of natural change and net migration (Tables I.6.1 for the typology and Table I.6.2 for the data). Out of the 19 countries where the population grew in 2009, both natural increase and net migration contributed to population growth in 14 cases. Population growth was mostly due to migration, with the exception of Spain, France, the Netherlands, Slovakia and the United Kingdom, where a natural increase was still the main demographic driver of population growth. In Ireland and Poland, a natural increase compensated for negative net migration. In three other countries, Italy, Austria and Portugal, positive net migration compensated for negative natural change. Eight EU Member States reported a negative total population change in 2009. In most cases, this was mainly due to negative natural change, with an additional effect from negative net migration (Bulgaria, Germany, Latvia and Romania). In Lithuania, the negative total change was mainly due to negative net migration. In Malta, the natural increase was offset by negative net migration, while in Hungary and Estonia, positive net migration could not compensate for the negative natural change. The population of seven Member States continued to decrease, as in 2008; that of Malta decreased in 2009, after increasing in 2008.

EU-27 and FR exclude France's overseas departments. Source: Eurostat (online data code: demo_pjanind) The median age of the EU-27 population was 40.9 years. This means that half the EU-27 population today is aged 40.9 years or over. The median age of the population in the Member States ranged from 34.3 years in Ireland to 44.2 years in Germany (see Table I.6.5). The dependency ratios ( 42 ) are used as indicators of the potential level of support needed by young people (aged 0-19) and/or older people (aged 65 or over) from the population of working age. The ratios are expressed in terms of the relative size of the young and/or older population to the population of working age. ( 42 ) In this section, the age dependency ratios are expressed in terms of the relative size of the young (0-19 years) or/and of the old (65 or over) population to the working age population (20-64), instead of the common definition, which considers the 0-14 years as young population and the 15-64 years as working age population. This adjustment is made on grounds that, in the EU- 27\u2019s Member States, most people aged 15-19 are still in education, and few of them are in paid work. In 2010, the old-age dependency ratio of the EU- 27 was 28.4 %. This means that the EU-27 had around 3.5 persons of working age for every person aged 65 years or over.

Source: Eurostat (online data code demo_pjan) 6.2.1. Past and current trends of population ageing in EU-27 Population ageing is a long-term trend which began several decades ago in the EU-27. This ageing is visible in changes in the age structure of the EU population and is reflected by the growing proportion of older persons, while the proportion of those of working age in the total population declines. Between 1990 and 2010, the working-age population (20-64 years) in the EU-27 increased by 1.8 percentage points, while the older population (aged 65 or over) increased by 3.7 percentage points (see Graph I.6.5). These increases came at the expense of a decrease of 5.4 % in the proportion of younger people (0-19 years). The low levels of fertility that were sustained for decades (see chapter I.2 on Fertility) have contributed to the process of population ageing, with fewer births leading to a decline in the proportion of young people in the total population. This process is known as \u2018ageing from the bottom\u2019 of the population pyramid, and can be observed in the reduction of the base of population pyramids between 1990 and 2010 (Graph I.6.4). Since the proportion of older people increased between 1990 and 2010, the top of the 2010 age pyramid is wider (Graph I.6.4). The growth in the proportion of older people can be explained by gains in longevity and is known as \u2018ageing from the top\u2019 of the population pyramid. A significant increase in life expectancy at birth was recorded in all EU-27 Member States for the past decades (see chapter I.3 on Mortality).

Future trends in population ageing Population ageing is a generalised process across EU Member States, and it is expected to continue in future decades. Population projections Eurostat produces population projections for each EU Member State every three years. These projections are what-if scenarios that aim to provide information about the likely future size and age structure of the population based on assumptions of future trends in fertility, life expectancy and migration; this publication is based on the main results of the EUROPOP2008, convergence scenario. According to Eurostat 2008-based population projections, the EU- 27\u2019s population will be slightly larger by 2060, while the age structure of the population will be much older than it is now. The likely change in age structure is of more concern than the change in population size. The median age is projected to rise to 47.9 years by 2060. The population of working age is expected to decline steadily. Older people would account for an increasing proportion of the population according to the same projections. The share of the population aged 65 or over is projected to increase from 17.4 % in 2010 to 30.0 % in 2060 (see Graph I.6.8). Even Also significant is the progressive ageing of the older population itself. The proportion of those aged 80 or over (\u2018oldest - old\u2019) is growing faster than any other segment of the population, and is projected to almost treble by 2060. The old age dependency ratio (population aged 65 or over in relation to that aged 20-64) is projected to more than double from 28.4 % in 2010 to 58.5 % in 2060. The total age dependency ratio (calculated as the ratio of children and young people aged under 19 and older people aged 65 or over to the population aged 20-64) is expected to rise from 63.2 % in 2010 to 95.5 % in 2060. The implication is that there will be almost one person of working age for every dependent person aged under 19 or over 65 years in the EU-27. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 75 1/07/11 08:08 ",

The baby boom bulge will move up the population pyramid, leaving the middle (population of working age, 20-64), and the base (ages 0-19), considerably narrower in 2060. 6.2.3. The speed of population ageing The previous section showed that EU- 27\u2019s population is expected to age considerably by 2060, thereby raising a number of questions. Will ageing be faster over the coming years or at the end of the projection period? How will ageing play out in different countries? Statisticians generally measure the speed at which the population ages by observing the proportion of older people in the population and the age dependency ratio. Both indicators were found to increase for the EU-27 in the projection period (2008-2060). Graph I.6.10 illustrates this, measured as the increase in the proportion of the population aged 65 or over, for the EU-27 and three Member States. The leftmost segment of each bar indicates the proportion of the population aged 65 or over in 2010, ranging from 12.3 % in Slovakia to 20.7 % in Germany. Moving to the right, the subsequent segments indicate the likely increase in the proportion of the population aged 65 or over in subsequent decades; the longer each segment is, the faster the increase in its decade. At EU-27 level (top bar), the proportion of the population aged 65 or over is projected to increase rapidly until 2040, to reach the high-20 % range; it then grows more slowly and barely reaches 30 % over the next two decades.

Most of this increase is projected to occur between 2020 and 2040. While population projections show that ageing will affect all Member States, individual countries will experience the process at different rates and at different times; in other words, there will be variations in the pattern of ageing. Most Member States that will experience a slow pattern of ageing start with a moderately old to older population, as illustrated by the Swedish case. In 2010, its proportion of the population aged KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 76 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "Part I Main Demographic Trends 67 65 or over was the fourth highest (18.1%) in the EU-27. By 2060, due to a slower pattern of ageing, it is projected to have the eighth lowest proportion of population aged 65 or over (26.6%) and well below the EU-27 average (30.0%). Similar, albeit slightly faster development, is projected for Belgium, Denmark, France, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Portugal, Finland and the United Kingdom. The Netherlands, while also belonging to this group, display an atypical pattern; their proportion of the population aged 65 or over was low in 2010 (15.3%), is set to increase rapidly until 2040 and then to stabilise at a level which is about the same as the others in its country group (27.3%). Another group of Member States have in common populations that were already relatively old in 2010, and projected to age at a moderate rate. An example is Germany, where the proportion of the population aged 65 or over in 2010 was 20.7%, the highest in the EU- 27. Germany\u2019s ageing is set to proceed at a sustained pace until 2040 and then to almost halt in the 2040s and the 2050s. Other countries, namely Austria, Greece, Spain, Italy and Slovenia, are projected to follow similar patterns. Ireland shows a similar moderate-ageing pattern, albeit starting from a younger population and with sustained ageing until 2050. These two groups of countries will experience very moderate ageing from 2040. The highest rates of population ageing, especially from 2040 onward, are expected in a third group, which includes several central and east European Member States, according to population projections. These are illustrated by Slovakia. Here the percentage of the population aged 65 or over (12.3%) was the second lowest in the EU-27 in 2010, above only Ireland (11.3%), but is projected to rise to 36.1% in 2060, thereby becoming the second highest rate, just below Poland (36.2 %). In Slovakia, ageing is likely to continue at a fast pace even in the 2040s and 2050s. Similar ageing, although at a slightly less rapid pace, is expected in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta, Poland and Romania. In all of these Member States, the proportion of the population aged 65 or over is currently comparatively low, and is projected to increase slowly until 2020. However, it is then set to grow rapidly throughout the remainder of the projections period. Furthermore, the graph indicates that while the spread across Member States is narrow in 2010 at about 2 percentage points, in 2060 there will be much larger differences between Member States, due to differences in the speed of ageing.

        "7. FAMILIES 68 \u2018Family\u2019 is a shifting concept. What it means to be a member of a family and the expectations people have of family relationships vary with time and across countries, making it difficult to find a universally-agreed and applied definition. Legal alternatives to historically conventional marriage, such as registered partnerships, have become more widespread, and national legislation has evolved to confer more rights to unmarried couples. Alongside these new legal forms, other forms of non-marital relationships have appeared, making it more difficult for statisticians to collect data that can be compared across countries. In their attempt to capture and track changing family forms and composition, demographers most often refer to the family nucleus and to private household units. Due to differences in the timing and formal recognition of changing patterns of family formation and dissolution, these concepts have become more difficult to operationalise. Analysts of demographic statistics therefore have access to relatively few complete and reliable datasets with which to make comparisons over time and between and within countries. It can be observed, however, that the number of marriages is decreasing and the number of divorces is increasing, although these trends may be due in part to the ageing of the population. In addition, more and more children are born to un- married women, and the countries with the highest extramarital birth rates are often also those with the highest fertility rates. 7.1. FEWER MARRIAGES, MORE DIVORCES Marriage as recognised by the law in each country has long been considered to signal family formation. This section examines the trends in family formation and dissolution though marriage and divorce. In 2007, 2.4 million marriages and 1.2 million divorces took place in the EU-27. The crude marriage rate, i.e. the number of marriages per 1 000 inhabitants, was 4.9, and the crude divorce rate was 2.1 per 1 000 inhabitants. Since 1970, the crude marriage rate in the EU-27 has declined by 38 % (from 7.9 per 1 000 inhabitants in 1970 to 4.9 in 2007). At the same time, marriages have become less stable, as indicated by the rise in the crude divorce rate, from 0.9 per 1000 inhabitants in 1970 to 2.1 in 2007. Part of this rise is due to the fact that divorce was legalised in several countries during the period.

A RISE IN BIRTHS OUTSIDE MARRIAGE The proportion of live births outside marriage in EU-27 continues to increase, signalling new patterns of family formation alongside the more traditional pattern where children were born within marriage. Extramarital births occur in non-marital relationships or cohabiting couples as well as to lone parents. Extra-marital births have been increasing in almost every country in EU-27, and in some Member States, mostly in northern Europe, the majority of live births are now outside marriage (Table I.7.3). Mediterranean countries like Greece, Cyprus, Italy and Malta, along with Lithuania, Poland, and Romania are at the other low end of the scale with a large proportion, over 70 %, of births occurring within marriage.

FERTILITY AND THE FAMILY Analysis of the relationship between patterns of fertility and age at childbirth (Graph I.2.2) shows that, in 2009, fertility was higher in several countries where women have children at a later age. Box I.7.1 below argues that, in the EU \u2013 and generally among developed countries \u2013 fertility rises with wealth. Graphs I.7.1 and I.7.2 below indicate that fertility was also higher in several countries where more children are born outside marriage and where there are higher employment rates for women. However, among all determinant of the different fertility levels in the 27 EU Member States studied here, the most important is child-care provision (Graph I.7.3).

        "Demography Report, 2010 70 Births outside marriage and fertility Countries with higher proportions of births outside marriage are often observed to have higher fertility rates. In Estonia, Sweden, France, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Belgium, high rates of live births outside marriage (above 45 % of live births) are associated with total fertility rates ( 43 ) above the EU-27 average of 1.60 children per woman in 2008 (Graph I.7.1).

Source: Eurostat (online data code: demo_find) Women's employment rates and fertility Arguably one of the most important trends of the past 50 years affecting family life has been the marked increase in female employment rates. Since the 1960s, more women have become economically active and have entered paid employment outside the home, particularly in the public sector, rather than working on the land or in a family enterprise as in the past. Women's employment rates have, thereby, moved closer to those of men. Graph I.7.2 shows that the Member States with higher rates of employment for women also tend to have higher fertility; though this relationship is not very strong.

        "Part I Main Demographic Trends 71 Box I.7.1: Does wealth increase fertility in developed countries? In the past century, fertility rates have decreased as national wealth has increased. Women in developing countries still have large numbers of children, whereas the wealthier half of the world population has below-replacement fertility. With on-going development, is the trend towards lower fertility irreversible? A recent study (1) challenges the traditional view by demonstrating that, in many countries at advanced stages of development, fertility levels are now increasing rather than decreasing. The traditional relationship between wealth and fertility seems to be reversed. Graph 1: Human Development Index (HDI) and Total Fertility Rate (TFR) by country in the world, 2005 0123456789 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Human Development Index (HDI) T o t a l F e r t i l i t y R a t e ( T F R ) Source: United Nations To reach these conclusions, the researchers analysed the relationship between the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) and Human Development Index (HDI). The HDI combines indicators for life expectancy, education, standard of living and GDP, thus taking into account factors other than material wealth alone. The left and central parts of Graph 1, taken from the study, show that TFR is high in societies at lower levels of development (the left-hand side of the J-shaped curve) and declines rapidly as development advances. ( 1 ) Myrskyl\u00e4, Kohler & Billari, Nature 2009 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n72 56/pdf/nature08230.pdf But, at the highest stages of development, the negative fertility trend changes into a positive one; in many countries, high levels of development are observed in conjunction with relatively high fertility rates. In Graph 1, this situation applies in the dense cluster of 15-30 countries at the bottom- right. Graph 2 shows the data from Graph 1 limited to EU-27 Member States. The clustered 9 countries with higher fertility (around or above 1.75 children per woman) are those with higher HDI (around 0.95 or above).

The study suggests that, above a certain level of development, further development may result in higher fertility rates. Further research into these mechanisms is needed because the researchers found notable exceptions. Japan, South Korea and Canada are at advanced stages of development, but without increasing fertility. These exceptions indicate that development alone is not sufficient to reverse the downward fertility trend. On the other hand, the Scandinavian countries have high labour force participation, innovative family policies and among the highest fertility levels in EU-27. Thus, the fertility reversal may be due to better policies to improve gender equality and facilitate a work-family balance. In fact, failure to address gender equality, work-family balance and flexibility in labour markets may well explain why fertility in rich countries in Asia continues to decrease as they grow wealthier.

        "Demography Report, 2010 72 Ensuring suitable childcare provision is an essential step towards equal opportunities in employment between women and men. In 2002, at the Barcelona Summit ( 44 ), the European Council set the targets of providing childcare, by 2010, to at least 33% of children under 3 years of age. Other forms of family support were comprehensively mapped across all 27 Member States in a recent EU-funded project ( 45 ) revealing considerable differences both in public policy as well as in cultural approach as regards informal support within families. Within the EU the traditional stereotype of poorer families having several children seems to have given way to a resumption of pre-industrial revolution patterns whereby better-off families tend to have more children. Nevertheless, at the other end of the income range, there is a persistent association between poverty and number of children. The EU SILC ( 46 ) reported that in 2008 the risk of poverty in the EU grows with the number of dependent children; considering two- adult households, this is 16.3% overall, 11.4% with one dependent child, 14.5% with two dependent children and 25.9% with three or more. Thus the distribution of children is U- shaped, with larger families at both ends of the income spectrum than in the middle. ( 44 ) For the Barcelona (2004) targets see http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEM O/08/592&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLa nguage=en ( 45 ) See www.multilinks-project.eu for details. ( 46 ) Statistics on Income and Living Conditions; the data reported is accessible online via the code ilc_li03; the year 2009 reports on 2008 income in almost all countries. A recent EU-funded project ( 47 ) showed that possible important areas of intervention to alleviate obstacles to the fulfilment of young adults' fertility goals are job security, gender equality and the reconciliation of work and family. However, social norms and cultural settings also play a crucial role and interplay with family policies. 7.4. CHANGING HOUSEHOLD STRUCTURE Household structure is constantly changing. As the population ages, more people live in smaller households, increasingly consisting of a single person. At the same time, many young adults, especially men, delay leaving the parental home to found their own household. 7.4.1. Smaller households Average family and household size has been declining since the 1960s. Despite the slight increase in fertility rates in the early years of the 21st century, the decline in household size continued between 2005 and 2009 in all EU-27 Member States, except Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Romania and the United Kingdom, where it remained stable. For EU-27, average household size fell from 2.5 members to 2.4, with the largest reduction recorded in Lithuania (-0.5) and Slovakia (-0.3). Many reasons have been provided to explain the changes observed in family and household size over the past half century. The ageing of Europe \u2019s population reported in the previous chapter led to a ( 47 ) see www.repro-project.org.

        "Part I Main Demographic Trends 73 decline in the proportion of young people, automatically resulting in fewer new candidates for marriage and family building. At the same time, changing value systems contributed to lower fertility rates and an increase in the number of childless couples. 7.4.2. More diverse family living arrangements The decline in family size associated with lower fertility rates and population ageing has been accompanied by a fall in the proportion of married couples, as non-marital relationships and lone parenting have become more widely accepted. The proportion of single-person households has also increased, as older people have become less likely to live with their children or grandchildren. The majority of households with children in the EU comprises two adults (Graph I.7.4), almost always living in a couple partnership. Between 2005 and 2009, despite the small increase in fertility rates, the percentage of two-adult households with children fell from 29% to 27.5% across Europe. This reduction may also be partly explained by population ageing, as older people are more likely to be living alone. Single-parents households are relatively common in Estonia and the United Kingdom (both above 20%). In the United Kingdom and Ireland, 8% and 6% respectively of young women aged 15-24 are single parents (Graph I.7.5).

Age on leaving the parental home and entering labour market Young adults in Northern and Western European countries leave the parental home earlier than in other EU Member States. In all countries, women tend to leave their parents\u2019 home earlier than men (Graph I.7.6). The main reason is probably that women, on average, marry or move in with a partner at a younger age than men.

Between 2005 and 2009, young adults in their twenties seemed to be leaving the family home a little earlier, whereas young adults over 30 were remaining somewhat longer with their parents. The proportion of young adults (aged 25-29) living with their parent(s) varies from 15% or less in France, the Netherlands and Finland (Table I.7.4) to 55% or more in Bulgaria, Italy, Malta, Slovenia and Slovakia. It exceeds 50% in 16 Member States. Cultural aspects or different lifestyle arrangements, which are difficult to assess, may help to explain differences between countries. A 2001 Eurobarometer survey ( 48 ), suggested that material difficulties are the main obstacle to young people leaving the parental home. These material difficulties reflect changes in the housing and labour markets (for instance, lack of job security), or the conditions under which young people pursue their education. These difficulties are also reflected in the large number of young people living with their parents even if they are employed. In 2008, ( 48 ) Eurobarometer 151, 2001: 67% of young adults aged 15-24 quoted material difficulties as the main reason for not leaving their family home. Such difficulties were the main reason in all countries except Luxembourg and the Netherlands. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 83 1/07/11 08:08 ",

        "1. INTRODUCTION Table II.1.1: Borderless Europeans: main findings A new group of mobile Europeans is emerging: they tend to be younger and better educated than the average in the host country; and they often move between countries for short periods of time. By 2008, 12.7% of EU-27 residents aged 15-74 were foreign-born or had at least one foreign-born parent. By 2060, the proportion is projected to double and reach over 25%. People who are connected to other countries (both traditional migrants and 'new' mobile people) tend to be more proficient in foreign languages and to envisage moving abroad for study or work. The potential for sustained immigration to the EU is strong. Many EU-27 Member States rank at the top of the scale of attractiveness as destinations for migrants from other countries in the world. In the four Member States with the largest cohorts of second-generation migrants and reliable data (BE, FR, NL, AT, UK), integration typically occurs two-to-three generations, when the children of migrants come close to the education levels and approach the labour market levels of local populations; overall in the EU-27, by the third generation, grandchildren of migrants no longer feel that they are part of a minority group. 77 Not only is EU-27 population ageing rapidly; it is also becoming more diverse and more connected across borders. Firstly, the migratory movements of the past century have intensified. The great majority of EU- 27 Member States have become a pole of attraction for migrants. In recent years, non-EU citizens have been joining EU countries at a rate of 1 to 2 million per year and intra-EU mobility has also increased. At the same time, the children and grandchildren of migrants have been integrating into their host countries. Secondly, in recent years, new forms of mobility have been emerging. Young, well-educated Europeans take advantage of opportunities to work, study and live abroad. They usually move for short periods of time but are much more numerous than long-term migrants; they go largely unnoticed by official statistics, which tend to focus on longer term migration. These new migrants bring with them connections to another Member State or to a country outside the EU. These connections may be the result of permanent migration, an extended stay in another country or strong personal ties with people in or from other countries, their culture and their customs. The Eurobarometer 'new' European survey The Eurobarometer (EB) is an opinion survey carried out periodically using a standard questionnaire and an ad-hoc questionnaire on specific topics (EBS, special). Interviewers visit some 25,000 EU nationals \u2013 about 1000 per country \u2013 and put the questions to them face-to-face. Non-EU nationals are excluded from the survey. Partly making up for the small sample and limited coverage, this methodology yields high response and accuracy rates. The EBS 337 ( 49 ) on mobility was carried out in November 2009. Respondents provided information on their cross- border mobility experience, knowledge and attitudes. The EBS 346 ( 50 ) on new Europeans was carried out in March 2010. Respondents provided information about the transnational components in their ancestry, life history, relatives and knowledge/culture. In addition, they were asked about their attachment to their own country, other countries and the EU; the likelihood that they would move abroad in the future; their feeling of belonging to minority or majority groups and the importance of the EU for them. Whereas the response rate was generally high, some respondents could not, or did not, answer all the questions, making it impossible to report on the degree of connectedeness for some 17 % of respondents. These \u2018new\u2019 or \u2018borderless\u2019 ( 51 ) Europeans do not make up a closed, well-defined group; rather, the majority of citizens experience cross-border connections to varying degrees. For most of them, the connections are moderate, involving regular holidays to a favourite location abroad, following ( 49 ) see http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_337_e n.pdf ( 50 ) see http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_346_e n.pdf ( 51 ) The Eurobarometer report focuses on counting EU citizens with varying degrees of connections; this report underlines the connections themselves in degrees of borderless-ness. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 87 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "Demography Report, 2010 78 foreign news and the like. For a smaller proportion of them, being married to a foreigner or having lived or been born abroad, the connections are stronger. Official statistics provide some information on the cross-border connectedness of Europeans. They categorise Europe\u2019s population as nationals and non-nationals (EU and non-EU) or native-born and foreign-born. Some surveys also collect information about citizenship at birth, as in the case of a special module of the Labour Force Survey covering respondents\u2019 parents. This part of the report draws largely on sources such as the Eurobarometer. It tries to go beyond the traditional dichotomies, which tend to divide populations into nationals and foreigners or people with and without a background of migration; such categorisations are certainly relevant, but they should be supplemented with indications of past migration experiences. The Eurobarometer offers some information about the degree to which increased mobility within the EU leads to an \u2018ever closer union\u2019 at a personal level. Increasing cross- border connectedness of Europe\u2019s population has important implications for future migration patterns. It creates a more cohesive and inclusive society. It has the potential to make labour markets more efficient through cross-border matching of supply and demand. It promotes the exchange of knowledge and experience. At the same time, as people become more connected across country boundaries, they also become more prone to short- and long-term migration. This influences population dynamics and, more importantly, it exposes policy makers to the risk of unprecedented responses from the public to their demographic policies. Europeans with connections to other countries are more aware of opportunities elsewhere and more willing to move. They are up to four times more likely to do so than those without any foreign experience or background. For instance, Member States Box II.1.1: Cross-border migration, mobility and marriages There are a small number of long -term migrants in the EU, compared to, for instance, North-America. They are on the increase and, together with their descendants, are increasing the diversity in the EU populations. However, a lot more people are experiencing shorter-term forms of mobility and intermarrying. While these change populations less dramatically and in subtler ways, they help spreading a sense of cross-border connections. Table 1 presents rough estimates of the numbers of people falling into different categories, made non- overlapping. Apart from the 20 million (4%) non- EU citizens living in the EU (Eurostat population statistics), the estimates are based on a Eurobarometer survey, which only includes EU- nationals in its sample. About 10% of EU citizens do not live in the country in which they were born. An additional 5% have at least one parent or grandparent who was born abroad. A fourth major group are EU citizens who have worked or studied abroad or live or have lived with a foreign partner. Not counting here are those with foreign ancestry, up to their grandparents, they make up a further 11% of EU nationals. Table 1: Counting Borderless Europeans (% and millions) % millions 1.

In addition to them, many more people, not belonging to any of the above groups, are connected to other countries in other ways. They speak foreign languages, including non European languages, have friends or relatives abroad or from abroad, follow foreign news, eat foreign foods. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 88 1/07/11 08:08 ",

        "2. MIGRANTS ACROSS GENERATIONS 80 This chapter presents a time-line of migration within and into the EU. It draws mostly on official sources for the most part and focuses on traditional, long-term migration as opposed to the new forms of mobility introduced in the next chapter. Migratory flows over past decades have had a significant impact on the current population size in most Member States, although the picture is very diverse. Some Member States have lost people. Others have gained as a result of migration. For some member States, the impact of past migrations is far larger than is revealed by statistics on foreign nationals. Generally speaking, long-term migrants and their descendants integrate fairly well as regards education outcomes, and less well as regards labour market outcomes, into their host countries within the second generation. In so doing, they tend to retain some of their traditions, for instance the language of their ancestors. Europe continues to attract migrants and the share of migrants and their descendants is projected to increase in the future. 2.1. HOW MIGRANTS SHAPE THE STRUCTURE OF EU-27 POPULATIONS The migration flows of the past decades have left their mark on population size and structure in many Member States. In this section, some simulations are presented that compare the population in 2007 with what it would have been if no migration had taken place since 1960. These simulations take account of the fact that immigrants settle down and have partners, children and grandchildren in the host country. Fertility and mortality rates are used to calculate a theoretical population that would have been observed in 2007 had there been no migration. It is possible, through a comparison with the actual population, to visualise the long-term impact of migration on both total population numbers and age structure. Where applicable, a comparison with the number of non-nationals allows visualising the 'hidden' impact of migration, that is the impact beyond the proportion of non-nationals from official statistics.

        "Part II Borderless Europeans 81 Graphs II.2.1-5 illustrate the impact of migration across the age range of five selected countries, representing five different types of effects that migrants have had on the populations of EU Member States. France (Graph II.2.1) has been receiving migrants for a long time, and their impact is particularly visible in the younger age groups which, in the absence of immigration would be about 25% smaller. In 2007, the actual population was about 60.5 million; had there been no migration, it would have been only 50.5 million. Of the 10 million difference caused by migration since 1960, 3.5 million is made up by the non-nationals in 2007; the outstanding 6.5 million are a wider demographic impact taking into account the immigrants' children and grandchildren ( 53 ). Moreover, the difference is larger at the younger age groups. The vast majority of these additional young people are French nationals, whereas in the older age groups immigrants are much less likely to have acquired French citizenship.

Source: D. Philipov and J. Schuster; Eurostat; see note (51) Spain (Graph II.2.2) presents a very different picture, due to the fact that it has only recently experienced large-scale immigration. As a result, the population increase resulting from immigration is concentrated in the working-age population. Most of the additional population resulting from migration since 1971 (some 5.6 million) is made up of foreign nationals, although there are also a ( 53 ) This does not represent an estimate of the number of children and grand-children of immigrants since 1960. few additional people at very young ages, representing the children of recent immigrants.

As a result, the working-age population is significantly larger than it would have been in the absence of migration. In the youngest age groups, however, past emigration has left a small deficit. The 2008 recession has dampened the effect of immigration to Ireland, as many foreigners have left the country.

The data from the 2008 ad-hoc module of the EU Labour Force Survey ( 55 ) allows estimating the education levels and labour market outcome by place of birth of the respondent and their parents. The data from the Eurobarometer 346, limited to EU-27 citizens, allows estimating the feeling of belonging to a minority group and the knowledge of foreign languages by place of birth of the respondents and of their parents and grandparents. The tables below mainly compare current foreign- born with current children of foreign-born migrants, both of prime working age (25-49 or 25- 54). This is a comparison between two different cohorts; the children of the current working-age foreign-born residents may behave differently when they will be of working age. 2.2.1. Second-generation migrants This sub-section focuses on the traditional, broad definition of second-generation migrants, as anyone who was native-born, but who has at least one parent born in another country, including another EU Member State. However, a special ( 55 ) In 2008 the Labour Force Survey included an ad-hoc module which also covered the place of birth of the respondents' parents. Data are available for most Member States although they are relevant and reliable for only a few. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 92 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "Part II Borderless Europeans 83 case is made for people whose parents where born in another EU-27 Member State. The analysis covers labour market outcomes. The percentage of people aged 25-54 is only significantly high in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and the United Kingdom ( 56 ). In other countries labour market outcome statistics, especially for unemployment, generally lack the necessary reliability. Globally, employment rates of second-generation migrants converge towards those with native-born parents. However, this convergence is hampered by persisting high unemployment. Unemployment Unemployment rates ( 57 ) of the foreign-born are always higher than those of the native-born with native-born parents. This applies to both sexes. Table II.2.2: Unemployment rates of women aged 25-54 by place of birth, own and of parents, 2008 total in EU-27 BE 14.1 12.8 10.2 4.5 CZ 10.6 10.9 11.6 5.1 ES 15.1 21.5 22.1 10.8 FR 12.8 8.9 : 6.6 IT 11.3 (7.3) : 7.5 LU 5.5 (5.4) (5.6) (3.0) NL 6.0 (2.8) : 2.1 UK 5.5 4.6 3.6 3.2 Born abroad Native-born with parents born abroad native Parents are considered as born abroad when at least one parent is. See also footnotes 55 and 56. Source: Eurostat, EU Labour Force Survey ad hoc module 2008 (online data code: lfso_08cobsp) Among both women and men, unemployment is high even at the second generation, although in France and the United Kingdom it is substantially lower (Table II.2.2 and II.2.3). Among women in Spain, it is higher at the second generation. ( 56 ) Most of the second-generation migrants in Estonia, Latvia and Slovenia are the result of exceptional historical events. The data from Germany, Finland and Sweden are not reliable due to the high non-response rate. In addition, Germany does not collect information on country of birth in the Labour Force Survey. In the 2008 LFS ad-hoc module, citizenship rather than country of birth was surveyed for the respondents' parents. Therefore, these countries are excluded from the analysis. ( 57 ) The Unemployment Rate is the ratio between those seeking employment and the total labour force. The Employment Rate is the ratio between the employed and the total populations. As such, the two rates are not complementary (they do not add up to 100). Unemployment for the native-born with foreign- born parents is still far higher than for those with native-born parents.

        "Demography Report, 2010 84 Among other countries with many second- generation immigrants, a fast convergence is registered in France, Austria and the United Kingdom. In Belgium, on the other hand, employment rates remain low for the second generation. In Italy, second generation migrant women have higher employment rate than native- born with native-born parents.

Source: Eurostat, EU Labour Force Survey ad hoc module 2008 (online data code: lfso_08cobsp) The patterns observed for women also apply to men, although foreign-born men have higher employment rates and a smaller gap compared to native-born than women. Here employment rates rise fast in the second generation in The Netherlands and the United Kingdom (Table II.2.5). In Belgium, there is hardly any improvement, except for the children of those born from other EU-27 Member States. In Italy, first and second generation migrants have higher employment rate than native-born with native-born parents. 2.2.2. Second-generation migrants from non- EU countries This sub-section focuses on \u2018 non-EU- born\u2019, i.e., the residents who were born outside EU-27 as well as to EU-born with parents born outside the EU- 27. The focus on the non-EU-born was chosen because their integration is perceived as being relatively difficult. In addition, the analysis focuses on education in addition to employment. This is because immigrants from non-EU-27 countries tend to have low education rates, and more specifically high rates of low education (ISCED 0- 2). The age group used in the comparisons for the detailed country analysis is restricted to 25-49. In analysing the education attainment, this narrow age group limits the influence of trends in education; in analysing the employment rates, it serves to remove the influence of late-joining and early-exiting from the labour market. The percentage of people aged 25-49 born in EU- 27 with one or both parents born outside EU-27 is significant in only a few countries, primarily Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Austria and the United Kingdom; these countries are the focus of analysis below (Graph II.2.6). It must be underlined that the population born outside the EU is very diverse. The differences between countries are in part due to the different composition of the foreigners' origins. Globally, education rates of the non-EU-born appear to converge fast after one generation; the convergence is slower for employment rates. Education For reasons explained above, the analysis below focuses on the share of the population with low educational attainment (ISCED 0-2). The education of those with non-EU-born parents is much higher than that of non-EU-born people with the exception of Spain, Italy and Portugal, where there are relatively few people with non- EU-born parents (Tables II.2.6 and II.2.7). The gap between the non-EU-born and the EU- born with both EU-born parents is almost 15 percentage points for the women and over 12 for the men. The EU-born with one non-EU-born parent tend to have an even lower share of low education, that is, even better education, than those with both parents born in the EU; this is the case in all reported Member States for the men and all except Belgium, the Czech Republic and France for the women.

On the other hand, for the men the (smaller) gap actually increases at the second generation when both parents are born outside the EU; it must be considered that male migration is often employment-driven.

Source: Eurostat, EU Labour Force Survey ad hoc module 2008 2.2.3. Do people of foreign descent feel that they belong to a minority? Many migrants feel that they are part of a minority group or that they are perceived by others as belonging to a minority. In the Eurobarometer survey, 32.2 % of foreign-born and only 7.4 % of native-born residents felt that they belonged to a minority group. Similar differences applied to those who felt they were perceived by others as belonging to a minority. Over the generations, do people of foreign descent feel progressively more integrated? Although the concept of integration is difficult to define, the Eurobarometer responses provide some indication of the extent to which integration is perceived to be taking place. Feelings of belonging to a minority group vary significantly depending on where people and their parents and grandparents were born (Table II.2.10). The summary table presents findings for groups of people who are first-, second- or third- generation migrants. The largest proportion of respondents who feel they belong to a minority (34.3 %) is found among those who were born abroad, as were their parents and grandparents. The lowest proportion (6.6 %) is for those who were born in the country of residence as were their parents and grandparents. The cases in between show an almost linear relationship between ancestry and the feeling of belonging to a minority. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 96 1/07/11 08:08 ",

Respondents were also asked if they felt that others perceived them as belonging to a minority group. The percentages follow a similar pattern to that shown in Table II.2.10. 2.2.4. Foreign descent and languages The same pattern applies to language proficiency. According to the Eurobarometer 346, among the foreign-born population in the EU, 75 % speak a foreign language, compared to 45 % of those born in the country of residence. Of those with one foreign-born parent (but not foreign born themselves), 65 % speak another language. Among those with foreign-born grandparents (but not themselves or their parents) about 60 % speak another language, which is well above the average for those who were not born abroad. Positive aspects of having foreign roots, such as speaking other languages, tend to last longer over the generations than do feelings of belonging to a minority group. The findings concerning education levels, employment rates, feeling of belonging to a minority group and speaking foreign languages point to a progressive integration of migrants by the third generation. At the second generation, integration in terms of education levels is more advanced than in terms of employment. Further study may be required to assess the integration of different migrant groups/ethnicities in countries with different policies. In addition, many third- generation migrants in the EU come from countries that now belong to EU-27. In the future, a larger proportion of new Europeans may be descendants of migrants from outside Europe, and their integration patterns could be different from those observed here.

        "Demography Report, 2010 88 2.3. HOW MIGRANTS CAN SHAPE FUTURE EU POPULATIONS Immigration is generally expected to continue to be an important determinant of population trends in the EU, notably as the working-age population starts to shrink from 2014. 2.3.1. Migrants and their descendants in the future On the basis of the migration assumptions used in the latest (2008) population projections by Eurostat ( 58 ) the total population in 2060 would be 91 million people larger than it would have been in the absence of migration. Due to immigration, the population projection indicates that, in 2060, Europe\u2019s population is projected to be slightly larger than today, even though the number of deaths in the EU is expected to exceed the number of births. ( 58 ) see http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics /search_database, online data codes proj_08c. Under these assumptions about future immigration used in the population projections, the number of people of foreign background (either born abroad or the children of foreign-born parents) is projected to increase significantly. According to the ad-hoc module of the EU Labour Force Survey implemented in 2008 (see also Graph II.2.7), 12.7% of the EU residents aged 15-74 were foreign-born or had at least one foreign-born parent. According to a research study ( 59 ), in 2060 this group may more than double and exceed 25% of the population (Graph II.2.7) across all ages. ( 59 ) See G. Lanzieri, \u2018 Fewer, older and multicultural? A projection of the populations of the European Union Member States by foreign/national background \u2019 . Paper for the European Population Conference, Vienna, 1-4 September 2010 http://epc2010.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId =100315 Box II.2.1: Are there many irregular migrants? Official statistics aim to cover all migrants. However, not all Member States are able to report fully on irregular migrants. The Clandestino (1) project has estimated the number of \u2018irregular\u2019 residents and w orkers in several EU Member States, drawing on records from border-enforcement agencies, police, labour inspections, regularisation exercises and NGOs. The project also yielded broad and patchy breakdowns by gender, occupational status and sector, and main geographical areas. The reliability of this information in no way matches that of the wealth of the documentation that official statistics provide mainly on regular foreign residents. In 2008, an estimated 31 million foreigners lived in EU-27 Member States, comprising 11.5 million citizens from other EU Member States and 19.5 million non-EU nationals. ( 1 ) The project was funded by the EU. See http://irregular-migration.hwwi.net/Home.6177.0.html Most irregular residents are non-EU-nationals. The Clandestino project estimated that between 1.9 and 3.8 million people lived \u2018irregularly\u2019 in EU -27, accounting for between 7% and 13% of estimated foreigners ( 2 ). A few may have been included in official statistics. The number of irregular immigrants appears to have been declining in recent years, mainly because many are nationals of countries that have joined the EU. As restrictions to the freedom of movement have been gradually eased, many have found that their situation has been regularised. Also, periodically, governments allow the regularisation of immigrants who have entered the country clandestinely. Hence the number of illegal immigrants fluctuates considerably from one year to the next. ( 2 ) The percentages are computed over the total number of non-nationals from official statistics. The comparison between official data and Clandestino estimates is undermined by partial coverage overlap and the low reliability of Clandestino. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 98 1/07/11 08:08 ",

In several countries, it would largely exceed 25 % of the population, thereby increasing the number of EU residents with foreign ancestry. In addition, among young adults the proportion of first and second generation immigrants is projected be far greater than today. 2.3.2. The potential supply of migrants EU-27 is host to about one fifth of world migrants according to estimates by the Development Research Centre on Migration, Globalisation and Poverty ( 60 ) (Table II.2.2). ( 60 ) At http://www.migrationdrc.org/ . The figures differ from those presented in Part I since they refer to a different year and are based on a different methodology.

Europe is likely to continue to attract migrants. The supply will depend to some extent on economic and political developments in home countries. There are, however, signs that the potential for further migration into the EU will not cease in the near future. In a recent world-wide survey of people's intention to migrate if the opportunity arose, many more people declared that they would migrate to an EU Member State than would emigrate. Gallup collected data on intentions to move permanently out of a country if the opportunity arose. The survey ( 61 ) was carried out between 2007 and 2010 among respondents in most world countries. Graph II.2.8 indicates the net migration that would be observed if all the expressed interest in migrating materialised and people moved to their target countries. The Graph shows the degree of attractiveness of EU Member States and the potential for population increase through migration.

        "Demography Report, 2010 90 The most attractive destinations include many EU Member States. Almost all of them project gains from the interest expressed in migrating. Generally speaking, EU-15 Member States (members before 2004) tend to be prospective migrant destinations, whereas newer Member States tend to be sources of emigrants. Across the world, a small number of countries are at the top of the list of those expecting to gain from immigration, the largest being Canada (+160%) and Australia (+150%). While the United States attracts more migrants than the EU as a whole, some of the larger EU-27 countries are just as attractive as the United States in proportion to their adult populations. The increase in migration recorded at the start of the 21st century, and which may continue, is not the only driver of increased diversity. The number of people of foreign descent \u2013 first or second generation \u2013 is expected to grow on account of the current, large migrant cohort of childbearing age. The proportion of people of foreign descent will depend on continuing migration flows and the degree to which young migrants intermarry with the host population ( 62 ). In turn, migration flows will depend on the political, social and economic situation in other countries, as well as the capacity of EU Member States to integrate migrants. ( 62 ) The higher fertility and mortality rates of migrants are an additional, albeit less important, factor.

        "3. MOVING INTO AND ACROSS THE EU 91 In the early years of the European Economic Community, citizens of Member States migrated across Europe for long periods, in many cases for life. They were often forced out of their countries by poverty and joblessness. They were mostly men, although some migrated with their families. They were generally moving from the south and provided manpower for the industrial sectors in the north. Gradually, as the early intra-European migrants were settling and integrating into the populations they had joined, different groups and types of migrants began to emerge. Firstly, the origins and destinations of the main flows changed. In 2008 nationals of non-EU-27 outnumbered EU nationals by more than 50 % (Graph I.4.4). Within the EU, almost every enlargement has brought a wave of migrants from joining Member States into the other Member States. Earlier sources of migration, mostly Mediterranean countries, including Italy and Spain, are now characterised by large-scale net migration. In relative terms, perhaps the most notable change occurred in Ireland, which became a pole of attraction for migrants, although the 2008 recession reversed the trend in 2009. Secondly, women are now much more likely to migrate than in the past. In some cases, they move simply to join a spouse who has already migrated, under family reunification schemes, but many more women are migrating to take up service sector jobs in the receiving countries. Over the same period, the number and percentage of migrants in the population have also increased. Thirdly, and most importantly, mobility within Europe has become increasingly dominated by people moving for short periods of time. Most of the new mobile population are young and well educated. It is not that they are being forced out of their countries of origin, rather that they are being attracted by opportunities elsewhere. They move independently or on secondment from their companies. Like their predecessors, most of this new mobile population are men. Official statistics are not designed to study short- term mobility since people who move for less than one year are usually excluded. The indicators used in this section come from ad-hoc Eurobarometer surveys ( 63 ). While only 2% ( 64 ) of EU citizens currently live in another Member State, many more have had experiences of living abroad in the past. Some 10% of the Eurobarometer respondents had lived and worked in another Member State (Graph II.3.1). Also, most people experience work abroad as young adults in their twenties and thirties. Despite the fact that older citizens have had more time to accumulate experiences abroad, fewer of them have taken advantage of the opportunity to do so. If more young adults had worked and lived abroad in the past century, larger numbers of older people would be expected to have recorded work experience abroad in recent surveys. The Eurobarometer results below demonstrate that this was not the case. Graph II.3.1: EU nationals who have lived and worked abroad in the past by age group, 2009 (%) 0% 5% 10% 15% 15-24 25-39 40-54 \u2265 55 total Source: Eurobarometer, EBS 337 There are similarly striking and telling differences by educational level. The Eurobarometer survey analysed the data with reference to the age at which respondents left full-time education. ( 63 ) For a description of the Eurobarometer survey, see Chapter II.1 ( 64 ) This percentage is taken from official statistics. Since people who are abroad on short stays are largely excluded, 2% (about 12 million people) is an underestimate of the amount of the movement of citizens to other Member States.

        "Demography Report, 2010 92 Graph II.3.2: EU nationals who have lived and worked abroad in the past by group of age at end of full-time education, EU-27, 2009 (%) 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% \u2264 15 16-19 \u2265 20 Still studying Source: Eurobarometer, EBS 337 Most EU citizens who have had experience of work mobility are well educated. This contrasts with the relatively low level of education of (longer-term) migrants when compared to nationals (see Part I, Chapter 5.4). Similarly, striking differences are found by occupational level: managers and self-employed workers are much more likely to be mobile. Again, given that the profiles are rather different from those of current migrants, it can be concluded that most of the periods of work experience abroad were short. The Eurobarometer survey used in Graphs II.3.1 and II.3.2 yielded similar results when EU citizens were asked about periods of study abroad and the experience of residing abroad without studying or working. Unlike more traditional patterns of migration, these new short-term forms of mobility do not enable people to leave difficult situations in their own countries. Rather, they seem to offer short- term opportunities for professional and personal development abroad. The new mobility is driven more by \u2018 pull \u2019 rather than \u2018 push \u2019 factors. 3.1. ANCESTRY AND LIFE CHOICES A distinction has been made between traditional, long-term migration and the more recent phenomenon of shorter-term mobility. A further distinction is made in this section between \u2018ancestry\u2019 and \u2018life choices\u2019 as factors determining European connectedness. The term \u2018 life choices \u2019 is used, for example, to describe individuals who are living or have lived with a foreign spouse and/or own a property abroad. These are considered as indicators of the propensity for connectedness to other countries that are linked to mobility Ancestry An EU citizen is \u2018Borderless by ancestry\u2019 if s/he - was born abroad, or - has at least one parent who was born abroad, or - has at least one grandparent who was born abroad. The aggregate \u2018Borderless Europeans by ancestry\u2019 used in this section includes anyone who matches one or more of the above criteria and who had at least one grandparent who was born as a non-national of the country where s/he (the grandchild) resides. Life choices An EU citizen is \u2018Borderless by life choice\u2019 if s/he - has worked abroad for at least three consecutive months, or - has studied abroad for at least half a school year, or - lives/has lived with a foreign-born spouse/partner, and/or - owns a property abroad. The aggregate \u2018Borderless Europeans by life choice, no ancestry\u2019 used in this section includes anyone who matches one or more of the above criteria and who does not meet the ancestry requirements (definition above). The purpose of this exclusion is to avoid overlapping categories. 3.1.1. Men are still more mobile Whereas as many women as men have some cross- border ancestry, many more men than women have experience of cross-border life choices (Graph II.3.3). Graph II.3.3: Borderless Europeans by ancestry and life choices/no ancestry by sex, EU-27, 2010 (%) 0 10 20 30 40 Men Women Ancestry Life choices (no ancestry) Source: Eurobarometer EBS 346, 2010 3.1.2. Young adults across borders The findings of the above analysis by age of respondents reporting work experience abroad are further reflected in the analysis by age of ancestry and life choices as factors determining Europeans' degree of connectedness. It takes young EU nationals some time before they feel attached to other countries and at ease with crossing national borders. However, younger adults are found to have more opportunities for cross-border connections, suggesting that overall rates could rise in the future. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 102 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "Part II Borderless Europeans 93 According to the Eurobarometer survey, the largest number of respondents with connections abroad is found among young adults, aged 25-34 (Graph II.3.4). This applies to connections both by ancestry and by life choice abroad. Graph II.3.4: Borderless Europeans by ancestry and life- choices/no ancestry by age group, 2010, (%) 0 10 20 30 40 50 15-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 \u2265 65 Ancestry Life-choices (no ancestry) Source: Eurobarometer EBS 346 3.1.3. The better educated are more connected Education plays an important role in cross-border experience. Better educated people are much more likely to seek experiences abroad. The education factor is strongest for life choices, especially among respondents who are not connected by ancestry (Graph II.3.5). Of those who remained in education until age 20 or above, about one in four made important life choices connecting them to other countries. These scores are well above (double) the rates for those who studied until the age of 16-19 or left education before the age of 16 (one third higher). This finding applies to all high scores for life choices, the effect being stronger for those who have studied abroad. Graph II.3.5: Borderless Europeans by ancestry and life- choices/no ancestry by age at end of full- time education, EU-27, 2010 (%) 0 10 20 30 40 50 \u226415 16-19 \u226520 Still Studying Ancestry Life-choices (no ancestry) Source: Eurobarometer EBS 346 The link between education and cross-border experiences interacts with the age effect since the younger generations also display higher levels of educational attainment. The implication is that, in the future, the proportion of those with connections across borders will increase and extend into older age groups as a result of the ageing of the current young and connected generation, and due to increasing levels of education. 3.1.4. More cross-border connections for managers Among the socio-occupational groups identified in the Eurobarometer survey, European managers seem more likely to have foreign connections than other groups (Graph II.3.6). Whereas they score relatively high on ancestry, they are far more likely to have made life choices abroad than respondents in other occupations. Manual workers and students are also relatively often of foreign ancestry; for manual workers, this may be explained by the characteristics of traditional migrants, their children and grandchildren. Unemployed respondents tend to report a high incidence of foreign ancestry, which may in turn be explained by higher unemployment rates among migrants and their descendants. Students most frequently refer to foreign ancestry, although few of them were born in another country (6 %), which is slightly below the overall proportion of those born in another country (7%). Many are the children of foreign-born parents. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 103 1/07/11 08:08 ",

Source: Eurobarometer, EBS 346 3.2. CONNECTEDNESS AND ATTITUDES Respondents with ancestry or life-choice connections tend to behave and feel differently from other respondents. They are more likely to feel an attachment to other countries and to envisage moving abroad to work, study or to live. They are also more likely to feel that they belong to a minority, although this applies in particular to people of foreign ancestry. 3.2.1. Attachment to specific foreign countries and the EU Respondents with foreign connections are more likely to feel attached to other countries as well as the EU, whether they are connected by ancestry or life choices. Table II.3.1: Attachment to specific foreign countries, EU-27, 2010 (%) Connected by ancestry 74 Connected by life choices 77 Neither 41 Total 51 Source: Eurobarometer EBS 346 Both ancestry and life choices make a difference when it comes to being attached to other countries, suggesting that experience and background have a lasting effect.

Likelihood of moving abroad Many more respondents of foreign ancestry (23 %) expect to move abroad compared to those without any foreign ascendants (6 %). Part of the explanation is that many of the respondents are of foreign ancestry \u2018by choice\u2019 insofar as they migrated to their current host country at an adult age and are, therefore, of foreign ancestry because they chose to move abroad. They are distinguished from those who were born in the host country of foreign ancestors and those who moved there with their families. People who are connected by life choices may be more likely to repeat the move abroad since they have already shown a readiness to cross borders. Overall, respondents of foreign descent and/or having had experiences abroad are almost four times more likely than those not of foreign descent to consider moving abroad. Those connected by life choice (24 %) are as likely as those connected by ancestry (23 %) to move abroad (Table II.3.3).

        "4. FURTHER WAYS OF CONNECTING TO OTHER COUNTRIES 95 Moving abroad, or having a foreign partner/spouse, creates strong links with other countries. There are also other, less direct ways in which people develop connections across borders. Some take up jobs in other countries while continuing to live in their own. In many such cases, they live near a border. Cross-border commuting is relatively common among the closely-linked countries in the centre-north of the EU (France, Germany and, especially, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands). Other people feel attached to the culture of another country. They speak the language, follow its news, and spend holidays there regularly. This type of connectedness is far more widespread than for the links illustrated in previous chapter. 4.1. COMMUTING ACROSS BORDERS There are about one million cross-border workers within the EU, representing 0.4% of the working population. They reside in one EU Member State and work in another. About five times as many people (roughly 1% of EU's resident nationals) declare that they have been cross-border workers at some time during their life ( 65 ). Most commuters live near a border in one country and have a job just across the border; they commute across the border daily or weekly. However, a few are in less common arrangements. These include seasonal workers, tele-workers, or people who divide their work across more than one location. Graph II.4.1 sets out Labour Force Survey data, showing the percentage of workers who reside in each Member State while working in another, as well as the percentage of those who work in each Member State while residing in another. As the Graph presents percentages, the main factor is the geographical size of the country. In smaller countries, people are more likely to live or work closer to a border and to seek opportunities on the other side. ( 65 ) See Eurobarometer EBS 337, November 2009 The comparison of outgoing and incoming flows in each country provides an indication of the economic performance of a country in relation to its neighbours. Luxembourg displays a very high rate of cross-border commuting since a large proportion of its work force (37%) resides abroad, mainly in neighbouring Germany, France and Belgium.

PERSONAL AND CULTURAL CONNECTIONS ACROSS BORDERS The Eurobarometer survey revealed that a substantial minority of respondents have either relatives (27 %) or close friends (40 %) abroad, or close friends of foreign origin in their own country (29 %). The prevalence of this type of cross-border connection is thus much higher than for the other forms of connectedness considered in the previous chapter, namely foreign ancestry and life choices. Foreign ancestry is a major determinant of connectedness through friends and relatives (Table II.4.1). Many of the respondents with foreign ancestry moved from abroad and left friends and relatives behind. In addition, they are more likely to be living in contact with communities that are joined by people from abroad.

        "Part II Borderless Europeans 97 percentage of people with close friends abroad by country is illustrated in Graph II.4.2. The Eurobarometer survey considered a number of cultural links to other countries. One important indicator of cultural ties is fluency in at least one other language (Graph II.4.3). Almost one third of the EU citizens questioned say that they are able to hold a conversation in a language other than that of the country in which they were interviewed. This proportion exceeds three quarters in Luxembourg, Latvia, Malta, Denmark, Lithuania and the Netherlands. It tends to be lower in the larger countries and in countries where English is widely spoken as the mother tongue. The United Kingdom and Ireland, together with Italy, are the countries with the lowest number of respondents fluent in a second language. About 22 % of EU nationals regularly spend their holidays in one particular country abroad (Table II.4.2). The percentages are generally higher in smaller countries. However, the percentage is also above the EU average in Germany and the United Kingdom. Cultural links with other countries are more common than other strong forms of connectedness, through ancestry or life choices, with which they are likely to overlap (Table II.4.2).

        "1. INTRODUCTION 101 This brief section highlights the main findings concerning demography and demographic policy during and after the recent recession. It is not an exhaustive analysis of the impact of the recession on demography or demography policy. It is too early to assess the impact of the recession on fertility, mortality and family formation; this may become more evident next year, so the next report will include more evidence. However, there are already some indications of the impact the recession has had on migration, so the following chapter will look at this. Demography policy overlaps with other domains which are analysed in other publications produced by the European Commission and other EU institutions: (cid:2) For an overview of the impact on social protection: http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/10/st 16/st16905.en10.pdf (cid:2) For a review of the measures taken on family support, see the specific report: http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/emplwe b/families/admintool/userfiles/file/Final%20rev ised.pdf (cid:2) For the impact on employment and joblessness, see the \u2018 Employment in Europe \u2019 report: http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en& catId=113&newsId=948&furtherNews=yes (cid:2) For education and productivity, see the \u2018 2010 Joint Report on Education and Training \u2019: http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/10/st 05/st05394.en10.pdf (cid:2) For the impact on migration policies, see the report from the \u2018 Independent Network of Labour Migration and Integration Experts \u2019: http://www.labourmigration.eu/research/report/ 12-migration-and-the-economic-crisis- implications-for-policy-in-the-european-union (cid:2) For public finances, see the latest issue of the European Economic Forecasts (Autumn 2010): http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/foreca sts/2010_autumn/statistical_en.pdf KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 111 1/07/11 08:08 ",
        "2. MIGRATION IN THE RECESSION 102 Economic and social conditions sooner or later affect demographic trends. The overall impact of the recent recession on demography will not be known for quite some time and will depend to a large extent on the speed, timing and scale of the recovery in global and national economies. However, migration is one of the components of demography that is more responsive to change in economic and social conditions, both in sending and receiving countries. 2.1. HOW THE RECESSION AFFECTED MIGRATION Due to limitations in the availability of comparable migration data for longer time series, data analysis in this chapter will focus on the period 2003-2009 and on selected EU-27 Member States only ( 68 ). 2.1.1. EU Member States that received the largest number of immigrants Analysis of immigration data for the period 2003- 2009 for the countries experiencing the highest flows of immigration in the EU (over half a million immigrants per year) has shown that the recent recession has had varied effects on migratory flows (see Graph III.2.1). Immigration to Italy and Spain started to fall from 2007 to 2008 and continued in 2009. In the United Kingdom, immigration was broadly stable from 2004, and fell slightly in 2009. In Germany, the number of immigrants has been slowly increasing from 2006 and continued to rise in 2009. In Spain, the overall decrease in the flow of immigrants by almost one third (31%) from 2008 to 2009 was mainly due to the reduced inflow of non-EU immigrants (35% down) and fewer immigrants from other EU-27 Member States (25% down). The highest absolute fall in immigrants to Spain was recorded for Moroccan citizens (falling by 32,000 in just one year), followed by citizens of Ecuador (by 20,000) and Romania (by 19,000). Most of the decline in the number of non-EU nationals migrating to Spain (apart from Moroccans) was due to lower inflows ( 68 ) In order to have comparable data for a longer time series, in some cases data by national definitions were used. of citizens from Latin America, with Ecuadorian, Colombian, Peruvian, Brazilian, Argentinean, Paraguayan and Dominican citizenship.

In the United Kingdom, the slight decrease in immigration was mainly due to a fall in the number of migrants from other EU-27 Member States (Graph III.2.2).

Trends in immigration in selected EU-27 Member States (receiving on average 100, 000 to 500, 000 immigrants per year) Several different patterns can also be identified illustrating the effects of the recent recession on EU Member States that receive between 100,000 and 500,000 immigrants per year ( 69 ) (Graph III.2.3). In Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden, immigration stabilised in 2008 and did not increase further in 2009. Austria differs since immigration was already starting to fall after 2004, slightly increased in 2006-2008 but then decreased slightly again from 2008 to 2009.

Source: Eurostat (online data code: migr_imm1ctz) and national data Comparable data for 2008 and 2009 by citizenship for France, Austria and Sweden showed that the number of immigrants with EU citizenship has decreased in all three countries (in France by 11 %, in Austria by 4% and in Sweden by 12%), although Sweden reported a slight overall increase in immigration (Graph III.2.4). ( 69 ) France could not be included in the comparison since 2003 because data are available for 2008 and 2009 only.

At the peak of immigration, it received just over 100,000 immigrants per year. After the peak, Ireland experienced one of the highest relative drops in immigration among EU Member States; a 64% fall in the period 2006-2009 (Graph III.2.3). This was mainly due to a steep fall in immigration of non-nationals and particularly of other EU Member States nationals. In 2007, Ireland received in total 52,000 EU foreigners representing 59% of all immigrants, dropping sharply to only 16,000 in 2009 (Graph III.2.5).

        "Demography Report, 2010 104 2.1.3. The effect on emigration from EU-27 Member States Previous economic recessions have given some evidence that emigration of nationals and foreigners rises if the social and economic conditions in the host country worsen. Data for the EU-27 Member States with the highest emigration since 2003 shows that emigration from Germany had started to rise in 2007 and 2008 and stabilised in 2009. Although immigration to Germany in 2008 and 2009 was one of the highest among EU-27 Members States, emigrants outnumbered immigrants, resulting in negative net migration (Graph III.2.6). The United Kingdom also saw a relatively high increase in emigration in 2007-2008, but it fell in 2009, almost to the same level as that in 2007. Emigration from Italy has been fairly stable, with a small increase after 2007. In Spain, however, emigration has increased since 2006 and continued to rise in 2009.

Source: Eurostat (online data code: migr_emi1ctz) and national data In the period 2006-2009, emigration from Spain increased on average by 33% per year. From 2008 to 2009, emigration from Spain increased mainly due to the rise in emigration of EU nationals, especially Romanians. Although most of the emigration in 2008 and in 2009 was of non- nationals, the emigration of nationals was higher than other individual citizenships, such as Moroccans, Romanians, Bolivians, Ecuadorians and Brazilians. In Italy, emigration fell in 2009 compared to 2008. In the United Kingdom too, emigration decreased and this was due to a decrease in all citizenship groups (i.e. nationals, EU citizens and non-EU citizens \u2014 see Graph III.2.7).

Source: Eurostat (online data code: migr_emi1ctz) and national data To obtain a more complete picture of the effects of the recent economic recession on emigration, a further analysis of emigration was carried out for the countries that have received on average 100,000 to 500,000 immigrants in recent years (the same countries that were included in the analysis in paragraph 2.1.2), although in some cases, emigration did not reach 100,000 per year. The analysis showed that the effects of the economic recession on emigration in these countries varied markedly (Graph III.2.8). In Sweden, emigration has decreased in recent years, whereas in Belgium and Ireland it has increased slightly, and in the Netherlands and Austria, emigration has increased significantly.

In Austria, most of the increase in emigration was due to German and Romanian citizens. However, as in Spain, emigration of nationals was higher than other individual citizenships. 2.1.4. Overall effect of the recent recession on selected EU-27 Member States The overall effect of the recession on migration flows is not straightforward: not all countries have been affected to the same extent. In absolute terms, Spain seems to have been most severely affected by the recession, resulting in a fall in immigration since 2007 (especially by Moroccans and citizens of Latin America) and increasing emigration (especially of EU nationals). However, the balance between the inflow and outflow still resulted in positive net migration. The recession has also affected Italy, but the effect has mainly been a reduction in the number of immigrants, in particular Romanians. Ireland, the EU country that experienced one of the fastest increases in immigration at the beginning of the 21st century, already experienced a sharp fall in immigration in 2007, which was combined with a significant increase in emigration, resulting in negative net migration in 2009. For Germany and the United Kingdom, countries with a long immigration tradition, the effect of the recession on migration flows was less marked. Flows have generally been stable with small annual increases or decreases. In Belgium and the Netherlands, immigration appeared to stabilise in 2009 at the level recorded in 2008, but emigration continued to increase. 2.1.5. Immigration from non-EU countries Flows and stocks of migrants from non-EU countries can be monitored through residence permit data, which are now also collected and published by Eurostat. This section looks at new permits issued in 2008 and 2009 and at the totals of all valid permits, including those issued before 2008 ( 71 ). Roughly speaking, over 16.7 million foreigners reside in EU-27 ( 72 ) under a valid permit, and in both 2008 and 2009, more than 2 million new permits were issued in the EU ( 73 ). In 2009, EU Member States issued about 2.3 million new residence permits ( 74 ) to third-country nationals. This represents a reduction of over 8% compared to the previous year and approximately 210,000 fewer permits in absolute terms. Regarding the main reasons for issuing permits, there was a fall in the number of authorisations granted for family (e.g. family reunification and formation) and employment-related reasons. About 8%, i.e. about 55,000 fewer permits, were issued in 2009 (Graph III.2.9) for family-related reasons. However, the decrease was greater in the number of permits issued for employment reasons. In 2009, the number of third-country nationals granted an employment-related permit in the EU fell by 28%. This represents more than 215,000 fewer persons from third countries allowed to work in the EU in 2009 compared to the previous year. As a result of this sharp decrease, the share of employment-related permits in the volume of all permits issued shrank from 30% in 2008 to about 24% in 2009. ( 71 ) Data collection only started in 2008 and certain methodological discrepancies may occur. ( 72 ) No data available for Denmark, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom. ( 73 ) No data available for Cyprus and Luxembourg. ( 74 ) First residence permit is defined as a permit issued to a person for a first time and permits issued after at least 6 months since the expiry of the previous permit. Only permits with a validity of at least 3 months are included. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 115 1/07/11 08:08 ",

Source: Eurostat (online data code: migr_resfirst) A smaller number of permits were issued in 2009 in the majority of Member States, although the sharpest fall was recorded in most of the Baltic and Eastern European Member States. The number of permits issued halved or more than halved in Latvia, Hungary, Czech Republic and Lithuania. However, with nearly 110,000 fewer permits, Spain recorded the highest drop in absolute terms in 2009. Only in a few Member States did the number of persons granted authorisation to reside increase in 2009 (see Table III.2.1). Noticeably, due to the large increase in education-related permits, the United Kingdom had the highest absolute increase in permits issued (up by 38,000). High relative increases were also recorded in Austria (29% or 6,000) and Belgium (27% or 12,000). The number of employment-related permits fell in the vast majority of Member States, particularly sharply in Latvia, Czech Republic, Spain and Hungary, where the number of persons granted employment-related permits fell within a year by approximately three quarters. In absolute terms, the number of employment-related permits decreased most noticeably in Spain (70,000 less than in 2008), followed by Italy (down by 37,000), Czech Republic (down by 32,000) and the United Kingdom (down by 23,000). Contrary to overall developments in 2009, the number of residence permits issued for education reasons increased in 2009 (up 11% or 51,000). The increase in education-related permits in the EU almost entirely stemmed from the sharp increase in authorisations issued in the United Kingdom (46,000 more permits than in 2008). The United Kingdom remains by far the top destination country for non-EU citizens entering the EU for the purpose of education, accounting for more than 50% of all such permits issued in the EU. The highest number of authorisations to reside in EU Member States in 2009 was issued to citizens of India (190,000), followed by the United States (176,000), China (170,000) and Morocco (156,000). These four countries accounted for nearly 30% of all permits issued in the EU in 2009. The majority of Indians and Chinese entered the EU for the purpose of education or employment. 72,000 Chinese and 61,000 Indians were granted education-related permits, while 51,000 Chinese and 63,000 Indians entered the EU for employment reasons. By contrast, Moroccans were granted the highest number of permits for family reasons in EU (62,000), and less than 5% (i.e. 7,000) were granted permission to reside for education reasons.

Largely thanks to migration, Belgium's population is projected to grow by about 10 % until 2050. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them While childcare availability lies above the EU-27 average it could be extended for very young children. The gender pay gap is one of the lowest in EU-27. Nevertheless, there is scope for women's employment rates to catch up with men's; moreover a large proportion of women work part-time. Employment rates of older workers, in particular women, are very low and they represent an important labour force reserve. Major gains are also possible with regard to the integration of minorities and third country nationals into labour markets and education systems. However, in the crisis non-EU foreigners have seen unemployment rates rise to the highest value in EU-27, above 30 %. Finally, the reduction of public debt, projected to rise to over 100 % in 2011, would enhance the ability to meet future social protection needs linked to ageing.

Mortality is expected to decrease, especially among men aged 40-59. The negative effect of the decreasing number of women in fertile age registered today will have an impact on the reproduction of the population in the decades to come. Life expectancy, for both men and women, is currently low and significant progress is expected; the education level plays an important role in life expectancy. The old-age dependency ratio, currently at the European average, is projected to rise to a higher level than for EU-27 as a whole. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Investing in education and lifelong learning, promoting better conditions to combine labour and family duties could contribute to the employment growth. Productivity is only one third the EU-27 average, so there is an enormous catching-up potential. Reducing the number of early school leavers and increasing investment in research would contribute to realising this productivity growth potential. Current and projected public spending on health and long-term care is significantly below the EU-27 average, however, there may be pressure for increased spending.

These projections indicate a moderately shrinking population and, in spite of below- average life expectancy, the old-age dependency ratio is projected to rise above the EU-27 average. Life-expectancy strongly depends on education level, especially for men. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Female employment rates could rise significantly and the gender pay gap remains large. Child-care provisions under age 2 are scarce. Households with children face a higher poverty risk than households without children. Employment rates for older workers are close to the EU-27 average, which means that there is still room for increasing the size of the labour force. While educational attainment is already high, productivity can still increase considerably. The government is also giving priority to reforming social, health and other public services to improve the conditions for more active and dignified ageing. Public debt is currently low, but a large ageing-related increase in public pension expenditure is expected, from the current 10 % to a projected 11 % of GDP in 2060.

The projected increase in the old-age dependency ratio is much smaller than for EU-27 as a whole. Mainly thanks to assumed immigration the Danish population is projected to grow by over 6 % by 2050. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Denmark has already achieved high female employment rates, although the gender pay gap remains significant and women are much more likely to work part-time than men. The employment rate of older workers is also far above the EU-27 average, but could still rise in the over-60 age group if health and disability issues as causes for early labour market exit can be tackled. There also appears to be scope for a better integration of third country nationals into labour markets and education systems. Public debt is low compared to the EU-27 average.

Net migration has turned to negative; the population is decreasing and is projected to shrink by almost 10 % until 2050. Life expectancy in Germany is in line with the EU average while the old-age dependency ratio is already among the highest in EU-27 and expected to stay above the EU-27 average. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Employment rates of older workers are already above the EU-27 average and the expected ageing-related increase in social spending may stay slightly below the EU-27 average. The share of older workers among workers is projected to increase considerably in the next decade. To increase and make better use of the labour force potential, the government seems committed to reviewing the role of immigration in meeting the future labour demand. To increase the participation of women in the labour market, the Government emphasises increasing childcare facilities; by 2013 there should be place to accommodate at least 35 % of all children under 3 years old in childcare facilities; from 2013 onwards all children aged one and older will have a legal right to childcare. In 2007 Germany introduced a new parental leave scheme that is giving in particular fathers a greater financial incentive to become involved in the daily care of their children. The German Business Programme \u2018Success Factor Family\u2019 tries to convince enterprises of the usefulness of a more family-oriented personnel policy.

Life expectancy is significantly lower than the EU-27 average, particularly for men and the less-well educated. The result would be a low old-age dependency ratio. By 2050 the Estonian population, which is already in decline, is projected to continue shrinking by 12 %. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Female employment rates are high and most women work full-time. Among older workers, female employment rates are higher than men's. However, their pay is significantly lower than men's, indicating scope for a qualitative improvement of female employment. Also, a high proportion of children live in jobless households. To help families through the recession and deal with unemployment and especially long-term unemployment the government increased expenditure on active labour market measures, subsistence benefit, family and parental benefit; maintained the universal state family benefits system. A high proportion of people in their 50s and 60s are still in employment. There is room to capitalize on this fact and further reinforce active labour market policies through focus on lifelong learning. There is much catch-up potential for productivity growth which could build on the high level of educational achievement and on efforts to ensure that R&D results are translated into innovative services and products. Last year Estonia launched a National Health Strategy for 2009-2020 aiming to improve health, life expectancy and life quality. In 2020 the preparations for the development plan of children and families started. The children and family development plan 2011-2020 will focus on promoting positive parenting, early education and care, child well-being, child protection and child rights, work and family reconciliation issues.

Life expectancy matches the EU-27 average. The projections assume that fertility rates will remain high and that life expectancy will stay close to the EU-27 average. The old-age dependency ratio could more than double, but would remain significantly below the EU-27 average by 2050. Until 2050 the Irish population is projected to increase by almost 50 %. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Female labour force participation is already relatively high, but there remains scope for improvement with an employment rate gap between men and women of 10 percentage points and about one-third of women working part-time. Labour market opportunities for women could benefit from more accessible childcare. The gender pay gap is below the EU-27 average. In the crisis many children, especially those living with single parents, found themselves in jobless households. Migrants have been hit in the crisis and in 2009 there has been net emigration from Ireland. An increase in public spending on R&D and a reduction of early school leaving would help to raise future productivity. Although employment rates of older workers are above the EU-27 average, potential still exists for improvement.

Greece's old-age- dependency ratio is projected to rise much more than the EU-27 average in the medium term. Until 2050 the Greek population is expected to grow only slightly. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Government initiatives aim to maintaining /increasing labour market participation and reducing unemployment especially of young people and women. Productivity levels might benefit from further improving the business environment and the climate for R&D and innovation. Raising percentages of the population completing higher education and facilitating movement between training/ education and the labour market could also bring benefits. Greece continues aggressive fiscal consolidation effort. The deficit is estimated to decline from 15.4 % of GDP in 2009 to 9.4 % of GDP in 2010. The aim for 2011 is to reduce the deficit to 7.4 % of GDP. The public debt has risen sharply in the crisis and is now projected to reach 152.6 % of GDP in 2011 (Source: Budget of 2011, Greek Ministry of Finance). By 2060, public expenditure on pensions is projected to approach 25 % of GDP. The recent pension reform (2010) limits the increase of public sector spending on pensions by altering the pension award formula, introduces a unified statutory retirement age of 65 years by December 2013, increasing in line with changes in life expectancy, increases the minimum early retirement age to 60 by 2011, increases the minimum contribution period for retirement on a full pension from 35-37 to 40 years by 2015, simplifies the fragmented pension system, restricts access to early retirement.

Life expectancy is among the highest in EU-27. The projections assume that fertility will recover slightly and that life expectancies will roughly evolve in line with the EU-27 average. This would result in a high old-age dependency ratio in EU-27 in 2060. Over recent years, Spain has attracted large numbers of immigrants, many of whom were regularised, boosting the official population and employment of Spain. Under the assumption that immigration continues at the present level the Spanish population could grow considerably by 16 % until 2050. However, in the crisis, unemployment among migrants has risen considerably. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Female employment rates could rise, but this might require a more extensive provision of childcare for the youngest children. In the crisis, some 10 % of households with children have found themselves jobless. Employment rates of older workers are above the EU-27 average, but could also be further increased. The share of older workers (55-64) in the work force is projected to increase to well above 20 % in 2030. Educational attainment can be improved and early school leaving reduced; this could help Spain continue narrowing the productivity gap to the EU-27 average.

Life expectancy is assumed to continue to be one of the very highest in EU-27. The total population is expected to grow by about 10 % until 2050, while the old-age dependency ratio could evolve more favourably than for EU-27 as a whole. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Employment opportunities for women are relatively well developed thanks to extensive childcare provision, and the gender pay gap is below the EU-27 average. By contrast, there is much scope for increasing the labour force participation of older workers; the average life time in retirement is the highest in EU-27. A more modern employment protection combined with lifelong learning would increase labour market flexibility. Another area which would generate employment growth is the integration of third country nationals whose employment rates and educational attainment are particularly low. Public debt is above the EU-27 average; in 2011, as a result of the crisis, it is projected to reach 90 % of GDP. The projected increase in public social protection expenditure is also roughly in line with EU-27 as a whole. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 141 1/07/11 08:08 ",

With a low fertility rate and high life expectancy - both being expected to continue - the old age dependency ratio could rise to almost two-thirds (2 persons aged 65 or over for every 3 persons of working age). The Italian population size is expected to remain more or less constant under the assumption that significant numbers of immigrants continue to arrive. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them There is significant scope for promoting the labour force participation of women. This would also help in reducing the risk of poverty for households with children. Employment rates for older workers are also comparatively low. The proportion of older workers (aged 55-64) in the work-force is projected to become the highest, almost 25 %, in 2030. There is scope for raising productivity, notably by raising educational attainment levels, combating early school leaving and boosting R&D spending. Reducing public debt would enhance Italy's ability to meet future social protection needs, even if the projected ageing- related increase in public expenditure is comparatively small.

This is assumed to continue over the next decades. Nevertheless, thanks to immigration, Cyprus' population is expected to grow significantly until 2050 and the increase in the old-age dependency ratio could be moderate compared to the EU-27 average. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Employment rates are above the EU-27 average as is the employment gender gap at 15 %. In particular a better availability of child care, particularly for very young children, might lead to a further increase in female employment. Labour force participation of older men is high, even in the higher age groups (65-69) but it could grow further for women aged 55-64. Due to ageing, public expenditure on pensions is projected to rise, exerting a heavy strain on public finances even if the public debt level remains moderate compared to other EU-27 Member States. Government policy priorities are focused on introducing parametric reforms to the pension system, to improve its financial viability, to raise the employment rates of women and older workers and to further reduce the public debt to GDP ratio.

Life expectancy is significantly below the EU-27 average, particularly for men, and the gap is expected to remain large over the projection period. As a result the population, which is already declining, is expected to shrink dramatically (-16 % by 2050) while the increase in the old-age dependency ratio will be higher than the EU-27's in 2060. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Female employment rates are above the EU-27 average and most women work full-time. A better availability of child care, particularly for the youngest children, might allow further increases. The employment rates of older workers are also above the EU-27 average, but they could grow further. Latvia has a huge potential for catching up in terms of productivity and can build on a high level of educational attainment. There is also scope for more proactive education and labour market policies to improve the integration of third country nationals.

Life expectancy is significantly below the EU-27 average, particularly for men, and the gap is expected to remain large over the projection period. As a result, the population, already in decline, is expected to continue shrinking considerably (-17 % by 2050) and the old-age dependency ratio will increase to be the third-highest in EU-27 in 2060. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Female employment rates are above the EU-27 average and most women work full-time. A better availability of childcare, especially in the 0-2 age group, might still allow for further improvements. The employment rates of older workers are also above the EU-27 average, but could still grow, particularly if health and disability issues are tackled. Lithuania has great potential for catching up in terms of productivity and can build on a high level of educational attainment. Public finances are sound although public social protection expenditure is expected to rise over the coming decades. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 149 1/07/11 08:08 ",

The old-age dependency ratio is projected to be the lowest in EU-27 by 2050. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Female employment could grow, reducing the current 16 percentage point gap between male and female employment rates. A large proportion of women work part-time. The expansion in childcare facilities will certainly help in this respect. Another important labour force reserve is formed by older workers whose employment rates are significantly below the EU- 27 average. Productivity levels are very high which could allow the country to attract more migrant workers in the future.

In 2009, over 15 % of children (aged 0-17) found themselves in jobless households. Life expectancy is significantly below the EU-27 average, particularly for men, and the gap is expected to remain large over the projection period. There are also large life expectancy differences by education level, indicating that there is scope for improvement. As a result, the population, which is already decreasing, is expected to shrink by 10 % by 2050 and the old-age dependency ratio will increase to a level above that of EU-27 as a whole by 2060. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Hungary has significant scope for increasing employment through higher labour force participation of women and older workers. Productivity levels can also catch up, building on a high level of educational attainment of the population. More R&D investment could also help boost productivity. Public debt is close to the EU-27 average and public spending on pensions is expected to rise moderately. Reforms are also needed in the area of health and long term care, while avoiding deterioration in the quality of the services provided. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 153 1/07/11 08:08 ",

Declining fertility and a lengthening life expectancy, whose relative advances are expected to increase even faster over coming decades, will result in more rapid population ageing over the long-term. The population is expected to grow slightly as a result of developments in net migration inflows. Old-age dependency is lower than the EU-27 average, mainly due to Malta\u2019s late onset of fertility decline, whereby a higher life expectancy and a lower fertility rate are expected to lead to a rise in the old-age dependency ratio and in a mild decline in the youth- dependency ratio over time, although to different levels and with various degree of intensity in this decline; therefore, in the long term (2060), the population is projected to age substantially. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Measures are being taken to encourage more female participation in the labour market, particularly amongst married women as the gap between male and female employment rates currently stands at 37 percentage points. Similarly, there is increasing awareness of the labour force potential of older workers and measures are also being taken to encourage older workers to remain active in the labour market. Productivity levels are still significantly below the EU average and to close the gap, educational attainment levels need to be improved and R&D spending boosted. Public debt is below the EU-27 average, but public expenditure on pensions is projected to grow to 13.4 % of GDP in 2060, whereby the demographic transition to an older population is the main driver underpinning the increase for the public pension expenditure over the long-term.

Life expectancy is above the EU-27 average. Projections are based on the assumption that fertility will remain high and that life expectancy will grow slower than for EU-27 as a whole. These trends combined with significant immigration will result in a below-EU-27 average old-age dependency ratio by 2050. The Dutch population is projected to grow by only a few percent until 2050. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Female labour force participation is high, but the contribution of women to the economy could improve if women worked more hours and the gender pay gap was reduced. Better childcare provision could help in this respect. Employment could also grow through higher labour force participation of older workers and improved access of minorities and third country nationals to the labour market and education systems. Public debt is below the EU-27 average. Public social protection expenditure is expected to rise faster than for EU-27 as a whole, albeit to a level that would remain below the EU-27 average.

Thanks to life expectancy rising above the EU-27 average and significant immigration, the population is expected to grow until 2050 by almost 10 %. The old- age dependency ratio is expected to double but will stay slightly below the EU-27 average. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Female employment rates are high, but many women work part-time and their hourly pay is significantly lower than men's; childcare facilities for children 0-2 years are limited. Older workers represent a significant potential for increasing employment as their employment rates are well below the EU-27 average, although they have been on a steep increase over the last years. Employment may also benefit from improving qualification levels of third-country nationals and ensuring their better integration into the labour market. Public debt is close to the EU-27 average and public social protection expenditure is expected to rise only moderately over the coming decades. The government is particularly concerned about reconciliation of work and family life, integration of young people into the labour market, improvement of employment rates of older people and ensuring the sustainability of public finances for high quality social services. It has recently taken important measures to help young people enter the labour market. The government is keen to further promote the employability of older workers together with a higher effective retirement age and enhance the participation in pre-school education for children with a migrant background.

Life expectancy is significantly below the EU-27 average and it is not expected that the gap will be closed over the projection period. Over recent years, Poland experienced significant emigration, but in 2009 this may have dwindled. Altogether, by 2050, this will lead to a shrinking of the population by more than 10 % and to one of the highest proportions of those aged 65 and over in EU-27. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them There is a large life expectancy gap according to educational attainment, which can lead to overall increases as education becomes more widespread. Employment rates of both men and women are far below the EU average, leaving much scope for future employment growth. Promoting the labour force activation of women might also reduce the risk of poverty, which is higher for households with children. The employment rate gap between Poland and the EU average is particularly large for older workers. There is a large potential for productivity growth which could build on a high level of educational attainment. Public debt is below the EU-27 average and public pension expenditure is even expected to fall significantly over the coming decades. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 161 1/07/11 08:08 ",

The projection expects a moderate recovery. Life expectancy is close to the EU-27 average, especially for women. Net migration is positive but has been decreasing steadily since 2002. These underlying trends cause population to grow by 7.5 % by 2050 and to increase the old-age dependency ratio to a level that is above the EU-27 average. The working population is ageing fast and in 2030 it is projected that one worker in five will be an older worker (aged 55-64). Because of the crisis, the debt ratio is increasing from just above 60 % in 2007 to a projected 90 % in 2011. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Labour force participation, the gender employment gap and the gender pay gap compare favourably to the EU-27 average. But productivity levels are low and the number of early school leavers is high even if educational attainment is rising. Employment rates of men and women with young children are among the highest in EU-27 while childcare availability is increasing. This is likely to reduce the percentage of children at risk of poverty, presently close to the EU-27 average. The government continues to be concerned about income inequality and for this reason it is targeting social benefits towards the most vulnerable groups, especially older persons and families with children .

Fertility rates are expected to recover from the current low level while net emigration should come to a halt. As of 2009, 10 % of families with children are jobless. Life expectancy, particularly for men, is currently low and significant progress is expected. Even so, the population is projected to decrease significantly by 2060. The old-age dependency ratio is expected to remain below the EU-27 average for a couple decades, then increase to well above the EU-27 average by 2060, when, as a result, public expenditure on pensions if projected to be above 15 % of GDP. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Low employment rates mean that there is a major potential for employment growth. Productivity is just above one-third the EU-27 average, so there is an enormous catching-up potential. Reducing the number of early school leavers and increasing investment in research and development would contribute to realising this productivity growth potential. At the beginning of 2009 the government improved paid parental leave for young children. Parents can now take leave for any child under the age of two at 85 % of the average income. New legislation is also going to make it possible for private providers to create childcare places. Current public debt is well below the EU-27 average. Projections of future ageing-related public spending suggest a considerable increase over the coming decades, in particular in the area of pensions. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 165 1/07/11 08:08 ",

Life expectancy is near the EU-27 average. The old-age dependency ratio is expected to increase faster than for EU-27 as a whole and to exceed the EU-27 level by 2050. Under the current projections, until 2050 the Slovenian population is projected to decrease by 8 % and pension payments will be almost 20 % of its GDP. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them Female employment rates are well above the EU-27 average and few women work part-time. The gender pay gap is smaller than for EU-27 as a whole. There is significant scope for increased employment of older workers. There is also a high share of older people who have retired prematurely due to past restructuring; older workers participation rates, currently below 40 %, could increase. With productivity standing roughly at 4/5 of the EU-15 level, there is still some potential for growth. The pension reform and measures to promote active ageing will contribute to higher employment rate of elderly and later exit from the working life.

This may be the effect of a transition to women having children later in life; a further recovery of fertility is assumed for the population projections. The low figures above on childcare capacity for children under age 3 are disputed. Life expectancy is below the EU-27 average, particularly for men, and it is not expected that the gap will be closed over the projection period. The old-age dependency ratio, currently far below the EU-27 average, is expected to grow fast and to become the highest in EU-27 by 2060. Until 2050 the Slovakian population is expected to shrink by 10 %. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them While the gender gap in employment rates is small (reflecting also low employment rates for men), the pay gap is particularly large and childcare is only available for a minority of children. There is significant scope for employment growth by raising the labour force participation of older workers and by assisting the long term unemployed to find work. Slovakia could also benefit from catching up in terms of productivity and can build on a high level of educational attainment. More expenditure for R&D and for lifelong learning could also help. Public debt is low and the expected ageing-related increase in public social protection expenditure is moderate. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 169 1/07/11 08:08 ",

Fertility rates and life expectancy in Finland are above the EU-27 average and this positive development is expected to continue. In the next few years, population ageing will be faster in Finland than in most other EU-27 Member States. In 2020, Finland will have the oldest population in EU-27, measured in terms of the old-age dependency ratio. The working-age population, 15-64-year-olds, has been already decreasing since 2010. From 2010 to 2050 the Finnish population is expected to grow by 2 %. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them In the current decade, pension expenditure will grow quickly. Finland has funded a major part of the future pension expenditure and reformed social security and taxation. Finland is preparing itself for demographic change in particular through active ageing policies. The female employment rate is high and the gap between male and female rates is small. The employment rate of older workers is also comparatively high, but could be further improved by health promotion and tackling disability as a major cause for early labour market exit. Extending working careers and improving the productivity of public services, e.g. by reforming the structure of municipal health and social services, will play a key role. The Government has launched a policy programme for health promotion as well as a programme promoting employment, entrepreneurship and work life.

Life expectancy is well above the EU average. This situation is assumed to prevail over the projection period. Combined with significant immigration, these trends will result in further population growth by near 8 % in 2050. The increase in the old-age dependency ratio will be modest to a level below the EU average. In the crisis, many migrants in Sweden found themselves unemployed. \u2026 Opportunities for tackling them Sweden has the highest employment rate in the EU and the employment gap between men and women is small. However, the gender pay gap is larger than the EU average and a large proportion of women work part-time. Employment rates of older workers are very high too; improvements would require further efforts to prevent increases in disability pensions. While productivity exceeds the EU-15 average, the high levels of educational attainment and investment in research and development could allow further growth. Access of minorities and third-country nationals to the labour market and education system might be improved. The public debt is below the EU average; the expected ageing-related increase in public social protection expenditure is moderate. KEET10001ENC_002.pdf 173 1/07/11 08:08 ",

Life expectancy is close to the EU average, and a more favourable evolution for men is expected in the population projections. These trends, combined with a significant level of immigration, will lead to a growing population and a much more favourable evolution of the old-age dependency ratio than for the EU as a whole. The UK population is projected to grow by 20 % by 2050. Many children younger than 17 (17 %), especially those with single parents, live in jobless households. The debt to GDP ratio is now above 80 %, constraining policies. \u2026 opportunities for tackling them The gap between male and female employment rates is smaller than for the EU as a whole, but, at 11 percentage points, there is scope for further progress. The gender pay gap is particularly large and many women only work part-time. An improvement in the situation may require better availability of childcare. Improved female employment might also reduce the risk of poverty for households with children. Employment rates of older workers are high, even for people in their 60s. Government initiatives are focused on increasing labour market participation by reforming the incapacity benefit policy and expanding the initiatives to guide people back to work (the Pathways model) - around half the potential customers are over 50. There is also a focus on skills enhancement \u2013 particularly in pre- and in-work support. Public debt is comparatively low; the expected ageing-related increase in public social protection expenditure is slightly above the increase for the EU as a whole.
