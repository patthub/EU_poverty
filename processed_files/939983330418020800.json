        "Targeted Surveys on application of core labour standards, Indonesia 5 Targeted Surveys on application of core labour standards, Indonesia This report has been developed to provide a picture of the application of core labour standards in Indonesia. The report is based on a combination of desk research and stakeholder interviews. The assessments of the issues covered in the report are based on the views of credible international organisations, national governments, employer organisations, trade unions, experts and other stakeholders. Key context The relationship between the EU and Indonesia is framed by the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) which entered into force in May 2014. Negotiations are ongoing for an EU-Indonesia Free Trade Agreement (FTA). In line with current EU trade policy, the EU\u2019s proposed text for the FTA\u2019s Trade and Sustainable Development chapter includes a commitment to \u2018respect, promote and effectively implement in their laws and practices the internationally recognised core labour standards\u2019. The ninth round of negotiations for the FTA are due to take place in December 2019. An emerging middle-income country, Indonesia has made real gains in poverty reduction in recent years, nearly halving the poverty rate since 2000, to 9.8% in 2018. This has been underpinned by strong economic growth, averaging 5% per annum during the period 2014-2018. Progress in creating decent work opportunities has been more mixed, as the economy has been so far unable to accommodate strong growth in the labour force and job quality remains a major concern. While overall unemployment in Indonesia is relatively low (4.3%) and has fallen significantly since 2006 (when it was 10.3%), the youth unemployment rate (20%) is the highest in ASEAN. This is underpinned by a relatively long transition between leaving education and finding a job, particularly for young people with tertiary education. The labour market is also characterised by significant gender gaps. Women\u2019s labour force participation rate (52%), lags significantly behind that of men (83%). Women workers remain over-represented in low-paying, less protected parts of the economy. Progress \u2022 Trade union rights and industrial relations environment \u2022 Efforts to protect (Indonesian) migrant workers \u2022 National efforts towards the elimination of forced labour Challenges \u2022 Prevalence of non-standard and precarious form of employment \u2022 Capacity of social partners \u2022 Entrenched gender norms /stereotypes \u2022 Data gaps, including on child labour ",
        "Targeted Surveys on application of core labour standards, Indonesia 6 Although regular wage employment has expanded in recent years, informal employment remains high. Trade unions report that the high prevalence of informality is a major constraint to the effective implementation of the core labour standards. Freedom of association and collective bargaining The current legal framework generally meets international standards with respect to freedom of association and collective bargaining, although there remain some notable gaps in coverage, particularly restrictions on the right to strike. In practice, there are limitations on workers\u2019 right to form and join trade unions and to bargain collectively. Key issues include weak enforcement, harassment of trade union members, and concerns regarding the capacities of social partners to negotiate effectively. However, the government has overseen recent and renewed efforts to build these skills, including through a series of training and awareness-raising initiatives. Current government efforts to promote enterprise-level collective bargaining have taken place in the context of a marked decline in union membership in the past decade. Broader economic patterns \u2013 including increasing use of non-standard forms of employment \u2013 are notable constraints, as is the fragmentation of Indonesian trade unions. Forced labour The legal framework surrounding forced labour is adequate. The law prohibits all forms of forced labour, although Indonesia has not yet ratified P29. Concerns focus on enforcement, including insufficient penalties for trafficking and forced labour. In practice, forced labour is reported primarily in plantation agriculture and fisheries. Fish from Indonesia is included on the USDOL\u2019s most recent List of Goods produced by forced labour. While (registered) labour emigration has been in rapid decline over the past decade, Indonesia is a major source country for women, children and men subject to trafficking, including for the purposes of forced labour. Reports indicate that Indonesians are subject to forced labour and debt bondage in several sectors abroad, including domestic service, construction, factories and manufacturing, mainly in Asia and the Middle East. Indonesia\u2019s government has identified the protection of migrant workers as a national priority, and key reforms have been made to the governance of labour migration . In 2018 the government passed a new law on the Protection of Indonesian Migrant Workers. The Migrant Worker Protection and Placement Agency (BNP2TKI) has worked with a number of partners, including the ILO, to reduce risks of abuse and exploitation of Indonesian migrant workers. The government is committed to a number of activities to eliminate forced labour under the National Action Plan on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings (RAN PTPPO). Child labour The legal framework surrounding child labour is strong, and Indonesia has made moderate advancements in the elimination of child labour. However, both enforcement of child labour laws and the deterrent effect of legal penalties remain inadequate. ",
        "Targeted Surveys on application of core labour standards, Indonesia 7 In practice, child labour, including its worst forms, persists. Published statistics on child labour are dated: the most recent national child labour survey took place in 2009, finding that 6.9% of children in Indonesia were engaged in child labour Child labour reportedly occurs mostly in informal, unregulated activities, such as street vending and in the agricultural and domestic sector. The US Department of Labour lists seven goods from Indonesia as produced by child labour: fish, footwear, gold, palm oil, rubber, tin and tobacco. The Indonesian government has set an ambitious goal to eliminate child labour by 2022, and progress is being made: between 2008 and 2018, the government removed (and returned to school) 105,956 children from child labour conditions. Government institutions are currently coordinating with ILO to identify further steps to consolidate progress towards child labour elimination \u2013 including updating national data on child labour and strengthening the role of local governments at provincial, district, city and village level. The Government has also made targeted interventions to prevent children\u2019s work on fishing platforms. However, a number of factors impede further progress: allocation of resources for effective enforcement of child labour laws; lack of comprehensive and recent data on child labour; and limits on access to schooling. Discrimination Indonesia has overall developed an adequate legal framework for the elimination of discrimination in employment and occupation. While there is no overarching anti- discrimination law, anti-discrimination provisions are embedded in different laws and regulations. However, employment-related discrimination based on sexual orientation, national origin, citizenship, language, age, and HIV status and other diseases is not explicitly prohibited in secondary legislation. In practice, most reports of discrimination in employment relate to gender. There is a high degree of both vertical and horizontal occupational segregation, and women\u2019s labour force participation lags significantly behind men\u2019s \u2013 both likely explained to some degree by allocation of unpaid care responsibilities and stereotypes relating to women\u2019s economic activity. Stakeholders report that discrimination affecting women takes various forms, including pay and benefits, career development, job security and hiring, with rising concerns about sexual harassment in the workplace. There have been recent improvements relating to gender discrimination in the workplace, largely because government and social partners have given greater attention to the issue. The government is publicly committed to promoting decent work for women and has embarked on several initiatives seeking to promote gender equality and a women\u2019s enhanced participation in the labour market, including the establishment of a Taskforce for Equal Employment Opportunity whose mandate is to raise awareness among both workers and employers of non-discrimination and equality in the workplace. However, the implementation of the 2016 Disability Law has reportedly had limited impact to date. Employers remain unsure of the requirements of the law and of the benefits of adjusting workplaces for workers with disabilities. ",

Noted trade union claims that legal provisions on protection of \u2018national vital objects\u2019 may be used in practice to suppress freedom of association. C98 (2018): Noted indications by govt that it will amend Manpower Act, which requires employer presence during enterprise vote to determine trade union representation for collective bargaining. Requested govt to review Industrial Relations Dispute Settlement - allowing for only one party to file a petition to the Industrial Relations Court \u2013 as this does not promote voluntary collective bargaining.

Child labour C138 (2019): Called for efforts to eliminate child labour, particularly in the agricultural sector and expand application of Manpower Act to cover children working in the informal sector; in addition, amend regulations to require employers to keep registers of children under 18 employed within their establishment. Noted that while there is a Ministerial Regulation which sets the minimum age of domestic workers at 18, that this does not offer comprehensive protection and is below the standards of decent work for a domestic worker. Strengthen labour inspectorate at the national and local levels to help monitor the situation of child labour, particularly in the agricultural sector C182 (2019): Called for actions to strengthen capacity of law enforcement to combat trafficking of children and ensure thorough investigations and prosecution of persons found to be trafficking children.
