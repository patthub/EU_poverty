        "REFERENCE DOCUMENT NO 27 | EDUCATION PRACTICAL GUIDANCE NOTE 6 | LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND 1. Topic Overview The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 state that education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit and individual capability. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out global priorities to be realised for people and the planet by 2030. At the heart of these goals is a simple principle: to Leave No One Behind. This means that regardless of circumstances, all people should have equitable and meaningful access to a quality education and the means for a productive life. The EU is committed to the realisation of the SDGs as a whole and Leaving No One Behind is a strategic priority for the Commission in its work at all levels of education. i There are many ways in which children, adolescents and youth are left behind. At present, using data that are available and recognising that many children \u2013 such as child workers, nomadic and homeless children, those in prison or living in urban slums, many refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) \u2013 often do not appear in official data at all: \u2022 Worldwide, some 262 million children ii , adolescents and youth are out of school due to reasons such as conflict, poverty, ethnicity, location, language, disability or gender \u2022 Girls are more likely than boys to remain completely excluded from education. 15 million girls of primary school age will never have the opportunity to learn to read and write in primary school, compared to about 10 million boys. iii \u2022 Globally it is estimated that 152 million children aged 5-17 are engaged in child labour iv , with a large number of them deprived of quality education, even i This PGN provides a broad overview of equity in education and the different groups affected.

        "2 REFERENCE DOCUMENT NO 27 | EDUCATION PRACTICAL GUIDANCE NOTE 6 | LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND \u2022 Children, adolescents and youth living in countries affected by conflict are further left behind either because they have little or no access to education or because the education is not appropriate to their situation. They are more than twice as likely not to be in school than children and youth in countries not affected by conflict. ix Leaving children and young people behind affects not only the children and youth themselves but has a pronounced and negative effect on society. The global income loss from not providing every individual with one extra year of schooling is estimated to range from 7 to 10 % of GDP per capita. x The loss in human capital wealth incurred today because many adult women did not benefit in their youth from universal secondary education (defined as 12 years of schooling) is estimated to range between US$ 15 trillion to US$ 30 trillion globally. xi Women\u2019s economic empowerment begins with girls having access to quality education. Half of the economic growth in the OECD countries during the past 50 years has followed from increased education, which has a lot to do with educating girls. xii In countries with twice the levels of educational inequality, the probability of conflict more than doubles. xiii The economic costs of out-of-school children is estimated to be \u2018greater than the value of an entire year of GDP growth\u2019 in nine countries in Africa. xiv If no one was left behind then the results for society would be more positive. Moving an additional 1% of women into primary education (from no education) would reduce rates of maternal death by between 5-8 deaths per 100,000 live births. xv One extra year of schooling increases an individual\u2019s earnings by up to 10%. xvi Each dollar invested in that additional year of schooling, particularly for girls, generates earnings and health benefits of US$10 in low-income countries and nearly US$4 in lower-middle income countries. xvii If all students in low-income countries completed school with basic reading skills, 171 million people could be lifted out of poverty.

Inequalities and inequities xxi can be the result of discrimination based on universal characteristics such as age, gender, disability or ethnicity; or contextual characteristics such as income level, conflict, parental education, orphan or marital status. In many cases there can be overlaps. This is called \u2018intersectionality\u2019. Lack of data: Data on these disadvantages is often aggregated across countries or regions within a country and masks huge inequalities and inequities. Many countries do not yet have the disaggregated data to be able to distinguish which children are in danger of being left behind and in what ways. These data gaps need to be addressed, using existing frameworks when available to inform our understanding of overlapping barriers in different contexts, and allow for better targeting of interventions. The rate of change in ensuring that no one is left behind needs to be faster to achieve the SDGs: At current rates, it is estimated that only seven out of 10 children of school age in low- and middle-income countries will be on track to achieve primary-level skills in 2030. In low-income countries just three out of 10 school age children will be on track to achieve primary-level skills. xxii But if all countries accelerated progress to the rate of the world\u2019s 25% fastest education improvers, then all children could achieve the minimum primary learning reducing inequalities in one generation xxiii , and a child in a low-income country would be as likely to reach the baseline level of secondary school skills and participate in post- secondary education as a child in a high-income country today. xviii EFA Global Monitoring Report, EFA Global Monitoring Report 2013-2014: Teaching and Learning: Achieving Quality for All, Summary , UNESCO: Paris, 2014, p. 22 https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000225654 xix UNESCO UIS & GEM Report, Policy Paper 32 / Fact Sheet 44: Reducing Global Poverty Through Universal Primary and Secondary Education, June 2017, p. 11 http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/reducing-global-poverty- through-universal-primary-secondary-education.pdf xx UNESCO, Global Education Monitoring Report: Education for People and Planet: Creating Sustainable Futures for All, 2016, p. 33 https://unesdoc. unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000245752 xxi Equality is \u201cthe state of being equal in terms of quantity, rank, status, value or degree\u201d, while equity \u201cconsiders the social justice ramifications of education in relation to the fairness, justness and impartiality of its distribution at all levels or educational sub-sectors\u201d (Holsinger & Jacob, 2009) xxii The Learning Generation, Op.

        "3 REFERENCE DOCUMENT NO 27 | EDUCATION PRACTICAL GUIDANCE NOTE 6 | LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND Improving education for all is possible, but to leave no one behind, disadvantaged groups need to be deliberately targeted and targeted early: Strengthening the performance of the education system and putting results first, finding new and more creative ways to achieve learning, and increasing and improving investment in education will improve education outcomes. However, only deliberately targeting disadvantaged groups first will ensure that no one is left behind and that education provision is equitable. Children, youth and adolescents who are presently left behind must make faster progress or they will be left further behind. In some cases, this may require challenging the social barriers that deny people opportunity and limit their potential including changing discrimination and exclusion based on gender xxiv , age, location, caste, religion, disability or sexual identity. \u2018Progressive universalism\u2019 is the term used to describe the provision of good quality services for all, with specific additional services for the most marginalised groups so that they can access those services equitably. In countries such as India, Pakistan, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, where some disadvantaged children have been given similar opportunities as better off children, the learning gap has reduced substantially. xxv A large number of children do not have access to education in a language they speak or understand xxvi , which has a profoundly negative impact on learning. The importance of using the child\u2019s language for instruction is recognised, with evidence demonstrating the positive correlation between speaking the language of instruction and pupil achievement xxvii . In ethnically and linguistically diverse countries, with children facing language barriers, the EU supports efforts to provide mother tongue based education at least for early grades xxviii ; this can be key to promoting social inclusion and cultural diversity. Leaving no one behind also means intervening early. There is an increasing evidence of the importance of investment in children\u2019s pre-school years for their later life outcomes and to reduce the effects of disadvantage. In Mozambique, for example, children in rural areas who enrolled in pre-school were 24% more likely to go on to attend primary school \u2013 and xxiv See PGN 8: Gender Equality in Education xxv Rose, P.

Key Issues Leaving no one behind means that EU Delegations should support reforms which aim to reduce disparities so that all children, whatever their background or circumstance can have access to a quality education. The following is a possible step-by-step methodology for addressing this situation. At the end is a framework of questions that can be used as a guide for sector analysis, policy dialogue and planning an appropriate response. Understanding the context Analysis of barriers and how they interact: Children, youth and adolescents are left behind in numerous and often overlapping ways. Understanding the barriers that prevent them from accessing and progressing in education and how those barriers often interact with each other to exacerbate the disadvantage is fundamental to understanding where it may be possible to intervene. For instance, there might be a language barriers for children from ethnic minorities, or children in rural areas are often disadvantaged by low-quality school infrastructure, insufficient supply of competent teachers, and a lack of educational materials. Poor children in rural areas may not be able to attend school frequently or at all due to involvement in agricultural work and their family\u2019s extreme low income or because the government has not extended provision to their area or ethnic group. In many countries and regions girls are disproportionately affected by poverty, negative social norms, gender-based violence, teaching which is not gender-sensitive, and a lack of sanitary facilities. But children, youth and adolescents with disabilities who live in rural areas may also experience a lack of any support for their special needs in education, and girls with disabilities may experience more barriers both in and out of school. Girls with disabilities, who are living in conflict situations are likely to have to surmount even more barriers.

        "4 REFERENCE DOCUMENT NO 27 | EDUCATION PRACTICAL GUIDANCE NOTE 6 | LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND Understanding inequality and inequities: It is important to be clear on the nature and extent of educational disparity. This requires analysis of current education policies and how they may relate to disadvantaged groups as well as developing an understanding through policy dialogue with governments and other partners, of where there may be policy and activity gaps. Collecting data on who is left behind and how: Being clear on the type, level and extent of educational disparity present relies on well disaggregated data on all groups across different sub-sectors. However, in many countries some vulnerable groups, such as children with disabilities, are \u2018invisible\u2019 in the data. It is often necessary to design specific studies to get a better understanding of the barriers that disadvantaged groups are facing. The UIS has established the International Observatory on Equity and Inclusion in Education to foster and develop the methodologies, guidelines and research needed to build a global repository of data and standards to measure equity in education. It has also produced a handbook for measuring equity in education. xxx Understanding the policy context: It is important to establish how the policy context embodies \u201cLeave No One Behind\u2019 principles and to understand governments\u2019 commitment to this, to determine where there may still be gaps in awareness and understanding or a lack of legislature and how that plays out in terms of resource allocation and mobilisation. National-level policies developed with SDGs in mind should reflect how the government is addressing inequality and inequity in education. There may also be specific policies and legislation which target inclusion of specific vulnerable groups such as child labourers, children, youth and adolescents with disabilities, or those from ethnic minorities in education. There may also be specific government departments dealing with these groups. It will be important to map all institutions which are involved in addressing inequality and inequity more broadly as well as in education, as there may be considerable areas of overlap. It is important to promote the consultation of representatives of specific vulnerable groups during policy development. Education sector plans often reflect broad aspirations towards leaving no one behind but are not always fully funded or supported with expertise. Looking at these for specific areas of action that could quickly bring benefits to the furthest left behind children in enrolment and retention will highlight useful entry points. xxx UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Handbook on Measuring Equity in Education, 2018 http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/handbook-measuring- equity-education-2018-en.pdf Mapping other actors\u2019 involvement: Coordination of response is another aim of the SDGs upheld by the EU and its Member States. Mapping the bilateral involvement in education programmes targeted at those most left behind and comparative advantages of other member states and other donor countries in this area will highlight gaps or areas where better coordination could be more effective in leaving no one behind. NGO and CSO activity in this area should also be mapped as this is often specifically targeted at left behind groups or geographical areas. This is particularly relevant for contexts affected by crises and fragility where humanitarian assistance increasingly includes responses to the education needs of those most excluded and left behind. It is important therefore to strengthen cooperation between humanitarian and development actors, in particular through facilitating closer linkages among their respective coordination structures. This closer nexus approach is set out in the Communication on EiEPC published in May 2018. Identifying and mobilising local levers for change Having understood the nature and extent of educational disparities which leave children, youth and adolescents behind, finding local levers for change can begin by identifying potential champions who are already convinced of the benefits of leaving no one behind. These persons and organisations can be powerful allies in crafting and delivering policy dialogue which sets out the benefits to the country, region or institution of ensuring that all children are equitably included in quality education to convince key individuals or institutions to act. Similarly, facilitating contact for key individuals or groups with their counterparts in other countries or regions who have embraced Leave No One Behind principles can be useful. Global groups such as the Results for Development offer advice, support and potential funding to assist in Leaving No One Behind. Building on previous commitments which have not yet been fulfilled, such as increasing primary completion rates for specific groups or introducing pre-schooling for disadvantaged groups. These commitments can be built upon, drawing on any existing good practice in terms of leaving no one behind and analysing with stakeholders why this is good practice and how it could be scaled up. Analysing government resource flows: Knowing the extent to which disadvantaged areas or groups are supported through allocation of government resources is imperative to understanding where and how barriers may be overcome to leave no one behind. Exploring the financing formulas in decentralised systems and examining budget allocations and expenditures for specific regions or disadvantaged groups can yield ",
        "5 REFERENCE DOCUMENT NO 27 | EDUCATION PRACTICAL GUIDANCE NOTE 6 | LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND important information on which to base response decisions. The Global Campaign for Education and ActionAid produced Financing Matters xxxi an NGO/CSO toolkit on domestic financing for education which usefully sets out different processes. Also a UNESCO publication Financing Education in Sub-Saharan Africa xxxii may be a useful reference. Teacher training and deployment are other areas that will affect the quality of education for all groups of children, youth and adolescents. Systems and drivers for deployment and retention of teachers, particularly in rural areas and of teachers who have special educational needs and disabilities training, should be explored and understood. A range of tools are available for this purpose, including SABER-teachers xxxiii which provides a framework for analysing teacher policies in order to improve student learning and develop priority options for improving teaching quality. (See also the PGN 10: Teacher Policy and Management for additional information) . It is also important to consider any private sector actors in education (e.g. private schooling providers) and their influence on provision for specific groups or regions. Acknowledging the multi-sectoral nature of disadvantage and the need for a corresponding multi-sectoral response: There are many reasons why children, youth and adolescents are left behind, some of which are outside the scope of the education system. It is necessary therefore to consider policies and practice in other sectors which may affect a child\u2019s ability to access and progress in education and to develop ways of working across these sectors. For example, social protection systems that include social benefits for children and/or families can contribute to removing children and adolescents from child labour and to integrate or re-integrate them into education and training. UNFPA produced a paper: Towards a Multi- sectoral Response to Gender-Based Violence xxxiv which illustrates how a multi-sectoral response can alleviate one of the barriers faced by many children in accessing and thriving in a quality education system. xxxi Global Campaign for Education & ActionAid, Financing Matters: A Toolkit on Domestic Financing For Education, 2016 https://www. campaignforeducation.org/docs/resources/GCE%20Financing_Matters_EN_ WEB.pdf xxxii UNESCO, Financing Education in Sub-Saharan Africa: Meeting the Challenges of Expansion, Equity and Quality, 2011 https://www.brookings. edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Finance_Education_Africa.pdf xxxiii World Bank SABER Teachers http://saber.worldbank.org/index. cfm?indx=8&pd=1&sub=0 xxxiv UNFPA, Towards a Multi-sectoral Response to Gender-Based Violence: Mapping the Current Situation in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Region, 2015 http://femroadmap.eu/UNFPA_EECA_RO_Survey_report_on_ Multi-sectoral_Response_to_GBV.pdf Developing a response strategy \u2013 results first The first step in developing a response strategy should be to agree on the ultimate objectives. What results do you want to achieve? Leaving no one behind implies that the response strategy should begin with those who are furthest behind, those most disadvantaged within the present system. This means bringing these groups up to the level of the more advantaged and investing support in improving their learning before that of better off groups. Raising a national average for enrolment for instance, is not good enough. Targets have to measure the extent to which different children, youth and adolescents are being included in the rate of progress and to be ambitious for all groups to reach a minimum target level. A few education systems (Vietnam xxxv , Shanghai xxxvi in China, Indonesia xxxvii ) have minimum standards for education. There is no global standard for proficiency yet, although steps have recently been taken in that direction through the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning xxxviii coordinated by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, and the Commonwealth Secretariat has also developed a set of Commonwealth Quality Standards for Education xxxix in response to SDG4. Depending on the context, interventions could be at a range of different levels and in some cases may span all levels, strengthening system reforms to address equity. \u2022 Policy and legislative level: Plugging gaps in legislation or policy to ensure that the most disadvantaged groups can have equal and equitable access to quality education.

        "6 REFERENCE DOCUMENT NO 27 | EDUCATION PRACTICAL GUIDANCE NOTE 6 | LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND \u2022 Organisational level: Working with Ministry of Education and associated institutions can help them to more appropriately configure themselves to address disadvantaged groups (strengthening EMIS, or assessment departments for example). \u2022 Curriculum level: Improving the curricula to address diversity can ensure it is accessible to all and available in all appropriate languages and levels. Kenya has recently reformed its curriculum as part of system wide reforms aimed at inclusion of all children in quality education. xlii \u2022 Teacher supply and training: Strengthening or introducing inclusive education training as part of the initial teacher training or in a continuous professional development programme and working on deployment strategies for trained teachers is vital. International Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) have developed a very useful handbook for supporting the professional development of teachers in conflict affected areas. xliii \u2022 School management: Head teacher training on Inclusive Education, working with School Management Committees to raise awareness and understanding of diversity and the need to Leave No One Behind and developing strategies for inclusion in their schools. This would include attention to school facilities to cater for different needs. The Education Sector Support Programme in Nigeria (ESSPIN) in Nigeria is a good example of working with school management to improve inclusion in education. xliv \u2022 Community level: Working with CSOs / NGOs can raise awareness and understanding of diversity and to champion the need to Leave No one Behind. For example, CARE International has been a champion of Girls\u2019 Education in their community advocacy work with boys and men xlv ; and coalition of NGOs Stop Child Labour \u2013 School is the best place to work aims to eliminate all forms of child labour and to ensure quality full-time education for all children by creating child labour free zones. xlvi \u2022 Disadvantaged groups: Raising awareness of inequalities, inequities and rights, increasing access to education and working cross-sectorally can help to break down barriers to access and progression. In Tajikistan, Save The Children are working with women\u2019s groups to raise awareness of the rights of children to have birth certificates (and therefore access to education). xlvii xlii Ogutu, D.

The P20 xlviii is an initiative put forward by Development Initiatives to track the progress of the world\u2019s poorest 20% as a way of monitoring the progress towards this goal. But simply monitoring the poorest 20% is not enough to give us information required to track progress for all disadvantaged children, youth and adolescents. To have data that is relevant for education policy, data on the P20 must be further disaggregated by gender, geography, ethnicity, age, disability and possibly language. The Washington Group and UNICEF have developed a standard way to identify xlix , at the population level, the prevalence of functional difficulties among children aged 2 to 17 years, and to use this information to monitor participation (for example, access to education) in accordance to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. There are a number of different methodologies to measure learning, another important indicator for Leave No One Behind. These generally fall into two groups: measures of learning that are already in existence that can be examined with specific disadvantaged groups in mind or those that are developed and administered specifically to track progress of those groups. Learning assessments such as national level examinations, and Literacy and Numeracy questions included in Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys or Demographic and Health surveys, may not return enough timely or sufficiently disaggregated data to inform policy and practice and it may be necessary to develop more targeted assessments. This is particularly important for the most disadvantaged groups, those children, youth and adolescents who are out of school and are not usually included in regular assessments.

Data Good, disaggregated data is essential both to understand the nature and extent of disadvantages experienced in education and to signal where actions could ameliorate those disadvantages. \u2022 Are systems in place for the generation, analysis and use of data that aids in identification and measuring the participation and progression of all disadvantaged groups? \u2022 Is that data disaggregated and freely available? \u2022 Are all actors involved in the generation of information and data regarding vulnerable groups of children, youth and adolescents? Concepts \u2022 Is Leave No one Behind seen as an overall principle that guides all educational policies and practices? \u2022 Are the societal benefits of Leave No One Behind understood and articulated? \u2022 Is there a vision for a more equal and equitable education system? \u2022 Is there a clear theory of change for achieving an education system in which no one is left behind? Policy Domestic Governments\u2019 commitment to investment and reform to leave no one behind is the most important driver. \u2022 Does promotion of Leave No One Behind feature prominently in all important policy documents? \u2022 Do all institutions that work with children, youth and adolescents support the policy aspirations of Leave No One Behind? \u2022 Is there cross-sectoral support that the EU could offer? \u2022 Do leaders at all levels articulate consistent policy aspirations for Leave No One Behind, and do they challenge practice that leaves children, youth and adolescents behind? \u2022 Are there key people or institutions who could be \u2018change leaders\u2019? Finances \u2022 Are resources both human and financial targeted at the most vulnerable groups of learners? \u2022 What are the barriers that prevent this? \u2022 Do financing formulas reflect the need to leave no one behind? \u2022 Is there potential for Leave No One Behind criteria to be included into structural support to governments? \u2022 Is there a system of financial accountability which could support Leave No One Behind, such as budget monitoring for instance? Practice The evidence for pre-primary education is strong. Investing in pre-schools is an effective and cost-effective way of addressing inequality, interrupting the intergenerational transmission of poverty and improving outcomes in later life. If there is a functioning primary education system in place, then developing a pre-primary system which feeds it may be the most effective next step. \u2022 Is there provision for pre-schooling or other early childhood development and care for all disadvantaged groups? In some countries whilst primary education is widely available, places in secondary are limited. This will disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups. \u2022 How is provision for all disadvantaged groups affected by the number and quality of secondary provision? It is important to understand how Leave No One Behind principles play out in schools. \u2022 Does the curriculum and associated assessment practice take account of all learners? \u2022 Do schools have strategies that encourage all learners to participate and achieve? Teachers are key actors and for them to be able to support all children to progress there need to be enough teachers in the right place with the right preparation and knowledge and the right tools. \u2022 Are there sufficient teachers equipped with the knowledge and tools necessary to recognise diversity and enable all learners? \u2022 Do they have access to continuous professional development to assist them in building their knowledge and improving their pedagogical practice? Accountability It is the responsibility of each person and organisation within an education system to play their role appropriately. To ensure that no one is left behind then there must be clear lines of responsibility for progress and systems to know when something goes wrong and what can be done in response. Whilst governments have ultimate responsibility for progress in education and leaving no one behind, civil society, schools, teachers, communities, parents, students and international organisations all have their roles to play. Is there a need to support the development of accountability systems such as: \u2022 Mechanisms that ensure that governments uphold every child\u2019s right to education? \u2022 Systems to prepare national education monitoring reports? \u2022 Regulations for private providers of education? \u2022 Capacity building for CSOs to track resource use in education? \u2022 Systems to measure of progress and development of minimum educational standards? \u2022 Systems of professional accountability with Teachers\u2019 Unions? \u2022 Systems of community-based school management?

Case Study Source Hameed Ghada, EU Delegation to Iraq Programme Iraq \u2013 Capacity building in Primary and Secondary education: Improving quality and equality Context and challenges Iraq was once renowned for having the best education system in the region. Conflict during the last few decades and the almost tripling of the population in the last 30 years has resulted in an inadequate supply of quality education. Almost 43% of the 33.4 million population are estimated to be less than 15 years of age. In addition, there are new pressures from the influx of Syrian refugees and the movement of internally displaced people (IDP) particularly to Kurdistan. Education received only 7.8% of total state budget allocations in 2015 and education spending, due to the low price of oil and frequent late agreement on, and release of, budgets, is uneven and inefficient. Although primary enrolment rate is 91%, only 44% complete primary school on time, with wide discrepancies in both enrolment and survival between governorates, gender and urban/rural populations. Average survival rates (76% to the end of primary school) are low and repetition rates, high (15% for boys, 10% for girls). Detailed data is scant but there is a pronounced requirement to improve provision for children with special needs and disabilities, including Syrian refugees, IDPs, and children with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Action taken Access and participation were increased through: \u2022 An analysis of the legislative and policy framework for inclusion. Work with key persons in the government to understand and adapt the policy framework for inclusion. \u2022 An analysis of the causes of low enrolment and the development of strategies to increase the enrolment rate for under- represented groups, such as girls, children with special needs and disabilities and those in rural areas, which included representation from all of these groups. Influence mapping to identify key decisions, influences and decision makers with regard to enrolment of all children. \u2022 The collection of baseline data on children with special educational needs and disabilities, awareness-raising, revising and updating legislation and the curriculum, and capacity building, led by widely representative and issue-based, working groups at various levels throughout the system to develop strategies to address barriers identified. Barriers included: difficulties in accessing curriculum (especially for disabled children who were in mainstream school but not supported); high costs of transport to school and of learning materials; security situation; the triple shift system and teachers\u2019 lack of training. This resulted in financial aid for greater inclusion, advocacy amongst parents and teachers, increased parent/ school dialogue and a reduction, where possible, in the triple shift system. Quality was enhanced through: \u2022 Quality assurance of schools against defined standards, with a focus on issues of inclusion, gender and IDPs, to ensure schools are able to respond to the emerging needs of these groups. \u2022 Building capacity to enhance the curriculum, taking into account issues of inclusion and developing specialised curricula and programmes to support children with particular needs including those with physical and psycho-social disabilities \u2022 Supporting teacher development around inclusive pedagogies for excluded groups, and revising how teachers are distributed throughout the country, with a particular regard to language/cultural issues. \u2022 Addressing issues such as deployment strategies, career progression and retention. Accountability was increased through: \u2022 Supporting the development of school self-evaluation and external evaluations together with school development planning through \u2018Critical Friend Supervisors\u2019 and the headteacher in the role of \u2018resident supervisor\u2019. A pilot of 500 Schools returned positive feedback and scaling up is in discussion. \u2022 The programme is concentrated on those districts in Iraq which are furthest behind. Lessons learned \u2022 Starting in those districts most in need (and accessible) \u2022 The involvement of Iraqi officials at all levels, through the working groups, and the development of local capacity were crucial in developing local solutions. \u2022 Data collection, generation and analysis is an important pre-cursor to any substantive activity (inception phase), as is the inclusion at this stage of representation of all disadvantaged groups. \u2022 The project steering committee helped to build high level champions and raise awareness at Ministerial and senior official levels. \u2022 Technical assistance to the working groups through Iraqi consultants. \u2022 Bringing in external expertise in Special Education Needs and Disabilities (and psycho-social issues) and modern counselling techniques was required to bolster local expertise.
