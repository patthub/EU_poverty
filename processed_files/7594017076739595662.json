        "European Economic and Social Committee The voice of Various Interests\u2019 Group December 2017 Europe III I have attended many COPs, but this one in Bonn was particularly interesting for me. In terms of the negotiations per se, it was rather routine: the agenda featured largely \u201ctechnical\u201d items such as how to draw up the reports that will have to be submitted in the future and how transparent they will be, as well as what transparency actu- ally means. Of course there was disagreement about money, specifically the Green Climate Fund, which will have a budget of EUR 100 billion from 2020 and which is designed to help poorer countries address the dire consequences of cli- mate change. The poorer countries, in my view quite justifiably, want to see money on the table right now, to provide some relief from the dam- age done by hurricanes, droughts and flooding. The donors, which are the countries who bear most of the responsibility for global emissions, are taking a hard line. What was really exciting was the area at the COP conference centre where science, civil soci- ety and regions and cities met \u2013 in other words all those who are already directly affected by climate change or who have to implement the decisions taken by the negotiating parties. Be- cause transformation clearly does not happen by itself but has to be put into effect and real- ised through practical measures. There was es- sentially a feeling of unity and positive energy around one goal: that it is time to take action now, without further delay. Particularly striking was the presence of two United States delegations at the conference. The smaller of these was the official White House delegation, which Trump had put to- gether from a mixture of coal and nuclear sec- tor lobbyists. This delegation was reserved and non-aggressive at the talks, though it seems that it was also quite isolated. But when it start- ed fulminating against climate protection at a US side event, the other US delegation \u2013 which consisted of regional and municipal represent- atives, mayors, NGOs, scientists and prominent figures such as Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2013 stood up and burst into song. The elegant and peace- ful protest went on for twenty minutes. The second US delegation was very engaged, and it had two messages for Bonn. The first was \u201cWe\u2019re still in\u201d, meaning that it is not the United States that has withdrawn from the UN Climate Convention but its president, that the US will continue to implement its commitments under the Paris accords, that it is already on the right track, and that it doesn\u2019t need its president to do this. I was very impressed by the examples from American cities like Des Moines or states such as California. They show that the Americans are not being cowed by their president but are going ahead and implementing climate protec- tion measures with considerable commitment and success through global alliances such as the Global Covenant of Mayors. Municipalities and regions were in fact very visible as pro-active players. Stockholm has announced its intention to be a fossil-fuel free city by 2040. CO2 emissions have already been reduced by 55% compared with 1990 levels, despite a 37% increase in the population and doubling of the city\u2019s GDP. Where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. The mayor of Ghent spelled it out clearly: there is no longer any reason not to initiate effective and ambitious action already. The technology is available, and we all owe it to future genera- tions to do something now and not wait in the hope of \u201cbetter times ahead\u201d. COP 23 made one thing very clear to me person- ally: that civil society, regions, cities and munic- ipalities, as well as some business players, have made much more progress than those who are framing policies. The German logistics firm DHL, which operates worldwide, has announced that it will be emissions-free by 2050 at the latest. It is finding unconventional ways of achieving this. As none of the established car-makers would or could supply it with electric cars, DHL took the initiative itself.

        "The first EESC opinion on the outline of the EPRS was adopted in January 2017. The second opinion was adopted last month, after the EESC was asked by the Commission for its input on the Reflection Paper on the social dimension of Europe . The EESC decided to link this opinion with the Recommendation and Proposal for an Interinstitutional Proclamation on the EPSR . The EPSR is part of a broader discussion about the future of Europe, launched by the President Juncker in 2015 to build \u201ca deeper and fairer Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)\u201d and achieve a \u201ctriple A social Europe\u201d. It consists of 20 key principles and rights covering equal opportunities and access to the labour market, fair working conditions and social protection and inclusion. NEWS from the EESC Europe III Without social rights, backed by a sound and sustainable economic basis, the future of Europe will be at stake A delegation of members of the EESC took part in the high-level social summit in Gothenburg on 17 November to voice the EESC\u2019s support for the European Pillar of Social Rights (EPSR), in line with the Committee\u2019s active and important contribution to the discussion about the future of Europe and its social dimension. At the summit, the EPSR was jointly proclaimed by the European Parlia- ment, the Council and the Commission. Representing the voice of organised civil society in the EU, the EESC highlight- ed the pressing need for a strong and sustainable social dimension of the EU, which is, together with economic growth, a prerequisite for securing the EU\u2019s future. Luca Jahier , President of the Various Interests Group, highlighted that: \u201cWe have to build a European Union which is sustainable and cares for all, including its most vulnerable citizens. Implementing the EPSR through the European Semester could be a first step in this process. I am also particularly disappointed that the draft Proclamation on the EPSR does not mention neither civil society, nor the important contribution of the social economy to future transitions in our welfare systems and services. The future of work and the transition to Work 4.0 will have to be accompanied by a parallel transition to Welfare 4.0 and it is civil society which will drive this process.\u201d The Gothenburg summit, co-hosted by Commission President Jean- Claude Juncker and Swedish Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven, gathered heads of state, the social partners and representatives of the EU institutions for a discussion on how to promote fair jobs and growth in the future. The EESC took part in the Gothenburg social summit in a show of support for the European Pillar of Social Rights Aachen University and a start-up company two new factories were built that are manufacturing 20 000 electrical cars annually for parcel delivery. A logistics company manufacturing cars because car-makers won\u2019t meet its needs: is this an upside-down world? No, more likely evidence that transformation takes place from the bottom up rather than the top down. Incidentally, Ford has just offered to help out, cit- ing its expertise in making cars. It is a shame that the role played by citizens was not as visible at the COP as it needs and ought to be. After all in Germany over 50% of all emissions-free power generation capacity is owned by private indi- viduals, land-owners, associations and SMEs. So it is true to say that here too energy transition has so far been a grassroots movement, under the motto \u201ccitizens\u2019 energy\u201d. The advantage is that by producing electricity from renewables, citizens are combining practical climate protection measures with regional development. And people also en- joy making an active contribution. This applies not just in Europe, but in other parts of the world too. COP visitors were impressed by Indonesia\u2019s demonstration that for in- stance it is economically fea- sible to develop a new elec- tricity supply infrastructure on small islands based solely on decentralised renewable energies. Green electricity has long been recognised in Indonesia as a precondition for any degree of economic development. The COP held a mirror up to reality. Across the planet, ordinary people are taking control themselves, when they are allowed to and are given the means. It is they, not politicians, who are the real climate champi- ons. Citizens want to change this world for the better and do not want to watch it being destroyed by today\u2019s profit-seeking interests. But unfortunately politics often confounds this trend: through red tape, market barriers or public funding that flows to large-scale projects rather than local opportunities for action. Consequently initiatives are often hampered rather than promoted, generating disappointment and frustration. \u201cAllow us to act\u201d was a recurring theme at the COP, and is a watchword that the EESC should itself embrace. >> ",
        "Cillian LOHAN (IE) Green Economy Foundation Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group Following a request of the European Commission (EC), the EESC participated in this debate, basing its contribution on a number of consultations on the national level. In this respect, the EESC held in May and June 2017, national debates in 27 Member States with the aim of hearing the views of the civil society organisations on the five scenarios proposed in the White Paper of the EC on the Future of Europe. The compilation of the national reports was officially handed over by the President of the EESC, Mr Georges Dassis, to the President of the EC, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, on 21 September 2017 during the EESC Plenary session. The compilation of the national reports is available: in FR: http://www.eesc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/resources/ docs/livre-blanc_avenir-de-leurope_compilation-fr.pdf in EN: http://www.eesc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/resources/ docs/white-paper-on-the-future-of-europe---compilation---en.pdf The national consultations are also available on the EESC\u2019s website here: http://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/policies/in-focus/future-europe/ national-debates We hope that these documents will be the basis to widen and deepen even further the debate on the future of Europe among the civil society at both the national and European level. Enjoy the reading! The European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform, as proposed by the EESC continues to progress at a rapid pace. Following a successful launch at a two day event early this year, the structures and terms of reference have now been set. The next big meeting of the Platform will be early next year, probably February. As envisioned, a Coordination Group has been established comprising rep- resentatives from all sectors. All call for expressions of interest in this was launched over the summer with 24 places available. In a measure of the lev- el of interest in this process, and a reflection of the need for such a Platform, we had almost 200 applications for the positions. The first meeting of the Coordination Group on November 22 nd was a huge success, and chaired by EESC\u2019s Group III representative, Cillian Lohan. You may recall this is a joint initiative with the other EU institutions, primarily the Commission as represented by DG GROW and DG ENV. The EESC team has worked hard to ensure that the ownership of the Platform rests with the stakeholders and that the objectives of delivering best practices, and identifying obstacles to transition are met. To this end an interactive website has just been launched and can be found at http://circulareconomy.europa.eu/platform . The members of the Coordination Group (which is balanced across sectors, gender and geography) can be found on the website along with the Terms of Reference and Structure of the Platform. There has been much hard work to get to this point, and strong engagement and leadership will now be required to ensure that the establishment of the Platform is instrumental in delivering progress on the Circular Economy Action Plan. The team of members working together to advance the Platform are Cillian Lohan (Group III) Peter Schmidt (Group II) and Bernd Dittman (Group I). A big thank you to all members who have helped to promote this stakeholder group and ensured such a strong level of engagement from across member states. The EESC is actively engaged in the current debate on the Future of Europe in order to contribute in shaping the future for the European Union.

        "Chaired by Silvia Costa, an Italian Socialist deputy, the event highlighted the fact that globally, some 3 billion people are affected by extreme pover- ty and in the EU this amounts to one in four people at risk of poverty. A more worrying figure is that according to statistics Eurostat figures published in 2015; http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/ index.php/Children_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion some 26.9% of children experience poverty compared with 24.7% of adults and 17.4% of elderly (above 65). On their own, these figures represent an ap- palling failure of EU policy in tackling poverty and marginilastion. Sadly, following the financial recession, the trend is not expected to decrease in the foreseeable future. The Eurostat report identifies a number of factors that contribute to these figures. They include; households where there is undue de- pendency on low wage employment, single parents with dependent children, extremely low levels of education and of course the situa- tion of migrants and homeless families. The consequences for families locked into a continual poverty cycle are far reaching. People in poverty suffer disproportionally from poorer health conditions, which in turn are triggered by poor housing access or none at all. They access less education opportunities and often drop out at an early age. Families from ethnic minorities are also at risk. Many of them become forced migrants. Hence the horrific scenes of people begging for basic supports from neighboring countries, who themselves are locked in their own internal political combat as to whether migrants should be allowed entry in the first place. For the millions affected by pov- erty, particularly children, there is a constant daily catalogue of experiences which are continually demeaning and humiliating to the point where for them there is no European union; there is no political entity that they can reach out to. Indeed, their experience is one which firmly identifies the EU as part of the root cause of their situation. A situation with no end in sight. It is generally accepted that the EU as an entity is perhaps the largest world peace project in existence. It would be foolish to ignore the progress made since its foundation. Progress on rights, social welfare and a range of meas- ures designed to introduce equality measures that improve the lives of all European citizens have been made. However, it is acknowledged by all that the failure of Euro 2020 strategy to reduce the figures tells a story that is in- herently sad and in the long term extremely dangerous in terms of the long term stability of the union. Indeed, the Union by failing to take the problem seriously is consigning children to live in a manner that will force them into crime, in some cases prostitution or live shortened lives caused by poor or no real access to essential health care. It should be noted that the Estonian Presidency has highlighted the plight of all people affected by poverty. Clyde Kull, Estonia\u2019s deputy permanent representative to the EU, said his country - current holder of the EU Council presidency; \u201cThe goal should be to empower people and our presi- dency welcomes adoption of the European Pillar of Social Rights. The aim now is to ensure that this is signed off by the end of this year and implemented.\u201d He went on to say that \u201cThe basic right of citizens to a dig- nified life must be respected.\u201d On October 17 th , UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, S\u00e9amus Boland represented the EESC at a meeting in EU Parliament. The EESC has contributed to the development the work on the European Pillar of Social rights and The Future of Europe. Group Three members, in particular has produced a plethora of opinions on the issues related to pov- erty; all of them highlighting the frustrations felt by civil society and all of them seeking the EU Commission and the various institutions to initiate real reform. Indeed, the EU parliament itself has also been to the forefront in this area. Yet we have failure on a grand scale. In environmental work Poverty is one of the main seventeen goals for sus- tainability. Yet implementation of these goals is hampered by the fact that measures to alleviate short term poverty caused by change are usually omitted from these plans. It is clear that the strong legislative teeth are missing from all of the high goals articulated by the commission. The 25% of the EU population affected by poverty are amazed at the speed in which EU institutions move when the banking system is in danger or the Euro needs assis- tance. That is not to say they are displeased with such speed. However; the lack of real actions following the launch of The Future of Europe or the Social Pillar of Social Rights demonstrates to people that the EU really doesn\u2019t care enough. Otherwise the target of eradicating poverty would have moved by now; downwards. The EESC has advocated \u201cthe creation of an in- tegrated European fund to combat poverty and social exclusion, based on experience to date of the implementation of the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) and the European Social Fund (ESF)\u201d Furthermore, it has stated that \u201cthe intervention of such a fund should make full use of the experience and capacity of civil society organisations by granting them a leading role in programming, implementation, moni- toring and evaluation\u201d In other opinions we have recommended changes in the way we look at minimum pay, supports to people and families who because of circum- stances are no longer able to work, greater access to real vocational ed- ucation, supports to family businesses and proper investment strategies aimed at tackling a range of social infrastructure that forces people into rather than out of poverty. Indeed, the lack of any serious attempt to pover- ty proof decisions made at Commission level and by member governments ensures a climate that by default perpetuates the growth of poverty, par- ticularly among communities who have been living in situations of long term economic and social disadvantage. In the last ten years the EU has been immersed in a series of crisis. Yet it seems oblivious to the fact that the crises of poverty figures now at its high- est number since its foundation continues to be ignored. Let\u2019s think about it. 29.6% of our children are currently affected by poverty. And that\u2019s not a crisis?

        "On 26 October 2017, the newly sworn-in Dutch cabinet \u2013 the third Rutte cabinet \u2013 posed with the king on the steps of his working palace. It had been 225 days since the parliamentary elections on 15 March this year, the longest it had ever taken to form a cabinet in the Netherlands. And this is a trend that is not limited to the Netherlands, looking at a number of other European countries. Why did it take so long, what kind of cabinet ultimately came out of it, and what are that cabinet\u2019s plans for Europe? I will give a brief overview of those questions here. The most important reason it took so long is that today\u2019s electorate is very fragmented. In the Netherlands, which has proportional rep- resentation and no electoral threshold, this resulted in a Lower House with 13 different parties, of which the smallest has two seats and the largest (Prime Minister Rutte\u2019s VVD) has 33. Following the elections, it took several weeks to establish which parties were compatible and were prepared to give up on some of their own policies in order to form a cabinet with parties with different opinions. It turned out to be four parties with a total of 76 of the 150 seats in the Lower House \u2013 i.e. the smallest possible majority. Those four parties are the VVD (right-wing liberal), the CDA (Christian conservative), D66 (progressive liberal) and the CU. The CU (Christen- Unie) is a party that is somewhat harder to categorise. On climate and environmental issues, for example (with the exception of agriculture), it can be regarded as progressive, but on questions of medical ethics such as embryo selection and euthanasia it is a conservative party. After months of talks, lunches, adjournments, bilateral meetings, etc., they had reached a decision: the four parties had a coalition agreement, and had found 23 people willing to be ministers or state secretaries un- der Prime Minister Rutte. The coalition agreement reflects the diversity of the four parties. It is conservative on questions of medical ethics, very accom- modating to the interests of big business in particular, and strongly worded when it comes to climate policy objectives. Un- fortunately, though, the new cabinet\u2019s proposed climate pol- icy has since been costed by the government\u2019s paymasters, and it turns out that the policy set out in the coalition agreement will only be able to achieve a maximum of half of the objec- tives. It will be interesting to see how that works out in the months to come. The parties are vocally pro-Europe \u2013 the coalition agreement states: \u201cEurope brings peace, security, safety and prosperity to the Nether- lands. Apart from being an economic community, the European Union is a community of values in which the Netherlands feels at home. Jus- tice and liberty are central. In the European review of the Union\u2019s role, of foremost importance is the fact that the Netherlands is inextricably linked to the EU. There are important issues where the EU should play a more active role because the Netherlands cannot achieve objectives alone. Migration, climate change and cross-border crime are examples.\u201d But fine words are often easier said than done, as it is also crucial that the ministers who have to put those words into practice actually want to do so \u2013 and will actually do it. The cabinet has a number of new faces, and it is not yet clear how these new people will develop politically. At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (which is so important for the EU), we have an interesting duo. The new Minister for Foreign Affairs is Halbe Zijlstra, the former leader of the VVD. In the past, he has often described trade policy as the heart of foreign policy, disregarding the Dutch tra- dition of promoting good governance and protecting human rights. At the same ministry, Sigrid Kaag (D66) has been appointed Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation. She also has internation- al environment and climate policy and the Sustainable Development Goals in her portfolio. And she has a very different background: she was a top diplomat for the United Nations, working inter alia for the United Nations Development Programme and then in Syria and Lebanon, and, as such, lived in Beirut until recently. In short, we are entering an exciting political period with a tiny majority in parliament, an open-ended coalition agreement and an interesting mix of government members, but it is nonetheless clear that the EU will enjoy the support of this cabinet. We will review the situation in a year\u2019s time.

        "Group III Members in the Spotlight playing a key role Luca JAHIER (IT) President of the Various Interests\u2019 Group ESPAS CONFERENCE GLOBAL TRENDS TO 2030: The Making of a New Geopolitical Order? On 22-23 November 2017, this landmark conference brought together a select community of global foresight practitioners and strategists to explore the latest and most pressing trends shaping geopolitics in the coming decade. Together, the aim was to shed light on pressing issues such as the future of multilateralism, new challenges to Europe\u2019s security outlook, and how governments and international institutions can thrive in an increasingly uncertain and volatile world. The rolling programme of the conference covered two-days. The first day was hosted by the European Political Strategy Centre, the European Com- mission\u2019s in-house think tank, at its headquarters, the Berlaymont. The second day took place in the library of the European Parliament and was hosted by the European Parliamentary Research Service, the Parliament\u2019s own think tank. President Luca JAHIER participated in the panel on \u2018The Geopolitics of an Economically Interdependent World\u2019. Below is an extract from his speech: \u201cNowhere is the complexity of our interdependent world as evident as in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Nowhere are the stakes so high, so finite and so important for the future of our world. In no other field are we called upon to literally imagine a new world, to use our human creativity, innovation and determination to transform accepted global models of development. Taking risks, embracing change and put- ting opportunities before problems is at the heart of an interdependent sustainable world in 2030 and beyond. \u201c \u201cHow to implement the UN Agenda 2030 is a profoundly political debate and necessitates a paradigm shift. Away from accustomed definitions of GDP-based economic growth and towards a new definition of prosperity based on well-being. It is the concept of beyond GDP, social inclusion, soci- etal happiness, environmental responsibility and democratic participation, which are at the heart of sustainable development. They define the type of society that we aspire to. They also require a new development model based on innovation, new consumption patterns and models of behaviour. However, we will only be able to design this new world if we work trans- parently in partnership. A new global governance model is necessary, to be driven by bottom-up initiatives by local and regional authorities, civil soci- ety organisations and citizens. Young people in particular should be made partners in change. We will only be able to deliver the UN 2030 Agenda by building trust, decentralising governance to local actors and empower- ing citizens to create their own sustainable solutions. As His Holiness Pope Francis stated in his Encyclical letter on the environment, the protection of \u201c\u2026our common goods.. (will) require a new and universal solidarity\u201d. Panagiotis GKOFAS (EL) Hellenic Confederation of Professionals, Craftsmen and Merchants (GSEVEE) Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group The benefits of migrant entrepreneurship in Europe Group III member Panagotis Gkofas participated in the roundtable discussion organised by UNITEE \u2018Homo Faber: the benefits of migrant entrepreneurship in Europe\u2019. The EU has been engulfed, in the past years, into a series of crises that have put into question its survival itself: from the economic crisis, to the migra- tion crisis, up to a widening gap between the North and the South, Europe is going through a deep rethinking of its identity and political situation. In all this, migrant entrepreneurship has slowly started to be acknowledged as a potential solution at different levels. Indeed, migrant entrepreneurship not only is an instrument of economic growth, in as much as it created new jobs; it also provides a powerful vector of social and economic integration for individuals who would otherwise remain at the margins of society. Furthermore, diversity can foster increased innovation, as research has shown in numerous occasions. Finally, it contributes to reduce the impact of migration and the cost of integration into European society. Pavel TRANTINA (CZ) Czech Council of Children and Youth President SOC section Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group Young people are worse off than older generations in today\u2019s labour market Active ageing, investing in education and developing the right skills among main solutions for future-proof Europe Despite a record high number of people in employment and continued economic growth in the EU, young Europeans today face less stable career prospects, less social security and worse living standards than older gener- ations. This makes intergenerational fairness one of the top political prior- ities, a conference held at the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) revealed. The high-level conference entitled \u201cReview of Employment and Social Developments in Europe: Intergenerational Fairness and Solidarity\u201d, held in Brussels on 10 October, was co-organised by the EESC\u2019s Labour Market Observatory (LMO) and the European Commission\u2019s DG for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. Its goal was to hear the views of EESC members, social partners and oth- er civil society organisations as well as government representatives about the findings of the 2017 Employment and Social Developments in Europe (ESDE) review, published by the Commission in July 2017. The ESDE review, which annually presents key employment and social issues for the EU and its Member States, confirmed positive labour Guntram Wolff (Bruegel), Mary Kaldor (LSE), Eva Kaili (MEP), Daniel Gros (European Policy Studies), Luca Jahier (EESC) ",
        "Group III Members in the Spotlight playing a key role market and social trends, highlighting the unprecedented number of 234.2 million people in employment in the EU and the 7.8% unemployment rate at EU level - the lowest level since 2008. But the review also showed that young people were at a disadvantage compared to prime-age and older workers. Despite having better educa- tion than their parents or grandparents, young Europeans face difficulties in entering the labour market and are more at risk of precarious work, such as part-time or temporary contracts. This in turn makes them more vulnerable on the labour market, as they have lower job tenure and are less protected by welfare systems or collec- tive agreements. As a result, they tend to postpone important life decisions such as starting a family. \u201cThis review shows a generational divide in the labour market. Member States, the European institutions, social partners and civil society organi- sations share a responsibility to work for a future-proof Europe,\u201d said Pavel Trantina, the president of the EESC\u2019s Section on Employment, Social Af- fairs and Citizenship. The Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mo- bility, Marianne Thyssen, stated that \u201cintergenerational fairness and soli- darity is one of the big challenges that policy-makers face today\u201d. \u201cWe have to ensure fairness between generations and the sustainability of our social model,\u201d she added.

The Congress took the form of a series of thematic meetings over the course of 2017 (Description of the social economy in Por- tugal; The social economy satellite account / 2013; The social economy and relations with the State; The social economy, new concepts and models for organisation and governance ; The social economy - for and with people) and concluded with a closing session held on 14 November. The initiative generated a high level of mobilisation, with more than two thousand par- ticipants in all. During the Session, a wide-ranging dis- cussion was held on national and inter- national issues of relevance to the social economy in Portugal. Miguel \u00c1ngel Cabra de Luna, together with other social economy representatives, took part on behalf of the European Economic and Social Committee in a round table on \u201cThe challenges of the social economy\u201d. A Letter of Commitment was also signed to set up a Portuguese Social Economy Confederation under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the European Union. This step is intended to signal the vitality of the social economy sector in Portugal. Luca JAHIER (IT) President of the Various Interests\u2019 Group Let\u2019s work together on EU Dialogues European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans partici- pated in last EESC Plenary Session. In his speech at the EESC\u2019s October plenary session, Vice-President Timmer- mans pointed out that even though the economic climate in Europe was better than it used to be, many people were still dissatisfied. The reasons for this were the increasing disparities within European society as well as the loss of control over our destinies, both collectively and individually. \u201cThe only way I believe that we can, with reason and not just by symbolic ges- tures, fulfil the promise of convergence, the only way I honestly believe we can portray the vision of a society where people regain control over their destinies individually and collectively, is if we tackle problems that are of a global nature together as Europeans on a European scale\u201d , said Timmermans. \u201cThe need for collective European action today is greater than ever before. It is about time we acted together.\u201d Using the opportunities of the circular economy and the Digital Single Market, creating an Energy Union and building a strong So- cial Pillar were some of the things the Commission was planning to focus on in 2018. Luca Jahier, President of the Various Interests\u2019 Group, welcomed the 300 Citizens\u2019 Dialogues organised by the Com- mission in 27 Members States but stressed the need to go further. \u201cThe EESC can become an im- portant ally of the Com- mission, working in partnership on the EU Dialogues.\u201d On the Sustainable Development Goals, Luca Jahier stated that \u201cit is our responsibility to deliver the 2030 Agenda and to lead by example, with a coordinated and systematic approach which includes sustainable development in all EU programmes, pol- icies, actions and financial instruments\u201d. Background: The EESC adopted its contribution to the Commission\u2019s 2018 Work Programme on 5 July. The Committee called on the Commission to adopt sustainable development as an overarching approach to its work, making reference to the three \u201cpillars\u201d of sustainability: i) strengthening the economic foundations of Europe; ii) fostering its social dimension; and iii) facilitating the transition towards a low-carbon and circular economy. The EESC made detailed recom- mendations and proposals for action structured around six priority policy areas: \u2022 further development of the single market; \u2022 promotion of entrepreneurship, innovation and industrial de- velopment; \u2022 the social dimension of the EU; \u2022 focusing public finances on sustainable growth, innovation, employment and cohesion; \u2022 protecting Europeans against security threats; \u2022 and the development of a structured civil dialogue.

        "Group III Members in the Spotlight playing a key role Dilyana SLAVOVA (BG) National Association \u201cMountain Milk\u201d Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group President of REX section In the end of October REX organised a joint seminar of the EU-Japan Fol- low-up Committee and the International Trade Follow-up Committee to examine the significance of the EU-Japan EPA in the global context for free trade agreements and geo-economic interests on both sides and to reflect on the role that civil society can play in the implementation of the future agreement. An agreement in princi- ple was reached in July 2017 in the negotia- tions for the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement. The details of the agreement need still to be fleshed out and some chapters are still open such as invest- ment protection, data and some aspects of regulatory cooperation, in oth- er chapters details need to be fine-tuned. This process will probably take some months and it is possible that the final conclusion, ratification and eventual entry into force will require more than a year. However, since the start of the negotiations in 2013, the global trading context has changed significantly with the US decision by the USA not to ratify the Transpacific Partnership Agreement (TPP), for example, or the impact on Japanese com- petitiveness of the Free Trade Agreement between the EU and the Republic of Korea, which has been in force since 2007, and the potential impact of the other FTAs the EU is currently negotiating or has recently concluded with countries in Japan\u2019s neighbourhood. Consequently, the rationale for reaching this agreement has changed, too. This changing political context probably played a role in bringing about this agreement in principle. By concluding it, the EU and Japan sent a strong signal of commitment to free trade, open markets and rules-based international exchanges. In this rather complex and dynamic overall context, a number of chapters in the future EU-Japan Agreement have proved particularly strenuous, such as negotiations on non-tariff barriers, agricultural market access, pub- lic procurement, investment protection, geographical indications or data flows. Furthermore, from a civil society point of view, the European Eco- nomic and Social Committee (EESC) would have liked to see the EU-Japan negotiations benefitting from the same level of transparency as the TTIP negotiations. This was not the case; the texts of some of the EU proposals were published only shortly before the end of negotiations. Thus, civil so- ciety was not in position to comment on the content of the EU proposals during the negotiations. The publication of the Agreement in principle and the agreement of the Council to publish the mandate for the EU-Japan ne- gotiations, now provide an opportunity to civil society to comment on the agreement and to assess in advance the opportunities and challenges for its implementation. Moreover, civil society must take the opportunity to reflect and prepare for the monitoring of the agreement and set up of the Domestic Advisory Groups foreseen in the chapter on Trade and Sustainable Development. Benedicte FEDERSPIEL (DK) Consumer Council Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group Krzysztof PATER (PL) Polish Scouting and Guiding Association Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group During the seminar organised by the EESC on Thursday 26 October, civil society organisations agreed on the geo-strategic importance of the free trade agreement between the EU and Japan, and on its positive impact for the two economies, but some of the organisations deplored the lack of transparency in the negotiations with regard to public opinion. \u201cUnlike TTIP (the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership), these nego- tiations have not been raised to the attention of the public opinion\u201d , the chair of the EESC follow-up committee for international trade, Benedicte Feder- spiel, stated. The president of the Japan follow-up committee at the EESC, Krzysztof Pa- ter, underlined the need to involve civil society closely in the monitoring and implementation of the agreement, by setting up a civil society domes- tic advisory group (DAG) as soon as possible after the agreement\u2019s entry into force. He also noted that throughout the negotiations, excellent work- ing relations have been built between the EESC and its Japanese counter- part organisations, which would be a good starting point for cooperation under the agreement. The Japanese ambas- sador to the European Union, Kazuo Kodama, underlined the eco- nomic, but also strate- gic, importance of the EU-Japan free trade agreement, which has been very positively received by most Japa- nese stakeholders.

        "Group III Members in the Spotlight playing a key role Renate HEINISCH (DE) Federal Association of German Senior Citizens\u2019 Organisations Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group From the ruins of the Second World War to the European Union\u2019s digital future On 22 October 2017 in the Casino-Kino Aschaffenburg, Ernst Schulten of Aschaffenburg University, and the chair of the Europa-Union in Aschaffenburg, Dieter Schornick, held the latest in their series of Europe- themed events in cooperation with the Main-Echo newspaper and the adult education centre (VHS) for an engaged audience of 70 young and young-at-heart Europeans. Ernst Schulten, head of the Career Service at Aschaffenburg University, was the overall host of the event, entitled \u201cFrom the ruins of the Second World War to the European Union\u2019s digital future \u2013 a thrilling 80-year journey\u201d. Dieter Schornick introduced and moderated the panel discussion, which began with Ursula Schleicher \u2013 former vice-president of the European Parliament \u2013 and Renate Heinisch, Group III member, giving their striking and moving recollections of their childhood experiences of the Second World War and how these experiences continue to mark them to this day. Dieter Schornick spoke about his professional experiences as a German living in Europe and Australia. Alexandra Angress, a Europe specialist and lecturer at Aschaffenburg University, gave an enthusiastic account of the EU education programme Erasmus+ and spoke about its advantages. During a discussion with the audience, Ursula Schleicher, Renate Heinisch and Dieter Schornick explained how the EU institutions worked and how they were directly involved in many EU legislative processes. Renate Heinisch continues to play an active role right across the EU as part of the EESC, an institution, little known among the general public, that reflects the whole of society. Within the EESC, she represents the interests of older people, who need to be taken into account when new EU laws are drawn up. For Alexandra Angress, success stories like Erasmus+ \u2013 especially at times like these \u2013 provide a counterweight, upholding European values such as tolerance, openness and solidarity and bringing young people together. More than 9 million Erasmus participants (including 3 million students alone) have benefited from the programme, creating numerous friendships, as well as young European families. She noted, however, that even more money had to be invested in EU education programmes such as Erasmus+ in future so that even more young people in Europe could benefit from these opportunities. Emily Fella spoke forcefully about how young people yearned for European idols like Emmanuel Macron who advocated a renaissance of the European idea, thereby reigniting the enthusiasm of Europe\u2019s young people. The question was asked, with some concern, about how to communicate EU values such as democracy, peace, freedom and tolerance to less educated social groups so as to counteract nationalist tendencies. Better education, the courage to engage in dialogue and more efforts to bring about an equitable society were some of the approaches that were mentioned. Miguel \u00c1ngel CABRA DE LUNA (ES) Spanish Confederation of Social Economy Enterprises Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group Promoting the EU\u2019s investment plan for the social sector This event was held jointly by the European Association of Service Providers for People with Disabilities (EASPD) and Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE, and was hosted in Madrid by the Representation of the European Commission in Spain. The aim of the event was to promote the EU\u2019s Investment Plan for the social sector in Spain and to publicise the EFSI, which is an initiative that has been launched with the support of the European Investment Bank Group (EIB) and the European Commission. The event brought together various inves- tors and social sector bodies. Miguel Angel Cabra de Luna, a member of EESC Group III, pointed out that \u201cin many European countries the social economy accounts for around 10% of GDP and employment and is also a sector that is particularly sensitive when it comes to integrating disadvantaged groups. It therefore seems log- ical that the disability movement should afford it particular attention\u201d. He also observed that \u201cone of our aims is to raise awareness of this issue among public authorities, both at national and European levels, as they can help to create a favourable environment.\u201d The event brought together social sector bodies and investors to assess the opportunities that the EU\u2019s Investment Plan \u2013 and other European invest- ment programmes \u2013 could provide to the sector at national level. Other participants included: Alberto Barrag\u00e1n, director of the European Invest- ment Bank\u2019s office in Spain; Carmen Comos, Director of CEPES; Eduardo Baamonde, president of Cajamar-Caja Rural; and representatives of the Third Sector Platform and the Spanish Association of Foundations. Victor ALISTAR (RO) Transparency International Romania Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group The preventive role of judiciary in protecting the financial interest of the European Union Transparency International Romania, in partnership with the EESC, organ- ised an event of the report and policy paper on \u201cThe preventive role of judi- ciary in protecting the financial interest of the European Union\u201d. The event took place on Wednesday, 29 November 2017 at the EESC. The debate covered following topics: \u2022 Importance of fighting corruption in the private sector in order to en- sure the effectiveness and efficiency of public invest-ments. \u2022 Results of the research and conclusions of the comparative analysis on the actual judicial practice on regarding the applica-tion on additional sanction \u2013 exclusion from public procurement and its estimated impact on protecting the financial inter-ests of the EU. \u2022 Recommendation of the policy paper to enhance the role of judiciary in protecting the financial interests of the Union by con-solidating its practice and using it as a basis for exclusion systems. This event was organized as part of a project supported by the European Commission through the European Union Programme Hercule III (2014- 2020). The project aims at raising awareness among judicial professionals regarding their role in protecting the financial interests of the Union, by developing high profile comparative research activities regarding the ap- plication of a specific judicial protection instrument - exclusion from public procurement as an additional sanction provided by the criminal law.

        "Group III Members in the Spotlight playing a key role Alfred GAJDOSIK (AT) Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft VIDA Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group REX/487 - EU development partnerships and the challenge posed by international tax agreements The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) supports a develop- ment policy that sees development as a process carried out between countries on equal terms, based on respect and sovereign decisions. Financing and im- plementing sustainable development goals (SDGs) agreed at United Nations (UN) level requires globally coordinated efforts. The EESC would point out that the UN\u2019s Economic and Social Council could play an even stronger role as a suitable forum for dealing with tax matters. This would ensure both the gear- ing of Agenda 2030 to the SDGs and the participation of all countries on an equal footing. The EESC warmly welcomes the fact that the European Union (EU) and its Member States have made considerable efforts in the context of international reform to address the weaknesses of the international tax system. These ef- forts are welcome and need to be supported and implemented effectively and then subject to regular monitoring. The EESC calls for coherence to be ensured between Member States\u2019 interna- tional taxation policies and the objectives of development policies, so as to avoid conflicts between individual countries\u2019 taxation policies and joint devel- opment priorities. Cristian PIRVULESCU (RO) Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group REX/494 - Exchanging and protecting personal data in a globalised world The opinion stresses that the EU has a responsibility to become a global ac- tor in promoting respect for fundamental rights and adequate protection of private life and personal data and encourages the European Commission to be pro-active at bilateral and multilateral level in promoting the highest standard of personal data protection. In this sense, the EESC finds well-balanced and reasonable the four key cri- teria outlined in the Communication to be taken into account by the Com- mission when assessing the countries with which a dialogue on adequacy should be pursued. However, it finds important to interpret these criteria in the light of a real commitment on the part of the governments, parliaments, and courts in these countries to reach an equivalent and functional level of personal data protection and calls for more transparency and civil society participation in the process of granting adequacy decisions. Vitas MACIULIS (LT) Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group TEN/639 - Interoperability of Electronic Road Toll System The EESC strongly supports the European Commission\u2019s proposal on the in- teroperability of electronic road toll systems. Such road toll systems have al- ready been introduced at national, regional or local level in 20 Member States. However, the poor interoperability of the systems at international level incurs considerable revenue losses for Member States, as well as additional costs for direct road users. The EESC encourages Member States to pursue active cross-border cooperation when developing advanced road tolling mecha- nisms. A lack of cooperation means that Member States have no way of identi- fying specific offenders if their vehicles are registered abroad. The EESC is strongly convinced that every possible effort should be made to introduce a uniform electronic road toll system throughout the EU, based on advanced technology. Therefore the on-board unit (OBU), which is the key component in an electronic toll system, need not be a single physical device. It could be a number of physically or remotely linked devices, including smart phones and tablets, which together perform the functions of an OBU. The EESC recommends encouraging the development of special IT applications for these purposes, which would significantly reduce costs for road users.

Dilyana SLAVOVA (BG) National Association \u201cMountain Milk\u201d Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group President REX section NAT/699 - Ex post evaluation of rural development programmes 2007-2013 The EESC has found the rural development policy to be one of the most wel- come EU policies. RDPs boosted regional development, stimulated econom- ic growth and job creation and succeeded to transform the situation of the countryside across the EU. A lack of coordination, complementariness and consistency with the actions of the other structural and cohesion funds (Social Fund, Regional Develop- ment Fund, etc.) in rural areas hindered the overall aim of a more balanced territorial development. Future RDPs should focus on vulnerable EU areas in order to achieve a better balance between rural and urban areas. At its plenary session on 18\u201319 October 2017 the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) adopted the following opinions for which Group III members were Rapporteurs or Co-Rapporteurs. Lutz RIBBE (DE) EURONATUR Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group SC/047 - The transition towards a more sustainable European future \u2013 a strategy for 2050 Like all other parts of the world, Europe is facing three major issues: (1) the depletion of the earth\u2019s natural resources, (2) social inequalities; and (3) public loss of trust in the political establishment. These three issues need to be un- derstood against the background of digitalisation, and globalisation. Based on a thorough analysis of the interplay between these issues and digitalisation, the EESC calls on the Commission to prepare a long-term strategy for Europe\u2019s sustainable development. This opinion aims to put forward issues and input to be considered in the preparation of the long-term strategy. First, this opinion analyses the positive and negative societal and economic impacts of digitalisation. Second, the implications of planetary limitations and the overall ecological challenge are discussed. Third, the opinion pre- sents figures related to social inequality, followed by an analysis of the loss of public support in governments and international institutions. It is critical - ly important that the strategy encompass precise policy recommendations to help address the three major challenges that Europe faces and so make \u201cthe Europe we want\u201d a reality. Part 5 of the opinion sets out recommenda- tions for the future in four policy sectors, each of which consists of key six elements: innovation, regulation/governance, social policy, open access, ed- ucation/training and research a fair, digital and green economy, new forms of govern- ance, sustainability and the financial sec- tor, promoting sustain- ability through inter- national trade.

        "Carlos TRIAS PINT\u00d3 (ES) Spanish Union of Consumer Cooperatives Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group SC/048 - New sustainable economic models The traditional market system is competing with the emergence of a multitude of new models that are transforming the relationship between producers, dis- tributors and consumers. In addition to economic returns, some of these new models seek (or claim) to address other key challenges for people and the planet that are crucial for sustainable development, such as social justice, par- ticipatory governance, the conservation of resources and natural capital. This Opinion makes 10 recommendations on the following areas: 1. Improving coordination of action for the sustainable economy within the EU, by creating a permanent body for the new sustaina-ble economy; 2. The public authorities of the EU should support research, including re- sponsible research and innovation; 3. The EU must encourage and support education, training and information provision to improve understanding among all stake-holders of the new sustainable economic models and of the role of sustainable finance; 4. The Commission should analyse and complement (but not replace) pri- vate initiatives for the exchange of good practice and expe-rience be- tween innovators; 5. The public authorities of the EU must ensure that the developers of new genuinely sustainable economic models have access to finance during the initial phases of development and as they continue to grow. Antonio LONGO (IT) Defence of the Citizen Movement (MDC) Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group INT/828 - Digital Single Market: Mid-term review The EESC supports the Commission\u2019s proposals but voices its concern at delays in the adoption and implementation of the 35 actions and legislative initia- tives submitted. It also stresses the need to strengthen the social dimension of the digital single market strategy and hopes the EU will launch a major plan for digital educa- tion and training, providing everyone with the cognitive tools they need to cope with the transition. In the EESC\u2019s view, social dialogue can play a key role in this process and it calls on the Commission, together with the social partners, to set the ball rolling by exploring the medium- and long-term prospects and identifying robust strategies to guarantee decent wages, good jobs, a sound work-life balance and widespread access to social security. The infrastructure and cultural digital divide must be closed as soon as possible. Pavel TRANTINA (CZ) Czech Council of Children and Youth Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group President SOC section SOC/566 \u2013 European Solidarity Corps The EESC: \u2022 welcomes the European Commission\u2019s proposal, recognising it as a good start for a broader discussion, but with a lot of ele-ments to clarify and im- prove; \u2022 is satisfied that some of the priorities that were highlighted by the civil so- ciety organisations in the various stakeholder con-sultations organised by the Commission were included in the legal basis; \u2022 considers that the added value of the ESC projects lies in the fact that they seek to establish among participants and the com-munities hosting them a full awareness of European citizenship and a sense of belonging to one Union; \u2022 asks for more \u201cfresh money\u201d to be invested in the programme; \u2022 is very concerned about the merging of the ESC goals with those of youth employment policies; it therefore suggests that the inclusion of job and traineeship placements in the programme should be reconsidered. Roomet S\u00d5RMUS (EE) Estonian Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group NAT/713 - Land use for sustainable food production and ecosystem services The rapporteur underlines the need to establish an EU reference framework aimed at protecting agricultural land. A joint EU soil protection strategy de- fining good soil status, laying down uniform terminology and harmonised criteria for monitoring, and defining priority policy measures would be of decisive impor- tance for the sustainable use and protection of agricultural soil.

        "Cillian LOHAN (IE) Green Economy Foundation Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group NAT/712 - Climate Justice Climate Justice is typically viewed in a global context of spatial and temporal interdependence and recognises that the most vulnerable and poorest in so- ciety often suffer the greatest impact of the effects of climate change, despite these people being the least responsible for the emissions that have driven the climate crisis. Climate Justice recognises the need to consider the fairness of the often disproportionate impact of climate change on citizens and com- munities. The EESC believes that citizens have a right to a healthy, clean environ- ment, and to expect gov- ernments to take action on the drivers and threats of climate change. Production and con- sumption systems must change to adapt to and to mitigate climate change. Sustainable food con- sumption must start at the upstream stage of soil preparation and manage- ment of natural systems in order to provide the primary building blocks for food, thus the EESC highlights the need for a Soil Framework Directive. Consumers need sustainable ethical alternatives that will not reduce the con- venience or quality of services or their accessibility. New economic models such as the Digital, Collaborative, and Circular Economy offer alternatives, but public investments are also required to ensure that infrastructure and appro- priate supports exist to enable consumers to choose a low carbon lifestyle, including assistance for meeting the higher costs of ethical and sustainable goods and services. At its plenary session on 18\u201319 October 2017 the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) adopted the following opinions for which Group III members were Rapporteurs or Co-Rapporteurs. The fight against climate change cannot be won at the expense of ordinary citizens The EESC proposes a debate on an EU Bill of Climate Rights to ensure climate justice at all levels During the COP23 in Bonn on 8 November, a side event on \"Just transi- tion to low-carbon economy\" was organised jointly by the EESC, King's College London, Foundation for European Progressive Studies and Fon- dation Jean-Jaur\u00e8s. The EESC used this event to present its opinion on Climate Justice. The concept of \"climate justice\" frames global climate change as a political and ethical issue and not just an environmental one. It recognises that the poorest and most vulnerable in society often have to suffer the great- est impact from climate change. Climate justice has been traditionally dealt with as an issue of emerging economies. The EESC wants to apply these principles also to the EU Member States. Therefore the EESC calls for a debate on an EU Bill of Climate Rights that encapsulates the rights of EU citizens and those of nature in the context of the challenges of the global climate change crisis. \"We call on institutions and governments to ensure climate justice at all levels \u2013 global, EU, national, regional and com- munity level, in this way we can make climate policy more human centered,\" said Cillian Lohan, rapporteur of the opinion. Stop unfairly penalising those who have no alternative \u2013 EESC calls for a genuine polluter-pays principle In order to mitigate the impact of climate change, it is necessary to change production and consumption systems. Consumers need to be provided with sustainable ethical alternatives which do not mean less convenience, poorer quality or even higher prices. \"The polluter-pays principle must be applied to those causing pollution and profiting from it,\" said Mr Lohan. The EESC therefore encourages subsidies on fossil fuels to be eliminated. Pavel TRANTINA (CZ) Czech Council of Children and Youth Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group President SOC section SOC/567 - New EU education strategy The EESC: \u2022 welcomes the initiatives and agrees with their principles; \u2022 calls on the Commission and the Member States to include the need to value cultural diversity and tolerance in education policies as another area for fostering active citizenship and promoting EU fundamental values; \u2022 believes that we are all responsible for educating people and making them truly aware of common European history and values, yet it maintains that a more ambitious initiative is needed, one that would lead to a more holistic education strategy that changes the current paradigm; \u2022 considers that further training needs to be provided not only to teachers and school heads but also to the real-life educa-tors, such as parents, the com- munity and non-formal ed- ucation providers; \u2022 considers essential the availability of sufficient, equitably allocated funding and a coordinated govern- ance in the framework of high-quality and effective social dialogue; \u2022 emphasises that educational resources should not only focus on perfor- mance, but also on inclusiveness, for learners from disadvantaged back- grounds and for refugees; \u2022 highlights the importance of involving the social partners and other civil society organisations effectively in the process Europe III Overview of our Members\u2019 Work in the EESC \u00a9 S h u t t e r s t o c k : C h e r r i e s ",

A robust, inde- pendent and diversified organised civil society is underpinned by adequate public financing. The EESC: \u2022 considers that the European institutions could take steps to establish genuine European civil society dialogue.

Giuseppe GUERINI (IT) Confederation of Italian Cooperatives (Confcooperative) Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group ECO/434 - Taxation of the collaborative economy The EESC believes that the collaborative economy may offer a new opportu- nity for growth and development for the countries of the European Union, as it allows untapped resources to be mobilised and gives the initiative to indi- vidual people. The EESC is of the view that the EU must not miss the opportunity provided by the collaborative economy to bring innovation to bear on the system of relations between businesses, individuals and markets. However, given the particularly rapid nature of change in this sector, it is crucial for fiscal regula- tory systems and tax regimes to be adapted in an intelligent and flexible way. The EESC recommends that the tax system for the collaborative economy comply with the principle of neutrality (i.e. it must not interfere with market development), identifying appropriate tax mechanisms that are fair to the dif- ferent types of business operating within the collaborative economy. Tom JONES (UK) Wales Council Voluntary Action Member of the Various Interests\u2019 Group NAT/698 - Villages and small towns as catalysts for rural development Better rural development is possible, and local people are willing to deliver, but they need a support. EU and national authorities need to empower villages and small towns with new programmes that are flexible enough to be adapted to the diverse needs of Europe\u2019s rural areas. Positive examples should be promoted \u2013 for instance through a yearly celebratory day \u2013 in order to encourage other communities. With its opinion \u201cVillages and small towns as catalysts for rural de- velopment\u201d, adopted at its last plenary session, the EESC wants to contribute to a revitalisation of Europe\u2019s rural areas. \u201cThe challenges of the 21 st century can only be tackled when towns and vil- lages, regions and national states work together. The countryside and local communities in particular need to be better involved and play a greater role in smart and sustainable economic development, and it is the responsibility of the EU and its Members States to deliver the impetus for rural development. We must make our countryside a more attractive place to live, particularly for young people\u201d , says rapporteur Tom Jones. Smart infrastructure Economic and social development requires adequate infrastructure, in- cluding fast broadband services and a modern transport network. \u201cThis includes not just the provision of a smart transport network for road and rail, but also smart and efficient use of the transport network\u201d, Mr Jones explains. Shared transport, including car-sharing, community- or cooper- ative-owned buses and cars, shared taxis, mobile services and shops are concepts that already work quite well in some parts of Europe. Businesses should be encouraged to support teleworking. Fast broadband \u2013 mobile as well as fixed \u2013 is crucial for the further economic and social development of villages and towns. The EESC strongly supports the European Commission\u2019s Smart Villages Initiative as a first step in the right direction, particularly as it combines initiatives from all directorates-general. Mr. Brendan Burns, Pres- ident of the Agriculture and Rural Development Section of the EESC: \u201cThe European Investment Bank (EIB) must also rise to the challenge and devel- op tailor-made support schemes for small rural businesses, both private and social enterprises, as promised in its 2017-2018 programme\u201d. Rural-urban partnerships Cooperation between cities, towns and rural areas in agri-tourism and rural tourism, health-related activities, and the food supply chain, would bene- fit all stakeholders and particularly the general public. Creating clusters of public and private services in education, training, health and social care in rural areas also provides an opportunity to renovate empty buildings and attract other businesses or even government offices. Social and commu- nity enterprises can increasingly contribute to replacing lost public and private services, as initiatives such as the Virksomhed in Denmark or the Cletwr caf\u00e9 in Wales emphatically prove. \u201cMany regions have historical buildings, such as old castles or farms, which could find a new use and so be maintained as historic monu- ments. Other cultural values found in villages should also be highlight- ed, especially since 2018 is the European Year of Cultural Heritage\u201d, says Tom Jones. The Rural Development Programme (RDP) should be better supported by other European, national and regional programmes, as it is an excellent opportunity for local entrepreneurs to create new business, for instance by branding and marketing local farm and craft products such as drinks, food and handicrafts, as well as landscape and historical heritage, cultural and health recreational activities.
