        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report iv Abstract This evaluation report presents the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the joint evaluation of ECHO\u2019s disaster risk reduction (DRR) activities in the Horn of Africa (HoA) and Central Asia and South Caucasus (CAC). The conclusions from this evaluation primarily apply to these two regions. But they are also of broader relevance for DG ECHO\u2019s DRR interventions in other regions . The aim of this evaluation is to provide an objective assessment that can serve as a basis for internal reflection and debate within the Commission about its overall approach to DRR and post-2015 DRR strategy. In the HoA, ECHO focuses on building communities\u2019 resilience and national / regional inst itutional capacity to address drought, a slow onset hazard and the single most important disaster risk facing the region. In CAC, ECHO interventions aim at preparing communities and authorities to deal with a range of small scale, rapid onset hazards that often go unnoticed at a national level, but have serious impacts at a local level. The joint evaluation thus, examines similar activities in two rather different contexts. By doing so, it provides the opportunity for cross-learning between the two regions and a broader evidence base for policy making. Over the period covered by this evaluation (2009 \u2013 2013), DG ECHO has invested nearly 70 million euros in DRR actions in the two regions. Funded activities have included both community based DRR (CBDRR) projects as well as broader actions aimed at advocacy, institutional capacity building and DRR mainstreaming. The evaluation concludes that ECHO funded projects have, inter alia , made a demonstrable contribution to (i) reducing vulnerability, limiting damage and saving lives at a community level; and (ii) advancing the DRR agenda at a national level through advocacy, institutional capacity building and by raising awareness among decision-makers of the need to integrate DRR into longer term development policies in all countries covered by the evaluation. Through regional programming, ECHO has brought together DRR stakeholders and partners, thus facilitating a joined-up approach to DRR, and sharing of knowledge, tools and materials. On the less positive side, this evaluation finds that the replication and scaling up of community projects is not as extensive as it could be; the linkages between DRR and development planning and programming have not been fully established in most countries; and the sustainability of outputs and outcomes beyond ECHO funding cycles continues to be an issue. The evaluation provides a series of strategic and operational recommendations to address these issues and to guide ECHO\u2019s future approach to DRR. ",

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report x Executive summary The European Union (EU) has been supporting disaster risk reduction (DRR) around the globe through a dedicated ECHO Programme for Disaster Preparedness (DIPECHO) since 1996. In 2003, Central Asia became the sixth DIPECHO region to be targeted by the Programme and in 2009, geographical coverage of the Programme was expanded to the South Caucasus region. Meanwhile, building on the success of DIPECHO, DG ECHO launched a specific DRR programme in the Horn of Africa (HoA) in 2006 focusing on drought risk reduction. While DG ECHO\u2019s overall approach to DRR and the nature of the activities funded is similar across the two regions, they differ in terms of context. In the HoA, DG ECHO focuses on drought, a slow onset hazard and the single most important disaster risk facing the region. In Central Asia and South Caucasus (CAC), DG ECHO interventions deal with a range of small scale, rapid onset hazards that often go unnoticed at a national level, but have serious impacts at the local level. The joint evaluation thus, examines DG ECHO\u2019s approach and activities in two different contexts and by doing so, provides the opportunity for cross-learning between the two regions and a broader evidence base for policy making. Objectives and scope of the evaluation This evaluation is both summative and formative in nature. It assesses the coherence, relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of DG ECHO\u2019s DRR interventions in the HoA and CAC over the period 2009 to 2013; and provides a series of recommendations for improving the future orientation of DG ECHO\u2019s a pproach to DRR. During the period covered by the evaluation, DG ECHO invested almost 70 million euros in DRR in the two regions, with three-quarters of this investment going to the HoA. Funded activities included both community managed DRR (CMDRR) projects as well as broader actions aimed at advocacy, institutional capacity building and DRR mainstreaming. The evaluation is based on extensive: desk research; stakeholder interviews with Commission officials and DG ECHO partners; and six country missions (covering Kenya/ Uganda, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Armenia and Georgia) where a broad range of stakeholders (including beneficiaries) were interviewed and sixteen projects sites were visited. To conclude the data collection and validation process, four debriefing workshops were held in Kenya, Ethiopia, Tajikistan and Georgia with key stakeholders at the end of each country mission. Key findings and conclusions of the evaluation Coherence and complementarity with international/ EU frameworks for DRR and national strategies DRR is a core element of DG ECHO's mandate as per Council Regulation (EC) no. 1257/96 on Humanitarian Aid. As such, the objectives of the Drought Risk Reduction Action Plan (DRRAP) in the HoA and the DIPECHO programme in CAC are cohere nt with the EU legal base. DG ECHO\u2019s DRR approach and interventions are also largely aligned with the main priorities articulated in: \uf0a7 the 2009 EU DRR Strategy and its implementation plan; \uf0a7 the 2012 Resilience Communication; \uf0a7 the Hyogo Framework for Action; and \uf0a7 regional/ national DRR plans and strategies where these exist.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report xi In line with the policy objectives set out in the high level documents mentioned overleaf, DG ECHO- funded actions have contributed to DRR awareness raising and capacity building at all levels (and particularly at a local level) in the two regions. The above strategies also call for an integrated approach to addressing DRR 1 and underlying risk factors (such as climate change, natural resource exploitation, urban development, environmental degradation, etc). The integration of DRR into issues that constitute underlying risk factors has been (indirectly) supported by DIPECHO through efforts aimed at mainstreaming DRR within development policy and programming, rather than by directly funding integrated projects in CAC. In the HoA, given the strong and concerted push towards mainstreaming of DRR within the resilience agenda, the recent trend has been to fund integrated DRR projects, while stand-alone DRR projects are only funded in specific countries and contexts. Relevance: continuing need for ECHO funding In both regions (HoA as well as CAC), there is arguably a continuing role for DG ECHO financed DRR, not only as a stand-alone activity, but also as one that is integrated into development planning (which is increasingly seen as the way forward). However, DRR needs and capacities vary across countries. For example, the DRR agenda and institutional set-up is more advanced in some countries than in others (e.g. Kenya and Ethiopia), and some countries do not necessarily require external financing for DRR (e.g. Kazakhstan). Relevance: addressing the needs of the \u2018most vulnerable\u2019 In both regions (HoA as well as CAC), DG ECHO-funded actions have targeted the communities/ villages that are the most exposed to droughts / disasters, yet it is not possible to determine whether the participating communities/ villages were the \u2018 most vulnerable \u2019 . This is because the vulnerability analyses carried out by partners are usually only performed on a limited basis and do not fully characterise the vulnerabilities of proposed participating communities. Cross-cutting issues In CAC, \u2018 Climate Change Adaptation \u2019 (CCA) and \u2018 Linking Relief Rehabilitation and Development \u2019 (LRRD) were found to be inadequately addressed as \u2018 cross-cutting issues \u2019, both at a programme level and a project level. It should however, be noted, that CCA was never intended to be addressed as a cross cutting issue in CAC. Partners were encouraged to incorporate CCA elements \u2013 \u2018 where feasible \u2019 - in the project design and during implementation. In the HoA on the other hand, LRRD has provided the overarching framework for DG ECHO's DRR interventions and a concerted effort has been made to link humanitarian and development assistance in the region. DG ECHO\u2019s DRR interventions have also applied CCA principles into practice by helping communities to better cope with the impact of drought (and thus, adjust/ adapt to one of the main effects of climate change in the region). As regards the cross-cutting issues of gender, age and disability 2 : \uf0a7 In the HoA, DG ECHO partners could arguably have done more to address the specific needs of women by designing specific DRR actions for women rather than merely ensuring women\u2019s inclusion in projects. The needs of children and the elderly were relatively less well addressed; however, in the later phases of the DRRAP, DG ECHO encouraged partners such as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Save the Children, Oxfam and HelpAge to address these needs. Disabled persons were not addressed at all during the period covered by the evaluation (2009 \u2013 2013). 1 The integration of DRR into issues that constitute underlying risk factors can be (indirectly) supported through efforts aimed at mainstreaming DRR within development policy and programming. More directly, DG ECHO could fund integrated DRR projects i.e. projects integrating DRR with climate change adaptation, natural resource management, environmental management, livelihood support, water purification, and erosion control, etc. 2 It is noted that the new single- form introduced in 2014 includes a \u2018gender age marker\u2019 to assess the extent to which the funded action is integrating gender and age considerations.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report xii \uf0a7 In CAC, projects were seen to have made special efforts to reach out to and engage women and children in DRR activities. However, only a handful of the projects considered the special needs of the elderly and disabled. In both regions, given the focus on community-based DRR, community networks (where these exist), community level stakeholders and members were typically involved in project design and implementation. Communities consulted during fieldwork expressed satisfaction and appreciation with their involvement in DG ECHO-funded actions. EU Added Value The key dimensions of this added value - as evidenced by this evaluation (in both regions) - are as follows: \uf0a7 DG ECHO funded DRR activities that would not have otherwise been implemented (or in the best case, would have been implemented at a much smaller scale); \uf0a7 DG ECHO is widely recognised as a front-runner in promoting DRR in the two regions; \uf0a7 running a dedicated funding programme for DRR; \uf0a7 adopting a combination of a top-down (advocacy and institutional linkages) and bottom-up approach (community based) to DRR. DG ECHO\u2019s focus on communities as central actors in DRR is unique; \uf0a7 local presence through DG ECHO field offices (ECHO Field) and their role in facilitating coordination and cooperation between partners and creating a linked-up community of DRR players; and \uf0a7 an innovative regional approach encompassing cross border and multi-country projects. Choice of partnerships The choice of partnerships was found to be appropriate in the HoA and CAC, building upon the comparative strengths of the organisations involved. In the HoA however, some DRRAP partners were funded over successive phases despite weaknesses in project design and issues with past performance. The choice of local implementing partners has also generally been appropriate, although the evaluation indicates that there is scope for DG ECHO partners to involve local NGOs to a greater extent in the design and implementation of their DRR actions with a view to long-term local capacity building, sustainability and paving the way for successful \u2018handovers\u2019. Partners\u2019 capacity and commitment Partners are committed to achieving the objectives of DG ECHO-funded DRR actions. However, the start-up of projects is often rather slow (often due to delays in national authorities\u2019 decision -making processes and approvals) and their exit strategies are often weak. There is often an implicit expectation of continued funding from DG ECHO under new funding cycles. Substitution effect Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that DG ECHO was competing with or substituting the activity of other humanitarian and development actors in the period covered by this evaluation. DG ECHO- funded actions were filling a critical gap in activity that is essentially the responsibility of national/ local authorities, but which they were unable to fulfil due to lack of resources, capacity and know-how. Learning and innovation over successive phases Where partners have received fu nding for \u201cregional projects\u201d 3 under multiple cycles, they have revised their approaches in order to improve their effectiveness and efficiency. However, country-specific projects, in the HoA have tended to change or expand the number of communities covered over 3 \u201cRegional Projects\u201d are those which are implemented throughout the whole region covered by a funding decision (e.g. the HoA), and which typically have a focus on technical support, coordination and advocacy.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report xiii successive phases. Although innovative approaches have been developed and applied through DG ECHO funding \u2013 particularly at a community level, partners have not necessarily demonstrated significant fresh innovation over successive phases, nor have they demonstrated how lessons learned from previous phases have been addressed. In contrast, in CAC considerable efforts have been undertaken to generate lesson-learning guidance and inventories of best practices, but they are not systematically promoted to potential \u2018 recommendation domains \u2019 and are instead taken up in an ad-hoc way by partners, across regions and between funding cycles. Effectiveness DG ECHO-funded DRR actions have demonstrably enabled local communities and institutions to better prepare for, mitigate and respond to natural disasters, thereby increasing resilience and reducing vulnerabilities. Some of the \u2018softer\u2019 effects of DG ECHO funded interventions include: \uf0a7 increasing beneficiary communi ties\u2019 awareness, knowledge and understanding of disaster risks and mitigation measures; and \uf0a7 triggering behavioural changes, such as improved sanitary practice and the diversification of livelihoods (in the HoA) and empowering communities to respond rapidly in the case of emergencies, through simulations, evacuation plans, etc (in CAC). Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that DG ECHO-funded actions have directly contributed to protecting lives, assets and livelihoods - although these impacts are typically not documented. Finally, DG ECHO-funded actions have also contributed to reinforcing sub-national/ local response capacities by investing in Early Warning Systems (EWS), providing training to local authority officials, establishing and developing Local Disaster Management Committees (LDMCs) and linking these with local authorities, organising simulations, etc. While DG ECHO-funded DRR actions have delivered both tangible and intangible benefits, it is impossible to determine the cumulative impact of DRRAP / DIPECHO with current monitoring and evaluation systems. Most notably, there are no tools in place for partners to systematically capture information on losses avoided as a result of DG ECHO-funded actions in case of a disaster. Replication, scaling-up and mainstreaming As regards the mainstreaming of DRR, significant progress has been made in the HoA (although the level of progress varies between countries). Moreover, although DRR has been mainstreamed in policy documents, 4 national and local authorities are still dependent upon external sources of funding for DRR activities, particularly community-based DRR. In CAC, the main successes have been in the mainstreaming of DRR within the education sector. Beyond education, there are still considerable challenges facing DIPECHO in integrating DRR in other relevant sectors (health, agriculture, environment, etc) and overall development planning and programming. There is some replication and scaling-up of activity under DRRAP and DIPECHO, however a massive scale-up only appears to have taken place in Kazakhstan. Further, there has been no \u201c spontaneous \u201d (community-led) replication / scaling up. In other countries, replication and scaling-up of DG ECHO funded DRR actions is not as extensive as it could be. Sustainability Some of the activities implemented through the DRRAP/ DIPECHO show evidence of continuation, even after DG ECHO funding has ended. This has been the case: \uf0a7 where DG ECHO partners have secured additional funding from other donors to continue / scale-up the action; 4 See for example, Sector Plan for Drought Risk Management and Ending Drought Emergencies; Second Medium Term Plan 2013 \u2013 2017 (Kenya); National Policy for Disaster Preparedness and Management (Uganda); Parliamentary Forum on Disaster Risk Reduction Strategic Plans (Uganda); and the 2013 National Policy and Strategy on Disaster Risk Management (Ethiopia). ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report xiv \uf0a7 where the action has been mainstreamed into the regional / national / local agenda or relevant sectoral policies; and \uf0a7 when DG ECHO-funded DRR actions have led to changes in knowledge, awareness and/ or behaviour (although changes in knowledge and behaviour will need to be reinforced). It however, remains a challenge to sustain the initial benefits of community based actions such as replenishing stockpiles, maintaining mitigation measures, providing \u2018 refresher training \u2019 and ensuring that the various DRR community groups established by projects \u2018 keep going \u2019, despite community out- migration and membership turnover. Cost-effectiveness A consolidated picture of the aggregate outputs and results achieved at programme level cannot be obtained due to weak reporting systems and the absence of standardised monitoring indicators. Consequently, it is not possible to determine if the \u2018 same results \u2019 could have been achieved with less funding. The relevance, effectiveness and added value of ECHO funding have however, been demonstrated. Moreover, wider evidence on the costs and benefits of DRR consistently shows that (i) there are high economic and social returns from DRR actions \u2014 both from DRR projects on their own or when integrated with development projects and that (ii) DRR investment brings greater benefits than costs 5 . On balance, it can therefore be concluded that, the money was spent wisely, although the efficiency of DG ECHO funding has been constrained by limited: replication, scaling-up and mainstreaming of funded DRR actions. Strategic recommendations This evaluation highlights important considerations about the future direction of DG ECHO\u2019s strategy and approach to DRR in the HoA and CAC. A number of strategic recommendations have been made to support enhanced policy impacts and maximise the added value in the future. These are set out below. Recommendation 1: DG ECHO\u2019s DRR funding should be targeted to wards the countries and beneficiaries that are most in need The evaluation reinforces the need to focus DRR funding on countries facing a high level of risk for disasters, while lacking the financial and technical capacity to reduce their own levels of risk. Specifically, within CAC, this calls for a more selective approach to country coverage going forward. The entry criterion for DG ECHO funding should be countries where DRR gaps are the greatest in relation to domestic capacity and needs. The achievement of the specified objectives for the country concerned should be the point of exit. This calls for a clear specification of country level DRR objectives \u2013 see also Recommendations 8 and 9. Furthermore, within the target countries, funding should be directed to: \uf0a7 specific DRR sub-sectors, areas (rural and/ or urban) and communities that are most in need; and \uf0a7 the DRR investments that are most needed (but which can be effectively funded by DG ECHO given its comparative advantages and funding/ political constraints). In this context, DG ECHO should examine how to account for new communities at risk, such as urban communities and pastoral drop-outs in the HoA. 5 For a summary of the literature, see Shyam, K.C., 2013.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report xv Scope of \u2018DRR\u2019 in the HoA Recommendation 2: DG ECHO should consider widening the scope of its \u2018DRR\u2019 activities in the HoA from \u2018drought risk reduction\u2019 to \u2018disaster risk reduction\u2019 The HoA is prone to many hazards such as droughts (slow-onset), floods, landslides, lightening (all of which are rapid-onset hazards), diseases and epidemics (e.g. Ebola, malaria, etc). Although drought remains the single most important risk facing the region, significant progress has been made in recent years in mainstreaming drought risk reduction within the resilience agenda, where it quite naturally fits. A number of donors are now active in th is \u2018space\u2019, leaving fewer gaps to be filled with DG ECHO funding. Some of the other hazards might however, be less well addressed by national/ local authorities and donors alike. DG ECHO should therefore, consider widening the scope of its programming acti vities from \u2018drought risk reduction\u2019 to \u2018disaster risk reduction\u2019 in the HoA. Overall approach to DRR Stand-alone versus integrated DRR approaches Recommendation 3: Alongside stand-alone DRR projects, DG ECHO should direct more support to (integrated) projects addressing underlying risk factors in CAC DG ECHO should consider directing more support to projects addressing underlying risk factors and DRR in an integrated manner, while remaining cognisant of the implications of such an approach in terms of the concomitant desirability of reduced support for stand-alone DRR projects in the region. The long-term nature of interventions aimed at addressing underlying risk would however, need to be reconciled with the short term funding cycles of DIPECHO and budgetary constraints. This could be achieved by: \uf0a7 increasing support for the \u2018 repeat funding \u2019 of projects which, over two or more funding cycles, take on the successive phases of the work required to tackle the longer-term nature of dealing with risk factors; and \uf0a7 requiring greater levels of co-financing from alternative sources (see also Recommendation 15). Recommendation 4: Following on from Recommendations 1 and 2, DG ECHO should continue to support both standalone as well as integrated DRR projects in the HoA DG ECHO should continue to follow a \u2018blended\u2019 approach to DRR that includes financing for both stand-alone as well as integrated DRR projects depending on the country context and the risks being addressed. Geographic approach to funding decisions (regional versus country specific programming) Recommendation 5: DG ECHO should maintain a regional approach to funding decisions in HoA and CAC This evaluation demonstrates the strong added value of adopting a regional approach to DRR. A regional approach allows DG ECHO to fund regional and multi-country/ cross-border projects (which is widely regarded as a key element of DG ECHO\u2019s unique added value) , facilitating cooperation and collaboration across partners and national/ local authorities and promoting efficiencies through the exchange of material, good practices and lessons learned. A regional approach also gives DG ECHO the flexibility to deal with country level variations in the absorption of DRR funding. Given that the evaluation found no evidence to suggest a shift in approach, DG ECHO should continue to follow a regional approach to its funding decisions in the HoA and CAC. A \u2018top down\u2019 versus \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach Recommendation 6: DG ECHO should continue to adopt a combination of \u2018top - down\u2019 and \u2018bottom - up\u2019 approaches to DRR , considering that the two approaches are highly complementary and mutually reinforcing (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) This evaluation demonstrates the added value and benefits of supporting policy advocacy and institutional linkages in conjunction with community or sector based DRR projects, although arguably ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report xvi there is scope to further enhance the linkages between the two. For instance, community-based or sector-specific DRR projects should provide the \u2018 ammunition \u2019 to advocate for DRR, e.g. real life stories, evidence and data on risks, costs and benefits, etc. This is already the case in the HoA. Engagement with UN Agencies Recommendation 7: DG ECHO should adopt a more strategic approach to its engagement with the United Nation (UN) Agencies (this recommendation only applies to CAC) UN agencies have a long-term in-country presence and often have remits that strongly relate to DIPECHO\u2019s mandate: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)/ United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) in wide terms for DRR globally; UNICEF for education; and the World Health Organisation (WHO) for health. These bodies have evident and considerable potential to take on or support strategic leadership in specific DRR sub-sectors, and this is not properly addressed by their inclusion as competitors for DG ECHO funding, alongside international NGOs such as Oxfam or CARE, for example. A more strategic approach to working with UN partners is warranted, for example through joint DRR needs assessment, priority setting or even coordinated funding of DRR activities. Improved accountability, monitoring and reporting Recommendation 8: DG ECHO should precisely define the objectives of each Humanitarian Implementation Plan (HIP) (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) The HIP objectives should be \u2018SMART\u2019, providing a clear idea of what each funding decisi on is expected to achieve and by when. There should be a clear hierarchy of objectives including: \uf0a7 global objectives (corresponding to impact indicators); \uf0a7 specific objectives (which correspond to result and outcome based indicators); and \uf0a7 operational objectives (which correspond to output indicators). To the extent possible, objectives should be specified in quantitative terms and for each country of operation. Better ex-ante specification of objectives would allow for improved (ex-post) measurement of impact. Evidence on the benefits of DRR is critical for persuading other donors and national authorities to replicate and scale-up DG ECHO-funded activity. Recommendation 9: HIPs should be accompanied by a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) Related to the above recommendation, HIPs should be implemented in concert with a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework that systematically covers the activities and results achieved across the portfolio of funded projects, and that generates information both for internal project management, as well as for evaluating progress at programme level. This would include enhanced attention to risks and assumptions, both at project and programme levels. The M&E system should be based on a core set of standardised indicators 6 to enable inter-project comparison and aggregation across the portfolio. Partners could still be allowed the flexibility to use some project-specific indicators. Recommendation 10: DG ECHO should better demonstrate the impact of its DRR funding (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) To persuade others (to replicate or scale-up), both DG ECHO and partners, should place more emphasis on collating, presenting evidence on return on investment and where feasible, generate quantified estimate costs and benefits of their activity, e.g. actual/ expected reduction in disaster losses as a result of the funded action. 6 Th e monitoring indicators contained in ECHO\u2019s 2013 thematic paper on DRR could be used as the basis for developing a more complete set of indicators that are relevant across all DRR programmes.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report xvii Building local capacity Recommendation 11: DG ECHO should provide capacity building support to local NGOs to ensure long term capacity and sustainability of DRR (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) On the basis that DG ECHO has decided against any amendments to the Financial Regulation (to allow it to directly fund NGOs), a separate evaluation on the subject offers practical steps that DG ECHO can take in the short to medium term to support local NGO capacity building 7 . For example, DG ECHO could incentivise its partners to more systematically involve local NGOs in their projects; DG ECHO could also directly engage in dialogue with key local NGOs to inform the design of HIP and discussions on good practice and lessons learned, etc. Such an investment would help build the capacity of loca l NGOs to continue DRR activities \u2018kick - started\u2019 with ECHO funding over the longer term. Operational recommendations Recommendation 12: Partners should be required to undertake a more comprehensive assessment of vulnerability (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) In their needs assessment, partners should be asked to not only provide an assessment of disaster risks and vulnerabilities, but also the underlying risk factors and root causes of vulnerability. Vulnerability assessments underpinning the selection of target beneficiaries should also be improved. Partners should be asked to provide the following information: \uf0a7 Which socio-economic groups have been identified as the \u2018 most vulnerable \u2019 in the targeted geographical area, sector or other ambit? \uf0a7 Why are these specific groups especially vulnerable? What causes and risk factors make these groups more vulnerable than others groups in the same community or in relation to other related communities? Recommendation 13: DG ECHO should support the systematic \u2018harvesting\u2019 of lessons learned and good practices developed (this recommendation only applies to CAC) DG ECHO should develop materials that capture lessons learned and generate reflections with partners at the end of each funding cycle, via a process involving the review of project documents, and regional and inter-regional workshops; and then implement a process whereby these lessons and measures are delivered to partners and properly accounted for, by successful applicants in next funding cycle. The identification of good practices has mainly focused on community based DRR activities. DG ECHO and partners should be encouraged to document and share good practice in policy advocacy. DG ECHO could also support national authorities in generating assessments, at the end of each funding cycle, of the implications of the completed projects for national DRR programming. An example could be the preparation of one or a series of presentations to national DRR official platforms, where these exist. This could include proposals for how government DRR and sectoral ministries could be enabled to take up findings and apply these in their programming, including determining key gaps and developing proposals and applying to international bodies for DRR funding. DG ECHO should advocate for DEVCO resilience programmes to actively incorporate learning from its DRR investments and the establishment of processes to capture lessons learned. This could include more detailed attention to DRR issues during DEVCO country programming and within frameworks such as national or regional environmental profiles, taking advantage of DG ECHO guidance and best practices materials. This would ensure that priority sector programmes designed within country assistance strategies would account for opportunities to tackle DRR either as a cross-cutting issue or via a specific set of measures. 7 Germax (2013) Evaluation of the potential effectiveness and efficiency gains of working directly with local NGOs in the humanitarian interventions of the Commission.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report xviii Recommendation 14: DG ECHO should coordinate donor-mapping exercises for each region on a regular basis to support focussed advocacy efforts (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) To support successful advocacy, DG ECHO should commission regular donor mapping exercises which identify the main donors active in each country of interest, their programming cycles, funding priorities and financial envelopes. Recommendation 15: DG ECHO should encourage projects to mobilise co-financing from domestic public or private sources or other donors (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) This recommendation is self-explanatory. Recommendation 16: Multi-country projects should be required to establish and demonstrate links between activities in different countries through for example, cross-border learning or knowledge exchange activities, joint activities such as simulations and trainings, etc (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) This recommendation is self-explanatory. Recommendation 17: Projects should receive funding over multiple cycles only if they show improvement, differentiation in approach or innovation over successive cycles (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) Projects receiving funding over multiple funding cycles should be underpinned by a justification based on: \uf0a7 support by DG ECHO of decisions by national authorities to pre-qualify and authorise DG ECHO\u2019s portfolio of winning projects, to avoid delays in starting -up due to slow authorisation of these; \uf0a7 clear additionally of actions; \uf0a7 lessons learned from previous cycles taken up via strategic assessment and uptake actions; and \uf0a7 innovation in approach.

The evaluation was launched by the Directorate-General Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (DG ECHO) in December 2013. The work was undertaken by ICF with specialist inputs from experts in the fields of international development, humanitarian assistance and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). The Final Report details the work undertaken and provides a synthesis of the evidence collected within the framework of this evaluation; it sets out the findings and conclusions emerging from this evidence; and provides a series of recommendations to inform the future orientations of ECHO\u2019s approach to DRR in the two regions. 1.1 Evaluation context and scope The EU has been supporting DRR around the globe through a dedicated ECHO Programme for Disaster Preparedness (DIPECHO) for almost two decades now. DIPECHO was launched in 1996 and is currently implemented in eight disaster prone regions including Central Asia and South Caucasus 8 (CAC) \u2013 Figure 1.1.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 2 DIPECHO supports both community based DRR projects as well as broader actions aimed at advocacy, institutional capacity building and DRR mainstreaming - Figure 1.2 provides an overview of the types of DRR actions supported by ECHO. Figure 1.2 DRR actions supported by DG ECHO Building on the success of DIPECHO, ECHO launched a specific DRR programme in the Horn of Africa (HoA) in 2006 focusing on drought risk reduction. While DIPECHO and the drought risk reduction programme are similar in terms of overall approach to DRR and the nature of operations, there are important differences between the two: \uf0a7 The scale of the intervention: the HoA accounts for a major share of ECHO\u2019s DRR funding. For example in 2012, the global annual financial envelope for DIPECHO was 35 million euros (spread across eight regions) 9 , whereas 20 million euros was allocated to drought risk reduction in the HoA alone. \uf0a7 The context for intervention: while DIPECHO interventions aim at preparing communities and authorities to deal with rapid onset disa sters, DG ECHO\u2019s DRR actions in the HoA address slow onset hazards such as droughts in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries. 9 C(2012) 6970 final \u2013 Global financial decision.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 3 \uf0a7 HoA context: the recurrent and protracted natures of droughts in the HoA and the resultant humanitarian crises have created frequent demands for humanitarian aid, thus justifying the volume of ECHO funding for this region. Given the protracted nature of droughts and the vicious cycle of socioeconomic effects that they set off, one of the main focuses of ECHO\u2019s DRR acti ons in this region has been to promote the mainstreaming of DRR within the wider resilience building and development agenda through advocacy measures. \uf0a7 CAC Context: the relatively recent emergence of CAC countries from central command socio-economic systems, the complexity of small-scale, localised and rapid-onset hazards, the paucity of donor support for DRR and the size and proximity of this region to Europe, have been decisive factors in determining the evolution of DIPECHO in this region. This evaluation assesses the relevance (including coherence and EU added value), effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of ECHO\u2019s DRR interventions in the HoA and CAC over the period 2009 to 2013. During this period, ECHO invested almost 70 million euros in DRR in the two regions, with three-quarters of this investment going to the HoA.

Given the large number of projects (81) and associated volume of documentation, a two-step approach was adopted for the HoA: \uf0a7 a broad-brush review of all project documentation; and \uf0a7 in-depth review of select projects. For CAC, geo-spatial analysis was carried out. Maps were produced for each country showing (a) geographical coverage of DIPECHO funded projects and (b) the most dominant hazard risk and historic disaster events (due to budgetary constraints, it was not feasible to map all hazards). The purpose of this exercise was to determine if projects covered the areas most at risk. The results of this exercise are presented in Annex 11. Desk research was only provided as part of the evidence base for the evaluation; it was necessary to update, cross-check and complement the information collected from secondary sources through primary research. Stakeholder interviews \uf0a7 12 scoping interviews (face to face) were conducted with DG ECHO officials (both HQ and field based) as well as relevant desk officers at DG DEVCO \uf0a7 14 telephone interviews were conducted with DG ECHO partners Annex 1 provides a list of interviews conducted during the desk phase While interviews were useful for understanding context, they typically generated opinions/ and individuals \u2019 perspectives, rather than facts. Field work: HoA Fieldwork covered three out of the seven countries 15 covered by DRAAP during the period 2009-2013 (Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda). While the evaluation team did not visit Somalia, the Ethiopian field trip included a visit to a cross-border project with Somaliland. Country selection was based on the consideration of the following factors: \uf0a7 together, these countries accounted for 93 per cent (38 out of 41) of all country-specific projects. These countries were also covered by cross-border and regional projects (see Annex 3); The main constraints were those imposed by the time and budget available for the fieldwork. DRRAP projects are geographically dispersed across the region as well as within countries. Logistics was therefore, an important consideration in planning the fieldwork. It also meant that a random sampling of projects was not feasible, therefore a purposive sampling approach was used instead. 15 Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia (Somaliland), Uganda and Sudan (NB: the latter was only covered in the 2008 decision).

Given the limited budget and timeline for the evaluation, Tajikistan was selected for a field visit for two reasons: its long history of DIPECHO activities and high disaster risk and vulnerability. Select parts of Kazakhstan were also included as part of the fieldwork to provide additional context and for liaising with the DG ECHO field office based in Almaty. Within Southern Caucasus, Armenia and Georgia were selected as these two countries collectively account for the majority of DIPECHO\u2019s activities in the Caucasus region. Besides, most of ECHO partners are based in these two countries and As above ",

Again a purposive sampling approach was used to select project sites for field visits. Locations for on-site visits were selected on the basis of accessibility, relevance, multi-country coverage, range of partners and logistical aspects. During the fieldwork, the team interviewed more than 200 stakeholders and beneficiaries (92 in Central Asia and 120 in the Caucasus region). The team visited six project sites (four in Central Asia and two in Caucasus). Annex 2 provides details of the sites visited and stakeholders interviewed. The fieldwork took place from 03 Apr to 30 Apr 2014. Debriefing workshops were organised in Tajikistan (Dushanbe) and Georgia (Tbilisi) towards the end of the country fieldwork. Online survey An online survey (using the EU Survey Tool) was developed \u2013 as a methodological experiment - to gather data from implementing partners. A link was sent to all ECHO partners who had used local implementing partners requesting them to collect responses from their implementing partner. An MS- WORD format of the questionnaire was attached to encourage responses from those with limited access to the Internet. Nine responses were received in total, with seven of these being submitted via email. The response rate was rather low. Only implementing partners that had participated in projects under the 2012 HIP responded. To supplement the findings, the evaluation team interviewed a further nine implementing partners in the field. This method of data collection is challenging in an environment where access to the Internet can be sporadic. The email questionnaire worked better than the online questionnaire. ",

This section provides an overview of the hazard risks facing these regions, their vulnerability to hazards and DG ECHO\u2019s activity aimed reducing t hese risks and vulnerabilities, by way of background and context for the evaluation. 2.1 The context for DRR: hazard risk and vulnerability 2.1.1 Horn of Africa The HoA is vulnerable to a number of different natural and man-made hazards. In the last 30 years, the population of the HoA has more than doubled and this has affected the demographic dynamics and placed further pressure on increasingly scarce natural resources. 16 Other causes of humanitarian crises in the region include conflict (including inter-clan violence and political disputes), displacement of populations, competition over scarce resources such as pastures, water and fertile lands (which in turn causes conflicts between pastoralist communities \u2013 e.g. along the Kenya/Ethiopian border), and rapid onset natural disasters (e.g. flooding or storms). The area is also affected by frequent epidemic outbreaks such as acute watery diarrhoea, malaria, meningitis, measles and Ebola haemorrhagic fever (i.e. Uganda) as well as diseases affecting livestock. 17 Over the last three decades, natural disasters have affected over 125 million people in the region and killed almost 330,000 people (see Table 2.1). As the table below shows, drought is the main disaster affecting the region (based on the number of people affected).

The main impacts of droughts occur through two channels: water shortages leading to disease and mortality among humans and animals; and loss of agricultural output and livestock resulting in food insecurity and loss of livelihoods. Droughts set off a vicious cycle of socio-economic impacts (poor nutrition, loss of livelihood, erosion of assets, indebtedness, poverty, etc), thus, increasing the vulnerability of affected persons to another drought as well as other shocks. The increasing frequency of droughts also prevents communities from recovering and rehabilitating, further eroding their coping capacities. For these reasons, the agro- pastoralists who characterise the ASALs of the HoA are particularly vulnerable to droughts. In 2010 and 2011, consecutive rain failures in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti caused a severe drought which led to a major humanitarian crisis in the region. At the peak of the drought (around August 2011), 13 million people were in need of emergency assistance. 20 Even today, millions of people in the HoA continue to suffer chronic food insecurity and vulnerability. 21 Around 9 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance, including 2.7 million food insecure people in Ethiopia, 1.3 million in Kenya and 3 million in Somalia, in the arid and semi- arid areas affected by the 2011 drought as well as areas that have not received sufficient rains. 22 In Somalia, food insecurity is exacerbated by ongoing conflict in the country. 2.1.2 Central Asia and South Caucasus CAC countries have a long history of devastating disasters that have caused economic and human losses across the region. During the 20-year period (1988 to 2007), the reported 129 disasters have affected at least 14 million people in the region and caused thousands of deaths.

Source [online] Available at: http://www.preventionweb.net/files/30427_armenianationalsurveyseismicprotect.pdf The CAC region is highly exposed to rapid-onset disasters such as earthquakes and localised hydro-meteorological hazards. The latter category includes storms/intense rainfall and resultant floods; heatwaves and droughts; as well as extreme temperatures. Apart from earthquakes, other geological hazards include mudflows, landslides, floods, droughts and avalanches. These complex and overlapping hazards typify the disaster risk profiles of many communities, due to their close proximity to a series of natural fault lines, extreme weather conditions and the region\u2019s highly-varied topography characterised by mountain ranges and glaciers, desert zones and large areas of treeless/grassy steppes. There are many large river systems such as the Amu Daria and Syr Daria with considerable flood plains, and major water bodies such as the Caspian and Aral seas and the Issy-Kul, Balkhash and Sarez lakes. Earthquakes are the most dangerous hazard facing the region, causing destruction to human life, buildings and infrastructure alike, while also triggering secondary events such as landslides, mudslides and avalanches. Historical evidence shows that landslides, mudslides and debris flows caused many casualties during the earthquakes in Armenia (1988 Spitak), Azerbaijan (2000 Baku), Kazakhstan (1887, 1889, and 1911 Almaty), Kyrgyzstan (1992 Jalal-Abad), Tajikistan (1949 Khait, 1989 Gissar), Turkmenistan (1948 Ashgabat) and Uzbekistan (1966 Tashkent). Table 2.3 provides an overview of the most prominent and significant hazard risks facing the CAC countries. ",

Moreover, two- thirds of the region\u2019s population is concentrated in the mountainous southern quarter, which is highly prone to all kinds of hazards due to its diverse geography and extreme weather conditions 23 . A range of environmental problems affect specific areas within the region, where many watersheds are suffering from soil erosion and poor land use such as deforestation and pasture degradation due to overgrazing; while large dams, polluting industries such as mining, abandoned industrial plants from the Soviet era and radioactive wastes dumps, further exacerbate current challenges to environmental management. Major urban areas are disproportionately vulnerable to disasters due to higher population densities and general lack of integration of DRR measures in urban planning 24 - see Box 1. Box 1 CAC regions: specific vulnerabilities of urban settlements Tashkent, Baku, Almaty, Tbilisi, Bishkek, Yerevan, Dushanbe, Ashgabat and Astana are the most populated cities in CAC and all are undergoing intense economic activity. With the exception of Tbilisi and Yerevan, all are experiencing high population growth. These cities, with the exception of Astana, are highly vulnerable to earthquakes and all nine are potentially vulnerable to floods. I n a simple risk assessment, taking into account the cities\u2019 hazard zonation and populations, earthquakes emerge as by far the major risk, while the hazard levels of floods and landslides are rather less significant, though this varies, of course, by local zone. Tashkent, Baku and Almaty form the group with the highest risk, followed by Tbilisi, Bishkek and Yerevan, which face about half the risk of the former group. The single key factor affecting hazard exposure and vulnerability is rapid population growth, particularly of high-density settlements concentrated within the cities. These risks are exacerbated by the hazards generated through the legacy of poor quality (and often deteriorating) stocks of buildings (in the educational, health, industrial and residential subsectors), which appear to require significant investment for retrofitting against earthquake risk: specifically - for example - many old schools and hospitals. As well, industrial plants abandoned after the collapse of the USSR are scattered throughout the region. Furthermore, urban planning systems and institutions are often weak, providing little in the way of structured spatial planning; and urban development is often characterised by limited regulation and control of new buildings and infrastructural investment decisions. 23 Central Asia and Caucasus Disaster Risk Management Initiative (2011) Risk Assessment for Central Asia and Caucasus, Desk Study Review. 24 DIPECHO CAC Action Plan 2012.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 14 Overall, the CAC countries region is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, although the level of exposure to hazard risk, coping capacities and the degree of preparedness (and consequently, the level of vulnerability) varies from country to country. According to OCHA Regional Office for Caucasus and Central Asia (ROCCA) 25 : \u2019 Countries in the region can be loosely divided into two categories: \uf0a7 middle-income countries that are prone to natural disasters and have a medium response capacity (inadequate capacity to respond to a major disaster affecting more than one province); and \uf0a7 low-income countries that need international assistance or are at high risk of needing it. While most countries in the region have established independent national disaster management authorities at ministerial level, others have assigned this task to branches within the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Interior or even the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. In Central Asia, the emergency ministries are being transformed from military to civil protection models. As such they are being given more importance within government structures. Most countries within the region are moving towards implementing the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015. However, budgets and human resource capacity are limited, and methodologies and concepts are outdated. Information is often restricted, which hampers cooperation with non-state actors. Domestic legislation needs to be adapted to facilitate international humanitarian assistance. Finally, there is at times a certain reluctance to formally request international assistance among some governments that lack capacity to respond to domestic emergencies. \u2019 2.2 Overview of DG ECHO funded DRR intervention in the Horn of Africa, Central Asia and South Caucasus 2.2.1 DRR in Horn of Africa ECHO has been engaged in drought preparedness initiatives across the region since 2006, with a total budget of 90 million euros provided under five different Regional Drought Decisions (RDDs) \u2013 also known as the Drought Risk Reduction Action Plan or the DRRAP. As shown in Table 2.5, ECHO has funded drought-risk reduction activities in the region continuously over this period (2006 to 2013).

The country-specific and cross- border projects focussed on a variety of activities, generally with a focus on community- based activities and working with local authorities, although many (especially from 2010 onwards) also included good practices dissemination and advocacy components. Some country-based projects (for example, see projects 2010/011026, 2010/011025, and 011023 in Annex 3) focussed on data-collection and technical studies. The regional projects focussed on providing technical support (to other ECHO partners and to authorities and institutions), engaging in advocacy for DRR and coordination and were implemented by UN agencies, IFRC and REGLAP (a consortium of NGOs led by Oxfam). FAO was the first organisation to be assigned the role of coordinating and providing technical assistance to other DRRAP partners, although as other regional projects were funded, these partners (particularly REGLAP and UN-ISDR) also took on more of a coordinating role. The objective of the regional projects was also to improve the exchange of good practice and to collate and disseminate lessons learned and good practices and feed this information up to national government / ministries and other relevant stakeholders (e.g. media, teachers, local NGOs, local authorities). The 2008, 2009 and 2010 funding decisions split the budget available between \u2018downstream\u2019 community based DRR projects (84 per cent) and \u2018upstream\u2019 projects focussed on advocacy and institutional linkages (11 per cent). The remaining 5 per cent was allocated to a 3 million euros \u2018 reserve \u2019 in 2008. 26 Figure 2.2 illustrates this organisational approach.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 16 2.2.1.3 Evolution of the DRRAP from DRR to Resilience ECHO\u2019s intervention in the region has gradually evolved over time . The main features of this evolution have been: \u25a0 evolution in the thematic focus of the programme from assets and livelihoods protection to DRR to resilience; \u25a0 increased coordination with DEVCO; \u25a0 shift in focus from pastoral communities to other groups (such as pastoral \u2018dropouts\u2019) ; \u25a0 increasing emphasis on a consortium approach to funding; and \u25a0 increasing emphasis on advocacy for DRR. When it was first conceived in 2006, DRRAP had the main purpose of reducing the time taken to respond to drought. This developed in phase II (2008) into a focus on asset protection and (pastoral) livelihoods, with activities including destocking, veterinary services, etc. From 2009 (phase III) onwards, there was a shift in focus from livelihoods protection towards projects targeting basic services (health, WaSH, etc) for wider communities. Phase IV sought to consolidate lessons from the previous phases and also to increase the complementarity of DRRAP with other EU funded interventions in drought-affected communities such as the DEVCO-funded Kenyan Rural Development (KRDP) and Karamoja Livelihoods (KALIP) programmes. 28 A key turning point in ECHO\u2019s approach was the 2011 drought, which triggered a shift in focus towards the resilience agenda jointly with DEVCO. A strategic objective of the 2012 HIP for the HoA was to \u2018 strengthen local resilience through Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) activities \u2019 and that same year, ECHO together with DEVCO, created the SHARE initiative 29 (alongside the 2012 HIP) with a financial envelope of more than 270 million euros, which has the aim of boosting resilience in Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti and Somalia. In 2012, in addition to the 20 million euros available for DRR actions through the HIP, a further 22 million euros was made available through SHARE to be managed jointly by ECHO and DEVCO to build resilience to food insecurity and malnutrition in the HoA (mainly Kenya and Somalia) 30 to prevent the repetition of large-scale disasters deriving from drought. 31 The 2012 HIP therefore, only made available funding for country-specific actions in Ethiopia (although the odd project was also funded in Djibouti and Uganda) as well as funding new regional actions (projects 2012/91000, 2012/91015 in Annex 3). DRR has been increasingly mainstreamed into the resilience agenda in recent years. For example, a number of ECHO funded projects (that were funded under the 2012 HIP) focus on resilience and include DRR components. The year 2012 can be regarded as a transitional year as during that year, both stand-alone DRR projects as well integrated DRR projects (i.e. projects focusing on resilience, but including DRR components) were funded. This new approach seeks to achieve better coordination and linkages between humanitarian and development actors, more efficient spending and greater sustainability of actions. In Ethiopia, ECHO is now working closely together with the EU delegation to implement the resilience agenda. The EU delegation to Ethiopia was consulted on the 2014 HIP and participates in weekly management meetings with the Ethiopia Field Office of ECHO. EU- DEL Ethiopia and ECHO are now jointly programming their interventions on resilience in Ethiopia and have developed joint log-frames for development and humanitarian interventions. 32 Indeed, ECHO partners were encouraged in responding to the 2013 HIP to identify possible linkages between humanitarian interventions with existing or planned, long- 28 Interview with former DRRAP lead in the HoA RSO. 29 'Supporting the Horn of Africa's Resilience' (SHARE).

The target beneficiaries of ECHO\u2019s interventions ha ve also evolved over time in response to changing trends \u2013 particularly in the aftermath of the 2011 drought. ECHO has commonly funded projects targeting agro-pastoral communities specifically, in support of their livelihoods; however, as there have been indications that the most vulnerable groups of people may be those who have lost their cattle in previous disasters (see Section 3.4.1), ECHO has somewhat shifted the focus. Although the structural approach to funding country-specific, cross-border and regional projects remained the same throughout the DRRAP, the number of regional projects funded gradually increased throughout, to reflect the increasing importance placed on advocacy for DRR. The 2011 drought catalysed national and regional authorities to act and \u2013 with the support of ECHO - national heads of state of the affected countries in the region came together to show a strong political commitment to \u2018 End Drought Emergencies \u2019 (Nairobi Declaration of IGAD, 2011). ECHO was also strategic in its project selection, gradually selecting projects (e.g. 2010/01017, 2010/011024, and 2012/91000 in Annex 3) which would fill gaps in knowledge or technical capacity for DRR in the region. Throughout the DRRAP, ECHO sought to optimise the coordination of the funded actions. It did this partly by assigning FAO (and later REGLAP and UN-ISDR) to coordinate partners, by encouraging and facilitating cross-partner meetings and working groups and by directing some partners to work as consortia (see Section 3.10). From 2009 onwards, the four ECHO partners (Care, Cordaid, Coopi and VSF-DE) working in the cross-border area of Ethiopia and Kenya were encouraged to better coordinate their targeting of communities and project activities to improve efficiencies and the complementarity of approach. 34 Towards the end of the 2012 HIP, ECHO partners in Ethiopia were also reorganised into geographic \u2018 clusters \u2019 around specific woredas or districts (see Box 2) where ECHO had been repeatedly reacting in emergency response \u2013 i.e. where droughts and nutrition related emergencies were recurrently emerging (where other major internationally backed programmes were not operating). 35 This approach was formalised in the 2013 HIP, but most of the projects funded were a follow-on from DRRAP projects.

The following key developments and trends can be observed over the different DIPECHO cycles in CAC: \uf0a7 Common funding decision for CAC : In 2012, a common funding decision was introduced for CAC to ensure a more even distribution of funding across the two regions. Since the two regions share common (institutional) legacies and face similar risks, it was felt that a common funding decision would also promote a more coherent approach to DIPECHO across the wider region. Furthermore, to improve linkages and collaboration within and across the two regions, ECHO \u2019s regional office in Dushanbe (Tajikistan) was relocated to Almaty (Kazakhstan) in 2013 and the Tbilisi antenna linked to the Almaty office. \uf0a7 Closer collaboration with UN agencies in Central Asia: Since the fourth funding cycle, UN agencies have played a key role in the implementation of DIPECHO in Central Asia \u2013 see Table 2.7. In South Caucasus, where only two DIPECHO funding 36 As per the Funding Decisions. ",

In South Caucasus, which is relatively \u2018new\u2019 to DIPECHO, funded projects typically tend to be multi -country or regional in nature; only one country-specific project was funded during 2009 \u2013 2013.

The 2009 EU DRR Strategy and its implementation plan; 3. The 2012 Resilience Communication; 4. The Hyogo Framework for Action; 5. Other EU policies and programmes; and 6. Programmes and policies in the regions of intervention? In order to answer this evaluation question, it is first useful to understand the objectives of the ECHO-funded DRR interventions that are the subject of this evaluation. Table 3.2 sets out the stated objectives of these interventions as per the Funding Decisions. Although there are some differences in the way objectives are formulated across regions, the overriding objectives of DG ECHO-funded DRR interventions are essentially the same across the regions i.e. to reduce vulnerability and to build the resilience of populations at risk .

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 24 3.1.2 Coherence and complementarity with ECHO\u2019s legal base DRR is a core element of DG ECHO's mandate. Indeed, ECHO\u00b4s legal base 39 states in its Article 1 and 2 that: \u2018 Community's humanitarian aid [\u2026] shall also comprise operations to prepare for risks or prevent disasters or comparable exceptional circumstances \u2019 and that \u2018 The principal objectives of the humanitaria n aid operations [\u2026] shall be [\u2026] to ensure preparedness for risks of natural disasters [\u2026] and use a suitable rapid early -warning and intervention system. \u2019 The specific objectives of the Regional Drought Decisions and the DIPECHO programme - are thus in line with ECHO\u2019s legal base. Moreover, the activities of ECHO funded actions 40 can be linked to these objectives, as shown in subsequent sections of this Report (specifically Section 3.7). 3.1.3 Coherence and complementarity with the 2009 DRR Strategy The above-stated objectives of the Regional Drought Decisions and DIPECHO programme are also coherent with the overall approach and principles outlined in the 2009 DRR Strategy 41 . Table 3.3 provides a high level assessment of the extent to which ECHO funded DRR interventions in the HoA and CAC over the period 2009 \u2013 2013 were aligned with and contributed to the priority actions of the 2009 DRR Strategy. Detailed analysis with supporting evidence can be found in Annex 5. It should be noted that the assessment (\u2018+++\u2019 = High; \u2018++\u2019 = Medium; \u2018+\u2019= Low ) presented in Table 3.3 is relative and there is an element of subjectivity involved, as the judgement between \u2018 high \u2019 and \u2018 medium \u2019 or \u2018 medium \u2019 and \u2018 low \u2019 is not always clear cut. Despite these limitations, the table serves its purpose of providing a high level overview of the HFA priorities and specific areas of intervention that were more or less supported by ECHO funding over the period 2009 \u2013 2013 in the two regions covered by this evaluation. Needless to say, given ECHO\u2019s mandate and budget constraints, it would be unrealistic to expect ECHO to cover all HFA priorities in all regions and countries. The focus of ECHO\u2019s interventions in a particular region/ country is generally context specific and needs driven. However, any obvious gaps are noted in the assessment below: \uf0a7 ECHO funded actions in both the HoA and CAC were highly aligned with the objective of \u2018 strengthening disaster preparedness for effective response at all levels \u2019 . In both regions, ECHO funded several community based DRR projects aimed at enhancing preparedness through activities such as community disaster preparedness plans, stockpiling of equipment and supplies, capacity building, drills and exercises, early warning systems, structural mitigation projects, etc. \uf0a7 ECHO also funded several awareness-raising campaigns and actions to promote the inclusion of DRR in education and training in line with the strategic objective of \u2018 using knowledge, innovation, and education to build a culture of safety and resilience at all levels \u2019 . In South Caucasus, DIPECHO has been particularly successful in supporting the mainstreaming of DRR in the education sector (further discussed in Section 3.7.2). \uf0a7 ECHO-funded capacity building actions (such as support for DRR platforms, creation and development of DRR tools, training, etc) have also contributed to the strategic objective of strengthening the institutional basis for DRR implementation in all recipient countries . Through sustained advocacy efforts, ECHO funding has been 39 Council Regulation (EC) no. 1257/96 on Humanitarian Aid. 40 Annexes 3 and 4 provide an overview of the projects funded by ECHO over the period covered by this evaluation in the HoA and CAC, respectively. 41 [online] Available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:38474d44-d8fd-4a5b-8590- fec8d043d581.0004.03/DOC_1&format=PDF ",

There are however, limits to what ECHO can achieve in this area, given its mandate. Although national/ local authorities are being increasingly involved as local implementing partners in ECHO funded projects in both regions, international humanitarian principles (neutrality, impartiality, independence) prevent ECHO from working directly with political entities, such as national authorities and governments. Given these constraints, ECHO cannot directly influence high level policy making (but can only exercise indirect influence via advocacy efforts) or provide funding to government bodies for implementing DRR projects. Furthermore in CAC, the links between DRR and development planning and programming have not been fully established . Although a key plank of ECHO\u2019s strategy is to develop partnerships with development actors, this has been challenging in practice for many reasons. For instance, development actors have their own priorities and multi-annual plans and short term DIPECHO cycles are not aligned with their long term plans. Moreover, DEVCO programmes in the region have limited scope for integrating DRR \u2013 see Section 3.1.6. In the HoA, there has been an increased coordination between ECHO and DEVCO at HQ level on DRR and resilience in recent years, evidenced by joint communications on these themes and joint programming (SHARE ) in spite of the fact that the difference in planning cycles (1-2 years vs 5 years) can make this challenging. At the field level, there is now a high level of coordination between the ECHO field office and the EU Delegation in Ethiopia, but this has not been formalised in Kenya and Uganda. One positive development in Kenya is that ECHO and DEVCO now participate together in Kenya\u2019s ASAL monthly donor platform set up by the Kenyan national government to develop DRR policy and programming. \uf0a7 The objective of \u2018 reducing underlying risk factors \u2019 was not addressed as effectively in the two regions. For example, ECHO funding decisions in these regions did not \u2018 explicitly and harmoniously link DRR and adaptation objectives \u2019 ; although ECHO has funded several integrated projects addressing DRR and multiple issues (e.g. DRR / climate adaptation 42 / food security) through the SHARE initiative 43 in the HoA since 2012. Integrated programmes or projects have however, not yet been implemented in the CAC region.

The first phase was implemented over 2012- 2013, with a budget of more than \u20ac 250 million. It covered drought-affected areas of Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Djibouti. Its second phase (2014-2020) will cover the larger region of the Greater Horn of Africa.

The purpose of the 2012 Communication was to use the lessons from past experiences to improve the effectiveness of the EU's support aimed at reducing vulnerability in disaster- prone developing countries by including resilience as a central aim. It also aimed to contribute to the international debate on enhancing food security and resilience in a wider sense, notably in the context of the G8, G20, the Committee on World Food Security, the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) initiative, Rio Conventions\u2019 negotiations and the Global Alliance for the Horn of Africa. The Communication stressed the importance of embedding resilience as a long-term effort into national policies and planning. It also emphasises the cost-effectiveness of investing in resilience (costs saved in terms of money spent) and states that the Commission will systematically include resilience as an element in its humanitarian implementation plans (HIPs) and strive for joint programming with development so as to ensure that short-term actions lay the groundwork for medium and long-term interventions. The Communication identified three key components to be integrated in future EU resilience approach, namely: anticipating crises by assessing risks; focusing on prevention and preparedness; and enhancing crisis response. The Communication also identified 10 steps to increase resilience in food insecure and disaster prone countries, namely: (i) implement bottom-up approaches; (ii) be based on sound methodologies for risk and vulnerability assessments; (iii) focus on addressing the underlying causes of crises; (iv) ensure maximum complementarity between resilience- related actions in its humanitarian and development assistance; (v) introduce flexibility into the programme design to allow quick and timely action; (vi) addresses security aspects; (vii) share and exchange lessons with its partners in order to multiply and scale-up successful approaches; (viii) introduce innovative approaches to risk management; (ix) create platforms at country level for ensuring the timely exchange of information and the coordination of short, medium and long term humanitarian and development actions; and (x) promote resilience in international fora. Following the Resilience Communication, the Resilience Action Plan, adopted in June 2013 44 , provides the framework for continuation and scaling up of EU efforts for resilience at different levels and includes concrete country/region strategies and specific cases. It sets out three priority areas for EU action: \uf0a7 Support for the development and implementation of national resilience approaches integrated in National Development Plans . In this context, DRR approaches will pay specific attention to: i) targeted actions; ii) better understanding risks for enhanced early warning systems and improved decision making; iii) integrated approaches to DRR and climate change adaptation; iv) promoting DRR in recovery activities in the aftermath of a disaster; addressing underlying risk and vulnerability factors; and v) increasing attention to small-scale disasters; awareness raising and capacity building for local authorities and communities; community-based risk reduction. \uf0a7 Innovation, learning and advocacy .

Findings from HoA Findings from CAC Targeted actions By design, the DRRAP supports DRR specific actions By design, DIPECHO supports DRR specific actions Better understanding risks for enhanced early warning systems and improved decision making; vulnerability factors A number of funded projects have contributed to better understanding of the risks facing local communities and national- level risk and vulnerability factors through: \uf0a7 collation of community indicators of drought risk, \uf0a7 collection of other EW indicators of drought, and \uf0a7 research to understand risks, needs and resources at the national level. A number of funded projects have contributed to better understanding of the risks facing local communities and national- level risk and vulnerability factors through: \uf0a7 risk assessments, \uf0a7 development of datasets and mapping tools that enhance the understanding of these issues, and \uf0a7 knowledge sharing and dissemination actions. Integrated approaches to DRR and climate change adaptation (CCA) ECHO did not explicitly link DRRAP objectives to those of CCA. However, many of the DRRAP projects had objectives which align with those of CCA (i.e. to help communities adapt their behaviours, practices and surroundings to mitigate the impacts of natural hazards). Although the funding decisions encourage partners to integrate climate change adaptation into their actions, very few actually do so. Of the 16 projects funded under the 2012 Decision, only 5 projects explicitly considered climate change adaptation as a cross- cutting issue in the design of their actions. This finding should however, be interpreted in context. As stated in the funding decisions, climate change is not the main focus of DIPECHO. On the other hand, several DIPECHO VII projects have contributed to CCA objectives (even though CCA was not the goal being pursued by these projects), e.g. solar disinfection (SODIS) technologies and structural mitigation activities. Promoting DRR in recovery activities in the aftermath of a disaster; addressing underlying risk The DRRAP addressed many underlying risks, such as access to water, natural resource management, conflict, etc. Promoting DRR in recovery activities was not a focus of the DRRAP. A few examples can be found of projects addressing natural resource management (e.g. 91002, 91004, 91011) and watershed management (e.g. 91003). Increasing attention to small-scale disasters; awareness raising and capacity building for local authorities and communities; community-based risk reduction In the funding decisions, a relatively large share of DRRAP funding (~ 80 per cent) was allocated to community-based risk reduction (including capacity-building for local authorities and communities). The DRRAP not only brought attention to large scale droughts, but also to smaller-scale disasters such as animal epidemics, human epidemics and conflicts. Although there have been occurrences of large scale disasters, CAC is mainly affected by localised, small scale disasters which often go unnoticed by other actors. DIPECHO has played a key role in drawing attention to these disasters. Awareness raising, capacity building and community based DRR are strongly supported by DIPECHO. 45 SWD(2013) 227 final dated 19.6.2013 - Action Plan for Resilience in Crisis Prone Countries 2013-2020.

ECHO and DEVCO also co-chair an Inter-service group (ISG) in charge of coordinating the 2013 Resilience Action Plan (which convenes on a quarterly basis), although interviews with ISG- members based in Brussels have suggested that the group still has some way to go to enable the joint planning of resilience activities within the work streams of the member DGs. At field level, coordination between ECHO field office (ECHO Field) and the EU Delegation has been formalised in Ethiopia (as mentioned in Section 2.2). Up to Phase IV, there was also some coordination between ECHO the field office and the EU Delegation to Uganda, to the extent that DEVCO funded FAO to implement agro-pastoral field schools (APFS) initially piloted through DRRAP. However, the EU Delegation to Uganda now has less opportunity to plan and coordinate with ECHO since the Ugandan ECHO field office closed in 2011. In Kenya , ECHO and DEVCO have recently started participating in Kenya\u2019s ASAL donor platform set up by the Kenyan national government which meets on a monthly basis to support the national government in developing DRR policy and programming. However, management and decision-making on the SHARE initiative remains fairly separate, partly due to the differences in their funding approach (DEVCO works directly with governments, whereas ECHO works through NGOs, UN agencies and intergovernmental organisations). Annex 7 provides an overview of DEVCO\u2019s funding priorities in the countries covered by the evaluation. DEVCO has prioritised its funding on food security and rural development in the HoA (Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya and Uganda) which offers opportunities for complementarity with DG ECHO\u2019s support to rural communities affected by food insecurity. In Djibouti, the focus of DEVCO\u2019s fundi ng is on water / sanitation and energy and on support to the decentralisation process (including capacity-building of civil society). In Ethiopia and Uganda (and less so in Kenya), ECHO and DEVCO have tried to create synergies in their work. However, in Djibouti and Eritrea there is little evidence of coordination between ECHO and DEVCO. 3.1.6.2 Findings from CAC DEVCO is funding some DRR projects in the South Caucasus through the Prevention, Preparedness and Response to Natural and Man-made Disasters Programme (PPRD East 46 ). The programme covers the period 2011 to 2014 with a financial envelope of 6 million 46 Countries covered: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. ",

The overall objective of the programme is to contribute to the development of partner countries\u2019 civil protection capacities for prevention, preparedness and response as well as to bring them closer to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and to improve their bilateral and regional cooperation (Annex 8 provides further detail on the PPRD East programme). PPRD- East is thus, highly complementary to DIPECHO. In CAC, DRR is yet to be embedded within DEVCO\u2019s country -level multi-annual indicative programmes (MIPs). One of the main reasons for this is that DEVCO interventions in CAC countries are not particularly relevant for integrating DRR (see Annex 7). DEVCO programmes in CAC countries tend to focus on the following priorities: \uf0a7 democratic structures and good governance; \uf0a7 trade and investment, regulatory alignment and reform; \uf0a7 good governance and economic reform; and \uf0a7 judicial reform. There are however, some \u2018hooks\u2019 for DRR in DEVCO\u2019 s plans, e.g. infrastructure development (Armenia), and rural and local development schemes (Tajikistan and Uzbekistan). A more consistent approach is warranted from DIPECHO towards DEVCO\u2019s programming, through more sustained interventions by DIPECHO to identify, highlight and then to develop opportunities for synergies for the integrated treatment of DRR within programming and then implementation, usually under the argument that DRR must be included as a cross-cutting issue, but possibly also as a justification for work in a particular development sub-sector, such as for example in Tajikistan where the new EU strategy envisages large components of support for the rehabilitation of irrigation, food security, watershed management and rural development. 3.1.7 Coherence with other policies and programmes in the region 3.1.7.1 Findings from the HoA DRRAP has ensured complementarity with national programmes / policies in the HoA by responding to gaps in current national capabilities \u2013 see Table 3.6.

However, as acknowledged in the funding decisions, national policies and legislation tend to focus on rescue and relief activities, as \u2013 most countries still lack comprehensive and functional national disaster management plans and collaborative institutional arrangements, in particular to cover the LRRD agenda. There is no region-wide policy or strategy, despite efforts to develop a regional disaster response capacity under the Central Asian Disaster Risk Reduction Centre initiative. Project documentation refers to national policies and strategies, where these are available. However, national DRR/DRM policies are not publicly available documents in many CAC countries (Table 3.7), which makes it difficult to assess coherence and complementarity between DIPECHO and national strategies. 47 [online] Available at: http://www.eac.int/environment/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=169&tmpl=component&for mat=raw&Itemid=106 ",

In line with the policy objectives set out in the above high level documents, both DRRAP and DIPECHO have contributed to DRR awareness raising and capacity building at all levels \u2013 particularly, at a local level. The above strategies also call for an integrated approach to DRR and underlying risk factors. The integration of DRR into issues that constitute underlying risk factors has been (indirectly) supported by DIPECHO through efforts aimed at mainstreaming DRR within development policy and programming: rather than by directly funding integrated projects i.e. projects integrating DRR with CCA, natural resource management, environmental management, poverty reduction, protection of critical facilities, financial and economic tools to ensure a safety net in case of disasters, livelihood support, water purification, and erosion control, etc. These minor mis-alignments are justified given the constraints that ECHO works with, namely, a relatively small budget, short funding cycles, and the principle of not working directly with governments. In the HoA, integrated projects have already been funded through the SHARE initiative in 2012. The recent trend towards joint priority-setting on DRR between ECHO and DEVCO in the HoA is positive, and while this has not resulted in clear and/or continuous coordination on the ground in all countries (e.g. Kenya and Uganda), the joint agenda in Ethiopia may bear fruit in the future to define how the two Commission services should work together to complement their work on DRR in the region. 3.2 Cross-cutting issues EQ2. To what extent have the following cross-cutting issues been taken into account in the design and implementation of DRR strategies and activities? a. climate change adaptation; b. Linking Relief, Rehabilitation and Development (LRRD); c. children, the elderly, and disabled people; d. gender, in particular women's involvement, consultation and participation in projects; and e. involvement of local and regional community networks in the implementation of projects. 3.2.1 Key Findings from Horn of Africa Strategic level Two of the above cross-cutting issues were key features of DRRAP \u2019s funding decisions over the period 2009 - 2013: \u25a0 LRRD: DRRAP was designed to reduce the need for emergency response/relief to drought by addressing the root causes of drought and to better prepare affected communities to cope with it. The 2008 and 2009 funding decisions stated that DRRAP actions should \u2018 pave the way for longer-term development actions \u2019 while the 2012 HIP sought to \u2018 strengthen local resilience \u2019 . In this respect, the programme could be said to be linking relief to recovery and development. Indeed, the approach taken to tackling drought is highly coherent with the principles of LRRD. 49 \u25a0 Involvement of community networks : a major focus of the DRRAP, particularly from 2010 onwards was to involve communities in DRR. From 2010 this approach was commonly referred to as Community Managed DRR (CMDRR). From 2010 onwards, the DRRAP funding decision explicitly took into account the needs of specific groups of people (children, elderly, disabled, women). The 2008 and 2009 funding decisions did not explicitly require grant applicants to address specific groups such as 49 For a definition and description of LRRD see Annex 6. ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 36 children, the elderly, disabled persons and women in project design, but the 2010 funding decision encouraged grant applicants to focus on women and children \u2018 left behind \u2019 during drought by migrating male members of their families. The 2012 funding decision also encouraged partners to involve children, the elderly, the disabled, and minority and marginalised groups in their actions. While the 2008 to 2012 funding decisions recognise climate change as a key driver behind the increasing frequency and intensity of dry spells in the region, none of the funding decisions explicitly linked DRRAP objectives to CCA objectives. Nonetheless, there is a high degree of overlap between the activities commonly implemented as part of climate change adaptation, disaster-risk reduction and resilience-building (see Annex 6). Further, the objectives of each are mutually reinforcing \u2013 particularly in the context of drought, which is a climatic phenomenon. Projects (operational) level In the implementation of DRRAP activities (i.e. at project level), some cross-cutting issues (e.g. LRRD, inclusion of local communities) have been more systematically addressed than others (e.g. disabilities, elderly, children). Climate change adaptation (CCA) is \u2018 the adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climate stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities\u2019 (see Annex 6). In trying to adapt community (and national) practices, including management of natural resources, to better cope with the impact of drought, DRRAP can be seen as a tool for CCA. ECHO partners and the East African Community (EAC) Climate Change Policy both emphasise DRR as a tool for CCA. A detailed review of 39 projects was undertaken as part of this evaluation. Among other things, the review examined the extent to which these projects addressed CCA issues in their design and implementation. The evaluation found that 33 out of 39 projects made an explicit reference to CCA in project design (Single Form) and 28 out of 39 were judged to be implementing actions relevant to CCA. A number of DRRAP activities were also highlighted by wider humanitarian circles as being good practice examples of LRRD. 50 DRRAP interventions implemented LRRD in the following ways: \u25a0 supporting resilience-building projects (e.g. income-generation, livelihood support) whilst reserving a contingency (a crisis modifier) for emergency response or the scaling up of activity in case of a drought; \u25a0 creating working relationships between humanitarian and development actors to harmonise the approaches to DRR; \u25a0 linking DRRAP-funded humanitarian actions to ongoing development programmes 51 ; \u25a0 encouraging national authorities to take DRR into consideration in national development planning; \u25a0 combining relief and recovery activities (e.g. animal vaccinations, water trucking [in 2009] , cash for work) with longer term \u2018resilience\u2019 activities (e.g. institutional building, capacity-building, education); and \u25a0 addressing the root causes of vulnerability to drought, such as lack of access to basic services (water, medicine / health services, animal health services), behavioural issues (hygiene, NRM), poverty / financial insecurity, education, and lack of accurate data on future disasters. 50 VOICE - CONCORD position paper (2012) Linking Relief Rehabilitation and Development (LRRD): Towards a more joined up approach enhancing resilience and impact. 51 E.g., the 2010 Oxfam project on Participatory Community Disaster Risk Reduction in Turkana and Wajir \u2013 project reference 01007, which linked directly to the DMI. ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 37 Most project designs describe how the projects would include women amongst their target beneficiaries, e.g. by ensuring they are represented on committees 52 . However, only a few of the DRRAP projects specifically targeted women, e.g. by creating female-only resource user groups (e.g. 2012/91058), by establishing women-only income-generation opportunities (e.g. 2010/01001, 2010/01009), by targeting aid at women-headed households (2010/01022) and by providing gender-targeted and gender-relevant training (e.g. in household hygiene) (2010/01016). This is not a criticism of the programme, as research into gender-sensitive DRR programming \u2013 published through the DRRAP-funded REGLAP project \u2013 suggests that while women should be involved as potential \u2018 agents of change \u2019 in DRR activities, this does not necessarily require women-only targeting. REGLAP has published studies on the gender-specific impacts of drought which suggest that strategies for addressing drought should pay better attention to the role that women play in societies and how this might be changing. 53 Women are amongst the most vulnerable to drought in their communities because they have more limited access to assets than men during drought (men tend to look after livestock) and may also have a greater number of arduous tasks to perform (women tend to be responsible for water and wood collection). ECHO partners have reflected this gender-specific vulnerability in their needs assessments, and projects implemented at community-level have ensured that both men and women were represented in community activities (e.g. by including a \u2018quota\u2019 of women in CDMCs, WUCs, etc). Box 3 provides some examples of the results of activities addressing women\u2019s DRR needs. Box 3 Examples of DRRAP activities specifically targeting women One ECHO project specifically engaged with women (representing 60 per cent of the work force in the target communities) to secure their participation in cash for work activities (rehabilitation of ponds, hay-making, hide and skin preservation and honey production) and by training women-only groups in business development, household resilience was automatically improved (as women used their money to buy food and household items). A total of 25,312 women benefitted from these activities. 54 By creating opportunities for hay- making and pasture closer to the village, the project also reduced the burden on women to walk long distances for water and hay and to look after sick and lactating livestock. During the field trip to Ethiopia, the evaluation team spoke to women in women-only SACCOs/VICOBAs and women in CMDRRs and there was some evidence that women in such committees or lending groups were empowered. This corroborates the findings of the recent evaluation of the four Kenya-Ethiopia cross-border projects. 55 These committees also generated and strengthened support networks between attending women. Children were also identified as amongst the most vulnerable to drought, particularly because they are the most affected by malnutrition. Over the period evaluated, 11 of the 81 projects (14 per cent) specifically targeted children, usually by introducing a DRR component into local school curricula or by setting up DRR youth groups. The general belief among ECHO partners interviewed was that community based DRR activities automatically benefit children, by improving the resilience of households. For example, income-generation activities can have a positive impact on children, as this provides households with the means 52 84% or 11 out of a sample of 13. 53 Flintan, F (2011) \u2018The importance of gender in drought and DRR\u2019 in Disaster risk reduction in the drylands of the Horn of Africa, Edition 2, December 2011.

At least 23 per cent of all projects included some element of income-generation: either cash for work (6 projects) or livelihood diversification (13 projects). In phase V of the DRRAP (2012), four DRRAP projects (2008/01003, 2012/ 91034, 2012/91060, 2012/91027) introduced DRR modules into school curricula in target communities. The evaluation team met with one school group based in Kacheri, Karamoja (Uganda). Children reported that through their learning they had been able to encourage behaviour change in the home (e.g. sufficient re-heating of meat, increased variety of diet, storage of \u2013 as opposed to selling - food). Save the Children in 2012 also collected Early Warning indicators in schools and UN-ISDR targeted teachers as part of its project to mainstream DRR. 3.2.2 Key Findings from CAC Both the 2009 Funding Decision for South Caucasus and the 2010 Funding Decision for Central Asia state that DIPECHO will support the integration of CCA into DRR operations by increasing the understanding of climate change issues by beneficiaries and promoting the implementation of CCA actions. The 2012 HIP for CAC states that \u2018 climate change cannot be the sole focus of DIPECHO interventions; however DRR measures can integrate climate change adaptation and environment protection components where relevant, and always in a natural disaster context \u2019 . This limitation of scope (i.e. climate change should not be tackled by proposed projects as a standalone topic), was highlighted as problematic by partners at the two debriefing workshops organised as part of this evaluation. Partners also expressed a need for more clarity on the treatment of CCA within DIPECHO. All funding decisions that fall within the scope of this evaluation also highlight the following cross-cutting issues as focus areas of intervention: involvement of women, children, and vulnerable groups such as the disabled and ethnic minorities; and environmental protection. The funding decisions or accompanying guidance notes do not however, elaborate on how these cross-cutting issues should be integrated in project design and implementation. In practice, not all cross-cutting issues are systematically addressed by projects. An in-depth analysis of project documentation reveals that: \uf0a7 Only 5 out of 16 projects funded under the 2012 Decision addressed CCA as a cross- cutting issue. This was done through the provision of training or organising awareness raising activities on the topic. What does not yet seem clear to partners, is the diversity and depth of potential approaches to adaptation, such as community- based adaptation, ecosystem-based adaptation and the incorporation of indigenous and traditional knowledge, which can greatly enrich and complement existing methods of DRR. \uf0a7 A number of projects have made special efforts to reach out to and engage women and children in their DRR activities, e.g. an Oxfam project (91011), inter alia , organised focus group discussions in each target community in Armenia to identify gender and youth needs in DRR. These findings were used to develop the Training of Trainers (TOT) curriculum. A Save the Children project (91005) made special efforts to ensure that women and girls were represented on Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT) and Children's Clubs (CC), created with the help of the project. As part of the same project, training on \u2018 child protection during emergencies \u2019 and \u2018 child friendly spaces \u2019 was delivered to 1,775 women from Women's Groups from the Jilikul district in Tajikistan. Oxfam first established Women Disaster Preparedness Groups (WDPGs) in early 2008 and has continued to establish these groups in the successive DIPECHO cycles. The purpose of the WDPGs is to build the capacity of women on disaster awareness issues so they can disseminate this knowledge to the wider community. \uf0a7 The education sector and child-focussed DRR interventions were a core element of six projects. These projects were specifically designed to improve the knowledge and disaster coping capacity of children through various means, such as formal and informal education measures, the creation of youth clubs, peer to peer learning, ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 39 organisation of theatre performances and puppet shows, competitions, simulations in schools, etc. One such project (91012) targeted kindergarten students and special needs children. This particular project \u2013 implemented by Save the Children - successfully advocated for the rights and needs of children in kindergartens in Georgia and those with disabilities in Armenia to ensure the inclusion of both groups in national DRR policies and local procedures. The project team produced bespoke inclusive DRR educational resources for children with and without special needs. The education material included interactive and innovative materials (game book, teacher guide, calendar for correct and wrong behaviour, posters and an audio CD) developed by the project officer with prior experience of working with children with learning difficulties. A Braille version of DRR educational material was also developed, published and provided to schools for children with vision impairments. \uf0a7 Only three examples could be found of projects where special attention was given to the needs of the elderly. One such project was delivered by ACTED (91003), which among other things, delivered age awareness training to target communities to foster an understanding of the plight of the infirm and elderly in the event of a natural disaster. \uf0a7 A vast majority of the projects which were community-based involved local community members and organisations. \uf0a7 Although LRRD is not explicitly mentioned as a cross-cutting issue in the CAC funding decisions, any feasible exit strategy at programme/ project level would de facto be addressing the issue of LRRD (the most effecti ve \u2018exit route\u2019 for DRR is to integrate it within development programming). A detailed review of project documentation and interviews however, suggests that the concept of LRRD is not very well understood among most partners (as also evidenced by weak exit strategies \u2013 see Section 3.7.4 on sustainability). Overall, the links between ECHO funded DRR projects, and development planning and programming are weak. 3.2.3 Conclusions In the HoA, the cross-cutting issues of LRRD and the involvement of communities are adequately addressed. Gender issues are also well reflected in project design, although during the implementation phase, ECHO partners could arguably have done more to address the specific needs of women by designing specific DRR actions for women rather than merel y ensuring women\u2019s inclusion . The needs of children and the elderly \u2013 were even less well addressed and those of disabled persons were not addressed at all. In CAC, projects were seen to have made special efforts to reach out to and engage women and children in DRR activities. However, only a handful of the projects considered the special needs of the elderly and disabled. This can partly be explained by the nature of projects supported: 6 projects (out of 16) were specifically designed for children (including children with special needs); while a handful of projects targeted stakeholders and institutions. Considering that these projects were designed for specific target groups, it is understandable that these projects did not take into account the needs of elderly, for instance. The cross-cutting issues of climate change adaptation and LRRD were not adequately addressed either at a strategic level (i.e. in the funding decisions) or at a project level in CAC. By design, CCA was not meant to be systematically addressed as a cross- cutting issue under DIPECHO. Rather, partners were encouraged to incorporate CCA elements in project design and implementation where feasible. It has been more challenging to link humanitarian/ DRR issues with development planning and programming in CAC for reasons previously explained (the misalignment between DIPECHO cycles and the long term plans of development actors, lack of sufficient \u2018hooks\u2019 for DRR within DEVCO\u2019s programmes, the low priority attached to DRR by national authorities and donors alike, etc). In both regions, given the focus on community-based DRR, community networks (where these exist), community level stakeholders and members were typically involved in project ",

To what extent have DG ECHO-funded DRR interventions addressed the needs of the most vulnerable communities in the areas most exposed to frequent natural hazards? Is there evidence of (contin uing) need for DG ECHO funding for DRR in the regions concerned? Is DG ECHO\u2019s approach to DRR relevant and appropriate in the regions concerned? 3.3.1 Key Findings from the HoA Addressing the needs of the most vulnerable The funding decisions covered by this evaluation targeted \u2018 vulnerable populations \u2019 exposed to drought \u2013 identified as people living is ASALs and in the 2008, 2009 and 2010 funding decisions, these were specified as agro-pastoralist and pastoralist communities (see Table 3.8). The 2012 HIP does not specify any particular socio-economic groups as target beneficiaries. 58 Table 3.8 Target areas and communities Funding Decision Target Areas Target Groups ECHO/-HF/BUD/2008/01000 Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda Nomadic and semi nomadic pastoralists and agro-pastoralists ECHO/-HF/BUD/2009/01000 Djibouti (whole territory); Eritrea (whole territory); Ethiopia (Southern and Eastern); Kenya (Northern); Somalia (whole territory); Uganda (Karamoja) As above ECHO/-HF/BUD/2010/01000 As above As above, plus non-nomadic groups and a particular focus on women and children left behind ECHO/-HF/BUD/2012/91000 (2012 DRAAP) Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Uganda (Karamoja) Does not specify any particular socio-economic group, but states projects should prioritise the elderly, the disabled, minority and marginalised groups ECHO\u2019s funding decisions provide a contextual picture of vulnerability in the target geographic regions, citing and drawing upon a comprehensive range of sources of information: (i) tools such as the Global Vulnerability and Crisis Assessment Tool; (ii) indicators such as TLU (Tropical Livestock Unit) / AAME (Adult African Male Equivalent) ratio; GAM (global acute malnutrition) rates; food insecurity levels; mortality rates, etc (iii) 56 Financing decision ECHO/-HF/BUD/2013/91000. 57 Financing decision ECHO/WWD/ BUD/2014/01000. 58 In 2012, DG ECHO changed from the use of Financial Decisions to Humanitarian Implementation plans (HIPs), a funding decision with a different format which did not require target beneficiaries to be made explicit, but rather refers to \u2018potential beneficiaries\u2019.

The funding decisions typically provide a country level overview of the humanitarian context, needs and risks and indicate for each country covered by the Decision, the specific areas and socio-economic groups that are most exposed to hazards. Data on hazard risks and wider literature confirms that the geographic areas targeted by the DRRAP are the most vulnerable to drought in the region (e.g. Karamoja in Uganda, North and East Kenya, and Eastern and Southern Ethiopia). They are also often the most politically and economically marginalised within their countries, 59 which means that there is little or no access to basic services (e.g. health services, money-lending institutions) and little or no investment in infrastructure (e.g. maintenance of water sources, accessible roads). Pastoralists and agro- pastoralists dominate the ASALs of the HoA 60 and have been typically considered to be vulnerable because droughts affect their livelihoods (leads to animal disease, crop-yield failure and loss of livestock). These groups have also been considered vulnerable as a result of economic policies, 61 and general changes to the patterns of pastoralism and agro- pastoralism in (some parts of) the region 62 . Migration, a traditional mechanism for coping with drought, has been impeded by the creation of national parks and political boundaries. 63 Increasingly, studies 64 have suggested that the groups most vulnerable to drought are non- pastoralists or former pastoralists (\u2018drop - outs\u2019) who have lost assets (land, livestock) and who are struggling to survive on unsustainable livelihoods, such as charcoal burning. For example, an analysis of changes in wealth and livelihood strategies in the ASAL zones of Ethiopia that ECHO Field shared with the evaluation team suggested that ex-pastoralists and diversified pastoralists are currently amongst the most vulnerable and dependent on food aid and social protection, whereas pastoralists are drought resilient and \u2018 cashing in \u2019 on increased meat demand. 65 However, evidence is lacking on a sufficiently wide scale to effectively document / analyse the relationship between livelihoods and vulnerability in the HoA, which makes it challenging to conclusively identify the \u2018 most vulnerable \u2019 in the region. ECHO funding decisions have consistently targeted agro-pastoralist and pastoralist communities, 66 but ECHO has also recognised the needs and vulnerabilities of other groups, including pastoral \u2018drop - outs\u2019, which from 2008 were recognised as a group at greater risk of malnutrition due to a \u2018 chronic dependency on outside assistance \u2019 . 67 From 2010 onwards, ECHO made it explicit that the programme should cover non-nomadic groups of pastoralists with a particular focus on women and children left behind in semi-permanent settlements 59 Mosley (2012) Translating Famine Early Warning into Early Action: An East Africa Case Study , Chatham House, Energy, Environment and Development Programme (EEDP)/Africa Programme Paper: 2012/04 \u2013 the paper refers specifically to North and North East Kenya and South and East Ethiopia. 60 It is estimated that there are 30 million (agro)-pastoralists in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and parts of Tanzania inclusive (Morton, J.

In 2012, also in keeping with ECHO\u2019s focus on children, the elderly and women as \u2018 cross-cutting issues \u2019 , the HIP stated that it would prioritise the elderly, the disabled, minority and marginalised groups. Arguably, by targeting \u2013 or making mention of \u2013 specific socioeconomic groups, ECHO has risked excluding other vulnerable groups (e.g. the so-called pastoral dropouts or non- pastoralists, particularly those relying on less sustainable livelihoods such as charcoal burning and casual labour). It has also made it challenging to monitor and measure the extent to which vulnerable groups have been supported, as none of the funding decisions which framed the DRRAP have made explicit the criteria on which \u2018 vulnerability \u2019 was assessed. The contextual information required assessment and a description of target beneficiaries only implied the parameters on which vulnerability was analysed. As a result, it is unclear exactly how ECHO partners could then identify the most vulnerable communities when selecting between communities on the ground. While ECHO has commissioned several studies to look at vulnerability, none of these studies examine \u2018 relative vulnerability \u2019 at a community level in each target country. DRRAP partner, Save the Children, conducted a localised study into vulnerability, its consequences and its drivers, which was published in the REGLAP journal, 68 but this was funded through a different donor programme. 69 A review of Single Forms shows that ECHO partners have used a range of approaches and criteria to identify vulnerable areas and communities in their needs assessments. \uf0a7 Approaches used include field assessments, end beneficiary consultations, mappings (e.g. of pastoral migrations, grazing and watering grounds, etc), drought hazard and food security assessments, use of studies and reports, and the partner\u2019s own experience of being in the region for many years. Some lead partners (e.g. IFRC, Cordaid, DCA [in Ethiopia only]) also involved their local implementing partners when carrying out a needs assessment. \uf0a7 Criteria include intensity of the hazard and resource-availability, 70 livelihood types 71 and willingness / capacity of the community to participate in the intervention 72 . All ECHO partners presented robust evidence in their project design that the targeted communities experienced major exposure to drought and its impacts . Visits to 21 communities benefitting from DRRAP actions confirmed that the communities selected were located in rural areas, susceptible to drought and often with unreliable or poor quality water sources and typically exposed also to other hazards such as inter-group conflict (over resources or as a result of inter-ethnic rivalries). It was only in Ethiopia where the evaluation team visited one location (Errer woreda in the Shinille zone) where access to resources did not appear as pronounced in other regions, and thus the intervention did not seem as relevant. 68 See Ruiz- Bascaran (2013) \u2018 Surveying pastoral dropouts in the Somali Region of Ethiopia and the implications for DRR programming\u2019 . 69 Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the RAIN (Revitalising Agricultural and pastoral Incomes and New markets) project. 70 Oxfam\u2019s 2009 project in Kenya ( Northern Kenya Drought Preparedness Project ) targeted \u2019 Strategically important water-points \u2018 and Coopi\u2019s 2009 cross -border project (Enhanced Drought Preparedness Adaptive Strategies in Northern Kenya and Southern Ethiopia ) targeted \u2019strategic livestock concentration areas\u2019. 71 Many projects which sought to prevent / reduce livestock disease, particularly in 2008 and 2009 targeted pastoralists / agro-pastoralists, as did those which included Pastoral Field Schools as an activity. 72 For example, German Agro Action interviewed members of communities in drought prone areas to identify those who would be most committed, with a view to enhancing sustainability of the project in implementing its \u2018Consolidation of Drought Preparedness & Resilience in Vulnerable Poor Pastoral and Agro Pastoral Areas\u2019 in Kajiado District , Rift Valley Province, Kenya \u2013 project reference 01013 (2009).

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 43 Yet, at a more granular level, when selecting beneficiary communities and individuals, there is inconsistency in the extent to which ECHO partners provide clear indicators and judgement criteria for their selection of \u2018 most vulnerable \u2019 or other target groups . This makes it challenging to assess whether the communities selected were the most in need. As previously indicated in Section 2, a relatively large proportion of DRRAP-funded projects were community based. These community based DRR projects sometimes targeted specific groups identified to be highly vulnerable, including pastoral drop-outs (e.g. Care UK, 73 Save the Children in Ethiopia 74 , Caritas, 75 Oxfam, 76 HelpAge 77 ), but several of these projects covered the entire community (as opposed to specific households or groups within the community). One of the ECHO partners interviewed argued that the activities implemented (e.g. WaSH infrastructure, DRR capacity-building) benefitted all members of the community including the most vulnerable, but the evidence for this is not very clear. Another ECHO partner interviewed implied that their project was aimed at preventing vulnerability by targeting those who had not yet reached \u2018crisis - point\u2019 : \u2018 Pastoral drop-outs occur in stages: y ou don\u2019t suddenly go from 100 cows to 0. First you become an agro - pastoralist, then drop-out altogether. Giving seeds/seedlings to beneficiaries helps to keep them in the loop. As such we have indirectly had an impact on drop-outs \u2019 . It should however, be noted that many of the DRRAP projects were aimed at advocacy and institution/ capacity building and as such, targeted \u2018multipliers \u2019 \u2013 e.g. government, institutions, CSOs, teachers, health practitioners, etc who have the capacity to reach a wider number of beneficiaries in the future (e.g. by investing in DRR, by raising awareness on DRR, or by improving community resilience). 78 Other approaches to reaching the most vulnerable have been followed by other donors (see Annex 9 which provides a mapping of donors active in the HoA). Indeed, one ECHO partner noted that \u2013 in Kenya \u2013 the most vulnerable persons are not necessarily supported by ECHO, they are covered by food aid / social safety net programmes. 79 Continuing need for DG ECHO funding for DRR in the HoA The issue of continuing need for ECHO funding in the HoA was examined at two levels: \uf0a7 firstly, beneficiary perspectives were collected to ascertain if the ECHO-funded DRR actions were addressing their needs; and \uf0a7 secondly, a country level assessment was carried out to determine if there were any un-met needs or gaps that could be supported by ECHO in future. Beneficiary perspectives Generally beneficiaries consulted during field visits confirmed that ECHO funded interventions were relevant to their specific needs and that they were satisfied with the project outputs. They also confirmed that they wanted more of the same (e.g. refresher training) if further funds were to be made available, rather than something different. Some ECHO partners have managed to secure funding from other donors to continue their actions 73 Regional Resilience Enhancement Against Drought (RREAD) Programme. 74 Preparedness Improves Livelihoods And Resilience (PILLAR). 75 Drought Preparedness and Emergency Response Operation in Eastern Ethiopia. 76 Ethiopia Somaliland Cross Border Community Based Drought Risk Management Project. 77 E-LEAP (Learning, Evaluation and Advocacy Programme) for the inclusion and active participation of vulnerable groups through. 78 In 2009 and 2010, the IFRC regional project targeted communities who were not only vulnerable to drought and (in 2009 especially) poor, but also those who were exposed to new possibilities for linking to local power structures, due to an influx of foreign investment. 79 Interview with Daphne Callies, La Nina Consortium lead \u2013 note that La Nina is not part of the DRRAP but has been included under the framework of this evaluation.

Country level assessment The mid-term review of the HFA made it clear that national governments bear the primary responsibility for reducing disaster risk, supported where required by the international community. Countries in the HoA face high levels of drought risk, while lacking the financial (and technical) capacity to reduce their own levels of risk. ECHO has therefore, been funding DRR in the region since 2006 (at a time when no other donors were funding DRR in the region) and more recently, other donors have also started supporting DRR in the HoA (Annex 9). Much has been achieved in these countries - with ECHO and donor support - in advancing the DRR agenda and architecture in recent years and particularly since the 2011 drought, which drew worldwide attention to the plight of these countries. Countries like Kenya and Ethiopia have made significant progress in institutionalisation of DRR at national and sub-national levels, although in Djibouti, Somalia and Uganda institutionalisation of DRR still has some way to go (see Section 3.7.2 on mainstreaming). Weaknesses remain even in countries that have made progress. Sub-national/ local-level financing/ capacity, transparency and accountability, and the integration of non-government finance all need significant improvement. For example, district-level DRR institutions are being given greater autonomy in Ethiopia and Kenya and these should, in theory, support communities in raising awareness on DRR and funding resilience-building projects. Yet, these institutions still require funding and capacity-building support (see Table 3.6 in Section 3.1.7). Moreover, HoA countries are likely to remain reliant on international assistance given their low/ lower-middle income and high risk profile (Table 3.9). Although the examples of Indonesia and Philippines (which can be classified as lower-middle income and high-risk) suggest that \u2018 national financing of DRR is not about the availability of funding but rather about the priority attached to the need to fund. \u2019 80 The discussion above and the evaluative evidence presented previously in Table 3.6 shows that critical gaps remain in national/ local DRR capacity in HoA countries that can only be filled with support from the international community \u2013 at least in the short term. This suggests a continued role for ECHO in funding DRR in the region. In fact, recent analysis suggests that many of these countries - Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda \u2013 receive disproportionately low levels of financial assistance from the international community for DRR 81 despite the substantial risk of disasters (caused by droughts, but also other hazards as indicated in Section 2.1.1) and low financial capacity.

London: ODI. 3.3.2 Key Findings from CAC Addressing the needs of the most vulnerable The funding decisions for CAC provide an analysis of the most disaster prone areas in each of the countries covered by DIPECHO. However, funding decisions neither identify the most vulnerable communities within these areas, nor provide a definition or metrics of vulnerability \u2013 Table 3.10. A review of project documentation and findings from the fieldwork suggest that partners have used a variety of top-down approaches to identify disaster prone areas (e.g. national DRR strategies, datasets on hazard risks and occurrences 83 , research and reports produced by other actors including DG ECHO) and bottom-up, participatory approaches to identify potential target communities or villages within these areas, e.g. Knowledge-Attitude- Practices (KAP) surveys, observations, needs assessments, prior experience, stakeholder and community consultations, etc. Once potential target communities have been identified, partners typically apply the following criteria (to varying degrees of detail and sophistication) to make the final selection (see Figure 3.1): \uf0a7 communities with limited coping capacities; \uf0a7 socio-economic vulnerability of the population (projects use different sources and metrics for vulnerability analysis); \uf0a7 geographic remoteness; \uf0a7 openness to DRR and willingness of the community to collaborate and take ownership of program; \uf0a7 communities less supported by other NGOs and DRR stakeholders; \uf0a7 commitment of local and regional authorities to support the action; and \uf0a7 capacities of the implementing partners in selected areas, presence of local branch, staff and volunteers with relevant knowledge and expertise. Projects typically cover the entire community. Where activities focus on specific groups, beneficiaries (households) are not necessarily selected on the basis of comparative or 82 Annual average percentage of the population that is affected by natural disasters classified as either droughts, floods, or extreme temperature events. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated. 83 E.g. the risk atlas produced by the Caucasus Environmental NGO Network (CENN) for Georgia.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the process of selection of target communities and beneficiaries is not fully transparent and overly influenced by stakeholder opinions rather than factual evidence 84 . Efforts have been made to develop common models for vulnerability assessment to assess risks and to rank communities in rural areas. The work done by Oxfam Georgia under DIPECHO II, was major step forward, where their \u2018 Common Tools for Vulnerability Analysis - CTVA \u2019 (see Box 4) have now been taken up by national actors 85 and by other partners, such as by ACF in their DIPECHO-funded work in Abkhazia and Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti. A Common Tools Working Group was established by Oxfam with the involvement of governmental agencies and civil society actors. It is now envisaged that data collected by various government agencies and civil society organisations will be available on a website and a training package will be developed so that regions can be compared in terms of their level of vulnerability. Awareness and interest in CTVA was expressed by stakeholders in the debriefing workshop in Dushanbe. 84 Based on an assessment of Single Forms and evaluative evidence, e.g. Murtaza, N.

Continuing need for DG ECHO funding for DRR in CAC Beneficiary and partner perspectives Beneficiaries and partners have expressed a demand for continued ECHO funding, given that in most CAC countries: \uf0a7 Communities remain vulnerable to complex hazards (hydro-meteorological, geological and combined) which are being altered under the ongoing impacts of climate change. \uf0a7 DRR is not yet a real national priority, although there are some exceptions. Half the countries in the region do not have a DRR strategy in place (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan), and where these exist, they are not underpinned by a targeted commitment to spend or earmarked financial envelopes. Coordinated and coherent national financing of DRR is lacking in all countries. \uf0a7 Local governments do not have the resources or the capacities to invest in DRR, suggesting that partners will likely remain reliant on outside donors. The legacy of Soviet command societies and civil conflicts makes decentralisation difficult, and the development of competent, sustainable and well-resourced DRR institutions within municipal governments, remains rare. However, partners have, with exceptions, done little systematic advocacy directed towards other potential donors aimed at diversifying the donor field and increased their attention to and funding for DRR - although ECHO argues that donors have shown little interest in funding DRR in the region so far. There are considerable opportunities for DIPECHO, for example alongside national platforms (where these exist), to analyse the issue of how partners can identify and advocate for more diversified funding streams, for example from climate adaptation international funding. Country level assessment When undertaking the fieldwork, the evaluators also noted gaps and needs, e.g. DRR needs in urban contexts, gaps in national/ local government competencies and tools in hazard mapping and geographical information systems, both for DRR and land use management. The range of risks and financing needs however, is very different across CAC countries as shown in Table 3.11. Of the countries covered by DIPECHO, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Armenia are perhaps the most in need of ECHO support.

In some cases, the rationale for targeting less vulnerable groups is logical and relevant, but in other cases the logic is unclear, not least because the criteria for community selection are not specified. The inconsistency between projects in the clarity and relevance of beneficiary selection is driven in part by the lack of guidance from ECHO in its funding decisions/ HIPs. Similarly in CAC, DIPECHO projects have generally targeted communities located in the areas most exposed to natural hazards. However, in the absence of comprehensive and comparable vulnerability assessments, it is not possible to determine whether participating communities/ villages were the \u2018 most vulnerable \u2019 . While some initial work is promising, such as CTVAs in Georgia, across CAC countries there is a paucity of comparative assessments of vulnerability (at a community level) or even national DRR datasets and strategies. It is widely accepted that the main responsibility for DRR financing lies with the national governments, supported where required by the international community. In such a context, ECHO\u2019s approach to DRR has been to \u2018get things off the ground\u2019 and to \u2018exit\u2019 once this has been achieved. However, while ECHO partners do appreciate that ECHO cannot be an eternal source of funding, in many countries they are stymied in obtaining diversified funding, due to the lack of international donor support for DRR and/or lack of national/ local financial capacity. In both regions, there is arguably a continuing role for ECHO financed DRR not only as a stand-alone activity but also as one that is integrated into development planning, which is increasingly seen as the way forward. However, DRR needs and capacities vary across countries. For example, the DRR agenda and institutional set-up is more advanced in some countries than in others (e.g. Kenya, Ethiopia), while some countries do not necessarily require external financing for DRR (e.g. Kazakhstan). This calls for a more selective approach going forward. 3.4 Internal coherence EQ4. Do the actions have clearly specified impact pathways (causal chain or logical framework) for each of their principal activities and outputs? Are the assumptions and risks underpinning the intervention logics realistic and reasonable? In particular: what other actions (outside ECHO) need to ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 52 happen for the planned impacts to be achieved? Have those actions been directly addressed in the programme design (for example through assessment of the assumptions and risks associated with reliance on policies, capacities and actions of national institutions [public and private], partnerships, or through work on the policy environment)? ECHO partners are required to: \uf0a7 provide an intervention logic for their project in the Single Forms setting out: o the principal objective of their action, o specific objectives, o results, o activities contributing to the results, o objectively verifiable indicators, and o sources of verification. \uf0a7 identify the underlying pre-conditions, risks and assumptions; and \uf0a7 subsequently, develop appropriate contingency plans 88 for addressing the identified risks. ECHO assesses the above elements as part of the selection process and at the interim/ final reporting stages; and records its observations in the fiche-ops. The log-frame format used by ECHO in the Single Forms is the standard format used by donors. However, as the same activity can contribute to multiple results, it leads to fragmentation and repetition in the monitoring and reporting of progress against activities and results. The objectively verifiable indicators are non-standardised across projects, making it hard to carry out a comparison of similar activities between projects or to obtain a global picture of the outputs and results delivered at a programme level. Although ECHO\u2019s thematic paper 89 sets out a series of indicators for monitoring the outputs and results of DRR actions, these have not been introduced in ECHO\u2019s funding decisions. 3.4.1 Key Findings from the HoA Aside from the above general remarks, the specific observations of the evaluators with respect to projects funded in the HoA are as follows: \uf0a7 Interventions are underpinned by clearly specified intervention logics. There is generally a logical link between project activities and results. In cases where partners have designed illogical or poor quality intervention logics, ECHO has provided close support to help them improve this. 90 \uf0a7 The monitoring indicators are not always \u2018 S pecific M easurable A chievable R elevant and T imebound\u2019 . \uf0a7 Although the fiche-ops show that DG ECHO is often satisfied by the risks identified, the evaluation team observed that partners tend to identify only a few main risks / pre-conditions and very few elaborate their contingency plans in sufficient detail. Interviews with ECHO partners and observations in the field have shown that the main risks which have affected the achievement of project objectives in the region have been security in the region (restricting or preventing access to project sites), 88 See Section 8.1 of the Single Forms. 89 DG ECHO (2013) Disaster Risk Reduction: Increasing resilience by reducing disaster risk in humanitarian action. 90 E.g. in the case of the 2010 FAO project in Djibouti (01024). ",

These were not adequately addressed in the project design. Good practice in doing so is demonstrated by Care UK who in their 2012 Single Form identify individual risk events, rating the probability of their occurrence, the potential impact, the person responsible for managing the risk (who could be an actor external to the project, e.g. a national authority), the method for identifying whether the risk has occurred and the contingency plan. \uf0a7 ECHO\u2019s monitoring of the projects as documented in the fiche -ops shows that ECHO provides support and feedback to partners to help them improve risk assessment. For example, in 2012, following the 2011 drought which affected the implementation of DRRAP projects, ECHO (in its fiche-ops) encouraged partners to identify drought as a key risk and provide a mitigation strategy. Yet in consideration of the implementation challenges faced by the partners, there is scope for improvement. \uf0a7 ECHO partners do not adequately evidence their progress achieving results. Indeed, ECHO often requests additional evidence of achieved results in its final monitoring of the project. \uf0a7 The lack of quantification of targets and use of inconsistent units in reporting beneficiaries (e.g. number of villages, number of households, number of individuals) makes it difficult to obtain an aggregate picture on programme outputs and results. 3.4.2 Key Findings from South Caucasus and Central Asia The log frames developed by partners in CAC were found to be clear and logical in most cases. In a few isolated cases, there was an inconsistency between the indicators and the target values. For example, in one case, the target value for the following indicator: % of population perceiving that they are in a disaster-prone area and prepared to react adequately was specified in terms of the number of communities. In the case of one project, the target values were not even specified. The Single Forms tend to provide a rather superficial description of pre-conditions for successful implementation. To quote some examples directly from the Single Forms: \u2018 Politically and socially stable environment \u2019 \u2018 No major natural disasters will hamper the start or ongoing implementation of the project. Relationship with the target communities remains strong \u2019 \u2018 Funds are transferred in time. No major fluctuation in exchange rate \u2019 \u2018 Facultative for Letter of Intent unless specified in HIP \u2019 Partners typically highlighted the following (ex-ante) risks affecting project delivery: \uf0a7 occurrence of disasters or security issues preventing access to beneficiary communities or project activities being implemented; \uf0a7 commitment and engagement of relevant stakeholders, including government authorities and participating communities, due to hierarchical systems and, for example, the difficulties these cause for agile and decentralised operations; and \uf0a7 political situations such as electoral cycles causing the loss of key staff due to repeated civil service restructurings. However, contingency measures set out in project documentation do not always address the identified risks. ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 54 At a practical level, despite some hurdles (e.g. delays in securing ministry approval for project activities, extreme weather conditions) and delays, projects generally managed to complete their activities within the DIPECHO funding cycle. While partners are keenly aware of the restraints under which DIPECHO operates, during the fieldwork, CAC partners collectively and strongly advocated for an extension of the project cycle beyond the current 18 month period, towards possibly a 20-month total project length, with a start-up month late in the winter season (say March 20XX to November 20XX+2). This was seen as vital in order to cover at least two summer periods, with the example benefit that this would allow partners to engage with natural resources management issues. 3.4.3 Conclusions They key conclusions arising from the above findings are as follows: \uf0a7 ECHO funded interventions are generally underpinned by clear intervention logics showing the linkages between outputs and results; \uf0a7 the lack of common indicators across DRAAP/ DIPECHO however, makes it hard to compare or aggregate outputs and results across projects; \uf0a7 risk assessment and contingency planning is relatively weak among partners and can be improved; and \uf0a7 ECHO partners in the HoA do not adequately evidence their progress on results. 3.5 EU added value EQ5 What has been shown to be the EU added value of the DRR actions examined (i.e. the added value of EU intervention, compared to leaving the initiative to other actors)? 3.5.1 Key Findings from the HoA The main elements of added value of ECHO\u2019s approach to DRR in the HoA were found to be: Dedicated and sustained DRR funding: Stakeholders consulted unanimously stated that ECHO began funding DRR in the HoA at a time when no other donor was funding such actions. By providing dedicated and sustained funding, ECHO gave participating partners the freedom to experiment with and pilot promising methods in drought risk reduction, generating greater understanding of drought-risk reduction in the region and promoting the mainstreaming of DRR into development. ECHO has been a front-runner in promoting DRR in the region: it is only recently that other donors like DfID and USAID have begun to fund DRR and resilience in the region (see Annex 9). Through the DRRAP, ECHO has created a linked-up community of DRR stakeholders and practitioners within which partners are encouraged to exchange information on innovation and good practices and this has generated a greater understanding of drought risk reduction in the region. By encouraging greater NGO coordination, ECHO also helped avoid duplication of effort. ECHO nurtured new alliances between the UN and NGOs. As stated by one regional partner, \u2018 The DRRAP allowed the UN and NGOs to come together as one voice \u2019 . Cross-border approach: other donors are often constrained by organisational structures and operational procedures to working bilater ally with specific countries. ECHO\u2019s cross - border approach to DRR is \u2018unique\u2019 in the region . Cross-border working can be highly challenging \u2013 particularly from a management perspective (both for the donor and the partner) and also generates numerous implementation challenges (higher costs due to differences in currency, administrative burden and coordination effort). However, there is evidence of the positive impacts of this approach \u2013 e.g. the MoUs on \u2018 Cross-Border Animal ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 55 Health Coordination \u2019 between Kenya and Uganda and the \u2018 cross-border peace accords \u2019 between local administrators in Northern Kenya and Southern Ethiopia. IGAD has recently begun to use donor funding to work cross-border. Focus on community- level actions / the \u2018most vulnerable\u2019: unlike other donors and Commission services, ECHO prioritises actions that target communities and is highly sensitive to the needs of the most vulnerable (although these are not always explicitly defined \u2013 See Section 3.4). It has funded interventions in communities which are not supported by national safety nets and in this respect, ECHO has filled a gap in services , even though the number of communities that could be reached was limited by the size of the programme budget. The added value of this approach is reflected by the fact that DfID has now started to \u2018 take over \u2019 some of ECHO\u2019s community -based projects (as part of their BRACED programme), 91 and local authorities in Kenya at least should theoretically also take over responsibility for community capacity-building. In theory, by funding preparedness projects in communities, ECHO also expects that its partners will be in a strong position to monitor early warning signs of onset disaster, to report these indications back to DG ECHO and to respond rapidly to drought should it occur. However, this aspect has not worked so well (see Section 3.8). 3.5.2 Key Findings from CAC The key findings from CAC are as follows: DIPECHO has delivered tangible results that are visible to beneficiary communities and valued by them: although difficult to quantify, there is substantial anecdotal evidence across the current portfolio of DIPECHO projects to suggest that response teams, mitigation measures (e.g., mudflow clearance, embankments, avalanche protection walls, drainage canals), contingency plans, etc created by ECHO funding, are currently saving lives and preventing property damage during disasters \u2013 see Section 3.8. Financial added value: DIPECHO is recognised as a key donor in the field of DRR and for the high quality of funded projects. Stakeholder interviews suggest that many of the projects in CAC would not have been implemented at all or would have been implemented at a reduced scale in the absence of ECHO funding as there are limited alternative sources of DRR funding. There are only a handful of donors supporting DRR in the region, and none actually run a dedicated DRR programme, such as DIPECHO. Besides, authorities both at national and at local levels in many CAC countries lack the resources, capacity and know- how to support community- based DRR (there are some exceptions such as Kazakhstan, which has the resources and in recent years has also shown policy interest in DRR; while some countries have the resources, but have not attached priority to DRR, e.g. Azerbaijan). A unique blend of top-down and bottom-up approach to DRR: ECHO is seen as a \u2018 frontline \u2019 donor supporting community based DRR (at a grass root level) alongside advocacy and institutional linkages at higher levels (local, sub-national and national level), thus tackling the issue from two angles. This has been particularly evident in the Central Asian countries where UNICEF and UNDP have been funded in earlier funding cycles to engage strategically with DRR as a national issue (UNDP) and for the education sector (UNICEF 92 ). Local presence and high visibility: through its field offices, ECHO regularly brings together \u2018DIPECHO partners\u2019 at the national and regional levels to stimulate inter -agency collaboration and cross-fertilisation, thus providing a forum for strategic cooperation and sharing of knowledge and material (good practices, DRR educational material, etc). A local presence also allows ECHO to closely monitor developments in the region as well as the implementation of the programme. Partners interviewed in the context of this evaluation 91 [online] Available at: https://www.gov.uk/international-development-funding/building-resilience-and-adaptation- to-climate-extremes-and-disasters-programme 92 See [online] Available at: http://www.unicef.org/ceecis/DRR_Good_Practices_and_New_Appraoches.pdf ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 56 spontaneously mentioned the local presence and accessibility of ECHO field staff as a key element of its added value. During fieldwork, national ministries also positively commented on the role of DIPECHO in promoting \u2018 multi-stakeholder involvement \u2019 in DRR. The cross-border and multi-country approach is also quite unique to ECHO and one that adds value by promoting the exchange of knowledge and cooperation between countries. 3.5.3 Conclusions The key dimensions of this added value as evidenced by this evaluation are as follows: \uf0a7 funding DRR activities that would otherwise have not been implemented (or implemented at a much smaller scale); \uf0a7 running a dedicated funding programme for DRR; \uf0a7 the combination of a top-down (advocacy and institutional linkages) and bottom-up approach (community based) to DRR . ECHO\u2019s focus on communities as central actors in DRR is unique; \uf0a7 local presence through ECHO field offices and their role in facilitating coordination and cooperation between partners and creating a linked-up community of DRR players; and \uf0a7 support for cross-border and regional interventions. 3.6 Delivery mechanisms 3.6.1 Organisational structures and partner selection EQ6. Are the actions\u2019 organisational structure and choice of partnerships (still) appropriate to achieve their aims? Have appropriate incentives been built in for partners? Do the funded actions build on the comparative advantages of the ECHO partners? Do the ECHO partners compete with or substitute activities that other development agencies could do more appropriately or efficiently? 3.6.1.1 Key Findings from the HoA Over the period 2009 to 2013, ECHO has worked with the following partners to deliver DRR actions in the HoA (Table 3.12). Table 3.12 ECHO partners funded through DRRAP 2009-2013 Regional partners Cross-border and country-specific project partners FAO, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Oxfam UK (when leading REGLAP), UN-ISDR, UNDP, UNICEF ACF-FRA, ACH-ES, Care International, Caritas Germany, Christian Aid UK, COOPI, CORDAID, Red Cross Denmark, Danchurchaid, Farm Africa, German Agro-Action, HelpAge International, International Rescue Committee (IRC), MedAir UK, OCHA, Oxfam UK, Save the Children UK, UNICEF, VSF Belgium, VSF Germany, VSF Switzerland ECHO works exclusively with IOs and NGOs with whom it has signed Framework Partnership Agreements. In accordance with the international humanitarian principles of impartiality, neutrality and independence, ECHO does not work directly with national governments nor with for-profit organisations. Donors consulted for this evaluation consider that this limits ECHO\u2019s capacity to support emerging national structures (e.g. the NDMA in Kenya), and th erefore see this as a disadvantage of ECHO\u2019s approach to partnership selection . However, the DRRAP has had some success in influencing national and regional policies and structures (see Section 3.8) by working with UN agencies (e.g. FAO, UN-ISDR, UNICEF) and Red Cross societies. For example, the decision to fund IFRC was driven by the fact that Red Cross societies play a major role in disaster response in the HoA as auxiliaries to national governments, thus by strengthening Red Cross societies \u2019 DRR ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 57 capacity in these countries ECHO was helping integrate DRR into national disaster management. During the period under evaluation, ECHO did not duplicate the work of development donors. Nonetheless, some EU officials consulted did express a concern that ECHO \u2018stretched its mandate\u2019 [into the remit of development actors] with the multi-phase approach followed and its focus on resilience. At the same time, ECHO partners commented that the 18 month funding cycles can have a limiting effect on the achievement of longer-term impacts (e.g. capacity-building in communities, which needs to be reinforced over a continuous period). According to them, development actors who fund over longer periods are better placed to fund resilience-building projects for this reason. However as stated in Section 3.5.1, ECHO was funding DRR activities precisely because other donors and development actors were not doing so until recently. In this respect ECHO \u2018filled a gap\u2019. The integration of DRR in development policy and planning including relevant sector policies and strategies is the ultimate goal of ECHO funded DRR actions. Until that goal is achieved, ECHO has a clear added value in supporting DRR either in the form of stand-alone DRR projects or through integrated projects. Specific incentives for the partners to engage with ECHO-funded DRR in the HoA have included the opportunity to work across borders (a possibility not usually offered by other donors) and the opportunity to become involved in the community of DRR practitioners who have collectively advanced understanding and technical knowledge of the subject. Overall ECHO\u2019s approach to partner selection was logical as most of the partners had a history of working in the geographical area and some, had specific methodological expertise (e.g. Cordaid which has expertise in CMDRR) or sectoral expertise (e.g. Oxfam in WaSH). DRRAP partners are amongst some of the key humanitarian actors working in DRR (UN [through UN-ISDR], Oxfam) and drought (ACF, Save the Children) and therefore, bring specific expertise and reputation to the programme. In this respect, the funded actions built upon the comparative advantages of the ECHO partners. However, an analysis of project documentation also suggests that partner selection was not always clearly justified. A review of the ficheops show that some of the partners were not very effective in engaging beneficiary communities and/or local authorities and some did not select appropriate methods for achieving their objectives. Similarly, the evaluation team observed during its field trips that most ECHO partners had in the latter phases of the DRRAP utilised community-participatory methods for implementing DRR (i.e. using a CMDRR approach), but with mixed success. This underlines the need for careful matching of community needs, action and partner skills. In two of the 2010 ficheops, ECHO itself expressed concerns with either the performance and/or relevance of some partners\u2019 actions, yet in the following phase the same partner was still funded without a strong rationale as to why. Further, where projects were multi-phase, the partners did not always demonstrate the effectiveness of the previous activities and therefore, the justification for their continuation in the Single Forms. At least 28 of the 62 projects funded during 2009-2013 (i.e. 45 per cent) involved local implementing organisations. Local organisations reported a good relationship overall with ECHO partners. All had been selected either because of their technical expertise in DRR and/or because of their links to the local community / authorities. ECHO partners have mixed opinions about working with local organisations: for some, this has worked extremely well and the local organisations have provided local contextual knowledge, as well as a stable \u2018anchor\u2019 t o the project site to enable project continuation, even between funding phases; but for others (e.g. 2012/91034), the limited capacity of the local organisation has increased the administrative burden of the project. 3.6.1.2 Key Findings from CAC Over the period 2009-2013, ECHO has worked with the following partners to deliver DRR actions in CAC: \u25a0 Acted, ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 58 \u25a0 ACH-Spain, \u25a0 Aga Khan, \u25a0 Save the Children, \u25a0 Mission East \u2013 Denmark, \u25a0 Oxfam, \u25a0 Red Cross (Dutch and Danish), \u25a0 Welthungerhilfe (formerly, German Agro Action), \u25a0 UN Agencies (UNDP, UNICEF, OCHA, WHO), and \u25a0 Intergovernmental Organisations such as IOM. Twelve out of 16 projects funded under the 2012 Decision involved local implementing partners. The number of implementing partners has ranged from 1 to 10. Implementing partners have included national Red Cross/ Red Crescent societies; national authorities (e.g. Ministry of Emergency Situations, Ministry of Education) and to a lesser extent, local NGOs (e.g. CENN, Single Mothers Association of Tekeli, Black Sea Eco-Academy etc). There is limited choice of local NGOs in most CAC countries which explains their relatively limited involvement in the programme. Having said that, there are some local NGOs which could be involved to a greater degree in the programme given their local DRR knowledge and expertise. The ineligibility of local NGOs to receive funding from ECHO and their limited involvement in the programme remains an obstacle to developing long-term local capacity. For example in Georgia, the Black Sea Eco-Academy had clearly played a pivotal role in delivering the Oxfam Adjara Mountains project 93 , but does not qualify by itself to apply for funding. Notwithstanding this, the choice of partnerships was found to be logical overall, reflecting the comparative strengths of partners. For example, organisations such as Save the Children and UNICEF have developed DRR interventions targeting children, in line with their areas of expertise. Partners have demonstrated relevant DRR expertise and where necessary, they have involved implementing partners to complement their in-house capacity and expertise as well as to provide local contextual knowledge. To give a few examples: \uf0a7 ACTED involved HelpAge as an implementing partner to carry out age awareness training of Village Disaster Preparedness Committees and Rescue Teams; \uf0a7 in Georgia, Save the Children worked alongside ABS Germany as local partner, who are specialists in disaster risk communication for children; and \uf0a7 Oxfam worked with the Black Sea Eco Academy (BSEA) in Georgia given their local knowledge of social and environmental issues and with the Rural Communities Development Agency (RCDA) who have special expertise in innovative technologies and the management of natural resources. The UN Agencies have tended to involve national authorities in their projects to secure their buy-in, to enhance their capacity and to promote the mainstreaming of DRR. For example, WHO involved the Ministry of Health, the Committee of Emergency Situations and Civil Protection and the Ministry of Internal Affairs in its project aimed at improving mass casualty management in Tajikistan (91006). Similarly, UNICEF has involved the Ministry of Education as an implementing partner in its projects aimed at delivering pilot DRR activities in schools, and integrating DRR in national school curricula, in several countries. One of the main incentives for partners to get involved with DIPECHO (aside from it being the only regular and major source of DRR funding) is the good reputation of the programme in the region. It is widely acknowledged by all stakeholder groups such as international agencies, national/ local authorities, local communities, etc, that DIPECHO funds good quality projects \u2013 thus, involvement in DIPECHO is seen as a \u2018quality stamp\u2019 by partners. 93 [online] Available at: http://www.governance.bsnn.org/pdf/GE1.pdf and \u201cLife In Danger\u201d video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7huCyfVKg08 ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 59 Other incentives for partners to seek DIPECHO funding include the support offered by ECHO field offices and flexibility in approach; funding is allocated to projects on the basis of the needs and merits of a proposal as opposed to other criteria such as geography. No evidence was found of ECHO partners competing with or substituting for activities that other development agencies could have funded more appropriately. There are virtually no countries or areas where a multiplicity of agencies operate in similar areas of DRR, thus indicating a reduced risk of overlap or substitution. It can of course be argued that DRR is the responsibility of national and sub-national/ local authorities. But as the latter have yet to fully mainstream DRR into national/ local development policies and relevant sectoral polices are not supporting community based DRR to the extent necessary (by investing in EWS, appropriate structural mitigation measures or awareness raising and preparedness, etc), there is little or no risk of competition or substitution; ECHO is rather filling a gap. 3.6.1.3 Conclusions In line with its mandate, ECHO directly funds IOs and NGOs with whom it has signed a FPA. ECHO partners typically involve national Red Cross/ Red Crescent societies, national authorities and to a lesser extent, local NGOs as local implementing partners to supplement their own capacity and expertise and to benefit from their local knowledge and links. The choice of partnerships was found to be appropriate in CAC and the HoA, building upon the comparative strengths of the organisations involved. In the HoA however, some DRRAP partners have under-performed through multiple phases suggesting a need for DG ECHO to place more emphasis on past-performance and the combination of organisational skills / capacity and the project methodology proposed when selecting partners to implement their actions. Moreover in the HoA, ECHO partners have had mixed (and not always positive) experiences of working with local NGOs, mainly due to issues with skills and capacity. Capacity-building of local civil society has however, not been a focus of the DRRAP, which may have been a lost opportunity, as was suggested in the recent evaluation of DIPECHO activities in Indonesia; this may have created a possibility that such organisations would take over the ECHO activities in the absence of international organisations. Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that ECHO was competing with or substituting the activity of other development actors in the period covered by this evaluation. ECHO interventions were filling a critical gap in activity that is essentially the responsibility of national/ local authorities, but which they were unable to fulfil due to lack of resources, capacity and know-how. 3.6.2 Local implementing partners\u2019 capacity and commitment EQ12. To what extent do the DG ECHO partners and their local implementing partners have the capacity to integrate the DRR's approach in their overall strategy from response to rehabilitation and development? How committed are the partners and their staff to implement the ECHO-funded actions in the regions concerned? 3.6.2.1 Key Findings from the HoA Overall evidence suggests that ECHO partners are highly committed to achieving the objectives of the ECHO-funded actions. As described in Section 3.7.1, the DRRAP succeeded in bringing together and developing a community of IOs and NGOs working on \u2013 and exchanging good practices on \u2013 DRR. Furthermore, most of the partners have a DRR strategy and implement DRR projects in other parts of the world (e.g. COOPI, CORDAID) which suggests that they are committed to DRR activities beyond ECHO's short term funding cycle. Experience gained in the HoA region has, in turn, informed their wider DRR policy and strategy and vice versa. ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 60 Most of the ECHO partners have had a presence in the HoA for many years and plan to continue working there. Some have had some success in tapping into other sources of funding, but others have expressed difficulty in finding alternative sources of support. Interviews with partners suggested there is an implicit expectation of continued funding from ECHO under new funding cycles. Overall, the evaluation team observed that ECHO partners do not have well-defined exit strategies in place. This affects their capacity to integrate the DRRAP actions and outcomes into future development activities. This is further discussed in Section 3.7.4 on sustainability. 3.6.2.2 Key Findings from CAC The above findings also apply to CAC. Additionally, when organising and conducting the fieldwork, the evaluators noted the high levels of commitment to DIPECHO demonstrated by all partners through for example, their interactions with beneficiary communities, their willingness to contribute to the evaluation process, etc. The commitment of partners is also evident from project documentation and independent evaluations of projects. 3.6.2.3 Conclusions ECHO partners are highly committed to the achieving the objectives of the ECHO-funded actions. However, exit strategies i.e. by integrating DRR into local development plans, for example are weak. This issue is further discussed in Section 3.7.4. 3.6.3 Evolution of projects over different funding cycles EQ13. Considering that the project activities of partners in many cases have been carried over from one funding cycle to the next, to what extent have the partners been revising their approaches \u2013 being innovative \u2013 to improve effectiveness and efficiency? 3.6.3.1 Key Findings from the HoA Out of the 81 projects implemented over the evaluated period, 57 were multi-phase projects corresponding to 16 discrete projects: 11 being implemented over the 4 evaluated phases. 94 Of the 16 discrete projects, 4 (REGLAP, and those of FAO, UN-ISDR and IFRC) were regional, with the remainder being community-based. All four regional projects showed an evolution in their programming: \uf0a7 REGLAP started by focusing on communications and awareness-raising, gradually implementing more research and creating a DRR community of practice and ending by providing technical support on monitoring and evaluation and evidence-based policy support. \uf0a7 In a similar fashion, the UN-ISDR \u2019s intervention evolved from assessing progress on the implementation of HFA with awareness-raising and advocacy elements to developing tools (a disaster loss database) and analysis to support governments in implementing DRR. \uf0a7 There was no change in the FAO project from 2008 - 2009 and 2009-2010, but from 2010 HIP onwards, FAO began to share coordination, advocacy and technical 94 These were Care UK, Coopi, Cordaid and VSF-Germany (previously VSF-Belgium) in the Ethiopia-Kenya cross-border region; Caritas Germany, Save the Children (PILLAR) and Danchurchaid in Ethiopia; Oxfam cross- border in Ethiopia and Somaliland; Danchurchaid in the Kenya-Uganda cross-border region; and FAO and Oxfam (REGLAP) at the regional level. IFRC implemented their regional project in three phases of the DRRAP (2009, 2010, 2012), as did Oxfam in Kenya and German Agro Action, also in Kenya, 2008, 2009 and 2010. ACH-ES and UN-ISDR implemented multi-phase projects funded in 2010 and 2012. ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 61 assistance roles with REGLAP and UN-ISDR, FAO also introduced some new activities (e.g. training to ECHO partners and learning visits), yet the progression from one set of activities to the next is less obvious \u2013 i.e. it is not clear how learning from previous years was used to improve following phases of the project. \uf0a7 IFRC also demonstrated evolution in its intervention both in terms of target regions and countries adding health in 2010 and overall objectives. Most of the multi-annual projects changed or expanded the number of communities they worked with over the four-year period. In the case of some projects (the multi-phase projects by Care, Coopi, Caritas, Save the Children) this was also to ensure complementarity between projects. Where partners remained in the same communities this was to consolidate impacts (e.g. providing refresher training, introducing new tools for DRR, etc) or to create linkages between the community outputs and local authorities. Where projects did attempt to expand the number of communities reached, this did not always work (see Box 5 below). Box 5 Scaling up community actions in Ethiopia The evaluation team visited a multi-phase project in the Bale Zone in Ethiopia. In Phase 4, a new district was included to scale-up lessons learned from previous phases. The ECHO partner (and its local implementation partner), however, did not have sufficient resources to maintain operations in the \u2018 old \u2019 district (which had been the focus of efforts over Phases 1-3) so all efforts were focussed on the new district. It appears that the exit from the first district was too quick and jeopardised the progress that had been achieved. Furthermore, as the new district activities started six months late there was limited time for implementation. For example, the excavation of a pond was delayed, therefore it was not ready in time for the start of the wet season. This affected the quality of delivery and sustainability of actions. As reported by one ECHO partner, \u2018 Expanding to a new district in principle was a good idea. But a stepped-approach is required. Phase 1 is about developing software, e.g. awareness-raising, education, planning \u2013 you have to pay attention to that and it can \u2019t be rushed. You need to focus on the rehabilitation of existing resources. Then, in Phase 2, you have a clear understanding of the problem and can prioritise. Ninety five per cent of the beneficiaries are illiterate and the tribes have very traditional structures in place. As such, you need time to implement change. \u2019 Between the 2010 and 2012 phases there was a six month break imposed by DG ECHO to learn lessons from the previous phase, but this did not happen between previous phases. The Single Forms do not make clear exactly how the project applicants have taken into account lessons from previous years and this does not appear to have been carefully monitored in the fichops either. 3.6.3.2 Key Findings from CAC In Central Asia, most ECHO partners (19 out of 24) have received funding over multiple cycles \u2013 as indicated in Table 3.13.

It shows that the approach of the partners has generally evolved over successive cycles \u2013 they have typically scaled-up their activity over time (often moving across borders) or shifted the activity focus or covered different beneficiary groups. These innovations are however, not systematically documented. It is also surprising to note that ECHO does not ask applicants to explain how their proposed action might be different from any previously funded DIPECHO activity in the Single Forms.

In all cases, there was either a shift in thematic or geographic focus of activity to avoid duplication. However, in one case (91014) there was some overlap: \u2018 refresher training \u2019 was provided to beneficiaries a lready covered in the first cycle (alongside \u2018new\u2019 beneficiaries). Partners built upon the results and lessons learned in the previous cycle, several examples were found of innovation in their approach to DRR over successive cycles, though this is difficult to evidence given that documents such as final reports do not cover this issue in explicit terms. 3.6.3.3 Conclusions Multi-phased regional projects in the HoA have revised their approaches over successive cycles in order to improve their effectiveness and efficiency. However, country-specific projects have simply tended to change or expand the number of communities covered over successive phases. They have not demonstrated any real innovation: nor have they demonstrated how any lessons learned from previous phases have been addressed. ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 64 In CAC, many of the partners have secured DIPECHO funding for similar activities over multiple cycles. Partners have typically scaled-up their activity over successive DIPECHO cycles, often moving across borders, or focussed on different themes or communities. In a few cases, refresher training was provided to past beneficiaries. Overall, partners have demonstrated a change in approach and it appears that learning of lessons has been widespread even though not well documented. However, the evidence does not allow any conclusions to be drawn with respect to improving efficiency and effectiveness. 3.7 Effectiveness 3.7.1 Improving resilience EQ7. To what extent have the DG ECHO-funded actions contributed to improving the resilience of the populations that face disaster risk, or is it likely to contribute in the future to the improvement of resilience? ECHO defines resilience as \u2018 the ability of an individual, a household, a community, a country or a region to withstand, to adapt, and to quickly recover from stresses and shocks \u2019 . 96 There are no commonly agreed dimensions or indicators that \u2018operationalise\u2019 this concept of resilience (see Annex 6). Consequently, baseline data on the resilience of populations in the countries and communities are also not available, which makes it difficult to measure changes in resilience, as evidence by the challenges faced by the COBRA project to develop a methodology and tools to measure the impact of resilience intervention. Moreover, in some of the countries, particularly in the HoA, there are multiple actors involved, which makes it impossible to isolate the impact of DRAAP vis-\u00e0-vis other interventions; therefore, attribution is also problematic alongside measurement. For these reasons, the answer provided below is essentially based on qualitative evidence and seeks to assess the contribution of ECHO- funded DRR actions in improving the resilience of affected populations. 3.7.1.1 Key Findings from the HoA Most of the projects funded had the objective of improving the resilience of the communities that they directly target. 97 They sought to do this in the following ways: \uf0a7 helping communities and local authorities monitor the onset of drought, e.g. establishment of Early Warning Systems in order to better prepare for drought; \uf0a7 developing protocols for rapid response in cases of drought, e.g. through the development of Community Action Plans and contingency plans; \uf0a7 improving management and maintenance of natural resources (e.g. water) and assets (e.g. livestock) so that communities are better able to adapt to drought; and \uf0a7 creating contingencies to allow communities to better cope with disaster (e.g. savings in village banks in Kenya and Ethiopia). The 2011 drought provided some basis for determining if beneficiaries previously targeted through DRAAP were more resilient to the drought (or not) as compared to non- beneficiaries. As outlined in Box 6, the evidence is conflicting as to whether or not the DRRAP mitigated the impact of the drought in those communities it was supporting. Box 6 ECHO and DRRAP partners\u2019 response to the 2011 drought 96 European Commission (2012) The EU Approach to Resilience: Learning from Food Security Crises - COM(2012) 586 final. 97 See mapping of project objectives. ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 65 Some stakeholders consulted during the field phase argue that during the 2011 drought, previously supported communities coped better than those that had not benefitted from the DRRAP. Further, a review of the response to the 2011 drought states that ECHO, DfID and USAID met in the early stages of the drought\u2019s onset (in December 2010) to coordinate their initial response and provided funding for NGOs to undertake crisis-response / relief activities. 98 DfID Kenya also report that when the 2011 drought hit, ECHO was able to amend its existing operations quickly, whereas DfID took four months to negotiate changes in its programming. DfID now works much faster (learning from ECHO\u2019 s approach) and put in place agreements to enable rapid response. 99 By contrast, interviews with ECHO Field report that during the 2011 drought, ECHO partners with agreed projects in affected areas did not react early enough to the drought, and instead \u2013 maintained the status quo with their project work. Nonetheless, ECHO learned from this experience and \u2013 as a result \u2013 has started to encourage ECHO partners to build contingency into their DRR project budgets to enable a shift of funds from preparedness activities to crisis-response / relief in reaction to sudden needs from their existing funding. This approach has also been recommended in the literature. 100 This method is currently being pursued through the La Nina consortium. For the communities the evaluation team visited in Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda, participation in DRRAP activities had (i) \u2018 opened their eyes \u2019 to the ways they could better prepare for and cope with drought; and (ii) empowered them to act. A diversity of results and outcomes were observed across/ reported by the communities visited: \uf0a7 Increased knowledge \u2013 e.g. water conservation, pasture management, fodder production and storage, improved animal husbandry, how to vaccinate animals, how to maintain hygienic living conditions. \uf0a7 Behavioural change \u2013 e.g. improved sanitary practice (observed in Kenya), diversification of livelihoods. \uf0a7 Tangible impacts \u2013 e.g. improved access to drugs for animals; improved access to water sources (observed in some communities in Kenya); those who used certified / treated seeds reportedly had better crops than those who did not; asset creation (e.g. VICOBA loans) and protection (e.g. through cereal banking, improved animal health); and livelihood diversification. \uf0a7 Improved relations with neighbouring communities (as a result of DRRAP-funded study visits). \uf0a7 Greater engagement with local / national authorities (in some cases, but not all) \u2013 e.g. one community in the Somali region are using the contingency plan developed in the CMDRR committee as a basis for requesting funding from the local government and others. Most of these outcomes arguably made the communities concerned more resilient to drought \u2013 e.g. by improving general health in the community (through improved hygiene, access to water, etc). Since there is no agreed way of measuring the resilience of a community and since the communities visited had not experienced a drought since participating in the DRRAP activities, it is impossible to \u2018prove\u2019 that the communities were more resilien t; however, to the extent that they demonstrated a greater number of coping mechanisms and apparent progress in their overall development after having participated in the DRRAP, the evaluators feel confident in asserting that these activities have helped to increase resilience. 98 Save the Children & Oxfam (2012) Joint Agency Briefing Paper: A Dangerous Delay - The cost of late response to early warnings in the 2011 drought in the Horn of Africa\u2019 , 18 January 2012. 99 Interview with Chris Porter of DfID Kenya. 100 See, for example: Save the Children & Oxfam (2012) and Chatham House (2012) \u2018 Translating Early Warning into Early Action: Response by Donors and Implementing Agencies \u2019 \u2013 Workshop Summary, 11-12 April 2012.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 66 3.7.1.2 Key Findings from CAC In CAC, DIPECHO has contributed to improving the resilience of at-risk populations in the following ways: Increase in awareness, knowledge and understanding of disaster risks which enables communities to better prepare for and respond to disasters . The changes in awareness and knowledge levels are systematically measured by projects through baseline and endline surveys. Box 7 Raising awareness, knowledge and understanding of disaster risks Save the Children organised trainings on inclusive DRR for 1664 teachers, caregivers and administrative staff in 100 institutions across Georgia. Pre-test analysis revealed that the average knowledge rate before the training was very low, at 12.6 per cent. After the training the average increase rate per institution was around 85 per cent. In two months 826 teachers in the kindergartens were asked to undergo the same test again which showed that teachers and caregivers had retained more than 90 per cent of the acquired knowledge (project 91012). A research team from the Armenia State Pedagogical University (ASPU) carried out pre-testing on DRR awareness in the target schools in February 2013, before the training and school-based interventions began. Post-testing in September 2013 revealed a 70-80 per cent increase in student knowledge and skills on disaster preparedness and risk reduction (as part of UNICEF project 91015 on Supporting Disaster Risk Reduction amongst Vulnerable Communities and Institutions in the South Caucasus) . During the earthquake of July 2012 in Zakatala (Azerbaijan), one of the schools which was selected as a pilot during the previous phase of the project, reported that they were able to evacuate premises within 1.5 minutes as a result of the numerous drills and training they received as part of a DIPECHO 1 project in 2010-11 (91015). Many DIPECHO actions have proven to be effective in limiting damage and potentially, saving lives at a community level. Although the testing of community resilience through real disasters is infrequent, examples can be found of DIPECHO projects that have had a positive local impact in terms of making communities safer, e.g. early warning systems have triggered evacuations, trained intervention teams have provided rapid relief, structural mitigation measures have avoided or reduced losses, etc. Box 8 Making communities safer During an unexpected snow storm in Adjara in December 2013, 61 kindergartens were able to safely evacuate 8,900 children \u2013 thanks to the early warning systems installed and evaluation procedures put in place by Save the Children with DIPECHO support (project 91012). Each year mudslides and landslides used to damage the property and affect the livelihoods (livestock and crops) of 500 households living next to a landslide prone slope in Syrymbet village. Following tree planting on the landslide prone slope, the community was able to avoid such losses in 2013 winter (project 91018). 3.7.1.3 Conclusions ECHO-funded actions have enabled local communities and institutions to better prepare for, mitigate and respond to natural disasters, thereby increasing resilience and reducing vulnerabilities. Specifically, ECHO funded actions have contributed to improving the resilience of participating communities by: \uf0a7 increasing their awareness, knowledge understanding of risks and how to manage them; \uf0a7 triggering behavioural change; ",

To what extent have the DG ECHO-funded interventions contributed to a reinforcement of DRR and mainstreaming into the national and local governments\u2019 long -term development policies and practices in the beneficiary countries, and increased funding for DRR-related programmes (systemic impact)? Specifically, how have the interventions stimulated replication and scaling up of projects, and promoted advocacy? What could be done further (enabling factors, tools, mechanism, change in strategy, etc) to increase the opportunities for replicating and scaling up successful projects at country/regional level, and integrate their results into DRR national policy/strategies as well as development planning/ programming? DRRAP/ DIPECHO resources are relatively modest in comparison to a country or region\u2019s DRR needs. A key element of the DRRAP/ DIPECHO strategy is therefore, to pilot and demonstrate successful models of community based DRR that can be replicated elsewhere by vulnerable communities, national or sub-national authorities, other EU funding instruments or other donors. All DRRAP/ DIPECHO projects therefore, have a demonstrative purpose. 3.7.2.1 Key Findings from the HoA The DRRAP funding was designed to fund small- scale \u2018pilot\u2019 interventions with a view to test and demonstrate their effectiveness, so that the intervention could be \u2018replicated\u2019 and \u2018scaled up\u2019 by other actors (e.g. national/local government or other donors). Through its regional partners and in particular through the REGLAP project, ECHO has encouraged its partners to record and disseminate good practices and open up debate on the methods applied through the DRRAP. The examples of replication observed in the field and reported in project documentation suggest that some DRRAP methods / approaches (e.g. CMDRR) have been identified as good practices and have gained sufficient momentum to be replicated in different situations by other NGOs or donors and/or in different geographic locations. However, the replication of practices by different communities \u2013 i.e. the dispersion of DRR practices amongst the affected communities \u2013 has been limited; the evaluation team has not encountered evidence of \u2018 spontaneous \u2019 replication of DRRAP practices established in one community by another community. Box 9 Examples of replication / scaling up in the Horn of Africa Replication The following replications have taken place in the Horn of Africa: \u25a0 Adoption of practices developed under DRRAP by non-DRRAP partners (e.g. DRR activities implemented by Solidarit\u00e9s in N. Kenya with DfID funding using VSF-G methodology developed under DRRAP). \u25a0 Adoption of DRRAP practices by national / local authorities and/or other donors (e.g. FAO, with EU-Del funding in Uganda, was able to continue and to scale-up its APFS activities also in Uganda and in Kenya, local authorities in Marsabit have utilised community participatory methodologies initiated by ECHO partners under the DRRAP). \u25a0 Replication within DRAAP. Some ECHO partners have expanded the number of communities in which their interventions were implemented (e.g.2012/91033, 2012/91042, 2012/91034). ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 68 Scaling up The following examples of scaling-up have been found: \u25a0 Actions piloted under DRRAP (e.g. APFS) have been taken forward by other donors on a wider scale. \u25a0 Community-level action plans (developed through DRRAP funding) have been used to develop county-level plans (in Kenya). This results from ongoing movement towards bottom-up planning and devolution in Kenya, as well as through the contribution of DRRAP. \u25a0 Local-level advocacy work (which had resulted in local agreements) was developed / \u2018scaled up\u2019 to an international level (e.g. the scaling up of local veterinary agreements support by DCA with DRRAP money to develop a MoU between the Department of Animal Health and Entomology in Uganda and the Department of Veterinary Services in Kenya by FAO with support from EU-Del Uganda). In order to encourage the replication / scaling up of DRR practices that have demonstrated effectiveness, the DRRAP has specifically funded projects that have advocated for the mainstreaming of DRR into the interventions of development donors and into national and local development policies and practices. Table 3.15 overleaf outlines the main findings of the evaluation as regards the extent to which DRR has been mainstreamed in the the HoA. It shows that during the period covered by the DRRAP, the EU\u2019s DEVCO, other international donors and regional and national authorities have made advances in mainstreaming DRR into their development interventions / policies. To some extent at least, this has been due to the DRRAP \u2013 e.g. when DRRAP-funded actions have specifically focussed on supporting regional and national governments and/or when other donors / national governments have replicated DRRAP methods.

DG ECHO still plays a DRR advocacy role by participating in national fora to support the DRR agenda / policy- making \u2013 e.g. on the Ending Drought Emergencies in Kenya (EDE) policy. 102 \uf0a7 In Uganda DRR is \u2018mainstreamed\u2019 to the extent that it has established DRR strategies 103 and systems that take an integrated cross-sectoral approach.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 72 3.7.2.2 Key Findings from CAC Mainstreaming of DRR into development policies and planning, including relevant sectoral policies In CAC, UNICEF and DIPECHO have played a key role in the mainstreaming of DRR within the education sector \u2013 Box 10. However, the mainstreaming of DRR in other sectors and overall development programming is yet to be achieved. As indicated in Table 3.7, only half of the countries in the region have a national DRR strategy. And most of these are not underpinned by an earmarked financial envelope for DRR or a targeted commitment to spend. Box 10 Mainstreaming of DRR within the education sector With support from DIPECHO, partners (mainly UNICEF, but also Save the Children and Oxfam) have advanced the mainstreaming of DRR in education in CAC countries The newly drafted 12-year education standards in Kazakhstan include children's disaster- preparedness competencies. The current discussions in Kazakhstan are related to the approach to curriculum development: whether to have DRR as a separate subject or mainstreamed in a number of different subjects. In Tajikistan, life skills, including DRR, have been integrated into the National Education Standards; the framework for the new curriculum is currently being developed by the Government. In Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan, DRR is now part of the formal education curriculum. As a result, governments are investing more on DRR in education, and this trend is expected to increase over the next few years. In South Caucasus, mainstreaming of DRR into national education policies, strategies and plans, has been reached with different scales in all three countries. Formal school curriculum in Azerbaijan has been revised by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and now includes specific DRR components. The new curriculum has been endorsed and it was implemented in September 2013. While the MOE has integrated DRR into standards and teacher training, further technical assistance is needed to apply DRR effectively across the education system. In Armenia: DRR has been mainstreamed into the curriculum of pedagogical universities and into key strategic documents, such as the Action Plan for Patriotic Education for 2014-2019 and the School External and Internal Assessment Procedures and Methodologies. The Action Plan focuses on specific requirements for schools, including: the provision of disaster-preparedness equipment and supplies; training on disaster preparedness and first aid; safety regulations, drills and activities; as well as a nationwide school contest on DRR. In Georgia: DRR has been institutionalised as part of the National Teacher Professional Development Centre's (TPDC) Scheme and is now offered as an official part of the training programmes provided by TPDC to teachers free of charge. Even though DRR is now a formal part of the national curriculum, there is no specific budget allocation for its roll-out and implementation. In addition, the current public-school financing model does not envisage the provision of funds for specific school disaster preparedness activities, including the procurement of basic school safety equipment. Replication and scaling-up The initiatives of DIPECHO have been replicated on a very limited scale by local authorities/ communities, donors and stakeholders; a massive scale-up only appears to have taken place in Kazakhstan. In other CAC countries, the most notable examples include replication and sharing of teaching and learning materials; replication of community emergency response teams by non-beneficiary communities; and DIPECHO awareness raising activities have fuelled interest in DRR among neighbouring villages \u2013 see Box 11.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 73 Box 11 Replication under DIPECHO In Kazakhstan, the Ministry of Emergency Situations and the Ministry of Education are providing significant funding to UNDP and UNICEF to take forward the activities established by DIPECHO. A project \u2018 Strengthening National Capacities for Risk Assessment, Prevention and Response to Disasters \u2019 has secured the Kazakhstan Government\u2019s contribution of USD 900,746. This project will integrate and build upon the activities and results of DIPECHO VII project (91008) activities and take forward the lessons learned on community-based DRR to the national level. Save the Children helped Community Emergency Response Teams CERTs) in targeted villages and MOES/CoES staff to select neighbouring communities for the replication of simulation exercises. These neighbouring villages were invited to observe the simulation exercises in project-targeted villages. At the end, 15 simulation exercises were replicated in 15 neighbouring villages in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, where more than 2000 people took part in the simulation exercises. The simulations were based on scenarios developed by community members and facilitated by DIPECHO established CERT members. The district MOES/CoES and local authorities provided their full support in organising and conducting the simulation exercises in non-targeted villages. These simulations help to improve the community emergency response and preparedness capacities, as well as mitigate the disaster risk. Meanwhile, the CERTs members from DIPECHO targeted communities had a chance to practice their skills and knowledge and share their experiences with their neighbours, thus scaling up the results. . The teaching and learning materials developed by UNICEF with DIPECHO support are being widely used by other partners in the region. Replication of a puppet show theatre by other schools in Kulyab Zone and the implementation of simulation evacuation practices carried out by Oxfam under DIPECHO VI in Danghara District by Kulyab Zone CoES (Tajikistan). The lack of massive replication and scaling up by national/ local authorities or other donors (including DEVCO) is due to several factors: \uf0a7 national/ local authorities lack the financial resources and capacity to replicate/ scale-up DIPECHO interventions; \uf0a7 conflicting national and local priorities and relatively, low priority attached to DRR; \uf0a7 i nstitutional constraints and past legacies such as centralised decision making; \u2018civil protection and response\u2019 mentality; the lack of understanding by ministries and government organisations about their diverse roles in DRR; \uf0a7 frequent staff changes at ministries undermining and diminishing efforts in advocacy and awareness raising; \uf0a7 governments withholding information that is essential in disaster management, such as maps, statistics, and databases; \uf0a7 the return on investment made under DIPECHO is not known. In the absence of this information, it can be difficult to persuade national / local authorities or donors to invest in DRR purely on the basis of theoretical arguments or qualitative evidence; \uf0a7 non-alignment between donor and DIPECHO funding cycles. The former being longer-term (5 to 7 years) than the latter (18 months); and \uf0a7 in sub-sectors such as natural resources management and rural energy security, DRR/NRM and even climate adaptation/mitigation practices appear to exist, but they are not yet \u2018 packaged-up \u2019 for replication in other similar contexts.

Box 12 Catalytic effect of DIPECHO In Uzbekistan, the Ministry of Emergency Situations has committed 2 million USD for the construction of an Earthquake Risk Mitigation Complex comprising an earthquake museum, movie hall and earthquake simulation facility. Although the project is behind schedule, with support from DIPECHO VII, UNDP has acquired the earthquake simulation facility. An Oxfam project has been successful in securing funding and support from the local government in Tajikistan (91004). Local authorities actively participated in planning and conducting public awareness campaigns on disaster preparedness and contributed 20-30 per cent towards the cost of conducting 10 simulation exercises. The CoES provided their contribution in establishing the Centre for Community Based Disaster Preparedness Education in Kulyab, through the allocation of land, legalisation of the centre through registration, as well as providing labour for works not covered by the contractor. The local authorities of the Khatlon Districts contributed to the establishment of seven stockpile locations in Shurabad, Khovaling, Muminabad, Vose , Baljuvan , Kurgan Tube and Kulyab and three reception centres in Shurabad and one in the Muminabad Districts of Khatlon. While the Government committed and allocated warehousing and staff to the project, the local authorities also made the official budgetary allocation to replenish the stockpiles for the upcoming year. A Save the Children project (91005) was successful in securing an investment of 5,480 euros from the local government and 7,414 euros from communities in Kyrgyzstan and 37,481 euros from local government and communities in Tajikistan for mitigation projects. In Georgia, as a result of advocacy work undertaken at the municipal level by an Oxfam project (91011) with support from DIPECHO, 60 per cent of village development funds on average (up to 10,000 GEL/approximately 4,350 euros per village) in all communities of the three municipalities of Keda, Shuakhevi and Khulo were dedicated to DRR (these funds were used mostly for mitigation projects, the replication of the common tools for vulnerability analysis and the development of village contingency plans in non-targeted villages). In Armenia, local authorities made a financial contribution to the establishment of the continuing education resource centres as well as the small scale mitigation projects, using the community budgets. Twenty four small scale mitigation projects across South Caucasus received a financial and/or in kind contribution from communities and local authorities- on average of 34per cent in Georgia, 25 per cent in Azerbaijan and 26 per cent in Armenia. As part of the same project, a small scale mitigation measure initiated by Oxfam in Azerbaijan (the reconstruction of the only road connecting Qarali to the main road), a businessman living in the village supported community members in rebuilding 1 km of road connecting the school to a new housing area. 3.7.2.3 Conclusions Overall, notable progress has been made in the HoA over the last decade to mainstream DRR - although the level of progress varies between countries. Some of the specific examples of mainstreaming could be at least partially attributed to the work that ECHO has done to build up a culture of drought risk reduction and promote its mainstreaming into development policies. Although DRR has been mainstreamed in policy documents, national and local authorities are still dependent upon external sources of funding for DRR activities, particularly community based DRR. This suggests a continued need and demand for ECHO funding for DRR in the region (although the needs will vary by country). ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 75 In CAC, the main successes have been in the mainstreaming of DRR within the education sector. Beyond education, there are still considerable challenges facing DIPECHO in integrating DRR in other relevant sectors (health, agriculture, environment, etc) and overall development planning and programming. There is support for DRR actions in both the HoA and CAC, from international donors as well as from national and local authorities \u2013 this is a positive outcome and one which can be attributed, at least in part, to ECHO\u2019s role in advocating for DRR. ECHO was one of the first humanitarian actors to run a DRR focussed programme in these regions; it placed DRR on the national agendas as well as on the agendas of the international donor community active in the region. In this respect, DG ECHO funding \u2013 although small \u2013 acted as a catalyst. There is some replication and scaling-up of activity under DRRAP and DIPECHO, however a massive scale-up only appears to have taken place in Kazakhstan. In other countries, replication of DG ECHO funded DRR projects is not as extensive as it could be. 3.7.3 Reinforcing sub-national response capacities EQ11. To what extent have the ECHO-funded actions contributed to reinforcing sub-national response capacities, including the preparation and awareness of local communities? 3.7.3.1 Key Findings from the HoA Drought affects communities by harming their livelihoods (destroying crops and livestock), affecting water quality/ availability and causing food shortages (sometimes leading to famine). In the HoA the traditionally pastoral communities have adapted to drought and developed practices (migration, food rationing, selling cattle) to cope with the above effects of droughts. Over the last few decades however, it has been more difficult to activate these traditional mechanisms, as the populations in the HoA have grown and national and regional policies have created obstacles. 106 Humanitarian emergency responses to drought usually include measures such as water trucking, food aid, restocking of livestock and livelihood support. Communities can facilitate their response by monitoring drought warning information and feeding this back to the authorities. They can also mitigate some of the effects of drought and enable themselves to cope independently for longer by preparing for drought \u2013 e.g. reserving pasture, rationing food and water, slaughtering livestock vulnerable to disease, saving money or generating additional income to buy food if the drought persists. ECHO partners and beneficiaries maintain that beneficiary communities\u2019 response capacity has been improved, e.g. through extended/increased access to water, reserved rangeland, increased household assets and improved destocking practices. The DRRAP contributed to reinforcing sub-national response capacities in a number of ways: \uf0a7 by supporting local EWS and linking this to wider district or national level EWS; \uf0a7 by raising awareness for DRR and helping communities to develop their own contingency plans so that they can have greater ownership over the drought response; and \uf0a7 by establishing income-generation and savings systems \u2013 e.g. VICOBAs as a form of \u2018social safety net\u2019 when drought hits. Each of these three points is discussed in turn below. Most communities are, however, still dependent upon outside support (either from international donors/organisations or \u2013 where 106 E.g. In 2008, bans on the trade and export of cattle were introduced in Djibouti \u2013 see the 2008 Financial Decision. The creation of national parks and political boundaries have made migration between different grazing areas increasingly difficult (e.g. in Karamoja, Uganda) \u2013 see also the 2006 Funding Decision and Coopi Final report 2012.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 76 available \u2013 national mechanisms) to respond to drought. While ECHO has supported regional, national and local authorities responsible for drought response, project documentation and our observations in the field (in Uganda and Kenya) 107 suggest that communities feel more comfortable requesting support from international organisations than from local / national authorities, whom they sometimes mistrust or are not aware of. For community drought response to be effective, it needs to happen as early into the drought as possible, which is why early warning systems can reinforce response capacities. At least 31 projects included activities to develop or strengthen community EWSs. In Ethiopia, a number of community EWSs were observed by the evaluation team to be still functional even after the DRRAP had finished. EW data was still being regularly collected by communities and had been linked to woreda authorities. At the time of the visit, one community at the Somaliland border had gathered early warning data indicating a potential locust attack and responded by informing their cross-border neighbours. The collection of early warning data in a format the pastoralists understand (e.g. using pictures) has also led to improved understanding of vulnerabilities and potential shocks at the community level. However, EWSs are only useful when they trigger response and often government contingency funds are limited or unavailable. At least 51 DRRAP projects established or strengthened community disaster management committees and/or trained community members in DRR. The CDMCs consulted at project sites in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda demonstrated increased awareness and understanding of the risks of drought and knowledge of the ways to respond when drought arrives (e.g. by destocking livestock, reserving pasture, etc) as a result of their participation in DRRAP actions. Other community members also demonstrated DRR knowledge resulting from their contact with CDMCs. The CDMCs in most cases had the role of disseminating knowledge on DRR to the rest of the community, but in most cases appeared to function mainly as community development committees and to a smaller extent, as disaster management committees. Box 13 Contingency plans: purposes and application Community contingency plans enable a community to plan their disaster response. During the 2010/2011 drought, 34 communities which had developed contingency plans through one cross-border project (2010/01009) were able to use the plans to attract aid from government, international humanitarian organisations, as well as the private sector and business. 108 In some communities, VICOBAs have also increased sub-national response capacity \u2013 e.g. in Dasanach the VICOBA set up by VSF Germany is used primarily to bulk-buy food so that villagers have to walk long distances to the nearest market less frequently. 109 Members of VICOBAs visited during the evaluation team\u2019s field trip to Kenya also reported that they would use the VICOBA during crises to buy food or medicine. In Ethiopia however, it was unclear how these groups improved community resilience to drought. 3.7.3.2 Key Findings from CAC DIPECHO actions have contributed to the reinforcement of sub-national capacities through the following channels: 107 In Ethiopia, a mistrust of authorities was not observed; however, one community visited reported that it informed the ECHO partner working in the area of an oncoming locust attack, who then informed the local authority, suggesting that \u2013 at least in some communities \u2013 the NGO is still the first port of call. 108 See Oxfam (2013) Impact Evaluation Report on the Ethiopia- Somaliland Cross-Border Community-Managed Drought Resilience Project, September 2013. 109 VSF Germany \u2013 Final Report of the project \u2018 Improved Cross-border Community Response to Drought Phase 4 (ICRD4)\u2019 .

To what extent have the project activities and results had (or likely to have in future) lasting effects after hand-over? In particular, the evaluator is expected to assess to what extent the supported actions and strategies at local, regional and national level are sustainable in the Horn of Africa Region. 3.7.4.1 Key Findings from the HoA Sustainability of the regional actions The regional projects have had a major role in multiplying the effects of the DRRAP by consolidating and communicating the lessons of the programme to a wider audience. For example, DfID Uganda used information produced through REGLAP to inform their programming. The research and documentation into DRR produced through DRRAP (e.g. published on disasterriskreduction.net and through REGLAP) have been well-used by a range of actors and it is likely that they will continue to be used as reference documents. REGLAP has recently registered as the Dryland Learning and Capacity Building Initiative (DLCI) for improved policy and practice in the HoA. 110 It has not yet secured funding for continued publications, but continues to function as a resource and information organisation for other NGOs, CSOs and authorities working on DRR. By supporting the IFRC, which is one of the main disaster responders in the HoA (an auxiliary to national institutions in disaster preparedness and response), DG ECHO has also supported an action with sustainable effect. The evaluation team\u2019s visit to communities supported by the IFRC action confirmed that those who had been trained by the Ugandan 110 See [online] Available at: http://www.disasterriskreduction.net/east-central-africa/dlci ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 78 Red Cross had increased their technical capacity to respond to drought and to train others in the future. The UN agencies (UNISDR, UNICEF, FAO) have also worked closely with national and regional authorities to ensure that DRR practices are integrated into development policies. At national / regional level, work is ongoing to ensure the sustainability of the DRRAP\u2019s activities and outputs. Donors, national authorities and IGAD have taken over / continued many of the activities started under the DRRAP. However, for the activities and results to be sustainable in the long-term, continued support to national and regional authorities is required, but it should not necessarily be ECHO providing this support. Sustainability of the cross-border actions The key cross-border achievements have included: \uf0a7 improved animal health (cross-border cooperation on vaccinations and monitoring of animal health); \uf0a7 peace-building (better cross-border cooperation); and \uf0a7 improved sharing of natural resources. Local governments and communities visited report that cross-border coordination will continue, and \u2013 for some projects 111 - the sustainability of the cross-border programme has been increased through working closely with both the Kenyan and Ethiopian governments. By contrast, other officials underlined the need for continued international support to address the root causes of the conflicts (i.e. to improve access to resources) and to possibly also maintain the good work done in cross-border relations (e.g. through continued learning, additional exchange trips / inter-community meetings, etc). Sustainability of the community-focussed actions Some of the localised impacts resulting from the DRRAP are sustainable: local communities demonstrated behaviour change, increased knowledge and awareness of risk. However, changes in knowledge and behaviour need to be periodically reinforced through repeat interventions until the changes are cemented. At a local level, small scale structural mitigation measures are unlikely to be maintained without continued funding and it seems that the educational / awareness-raising work at community level has not reached a \u2018critical mass\u2019 to have a continued impact without external funding \u2013 e.g. DRR is not part of the national curricula in Kenya (it is in Ethiopia); community DRR may be sustainable if the devolved development planning process proceeds as planned. Exit strategies and sustainability The evaluation team found that many ECHO partners did not have sufficiently well-defined exit strategies to ensure sustainability (see also Section 3.5.1). Where exit strategies were set out in Single Forms, in practice they were not successfully executed to ensure the successful \u2018 hand-over \u2019 of activities. The 2012 DRRAP stipulated that any follow-up of projects from the previous decisions will be considered if the proposal includes a justified consolidation and an exit strategy with a clear timeline. Phase IV of the DRRAP was intended to achieve consolidation of past achievements, best practices identified and lessons learned along the way. Evidence suggests, however, that this was not fully achieved. The concept of an exit strategy, an inherent element of the DG ECHO pilot approach, appears to be poorly understood and not taken seriously by ECHO Partners 112 . 111 Cordaid\u2019s project. 112 Oxfam evaluation (2011) cross-border evaluation.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 79 3.7.4.2 Key Findings from CAC As noted in earlier sections, the impact on beneficiary awareness is outlasting the duration of the projects. DRR capacities and tools (community risk assessments, DRR planning, emergency response teams, etc) developed at community, school and local levels will likely persist, but will require refreshment and ongoing support. Community co-sponsorship of mitigation projects improves ownership and subsequently encourages maintenance, presenting a great likelihood of sustainability. The concept of co- investment, between public and private entities, and communities, would be a good way forward. However, this is not possible for every community due to budget constraints or, at times, lack of will. The mainstreaming of DRR in school curricula will have a lasting impact, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan where national ownership and commitment is high. In other countries (e.g. Georgia), there are risks to sustainability, e.g. DRR has been mainstreamed, but the government has not allocated significant any funds to DRR in teacher training. Similar to the HoA, while exit strategies exist \u2018on paper\u2019, they do not always result in a successful \u2018hand - over\u2019 of activities in practice. 3.7.4.3 Conclusions Some of the activities implemented through the DRRAP/ DIPECHO show evidence of continuation even after ECHO funding has ended: \uf0a7 where ECHO partners have secured additional funding from other donors to continue / scale-up the action; \uf0a7 where the action has been mainstreamed into the regional / national / local agenda or relevant sectoral policies; and \uf0a7 when they have led to changes in knowledge, awareness and/ or behaviour (although changes in knowledge and behaviour will need to be reinforced). The challenges for ECHO and other actors in DRR will be to sustain the initial benefits of community based actions such as replenishing stockpiles, maintaining mitigation measures and providing refresher training and ensuring various groups established by projects \u2018 keep going \u2019 despite migration and staff turnover. 3.8 Cost-effectiveness EQ15. Is the size of the budget allocated by ECHO to the regions appropriate and proportionate to the actions they are set out to achieve? Is it sufficient to reach a critical mass of impacts? Could the same results have been achieved with less funding? 3.8.1 Key Findings from the HoA Critical mass and adequacy of ECHO funding At the regional and national level, the DRRAP has generated interest from authorities and from other donors. On this basis, the evaluation team consider that the investment of the DRRAP into creating institutional linkages and advocacy (through the regional, cross-border and country-based actions) was worthwhile and that it made a significant contribution to the hopefully continuing success of DRR in the HoA. Whilst the funding of DRR at community- level has also created positive localised impacts, it is evident that community-based activities have not been sufficient to create a \u2018critical mass\u2019 of impacts ; communities are still dependent upon international donor funding when a drought arrives (see Section 3.8.3), and there has been limited replication of activity in unassisted communities. ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 80 Whilst the DRRAP funding was probably too little to achieve \u2018critical mass\u2019 in the HoA (even accounting for wider replication and scaling-up), 113 it was enough to reach the objectives it set out to achieve (piloting good practices, testing their effectiveness, disseminating lessons learned with a view to improving practices and putting DRR on the agenda of other actors). Yet, the evaluation team has noted a number of \u2018 inefficiencies \u2019 which have to some extent hampered the extent to which these objectives could be fully achieved. \uf0a7 There is little evidence to demonstrate that lessons learned from previous phases of the projects were taken into account in later funding phases (see Section 3.5). Whilst most partners did evaluate the different phases of their projects, this does not appear to have been a requirement and the Single Forms do not require partners to explain how they plan to build upon the lessons learned from any previously funded DRRAP interventions. The former RSO coordinator of the DRRAP has reported that it was a \u2018 very difficult /time consuming process to make partners understand the need to actually document findings, lessons learned , products so that conditions for change could be created \u2026 [there was] too much focus on activities and not enough on how to use the outputs and outcomes for an evidence based advocacy \u2019 . 114 \uf0a7 Projects have been funded despite weaknesses in design and issues with past track record. Indeed, in its monitoring of projects, ECHO has identified various problems in project design and past partner performance, but nevertheless decided to fund follow-up phases to these projects, as part of its long term strategy for capacity building. \uf0a7 The results of individual DRRAP projects and funding decisions have not been clearly documented, consolidated and reported . Results are reported in various documents published by ECHO partners, but these are presented in a promotional fashion and the actual impacts are not always clear. It would increase the transparency o f ECHO\u2019s DRR actions in the HoA if results were reported in a consistent manner by ECHO partners. Cost effectiveness (Could the same results have been achieved with less funding?) The return on investment of the DRRAP actions is difficult to calculate due to the lack of clear and consistent information on the results and impacts. Final reporting by ECHO partners tends to list only the activities completed and the outputs delivered, but rarely the results of these outputs (e.g. changes in knowledge or behaviour, improved access to resources, etc). This information is provided where ECHO partners have evaluated their projects, but the evaluation reports are only available after a considerable time lag. Further, the lack of standardised core indicators and units for reporting on results renders it challenging to make comparisons between projects: e.g. some projects report on the number of households reached, whereas others report on individuals and others report on communities reached. The evaluation team also believe that it would be much easier to assess outputs and results if these were presented in a separate section of the final report, e.g. as a table rather than in a narrative following each item of the intervention logic \u2013 see Table 3.16 following.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 82 The evaluation team noted several shortcomings with the current approach to the monitoring and reporting of outputs and results: \uf0a7 There were inconsistencies between projects in how outputs were reported: some final reports presented information on outputs under the description of activities, which means that data had to be manually counted which may lead to some inaccuracies. \uf0a7 Some indicators were presented or repeated/duplicated in different parts of the report creating a risk of double-counting outputs in our analysis. \uf0a7 Outputs were not always explicitly counted, although they were referred to (e.g. there was mention of water points being built, but without any indication of the number) which creates the possibility that some outputs are missing in the analysis above . \uf0a7 Some activities do not lend themselves to quantification . \uf0a7 There is variation in the quality of the information provided in reports . \u2013 In some reports the objectivity of the figures as been questioned during the review process (i.e. in the ficheops). Not all queries posed by DG ECHO in the ficheops were answered in the final report and this may limit the extent to which data in the table can be generalised to the DRRAP as a whole. \u2013 Some projects reported on percentage change indicators without providing the actual number / baseline, which means the indicators could not be always be traced back to raw data. 3.8.2 Key Findings from CAC Critical mass and adequacy of ECHO funding The goals set out in the funding decisions are rather vague and at the same time, they are not quantified which makes it difficult to answer the first part of the question. DG ECHO actions aim \u2018 to increase resilience and reduce vulnerability of local communities and institutions through support to strategies that enable them to better prepare for, mitigate and respond to natural disasters \u2019 . However, the funding decisions do not specify the target number of local communities and institutions; nor do they specify what \u2018 success \u2019 would look like (i.e. what metrics will be used to assess changes in resilience or vulnerability). Moreover, as with the HoA, it is difficult to get a consolidated view of programme achievements given that: \uf0a7 Output indicators (referred to as objectively verifiable indicators in the log frames) used by projects are non-standardised and reporting against these is fragmented. It is thus not possible to aggregate these across the programme. \uf0a7 Expected/ actual outcomes and impacts are not systematically defined or measured by projects through independent evaluations. As regards the second part of the question i.e. whether ECHO funding is sufficient for reaching a \u2018 critical mass \u2019 of impacts, the answer depends on the timeframe over which ECHO wants to achieve critical mass. Given the baseline positions of these countries, change cannot be achieved in one or two years. At the same time, \u2018 throwing more money at the problem \u2019 is not always the best solution. ECHO\u2019s own experience in some countries shows that when it comes to DRR, behavioural, mind-set and institutional change takes time, but can be achieved with relatively modest amounts of funding. One issue in the pursuit of critical mass, that needs to be addressed, is the special role of the UN and other international agencies, many of which have a long-term in-country presence and often have remits that relate strongly to DIPECHO\u2019s mandate: UNDP in wide terms for DRR nationally and locally; UNICEF for education; and WHO in health. These bodies have evident and considerable potential to take on or support strategic leadership in specific DRR sub-sectors, and this is not properly addressed by their inclusion as competitors for DIPECHO funding, alongside for example, actors such as Oxfam or CARE.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 83 more strategic approach to DIPECHO working with UN partners is warranted, for example, especially given how UNICEF is shifting \u2018 upstream \u2019 towards a role dedicated to institutional and national policy development, having found in the Tajikistan case, the costs of applying for and managing DIPECHO projects to be rather too high. Cost effectiveness (Could the same results have been achieved with less funding?) According to the 2009 evaluation 116 , ECHO traditionally assesses the cost effectiveness of its projects by dividing the projects costs by the estimated number of direct beneficiaries (e.g. the number of people trained, the approximate number of people reached by awareness campaigns, etc); and costs of up to 10 euros/person as acceptable. A total number of ~623,000 direct beneficiaries (less than 1 per cent of the total population of the region) were reached by 15 DIPECHO projects (funded under 2012 Decision) 117 at an investment of ~ 10 million euros which equates to a per beneficiary cost of 17 euros. This is higher than the ECHO benchmark. However, as the 2009 evaluation points out, cost per beneficiary is a rather crude and imprecise measure of cost-effectiveness. For example, it makes structural mitigation projects look prohibitively expensive compared to relatively \u2018 cheaper \u2019 options, e.g. conducting DRR awareness and training programmes. Another way to determine cost-effectiveness would be to compare the costs and benefits of DG ECHO\u2019s intervention . While the cost of DIPECHO are known, it is almost impossible to get a sense of benefits as projects are not required to report on outcomes. Moreover, it is not feasible for programme evaluations as they are currently designed to calculate the return on investment of DIPECHO, as such an exercise would entail significant data collection activities on the nature and scale of benefits of all or at least a representative sample of projects. This would require ECHO to allocate more time and resources to ex-post evaluations, than is presently the case. The evaluation team tried to consolidate the information provided by projects in their final reports to get a sense of what the ~10 million euros have been spent on \u2013 see Table 3.18. It should be noted that Table 3.18 does not provide an exhaustive account of all outputs delivered, but rather an illustration of the types of outputs delivered.

The efficiency was calculated by comparing the property value of homes protected from avalanches (300,000 euros) to the cost of the mitigation project (10,000 euros) delivering a return on investment of 1:30. 3.8.3 Conclusions A consolidated picture of the aggregate outputs and results achieved at a programme level cannot be obtained due to weak reporting systems and in the absence of standardised monitoring indicators. Consequently, it is not possible to determine if the \u2018 same results \u2019 could have been achieved with less funding. On the basis of previous findings on the relevance, effectiveness and added value of ECHO funding and given the wider evidence on the costs and benefits of DRR demonstrating the high economic and social returns of DRR actions 118 it can however, be concluded that the money was spent wisely. Likewise, it cannot be definitively concluded whether the funding was sufficient for reaching a critical mass of impacts or if the same results could have been achieved with less funding. What can be said is that a critical mass of impacts through community based DRR actions was not reached over the period covered by this evaluation (2009 \u2013 2013) due to limited replication, scaling-up and mainstreaming. 3.9 Lessons learned EQ9. What are the main lessons learned in terms of good/bad processes/mechanisms having allowed taking over/scaling-up by governments and other donors, impact on national policies, increase in national/external investment in DRR, etc? What has worked or not in the DRR approach/actions and what were the major critical success factors influencing the achievement of these actions? What good practices of intervention in the field of disaster preparedness at the level of communities have been established? What coordination mechanisms and exchange of information and experience have developed among key stakeholders in the field of disaster preparedness? How can the identification and documentation of good practices be further improved? 118 For a summary of literature, see KC, Shyam. 2013.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 85 3.9.1 Key Findings from the HoA Lessons learned There is a need for ECHO to ensure that the selection of projects is appropriate for the goals it sets out to achieve / for the target beneficiaries. While some ECHO partners have succeeded in empowering communities, raising their awareness about disasters, etc, in other communities this has not worked so well. Some of the ficheops (for projects funded under the 2012 HIP) question partners\u2019 capacity to implement the CMDRR approach 119 and the evaluation team\u2019s field visits uncovered evidence of some actions implemented being inappropriate for the target communities. Box 15 outlines one such example of mismatching of activity and the community in Uganda. Box 15 Pastoral drop-outs and CMDRR In the Moroto District of Uganda, the evaluation team visited one community, which was observably vulnerable. The community had lost much of its livestock and was subsisting primarily on charcoal- burning and casual labour, being situated close to the town of Moroto. Children in the community were suffering from malnutrition, there were high levels of aid dependency and evidence of substance abuse. This vulnerability appeared to have been driven by a lack of coping mechanisms in place to either prevent, prepare for or cope with (the impacts of) drought and/or conflict. The community had benefitted from an environmental development project (a re-forestation project) and had participated in various sessions to build their awareness of DRR and capacity to manage disaster- risk. The action did not appear to have influenced the communities\u2019 understanding of drought preparedness or made them more resilient. In this case, it appears that the community lacked the necessary baseline capacity to manage their own DRR in-community, and would have rather benefitted from a much more targeted action (e.g. income generation or livelihood diversification actions). The DRRAP was not fully effective in allowing ECHO to respond to drought emergencies. Interviews with ECHO Field suggest that during the 2011 drought, ECHO partners with approved projects in areas affected by the 2011 drought did not react early enough to the drought, and - instead \u2013 maintained the status quo with their project work instead of accelerating the project timetable and adapting activity to respond to the unfolding crisis. Nonetheless, ECHO learned from this experience and \u2013 as a result \u2013 has started to encourage ECHO partners to build contingency into their DRR project budgets to enable a shift in funds from preparedness activities to crisis-response / relief in reaction to sudden needs. This approach has also been recommended in the literature. 120 This method is currently being implemented through the La Nina consortium. Water maintenance projects. A number of DRRAP projects included components to improve access to water. For example, Red Cross Uganda trained Water User Committees (WUCs) in bore-hole maintenance. While WUCs demonstrated a good understanding of how to maintain and protect bore-holes, this has not prevented the bore-holes from falling into disrepair (10 out of 12 of the bore-holes in a community visited by the evaluation team were broken). This suggests that more could be done to raise awareness within the entire community about how to properly use and care for the bore-holes to prevent them from breaking so frequently. Further, these actions have not managed to resolve the issue of cost- recovery for repairs and having sufficient cash for repair work. This means that while many 119 In the 2012 Final ficheops for two of the cross-border ET-KE projects, DG ECHO HQ questions the appropriateness of the CMDRR approach, observing a \u201clack of buy - in\u201d from the local community. The evaluation team observed in the field that CMDRR had mixed success. In some communities it appears to have worked very well. This may also be an issue of partner capacity. 120 See, for example: Save the Children & Oxfam (2012) and Chatham House (2012) \u2018 Translating Early Warning into Early Action: Response by Donors and Implementing Agencies \u2019 \u2013 Workshop Summary, 11-12 April 2012 ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 86 DRRAP partners have \u2013 logically \u2013 included water components in their projects, this has not been a sustainable investment. In Ethiopia, it was observed that water produced through DRRAP-funded structures was mostly not potable, and Aquatabs were not always available. For example, in one project money was given to the community to organise contractors to build a berkard. The berkard had water in it (from the previous rainy season), but it was green from algae growth. However, the CMDRR committee members stated that the water was clean. Some of the iron sheets had been replaced by wire mesh, supposedly to ensure air circulation as the water would otherwise go stale; however, as the berkard was not closed at the ends, there seemed to be plenty of room for air circulation without the wire mesh, which increased the risk of bird droppings which contaminated the water. Critical success factors The following non-exhaustive list of critical success factors have been identified by the evaluation team: \uf0a7 Knowledge management (e.g. FAO-managed disasterriskreduction.net; UN-ISDR disinventar website and the REGLAP publications): Country-level and regional knowledge management systems have proven to be useful for authorities and donors alike. The information has clearly been used to inform policy (see e.g. the recent UPFDRR Strategy document). REGLAP has been effective at this, and has at the same time \u2018 pushed \u2019 a lot of knowledge down to the community level \u2013 e.g. the evaluation team met local implementing organisations that had both contributed to and made use of articles published by REGLAP. Disaster loss databases which have been set up in the region in Kenya and in Ethiopia under the DRRAP are also crucial to communities or implementing partners because they provide information and knowledge about previous disasters. Further, by focusing on knowledge generation and dissemination, the DRRAP established the principle of good practices documentation in DRR in the HoA. \uf0a7 Coordination with existing national institutions and mechanisms : The evaluation team observed that the IFRC action to develop Red Cross \u2018 surge capacity \u2019 to respond to drought during crisis showed evidence of sustainability, because it utilised community- based volunteers. However, the team observed that this was largely due to the strong institutional standing of the Red Cross in Uganda (as in Kenya) and so it is clear that while this approach works for the Red Cross, it could not necessarily be replicated by others. Good practice The following practices implemented through the DRRAP can be considered good practices: \uf0a7 CMDRR: The evaluation team observed that the CMDRR tool is an effective tool for \u2018opening the eyes\u2019 of communities to the linkages between hazards and vulnerability and empowering them to identify strategies to mitigate the impacts of these hazards. In most of the communities visited, CMDRR had increased community knowledge, empowered communities to improve their own resilience and in some cases had also resulted in behaviour change (e.g. in the ways that communities prepare for drought and build resilience to it). An indicator of the usefulness of CMDRR as a planning tool is evidenced by the fact that the community development and contingency plans have been taken up by local authorities in Kenya to inform their County Development Plans. The use of CMDRR needs to match the capacities of the target community as discussed in Section 6.4.1. 121 121 ECHO partners consulted in this field phase have also demonstrated that the CMDRR process requires a number of years\u2019 investment - to allow for the review and updating of contingency and development plans and to reinforce CMDRR practices within the community \u2013 for it to be fully effective. Such long-term investment was possible for those DRRAP projects implemented over multiple phases, but may have been another driver for the failure of the CMDRR process in those communities where it was only implemented in one phase.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 87 \uf0a7 VICOBA / Village Loans and Savings (VLS): These function primarily to generate income for communities by allowing them to access markets (using loans) which they then pay back with interest once they have earned a profit from their market interaction. The evaluation team found evidence that in a couple of communities, VICOBA were also structured to support interest-free loans to particularly vulnerable people. In both of these ways, the VICOBA can increase community resilience. The evaluation team see potential for VICOBA in specific country contexts to contribute to the sustainability of the CMDRR process if communities were to use them as a disaster contingency fund / emergency response fund and/or for specific disaster-preparedness activities (such as cereal-banking, planting drought-hardy plants or purchasing drought-hardy livestock). \uf0a7 Exchange visits: These appeared to be an effective tool for addressing cross-border and cross-community conflict. Communities in Karamoja reported that as a result of such visits they have better relations with (some) neighbouring communities 122 and in North Horr, as a result of cross-border peace workshops organised between elders and local administrators in Ethiopia and Kenya, peace agreements have been signed between the Gabra (KE), Daschnet (KE) and Amar (ET). \uf0a7 Agro-pastoral field schools (APFS): These have had a notable take-up by other donors, particularly in Karamoja (e.g. SDC in Ethiopia and Kenya and EU-DEL in Uganda) and have been supported by government. Communities visited who had participated in APFS demonstrated a greater understanding of the \u2018science\u2019 behind agro - pastoralism and were empowered to experiment and test innovative techniques that could lead to improved farming / animal-rearing. However, experimenting takes a while and needs monitoring and for this reason APFS usually require long-term investment to be effective. In view of this, a positive outcome of the DRRAP is that DEVCO is now funding APFS in Uganda. 3.9.2 Key Findings from CAC The lessons learned and good practices are already well documented in the case of DIPECHO, 123 some of which were reinforced by the information collected during the fieldwork. Identifying and targeting the \u2018 most vulnerable \u2019 Tools for assessing vulnerability: Oxfam\u2019s CTVA approach is recognised as good practice in the region and has been widely adopted by other partners, including ACF, Georgian Red Cross, and UNDP. An external evaluation of ACF\u2019s DIPECHO funded project activiti es in Georgia 124 provides a number of useful suggestions for enhancing the CTVA approach, demonstrating partners\u2019 commitment to learni ng and continuous improvement. DRR in urban contexts: DIPECHO projects in CAC have traditionally focussed on vulnerable communities living in rural and/or remote, isolated areas. However, as described in Section 2.2, urban areas in the region are also highly vulnerable to hazards. At the 2013 lessons learned workshop in Almaty, both ECHO and the partners recognised this gap in the geographic coverage of DIPECHO. Building upon the lessons learned workshop, the 2014 HIP for CAC explicitly provides support for DRR in urban settings. 122 Nonetheless, cattle raids continue between this village and neighbouring ones. The community also reported that the growth of arable farming has also helped inter-community relations. The increasing use of agriculture to supplement their food sources has reduced the reliance on livestock and made communities more settled. As a consequence, smaller herds are more manageable and compete less over limited grazing land. 123 DIPECHO Study: Lessons Learned for an Improved Strategy and Approach, March 2013 and DIPECHO VII in Central Asia and DIPECHO II in Southern Caucasus Lessons Learned Exercise Workshop - Almaty, Kazakhstan, 18-20 September 2013. 124 Murtaza, N.

There is a need to develop and promote the theory and application of \u2018 disaster economics \u2019 . Stronger complementarity and link between community-based or sector-specific DRR work and policy advocacy work: community-based or sector-specific DRR projects should provide the \u2018 ammunition \u2019 to advocate for DRR, e.g. real life stories, evidence and data on risks, costs and benefits, etc. Building partnerships and coalitions for advocacy: joined-up, coordinated and focussed advocacy efforts are likely to be more eff ective and efficient than a \u2018scatter gun\u2019 approach. Partners should work together for common advocacy goals and make full use of existing platforms and fora for this purpose. For example, one of the partners interviewed suggested that in Tajikistan, the Donor Coordination Council could be used as a platform for advocacy aimed at donors. Donor mapping: targeted advocacy efforts should be underpinned by a good understanding of the donors active in the region, their programming cycles and priorities. Factors contributing to project success Ownership built through involvement of communities and relevant authorities in the entire project cycle. Quality and commitment of partners. Projects are more successful if they: are delivered by partners with a significant presence in the country/region/community; have the ability to work with communities and local government; are involved in both development and DRR; and are learning organisations that are committed to DRR activities beyond ECHO's short term funding cycle. Risk informed project design. Basing project design on participatory community-based risk assessment supporting the optimal use of local knowledge, but also complementing it with external scientific knowledge. Sustainability of community based DRR projects The following factors contribute to the sustainability of community based DRR projects: \uf0a7 Simple, easy-to-maintain, low-cost activities are more likely to be maintained by communities in comparison to complex interventions. For example, ECHO partner ACTED explained that it involves local builders and uses locally sourced construction material to build structural mitigation measures, so that these can be maintained even after DIPECHO funding has ended. \uf0a7 The involvement of local implementing partners builds long-term local capacity for DRR. \uf0a7 Supporting linkages between community based DRR with government institutions, e.g. linking community emergency response teams with district response teams. \uf0a7 Community co-sponsorship of mitigation works improves ownership and subsequently encourages maintenance. However, this is not possible for every community due to the lack of money or, at times, a lack of will and deficient \u2018 power analysis \u2019 in the project design. \uf0a7 Fin ding local \u2018champions\u2019 to promote DRR .

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 89 also frequently-onerous national authority checking and approvals processes, which can reduce this time effectively down to just 14 \u2013 16 months. \uf0a7 While the constraints on any increase in the cycle are well recognised by partners, a contradiction is noted by partners in that a short effective project duration, does make it especially hard to work in zones where access is impeded over long winter periods and the summer/autumn part of the cycle is the only opportunity to deliver results, such as physical mitigation measures and measures involving forestry, agriculture and livestock. Furthermore, there is a contradiction between the short effective cycle and addressing the underlying causes of vulnerabilities. \uf0a7 The gap between DIPECHO funding cycles results in institutional loss of memory and loss of momentum, with considerable opportunities for DIPECHO to support more strategic approaches to applying lessons and practices and building up collaborations early on in each funding cycle, once the portfolio of successful applicants is clearly established. Documenting and exploiting the lessons learned and good practices developed While a number of examples of lessons learned and good practices have been highlighted above, ECHO and its partners are not systematically: \u2018 harvesting \u2019 the key lessons and DRR good/best practices (both at field and policy levels) achieved so far; systematising these findings; determining audiences for the dissemination of findings; and delivering specific targeted manuals and other guidance in ways designed to meet the communication needs of potential users across other parts of these countries, across DRR subsectors and to other regions. There is a clear need to better articulate the somewhat-haphazard lesson learning activities of DIPECHO, with the clearly-defined needs of user groups, which would lead then to adequate programming of replication, scaling-up and mainstreaming activities. One point to be made is the opportunity to gather lessons annually, along the lines of the Sept. 2013 Almaty workshop, but not only deliver these at the end of the project cycle, but also at the beginning of the next cycle, once winners of projects are known, to enable the targeting of lessons to the clear needs of current partners, and to establish direct collaborations and agreements on how to deliver on these early-on in the actual project implementation phase. It should also be noted that a dedicated website for DIPECHO lesson learning materials for the CAC region, would be very useful, as it would provide a \u2018 space \u2019 for sharing findings, even if these are provisional. For example, the Almaty Sept 2103 report is not yet posted online. 3.10 The multi-partner (consortia) and the multi-country approaches EQ14. What has been the partners\u2019 experience of working in con sortia as well as with a multi-country approach? 3.10.1 Key Findings from the HoA Consortia approach There have been four kinds of \u2018consortia\u2019 functioning within the DRRAP: \uf0a7 official consortia of ECHO partners working together to implement an action \u2013 e.g. the consortium of REGLAP, the DCA-ACTED-C&D consortium working cross-border in Uganda and Kenya and (under the Resilience envelope) the La Nina project; \uf0a7 unofficial consortia between partners , as encouraged by DG ECHO \u2013 e.g. of the four cross-border projects in the Kenya-Ethiopia frontier; \uf0a7 a consortium-like system behind the DRRAP whereby UN agencies (FAO, UNDP, UN- ISDR) were tasked to provide technical and coordination support to other ECHO partners; and ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 90 \uf0a7 the consortia established within projects where partnerships created local NGOs and/or local offices of international NGOs for implementation. ECHO partners working in consortia have found the approach to be useful as it has allowed them to pool expertise. The DCA consortium continues to work together in Karamoja even now that ECHO funding has finished. DfID - inspired by ECHO\u2019s approach - has also recently started to use a consortium approach for funding through its Arid Lands Support Programme (ASP) Internal Risk Facility (IRF). Yet consortium-work can also be challenging. ECHO requires only one lead partner to sign its contract, so in order to mitigate the risk for this partner (e.g. liability for project failure), effective project management structures need to be put in place. In Ethiopia, the new \u2018 cluster \u2019 approach introduced by ECHO in 2012 (see Section 2.2.1.3 for an explanation of this approach) has forced partners to coordinate and conduct joint planning. A number of donors commented that this new approach has led to improved donor coordination, particularly as partners are now required to submit proposals as consortiums to provide a multi-sectoral package for a geographical cluster. This joint planning to arrive at a common log frame is seen by many donors as particularly important, as demonstrated by the following comment from an ECHO partner: \u2018 The new cluster approach is an improvement. It represents a concerted approach to share expertise across NGOs. It should help to minimise overlaps of activities and identify where you can have a good entry point and how to build synergies. It should improve resource utilisation, and having a common objective and a common log frame should help to build resilience. \u2019 Coordination between ECHO partners funded under the DRRAP has overall been quite effective. Some projects were also highly interlinked \u2013 e.g. the Save the Children 2010 project produced information on nutrition that fed into ACTED\u2019s EWS (implemented through the DCA project) and from 2010 onwards ECHO partners were encouraged to feed information to regional (coordinating) DRRAP partners, e.g. by sending articles to REGLAP for publication. ECHO partners were encouraged to consult each other about the project design to ensure complementarity in the targeting of beneficiary communities. It has also facilitated joint-working between UNDP and UN-ISDR on the implementation of HFA in the region. The evaluators observed that the ECHO partners based in Nairobi who attend the briefing and debriefing meetings know each other and e ach other\u2019s programmes well and a few staff have worked in more than one organisation funded through DRRAP. In Ethiopia, ECHO DRRAP partners also meet regularly at the national level and also at the regional level, e.g. Oromia and Somali quarterly Technical Coordination Meetings and during monitoring visits and in Uganda, the coordination of ECHO partners was led by FAO from Kampala and Moroto. Regional partners emphasise that the DRRAP provided an opportunity to nurture new alliances between the UN and NGOs. However, non-regional ECHO partners have not always recognised the added value of the regional partners\u2019 internal coordinating role. ECHO partners based in Uganda and Ethiopia reported that FAO did not provide sufficient support to them. One ECHO partner based in Uganda held the view that FAO scheduled meetings without due planning \u2018 to meet their project quota for activities \u2019 and felt that FAO could have done more to distribute technical knowledge and new studies, and been more proactive in providing technical guidance. The coordinating role of FAO may also have been hindered by the fact that UN agencies are structured mainly at country level and the country and regional offices are not internally coordinated. This point was argued at the meeting of DRRAP regional partners in Nairobi in April 2014. In spite of this, and also due to the collaborative efforts of the non-regional DRRAP partners, the programme appears to have been successful in generating a community of practice amongst humanitarian organisations working on DRR. Given the need for greater coordination on drought \u2013 between humanitarian organisations, international donors, national and regional authorities and CSOs \u2013 this regional approach was appropriate. ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 91 Partnerships between local NGOs and ECHO partners have worked well on the whole. Many of these are well established and even existed prior to the DRRAP. All implementing partners reported positively on their relationship, commenting only that coordination could have been further improved through more regular meetings and/or greater involvement in coordination with other ECHO partners. It appears that ECHO partners have largely involved local partners in the whole project cycle from design to implementation. They have been selected on the basis of different criteria, including their links with the local community, years of experience in the region, and technical expertise. This has been most effective when each partner has had a distinct role. Some challenges have arisen, particularly when local partners do not have access to the same resources and expertise (e.g. in monitoring and evaluation) as local branches of international NGOs. Multi-country (cross-border) approach ECHO partners experienced some challenges in cross-border working, such as increased costs (e.g. in travel, in currency exchange) and increased bureaucratic obligations. They also underlined that they required more time to engage authorities on both sides of the border. However, there was a clear logic for launching cross-border drought preparedness projects given that drought and its ensuing problems (e.g. animal and human disease) heavily affect the borderland areas of the HoA and considering that the agro-pastoral populations living in these areas rely on resources (water, pasture) on both sides of the borders to maintain their livelihoods and health during times of drought. The evaluation team observed positive outcomes in the field: establishment of regular dialogue between cross-border communities, increased trust between previously conflicted communities and national authorities and improved communication between authorities across borders. The cross-border actions have also resulted in a bilateral agreement between Kenya and Uganda on animal health 125 and stakeholders report that in specific locations there is increased access to resources (water, pasture). Both ECHO partners and end beneficiaries view the cross-border approach positively. In contrast, ECHO has expressed a concern that the cross-border projects did not do anything different from country-based projects , commenting that some of the projects were delivered almost as two separate country-based projects and that in its 2013 and 2014 HIPs it does not fund cross-border projects. The evaluation team also observed in interviews with the project leads of two separate cross-border projects that the interviewee did not have a clear overview of the full project. Staff in other cross-border projects, however, demonstrated comprehensive knowledge of the entire project. Overall, the benefits of the cross-border approach (cross-border cooperation, sharing of resources, awareness-raising about the nature of drought and how to address it) appear to have out-weighed the disadvantages. 3.10.2 Key Findings from South Caucasus and Central Asia The consortium approach has not yet been applied in CAC, although partners expressed an interest in it during interviews. Under the 2012 Decision, DIPECHO funded seven country-specific projects; five multi- country projects and four regional projects \u2013 Table 3.19 shows the focus of these projects. The funding of multi-country/ regional projects is seen as a key dimension of the added value of ECHO\u2019s approach as such an approach yields economies of scale, promotes collaboration, cross-learning and cross-application of tools and practices. However, the evidence demonstrates that there is scope to more systematically \u2018exploit\u2019 the cross -border 125 Memorandum of Understanding on Cross-Border Animal Health Coordination signed between the Department of Veterinary Services \u2013 Kenya and the Department of Animal Health and Entomology \u2013 Uganda on 24 th April 2013.

Table 3.19 Focus of multi-country and regional projects in CAC (2012 Funding Decision) Multi-country projects Regional projects 2 out of 5 multi-country projects delivered similar interventions in multiple countries, but incorporated specific cross-border activities, e.g. sharing of experiences and learning Creation of cross-border working groups aimed at fostering cooperation and collaboration to identify and address cross-border risks, e.g. cross-border disaster simulation drills, etc (although in one case, cross-border activities could not be implemented due to political developments and in the other case, inter- communal violence caused some delays) 3 out of 5 projects delivered similar activities in multiple countries without any specific cross- border dimension or linkages between activities in different countries A UNICEF project aimed at mainstreaming DRR in education in Central Asia (covering 4 countries) A UNICEF project aimed at mainstreaming DRR in education in Caucasus An OCHA project aimed at increasing awareness, preparedness and the response capacities of humanitarian partners, including authorities, at local, national and regional levels in Central Asia and Caucasus (covering 8 countries) An Oxfam project supporting community resilience in the South Caucasus 3.10.3 Conclusions Despite some challenges, the consortium approach in the HoA has proven to be useful as it has allowed partners to achieve greater scale by pooling expertise and resources. Other donors have shown an interest and are also adopting such approaches. In Ethiopia, the new cluster approach introduced by ECHO in 2012 is widely acknowledged to have led to improved donor coordination. The multi-country approach has had clear added value in terms of yielding economies of scale, promoting collaboration, cross-learning and addressing cross-border risks. 3.11 Unintended / unexpected effects EQ10. Are there any apparent unintended or unexpected effects and risks from the actions (spill- overs; institutional changes in partners, both positive and negative; effects on nutrition; effects on the environment; or effects on gender relations or other social relations)? Overall, the evaluation found limited evidence of unintended or unexpected effects. This is not surprising given that DRRAP/ DIPECHO are now established programmes with a clear intervention logic. 3.11.1 Key Findings from the HoA Two spill-over effects from DRRAP projects were identified by the evaluation team: \uf0a7 Some ECHO partners note the positive impact of their DRR activities on peace-building in the local area, particularly where the projects have developed symbiotic processes (e.g. the interdependence between agro-pastoralists and pastoralists which resulted from COOPI\u2019s fodder production project in the Kenya / Et hiopia cross-border region \u2013 2012- 91036) or entailed visits between villages focusing on the exchange of good practice (e.g. as through Danchurchaid\u2019s cross -border project in West Pokot / Karamoja, or the early warning a community in Ethiopia had received from Somaliland [due to linkages established through a DRRAP project] of an upcoming locust swarm \u2013 the information ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 93 was relayed to the implementing partner who in turn ensured a meeting was held with the relevant Ethiopian authorities). \uf0a7 Improving access to water and pasture is resulting in some places in pastoral sedentarisation. This was not an intentional outcome. Interviewees seemed happy to have swapped the pastoral way of life for a settled life with better access to (animal and human) health services and education for their children. However, there are potentially negative outcomes from sedentarisation including land degradation, loss of culture and traditional land management practices. ECHO partners present at the field based debriefing workshop aft er the evaluation team\u2019s Ethiopia field trip in April 2014 suggested that environmental, social and economic impact assessments should always be performed to understand the broader impacts of interventions. 3.11.2 Key Findings from CAC The breaks between the DIPECHO funding cause loss of staff, which, while negatively affecting the momentum of project implementation, also result in staff turnover and institutional loss of memory. At the same time, successive cycles of DIPECHO funding have had the unintended consequence of creating grant dependency on ECHO (this was also the case to a lesser extent in the HoA 126 ). ECHO partners usually co-finance their actions through their own funds, but it would be perhaps more conducive to sustainability to incentivise partners to secure co-financing from other donors, communities (even in-kind) and/or private donors. In the 2012 funding round, only 7 out of 16 projects secured co- funding from other donors with the total volume amounting to just over a million euros (however, a vast majority of the total co-funding mobilised by ECHO partners [70 per cent] relates to a single project: co-funding was secured by OCHA from the US Government, Russia and its own budget to undertake a regional DRR project). Table 3.20 Funding sources for DIPECHO in CAC: 2012 Funding Decision Source of Funding Amount of funding As % of total ECHO funding 7,990,801 \u20ac 77% Own funds 1,262,662 \u20ac 12% Other donors 1,097,196 \u20ac 11% Total 10,350,659 \u20ac 100% Based on data provided by DG ECHO 126126 E.g. Cordaid has reported that it has found it challenging to identify follow-on funding now that DRRAP has ended, because its approach was so interlinked into the DRRAP (Cordaid was one of the first partners to be funded and the DRRAP was partly developed around their existing actions in the region).

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 94 4 Recommendations 4.1 Strategic recommendations This evaluation highlights important considerations about the future direction of DG ECHO\u2019s strategy and approach to DRR in the HoA and CAC. A number of strategic recommendations have been made to support enhanced policy impacts and maximise the added value in the future. These are set out below. Recommendation 1: DG ECHO\u2019s DRR funding should be targeted to wards the countries and beneficiaries that are most in need The evaluation reinforces the need to focus DRR funding on countries facing a high level of risk for disasters, while lacking the financial and technical capacity to reduce their own levels of risk. Specifically, within CAC, this calls for a more selective approach to country coverage going forward. The entry criterion for DG ECHO funding should be countries where DRR gaps are the greatest in relation to domestic capacity and needs. The achievement of the specified objectives for the country concerned should be the point of exit. This calls for a clear specification of country level DRR objectives \u2013 see also Recommendations 8 and 9. Furthermore, within the target countries, funding should be directed to: \uf0a7 specific DRR sub-sectors, areas (rural and/ or urban) and communities that are most in need; and \uf0a7 the DRR investments that are most needed (but which can be effectively funded by DG ECHO given its comparative advantages and funding/ political constraints). In this context, DG ECHO should examine how to account for new communities at risk, such as urban communities and pastoral drop-outs in the HoA. 4.1.1 Scope of \u2018DRR\u2019 in the HoA Recommendation 2: DG ECHO should consider widening the scope of its \u2018DRR\u2019 activities in the HoA from \u2018drought risk reduction\u2019 to \u2018disaster risk reduction\u2019 The HoA is prone to many hazards such as droughts (slow-onset), floods, landslides, lightening (all of which are rapid-onset hazards), diseases and epidemics (e.g. Ebola, malaria, etc). Although drought remains the single most important risk facing the region, significant progress has been made in recent years in mainstreaming drought risk reduction within the resilience agenda, where it quite naturally fits. A number of donors are now active in this \u2018space\u2019, leaving fewer gaps to be filled with DG ECHO funding. Some of the other hazards might however, be less well addressed by national/ local authorities and donors alike. DG ECHO should therefore, consider widening the scope of its programming activities from \u2018drought risk reduction\u2019 to \u2018disaster risk reduction\u2019 in the HoA. 4.1.2 Overall approach to DRR Stand-alone versus integrated DRR approaches Recommendation 3: Alongside stand-alone DRR projects, DG ECHO should direct more support to (integrated) projects addressing underlying risk factors in CAC DG ECHO should consider directing more support to projects addressing underlying risk factors and DRR in an integrated manner, while remaining cognisant of the implications of such an approach in terms of the concomitant desirability of reduced support for stand-alone DRR projects in the region. The long-term nature of interventions aimed at addressing underlying risk would however, need to be reconciled with the short term funding cycles of DIPECHO and budgetary constraints. This could be achieved by: ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 95 \uf0a7 increasing support for the \u2018 repeat funding \u2019 of projects which, over two or more funding cycles, take on the successive phases of the work required to tackle the longer-term nature of dealing with risk factors; and \uf0a7 requiring greater levels of co-financing from alternative sources (see also Recommendation 15). Recommendation 4: Following on from Recommendations 1 and 2, DG ECHO should continue to support both standalone as well as integrated DRR projects in the HoA DG ECHO should continue to follow a \u2018blended\u2019 approach to DRR that includes financing for both stand-alone as well as integrated DRR projects depending on the country context and the risks being addressed. Geographic approach to funding decisions (regional versus country specific programming) Recommendation 5: DG ECHO should maintain a regional approach to funding decisions in HoA and CAC This evaluation demonstrates the strong added value of adopting a regional approach to DRR. A regional approach allows DG ECHO to fund regional and multi-country/ cross-border projects (which is widely regarded as a key element of DG ECHO\u2019s unique added value) , facilitating cooperation and collaboration across partners and national/ local authorities and promoting efficiencies through the exchange of material, good practices and lessons learned. A regional approach also gives DG ECHO the flexibility to deal with country level variations in the absorption of DRR funding. Given that the evaluation found no evidence to suggest a shift in approach, DG ECHO should continue to follow a regional approach to its funding decisions in the HoA and CAC. A \u2018top down\u2019 versus \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach Recommendation 6: DG ECHO should continue to adopt a combination of \u2018top - down\u2019 and \u2018 bottom- up\u2019 approaches to DRR , considering that the two approaches are highly complementary and mutually reinforcing (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) This evaluation demonstrates the added value and benefits of supporting policy advocacy and institutional linkages in conjunction with community or sector based DRR projects, although arguably there is scope to further enhance the linkages between the two. For instance, community-based or sector-specific DRR projects should provide the \u2018 ammunition \u2019 to advocate for DRR, e.g. real life stories, evidence and data on risks, costs and benefits, etc. This is already the case in the HoA. Engagement with UN Agencies Recommendation 7: DG ECHO should adopt a more strategic approach to its engagement with the United Nation (UN) Agencies (this recommendation only applies to CAC) UN agencies have a long-term in-country presence and often have remits that strongly relate to DIPECHO\u2019s mandate: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)/ United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) in wide terms for DRR globally; UNICEF for education; and the World Health Organisation (WHO) for health. These bodies have evident and considerable potential to take on or support strategic leadership in specific DRR sub-sectors, and this is not properly addressed by their inclusion as competitors for DG ECHO funding, alongside international NGOs such as Oxfam or CARE, for example. A more strategic approach to working with UN partners is warranted, for example through joint DRR needs assessment, priority setting or even coordinated funding of DRR activities. ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 96 4.1.3 Improved accountability, monitoring and reporting Recommendation 8: DG ECHO should precisely define the objectives of each Humanitarian Implementation Plan (HIP) (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) The HIP objectives should be \u2018SMART\u2019, providing a clear idea of what each funding decision is expected to achieve and by when. There should be a clear hierarchy of objectives including: \uf0a7 global objectives (corresponding to impact indicators); \uf0a7 specific objectives (which correspond to result and outcome based indicators); and \uf0a7 operational objectives (which correspond to output indicators). To the extent possible, objectives should be specified in quantitative terms and for each country of operation. Better ex-ante specification of objectives would allow for improved (ex-post) measurement of impact. Evidence on the benefits of DRR is critical for persuading other donors and national authorities to replicate and scale-up DG ECHO-funded activity. Recommendation 9: HIPs should be accompanied by a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) Related to the above recommendation, HIPs should be implemented in concert with a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework that systematically covers the activities and results achieved across the portfolio of funded projects, and that generates information both for internal project management, as well as for evaluating progress at programme level. This would include enhanced attention to risks and assumptions, both at project and programme levels. The M&E system should be based on a core set of standardised indicators 127 to enable inter- project comparison and aggregation across the portfolio. Partners could still be allowed the flexibility to use some project-specific indicators. Recommendation 10: DG ECHO should better demonstrate the impact of its DRR funding (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) To persuade others (to replicate or scale-up), both DG ECHO and partners, should place more emphasis on collating, presenting evidence on return on investment and where feasible, generate quantified estimate costs and benefits of their activity, e.g. actual/ expected reduction in disaster losses as a result of the funded action. 4.1.4 Building local capacity Recommendation 11: DG ECHO should provide capacity building support to local NGOs to ensure long term capacity and sustainability of DRR (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) On the basis that DG ECHO has decided against any amendments to the Financial Regulation (to allow it to directly fund NGOs), a separate evaluation on the subject offers practical steps that DG ECHO can take in the short to medium term to support local NGO capacity building 128 . For example, DG ECHO could incentivise its partners to more systematically involve local NGOs in their projects; DG ECHO could also directly engage in dialogue with key local NGOs to inform the design of HIP and discussions on good practice 127 The monitoring indicators contained in ECHO\u2019s 2013 thematic paper on DRR could be used as the basis for developing a more complete set of indicators that are relevant across all DRR programmes. 128 Germax (2013) Evaluation of the potential effectiveness and efficiency gains of working directly with local NGOs in the humanitarian interventions of the Commission.

Vulnerability assessments underpinning the selection of target beneficiaries should also be improved. Partners should be asked to provide the following information: \uf0a7 Which socio-economic groups have been identified as the \u2018 most vulnerable \u2019 in the targeted geographical area, sector or other ambit? \uf0a7 Why are these specific groups especially vulnerable? What causes and risk factors make these groups more vulnerable than others groups in the same community or in relation to other related communities? Recommendation 13: DG ECHO should support the systematic \u2018harvesting\u2019 of lessons learned and good practices developed (this recommendation only applies to CAC) DG ECHO should develop materials that capture lessons learned and generate reflections with partners at the end of each funding cycle, via a process involving the review of project documents, and regional and inter-regional workshops; and then implement a process whereby these lessons and measures are delivered to partners and properly accounted for, by successful applicants in next funding cycle. The identification of good practices has mainly focused on community based DRR activities. DG ECHO and partners should be encouraged to document and share good practice in policy advocacy. DG ECHO could also support national authorities in generating assessments, at the end of each funding cycle, of the implications of the completed projects for national DRR programming. An example could be the preparation of one or a series of presentations to national DRR official platforms, where these exist. This could include proposals for how government DRR and sectoral ministries could be enabled to take up findings and apply these in their programming, including determining key gaps and developing proposals and applying to international bodies for DRR funding. DG ECHO should advocate for DEVCO resilience programmes to actively incorporate learning from its DRR investments and the establishment of processes to capture lessons learned. This could include more detailed attention to DRR issues during DEVCO country programming and within frameworks such as national or regional environmental profiles, taking advantage of DG ECHO guidance and best practices materials. This would ensure that priority sector programmes designed within country assistance strategies would account for opportunities to tackle DRR either as a cross-cutting issue or via a specific set of measures. Recommendation 14: DG ECHO should coordinate donor-mapping exercises for each region on a regular basis to support focussed advocacy efforts (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) To support successful advocacy, DG ECHO should commission regular donor mapping exercises which identify the main donors active in each country of interest, their programming cycles, funding priorities and financial envelopes. Recommendation 15: DG ECHO should encourage projects to mobilise co-financing from domestic public or private sources or other donors (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) ",
        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 98 This recommendation is self-explanatory. Recommendation 16: Multi-country projects should be required to establish and demonstrate links between activities in different countries through for example, cross-border learning or knowledge exchange activities, joint activities such as simulations and trainings, etc (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) This recommendation is self-explanatory. Recommendation 17: Projects should receive funding over multiple cycles only if they show improvement, differentiation in approach or innovation over successive cycles (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) Projects receiving funding over multiple funding cycles should be underpinned by a justification based on: \u25a0 support by DG ECHO of decisions by national authorities to pre-qualify and authorise DG ECHO\u2019s portfolio of winning projects, to avoid delays in starting-up due to slow authorisation of these; \u25a0 clear additionally of actions; \u25a0 lessons learned from previous cycles taken up via strategic assessment and uptake actions; and \u25a0 innovation in approach. Recommendation 18: DG ECHO partners should be required to better articulate their plans to promote the sustainability of funded outputs and outcomes, including risks to sustainability and mitigating measures (this recommendation applies to the HoA as well as CAC) This recommendation is self-explanatory.

Outside of the DRRAP, DG ECHO TAs based in HoA participate in multi-stakeholder forums (including donor forums supporting national government policymaking) However, international humanitarian principles (neutrality, impartiality, independence) prevent DG ECHO from working directly with political entities, such as national authorities / Governments DG ECHO has advocated for DRR in the region by increasing its visibility and demonstrating its benefits. Multistakeholder dialogue is facilitated and in some cases, formalised in the form of National Platforms (Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan). However, international humanitarian principles (neutrality, impartiality, independence) prevent DG ECHO from working directly with political entities, such as national authorities / Governments Support the integration of DRR into developing countries' development policies and planning, including relevant sectoral policies, climate change adaptation strategies and crosscutting issues DRAAP funded interventions support the integration of DRR considerations into planning and development either at local (community / district) or national level DG ECHO is supporting the mainstreaming of DRR within development policies and planning through advocacy and dialogue. However, links between DRR and development planning and programming have not been fully established. This remains work in progress. A key plank of ECHO\u2019s strategy is to develop partnerships with development actors, but this is challenging in practice for several reasons. Development actors have their own priorities and multi-annual plans. DIPECHO cycles are not aligned with their long term plans. DG ECHO is trying/ experimenting, but it is difficult to get results in this area. Better integrate DRR into EU policies, support strategies, programmes and projects In Brussels, DG ECHO and DG DEVCO have increased coordination on DRR and resilience in recent years, evidenced by joint communications on these themes and joint programming (SHARE 129 ) in spite of the fact that the Close dialogue between DG ECHO field and EU- delegations. DEVCO is funding some DRR projects in the region 129 'Supporting the Horn of Africa's Resilience' (SHARE).

At field level, there is now a high level of coordination between ECHO Field and the EU Delegation in Ethiopia, but this has not been formalised in Kenya and Uganda, and can be dependent on individual personalities\u2019 drive and relationships. One positive development in Kenya is that DGs ECHO and DEVCO now participate together in Kenya\u2019s ASAL monthly donor platform set up by the Kenyan national government to develop DRR policy and programming. through PPRD programmes. However, DRR is not embedded within DEVCO\u2019s programmes in the region \u2013 see Annex 5. Support the development and implementation of national policy, legal and institutional frameworks for DRR, including National and Regional Platforms DRRAP regional partners (Oxfam/REGLAP, FAO, UN- ISDR, UNICEF, UNDP) have -with ECHO support - provided technical support to national and regional institutions in developing DRR policy and tools. Some non-regional DRRAP partners have also fed into DRR policy-making and institution-building at district level. DG ECHO indirectly supports the development and implementation of national policy, legal and institutional frameworks for DRR through its activities. Regional Knowledge Management workshops are organized on bi- annual basis under UNICEF\u2019s DIPECHO funded DRR programme in the region, to provide governments with a forum to meet and share experiences, knowledge and resources across the region. Three countries have national DRR platforms (Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan) where these exist, their development has been led by other actors (UNDP and national governments) - with support from DIPECHO in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan ",

Donors\u2019 approach to DRR funding is fragmented and no consolidated overview is available. This is not d ue to lack of effort on ECHO\u2019s part. It should however, be noted that ECHO remains the single largest donor to support DRR in CAC. Support the UN/ISDR as the coordinating body for the implementation of the Hyogo Framework DG ECHO funded the UNISDR through the DRRAP to support HoA institutions in implementing the HFA. As indicated in section 2.2.2, since the fourth funding cycle, UN agencies have played a key role in the implementation of DIPECHO and HFA priorities in Central Asia. In South Caucasus, where only two DIPECHO funding cycles have been implemented until 2013, ECHO and UNICEF have worked closely over both cycles to promote the mainstreaming of DRR in education. Identify, assess, and monitor disaster risks \u2013 and enhance early warning Support expanded research (scientific, technological and socio-economic) and statistical capacity in developing countries 16 projects (20% of all DRRAP projects) over the evaluated period involved a technical study, workshop or survey (e.g. UNDP\u2019s cobra study an d UN- ISDR\u2019s cost - benefit analysis). Further, 38 projects (47%) involved some kind of localised survey or mapping of the situation on the ground (e.g. mapping of natural resources, of community attitudes, vulnerability assessments, identification and collection of EWS indicators, etc.) Not many examples of such activity could be found. One notable example is the OCHA project (91009). Through this project: \uf0a7 Age and sex disaggregated data were acquired and processed at the province level for the 8 countries covered by the project. This data were then incorporated into 6 inter-agency contingency plans (Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) \uf0a7 Common operational datasets collected for two priority countries - Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. \uf0a7 Vulnerability indicators defined and agreed upon with partners in all countries in the region. Vulnerability indicators incorporated into IACPs in three priority countries (Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan) 130 This was not the case for projects such as the Caritas Germany project on Drought Preparedness and Emergency Response Operation in Eastern Ethiopia and the Save the Children Drought Preparedness Programme for pastoral communities in Ethiopia (PILLAR) which both focused more on improvement of WaSH and livelihoods in the specific communities in the region and on relief and resilience-building in the case of PILLAR.

This is partly because in 2010, 15 out of 26 projects funded aimed to support communities in linking DRR contingency planning to EW systems. A number of projects funded under the 2012 Decision have supported the establishment of EWS e.g. installation of hazard warning bells (91002), rain measuring gauges, gongs (91003), sirens and alarms (91012) Use knowledge, innovation, and education to build a culture of safety and resilience at all levels Support awareness-raising campaigns and programmes At least 14 projects (17%) included specific awareness- raising or communications components. One of the main awareness-raising projects has been REGLAP which has published various articles on good practices and lessons learnt in DRR. A number of funded projects have run awareness raising campaigns e.g. German Agro Action ran 25 awareness campaigns in public places such as tea houses, schools and mosques, reaching more than 6,300 individuals in Tajikistan with support from DIPECHO (91002) Support the inclusion of DRR in education and training At least 11 projects targeted schoolchildren to teach them about DRR. UN-ISDR worked with teachers to try and promote DRR education in national curricula. With support from DIPECHO , UNICEF has made considerable progress in mainstreaming DRR in the education sector Help make DRR information more easily available, particularly to people in high-risk areas All projects target populations exposed to drought. Many also target communities in isolated areas (e.g. VSF-G project in Illeret) trying to target populations not reached by national safety nets / politically marginalised groups. A number of DIPECHO projects have targeted hard to reach communities in remote, disaster prone areas (mainly rural). Less focus on urban areas, even though urban areas are highly vulnerable in CAC as highlighted in section 2 Support the development or up-scaling of community-based disaster risk management programmes, including the use of market based insurance mechanisms DG ECHO seeks to achieve scaling-up and replication through the demonstration effect of its projects and through advocacy. A few projects have tried to improve communities\u2019 access to markets and financial security by protecting existing assets / introducing new ones (mainly livestock, e.g. camels), introducing village loans and savings systems, training community members in different skills to diversify livelihoods options. However, these interventions have mainly had the objective of increasing resilience other than economic development or \u2018up - scaling\u2019 of programmes.

Seek ways to more explicitly and harmoniously link DRR and climate change adaptation objectives Although it recognises climate change as one of the drivers to increasingly frequent droughts in the region, DG ECHO has not explicitly and harmoniously linked the DRRAP objectives to climate change objectives. Very few projects - except for the UN-ISDR projects - have explicitly linked CCA and DRR objectives. DG ECHO encourages partners to integrate climate change adaptation and environment protection components in projects. However, very few projects have actually done so and their activities in this area have been limited to delivering training and awareness raising It should be noted that climate change is not the main focus of DIPECHO. On the other hand, several DIPECHO VII projects have unintentionally contributed to CCA objectives (i.e. CCA was not the goal being pursued by these projects; nor CCA issues explicitly considered in project design and implementation) e.g. Solar Disinfection (SODIS) technologies, structural mitigation activities Support integrated programmes or projects addressing DRR and multiple issues identified as compound risk factors (e.g. DRR / climate adaptation / food security) The DRRAP has tried to emphasise links between DRR and other sectors of humanitarian response, particularly livelihoods, but also WaSH (e.g. 2009/01014), food security (e.g. 2009/01006), and human health (e.g. 2012/91060). In CAC, the funded projects tend to focus exclusively on DRR, although some examples can be found where projects have incorporated wider issues such as food security (e.g. 91002) and climate change adaptation (e.g. 91014) Explore how innovative funding can be mobilised for the benefit of both DRR and adaptation Communities were encouraged to invest their own money (on top of ECHO money) into village loans and savings systems to use in emergencies or to use to improve the economic status of the village to make them more resilient.

Only a few DRRAP projects integrated relief components into their DRRAP intervention \u2013 e.g. project 2009/(01012 incorporated relief activities such as a voucher system for vulnerable households and a crisis modifier of 20% to be released in case of drought.

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 136 Annex 6 Overview of key concepts A6.1 Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) The most commonly cited definition of DRR is one used by UN agencies: \"The conceptual framework of elements considered with the possibilities to minimize vulnerabilities and disaster risks throughout a society, to avoid (prevention) or to limit (mitigation and preparedness) the adverse impacts of hazards, within the broad context of sustainable deve lopment\u201d. (ibid). The promotion of DRR represents the latest step along a path of continuous evolution in the practice of disaster management since the 1970s 132 . The scope of DRR is much broader and deeper than conventional emergency management. In 2005, at the UN\u2019s World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR) the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) became the first internationally accepted framework for DRR adopted by 168 Governments. The HFA set out five priorities for action attempting to \u2018capture\u2019 the main areas of DRR intervention. In March 2015, the HFA will come to an end and be replaced by a new international framework for disaster risk reduction and resilience. The Overseas Development Institute (2012) has highlighted the need for more focus on disaster risk management (DRM) in the new post-2015 framework 133 . There have been calls for an improved version of the current HFA, with a set of common standards, a comprehensive framework with achievable targets, and a legally-based instrument for disaster risk reduction. A6.2 Disaster preparedness Preparedness is the knowledge and capacities developed by governments, professional response and recovery organisations, communities and individuals to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from, the impacts and of likely, imminent or current hazard events or condition 134 . Disaster preparedness constitutes one component of DRR when considered as a conceptual framework to \u201c minimize vulnerabilities and disaster risks throughout a society, to avoid (prevention) or to limit (mitigation and preparedness) the adverse impacts of hazards \u201d 135 . The importance of disaster preparedness is clearly recognised in ECHO's mandate and in the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid adopted in 2007. According to this Consensus \u201c The EU is committed to promoting disaster risk reduction and disaster preparedness in developing countries through coherent and coordinated action at local, national and regional level \u201d. In 1996 ECHO launched a specific programme, DIPECHO (Disaster Preparedness ECHO) dedicated to disaster preparedness. The DIPECHO programme is present in nine disaster- prone regions throughout the world. Disaster preparedness also has a central place in the 23 principles for Good Humanitarian Donorship agreed in 2003 in Stockholm by leading humanitarian donors, including ECHO. 132 UNISDR (2002) Living with Risk: a global review of disaster reduction initiatives. Various bodies of practice have been known over time as civil defence, emergency assistance, disaster response and relief, humanitarian assistance, emergency management, civil protection, disaster mitigation and prevention, and total disaster risk management. 133 ODI (2012) Disaster risk management in post-2015 policy frameworks: forging a more resilient future. 134 DG ECHO Thematic Policy Document n\u00b0 5 Disaster Risk Reduction (2013) Increasing resilience by reducing disaster risk in humanitarian action 135 Definition of DRR as per UNISDR's 2002 publication \"Living with Risk: a global review of disaster reduction initiatives\".

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 137 A6.3 Mainstreaming DRR into development Since the late 1990s, there has been increasing recognition by both governments and donors of the need to \u2018mainstream\u2019 disaster risk reduction into development 136 \u2013 that is to consider DRR in national (and regional) decision making processes (planning, policy and implementation). Mainstreaming of DRR is a governance process enabling the systematic integration of DRR concerns into all relevant development spheres as an underlying principle. This approach is based on the understanding that DRR is a cross-sectoral issue and as such is relevant for all relief sectors (health, shelter, water and sanitation, livelihoods and food security) and across key development sectors including education, infrastructure, housing and agriculture. Therefore, mainstreaming should be understood not as an end in itself but a strategy or means to achieving DRR. The HFA established a wider international commitment to mainstreaming DRR into development. One of the three strategic goals of the framework is to integrate disaster risk reduction into sustainable development policies and planning 137 . The European Commission Communication on the Consensus on Humanitarian Aid recognises the importance of improving DRR, both through better preparedness, but also \u2018 through mainstreaming of this (DRR) dimension into EU humanitarian and development aid\u2019 138 . However it has been observed that the term \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 may be a hindrance for DG ECHO staff and partners, who are overwhelmed with policy directives for \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 multiple issues (e.g. climate, gender, HIV/AIDS, etc.) 139 . This can result in a superficial \u2018tick the box\u2019 approach. The Regional Consultative Committee (RCC) has developed \u2018Guidelines on mainstreaming DR R into development\u2019 with an objective to provide operational guidance on \u2018how to\u2019 mainstream DRR in national/sector development planning 140 . A6.4 Resilience Early work around resilience focused on food security, albeit in a range of contexts (drought, flood and war). Since then, the agenda has diversified, as exemplified by the work of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (ISDR) 141 and the Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). Climate Change is also a major theme in the analysis of vulnerability and resilience. There has also been an increase in work on macro-economic vulnerability and resilience. The global food crisis of 2008, as well as subsequent shocks, stimulated additional work on resilience, both in terms of the security of global food supplies, and the need to strengthen social protection in poor countries In 2012, t he European Commission published a Communication on \u2018The EU approach to resilience\u2019 defining resilience as \u2018 the ability of an individual, a household, a community, a country or a region to withstand, to adapt, and to quickly recover from stresses and shocks\u2019 . The Communication sets out 10 guiding principles to increase resilience in food insecure and disaster-prone countries. The Communication focuses heavily on food security, and on essentially local programmes in the Sahel (AGIR) and the Horn of Africa (SHARE). There 136 Benson (2009) Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction into Development: Challenges and Experience in the Philippines. 137 UN-ISDR Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the resilience of nations and communities to disasters. 138 \u2018Towards a European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid\u2019, European Commission, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council, COM (2007) 317, June 2007, page 9. 139 2008 Evaluation of DRR mainstreaming in DG ECHO\u2019s humanitarian actions. http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/evaluation/2008/DRRMainstreaming.pdf 140 http://www.rccdm.net/index.php 141 \u2018Building Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters\u2019 is at the heart of the UNISDR -led Hyogo Framework for Action (2005-2015).

        "Joint Evaluation of Drought Risk Reduction in the Horn of Africa and DIPECHO Central Asia and South Caucasus (2009 - 2013) - Final Report 138 are references to wider issues and to macroeconomic shocks, but there is no reference to social protection. Whilst these initiatives have helped to refine and promote the concept of resilience, there is still no agreed concept on how to measure resilience. This is partly due to the fact that resilience is inherently difficult to measure 142 . The factors that influence resilience are numerous, varied, and interact in a complex manner. As such, it is not possible to define \u2018universal\u2019 indicators of resilience that can be applied in all situations. Nonetheless, it is possible to identify \u2018dimensions\u2019 of resilience \u2013 broadly defined categories of factors that are generally applicable but whose precise nature and relative importance vary across contexts. As such, numerous methodologies for measuring resilience have been developed (e.g. the Africa Climate Change Resilience Alliance (ACCRA )\u2019s Local Adaptive Capacity Framework; Alinovi et al. 2010; the ICIMOD Multidimensional Livelihood Vulnerability Index (MLVI); Oxfam GB \u2019s Multidimensional Approach for Measuring Resilience). These different methodologies all define different dimensions of resilience. Key areas of difference in these frameworks include: focus of measurement, unit of analysis, method of data collection, scale of measurement, frequency of data collection, types of measurement. A6.5 Linking Relief, Rehabilitation and Development (LRRD) Through LRRD - sometimes also referred to as \u2018transition\u2019 - the artificial gap between relief and development phases can be overcome. As the term states, LRRD is about linking relief, rehabilitation and longer term development interventions, regardless of the size or character of a disaster (sudden, recurrent or ongoing natural hazards or conflict). LRRD can be promoted by advocating for greater coordination and a more joined up approach between humanitarian and development actors, by laying the groundwork for sustainable development during humanitarian interventions and similarly ensuring that that humanitarian programming does not undermine development work, or by promoting development programming that builds on humanitarian knowledge and results 143 . At EU level, Communications in 1996 and 2001 underlined the importance of addressing LRRD at EU level, as did the 2007 European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid. LRRD was reconfirmed as a priority by EU institutions and Member States in the mid-term review of the Consensus Action Plan in 2010. The debate came to the forefront again with the 2011 crisis in the Horn of Africa, which despite early warnings resulted in famine due to late response and lack of an LRRD approach. Despite these Communications, tangible progress remains limited, as also confirmed in the 2012 OECD-DAC peer review of the European Commission 144 . According to the ODI (2014), while understanding of LRRD has become increasingly sophisticated, evidenced by the growing amount of literature on the topic, the concept has been put into practice only to a limited extent. Very few specific tools or guidelines have been developed. With attention currently focussed on \u2018resilience\u2019, there has however been renewed interest in the concept of LRRD. The EC Communication on Resilience (EC, 2012), although not explicitly employing the language of LRRD, did identify a need for investment in a kind of development assistance (i.e. resilience-building) in protracted crises. The ODI acknowledges that the EU is the major driving force behind the continued use of LRRD as an organising concept of aid 145 . 142 Summary of 2013 Expert Consultation on Resilience Measurement for Food Security 143 VOICE - CONCORD position paper (2012) Linking Relief Rehabilitation and Development (LRRD): Towards a more joined up approach enhancing resilience and impact 144 OECD DAC peer review of the European Commission (2012), pp.90-91 145 ODI (2014) Remaking the case for linking relief, rehabilitation and development: How LRRD can become a practically useful concept for assistance in difficult places/ ",

Advocacy work to encourage greater cooperation between humanitarian and development donors/ practitioners A6.6 Climate change adaptation According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate change adaptation (CCA) is \u201c the adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climate stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities .\u201d DRR is an important aspect of climate change adaptation. Climate change increases disaster risk in a number of ways. It changes the magnitude and frequency of extreme events (meaning that coping and response mechanisms and economic planning for disasters based on past vulnerabilities may no longer suffice). It changes average climatic conditions and climate variability, affecting underlying risk factors, and it generates new threats, which a region may have no experience in dealing with. Climate change is altering the face of disaster risk, not only through increased weather-related risks and sea-level and temperature rises, but also through increases in societal vulnerabilities - for example, from stresses on water availability, agriculture and ecosystems. However, DRR and CCA have common concerns in managing climate-related risks. They share a common goal of reducing vulnerability and achieving sustainable development. The figure below illustrates the overlap between DRR and CCA. 146 VOICE - CONCORD position paper (2012) Linking Relief Rehabilitation and Development (LRRD): Towards a more joined up approach enhancing resilience and impact ",

The programme is tackling prevention, preparedness and response to natural and man-made disasters affecting the Eastern Partnership countries and the EU, in view of the joint commitment to greater cooperation on disaster management. PPRD East r einforces the capacity of participating countries for disaster prevention, preparedness and response at local, national and regional level, and develops effective cooperation between the EU and the Partner Countries and among the Partner Countries themselves, as a means of political and social stability and security. Table A8.1 overleaf provides a more detailed description of the programme\u2019s objectives and purpose. The programme includes five activity areas which are meant to address the following main deficiencies: \u25a0 None of the Partner Countries possess an effective early warning system to allow the population exposed to hazards to take appropriate actions to avoid/reduce risk, and to prepare effective responses \u25a0 Although some of the neighbouring countries have similar risk and vulnerability profiles and geographic proximity, the existence of contacts and close co-operation between them is lacking \u25a0 Although some of the ENPI East region countries have well-developed systems of preparedness, and good risk assessment and planning methods, expertise within the respective systems is highly scattered and special measures are required to identify/systematise that expertise on the basis of a multi-hazard approach The PPRD East programmes as a whole consists of a review of existing resources and available mechanisms working on disaster prevention, preparedness and response in different countries, and develops an Electronic Regional Risk Atlas. The programme organises training workshops, study visits and exchanges of experts involved in disaster management, as well as technical assistance missions in response to specific demands by the countries\u2019 authorities. Further activities include awareness - raising for stakeholders and the general population. The programme focuses on achieving 5 results: \u25a0 Result 1: Better knowledge of risk exposure and available resources for enhanced preparedness and response capacities in the region (through creation of the Electronic Regional Risk Atlas) \u25a0 Result 2: Enhanced legislative, administrative and operational civil protection capacities of the Partner Countries in the field of prevention, preparedness and response \u25a0 Result 3: Improved information, awareness and participation of stakeholders regarding disaster prevention, prevention and response. \u25a0 Result 4: Partner Countries are well informed about the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and able to effectively collaborate with the Mechanism participating states in responding to disasters, including through close cooperation with the MIC via the established contact points. \u25a0 Result 5: Needs for a possible further development of cooperation with Eastern partners following the end of the Programme (Phase II) are identified.

Terms of Reference requirements How these requirements have been met by the evaluation Section 4.1 Evaluation questions \u2013 applying to all three regions examined The Terms of Reference sets out 16 specific questions to be addressed by the evaluation. The findings and conclusions of the evaluation with respect to each evaluation question are presented in section 3 of the main report. The answers are structured as follows: 1. Findings from the Horn of Africa 2. Findings from Central Asia and South Caucasus 3. Conclusions \u2013 this section draws conclusions that are region-specific as well as those that are common to both regions. NB: given that both Central Asia and South Caucasus are highly similar in terms of context, the nature of DIPECHO activities and considering that both regions share a common funding decision (since 2012), the two regions have been treated together for the analysis. Section 4.2 Tasks to be carried out by the evaluator: 1. An analysis of all relevant documents provided by the Commission concerning DG ECHO activities in the regions covered by the evaluation. 2. An analysis of relevant existing evidence (databases, reports, statistics, etc.) provided by other actors involved in the DRR field: national authorities, other donors, partners, international agencies. The desk research covered: 1. international, EU and national strategies and policy documents on DRR; 2. academic and grey literature on DRR and related concepts, e.g. resilience, climate change adaptation, and LRRD; 3. data and statistics on hazard risks; 4. programme documentation, e.g. funding decisions, good practice and lessons learned documents, presentations, etc; and 5. project documentation, e.g. single-forms, fiche- ops, interim reports, final reports, and evaluation reports. Given the large number of projects (81) and associated volume of documentation, a two-step approach was adopted for the HoA: 6. a broad-brush review of all project documentation; and 7. in-depth review of select projects. Table 1.2 in section 1.2 of the main report provides further detail on the sampling approach. Additionally, geo-spatial analysis was carried out for CAC. Maps were produced for each country showing (a) geographical coverage of DIPECHO funded projects and (b) the most dominant hazard risk and historic disaster events (due to budgetary constraints, it was not feasible to map all hazards). The purpose of this exercise was to determine if projects covered the areas most at risk. The results of this exercise are presented in Annex 11. 3. Interviews with Commission involved in activities in the regions. 12 scoping interviews (face to face) were conducted with DG ECHO officials (both HQ and field based) as well as relevant desk officers at DG DEVCO - see Annex 1. 4. Interviews, surveys and other types of data collection tools, to be defined by the contractor and validated by the 14 telephone interviews were conducted with DG ECHO partners (see Annex 1). ",

Interviews with various stakeholders were also carried out as part of the field work: \uf0a7 HoA: 69 stakeholders were interviewed. Additionally, a number of group meetings with beneficiaries were also organised at project sties. \uf0a7 CAC: during the fieldwork, the team interviewed more than 200 stakeholders and beneficiaries (92 in Central Asia and 120 in the Caucasus region). Annex 2 provides further details. Additionally, an online survey (using the EU Survey Tool) was developed \u2013 as a methodological experiment - to gather data from implementing partners. 5. Field visits to a relevant sample of case studies in the field, to be proposed by the evaluator. See Annex 2: \uf0a7 In HoA, fieldwork covered three out of the seven countries covered by DRAAP during the period 2009-2013 (Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda). \uf0a7 In CAC, fieldwork covered four out of eight countries (namely, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Armenia and Georgia). In both regions, the scope of the fieldwork was expanded to cover additional countries (in relation to ICF\u2019s initial offer): \uf0a7 In HoA, the fieldwork additionally covered Uganda. \uf0a7 In CAC, the fieldwork covered four countries instead of two (as originally proposed). 6.

The main instrument at EU level concerning is the Humanitarian Aid Regulation (HAR; No. 1257/96) 153 . 2. The humanitarian aid budget is implemented through annual funding decisions 154 adopted by the Commission, which are directly based on the HAR. A funding decision 152 http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-the-functioning-of-the-european-union-and- comments/part-5-external-action-by-the-union/title-3-cooperation-with-third-countries-and-humantarian- aid/chapter-3-humanitarian-aid/502-article-214.html 153 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1996:163:0001:0006:EN:PDF ",
        "is taken for humanitarian operations in each country/region at the time of establishing the budget, or for each unforeseen intervention as needed. The funding decision specifies the amount, the objectives, maximum amounts to be financed by objective, potential partners, and possible areas of intervention. In 2011 the format of the funding decisions changed 155 , and since then they are referred to as \u2018Humanitarian Implementation Plans\u2019 (HIP). 3. In recent years the focus has moved from mainly responding to disasters to implementing comprehensive Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) approaches. The UN\u2019s International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) defines DRR as: \"Actions taken to reduce the risk of disasters and the adverse impacts of natural hazards, through systematic efforts to analyse and manage the causes of disasters, including through avoidance of hazards, reduced social and economic vulnerability to hazards, and improved preparedness for adverse events\". There is increasing evidence that investments in DRR are generally cost-effective. Only 4% of the estimated $10 billion in annual humanitarian assistance is devoted to prevention, and yet every dollar spent on risk reduction saves between $5 and $10 in economic losses from disasters. 156 4. In 2005 a World Conference on Disaster Reduction was held in Hyogo, Japan. 168 governments adopted the \u201cHyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 157 : Building the resilience 158 of nations and communities to disaster\u201d (HFA). The Commission fully supports its implementation \u2013 however, only governments could adopt the HFA. A renewal of the HFA post-2015 is planned, and the European Commission is in the process of preparing inputs for this renewal. 5. ECHO actively participated in the development of the EU Strategy 159 (adopted in February 2009) supporting DRR in developing countries, and of its Implementation Plan 160 . This Strategy commits the EU to integrate DRR considerations more effectively into EU development and humanitarian policies. The importance of disaster preparedness is clearly recognised in the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid 161 adopted in 2007. A summary of ECHO\u2019s DRR actions is provided in a Factsheet 162 . 6. In 1996 ECHO launched a specific programme 163 , DIPECHO (Disaster Preparedness ECHO) dedicated to disaster preparedness. Disaster preparedness also has a central 154 http://ec.europa.eu/echo/funding/decisions_2013_en.htm 155 http://www.dgecho-partners-helpdesk.eu/preparing_an_action/financing_decision/wwd_hip 156 \"A Needless Toll of Natural Disasters\", Op-Ed, Boston Globe, 23 March 2006, by Eric Schwartz (UN Secretary General\u2019s Deputy Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery 157 http://www.unisdr.org/2005/wcdr/intergover/official-doc/L-docs/Hyogo-framework-for-action-english.pdf 158 Resilience is the ability of an individual, a household, a community, a country or a region to withstand, adapt, and quickly recover from stresses and shocks such as drought, violence, conflict or natural disaster. 159 http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/policies/dipecho/EU_Strategy_supporting_DRR_2009_en.pdf 160 http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/environment/documents/implementation-plan-disaster-risk-reduction-2011- 2014_en.pdf 161 http://ec.europa.eu/echo/policies/consensus_en.htm 162 http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/thematic/disaster_risk_reduction.pdf 163 Considering the structure of ECHO \u2019s mandate, this is more of an operational scheme \u2013 although with a specific budget line \u2013 but not a programme in the formal sense.

        "place in the 23 principles for Good Humanitarian Donorship 164 agreed in 2003 in Stockholm by leading humanitarian donors, including ECHO. The objective of DIPECHO is \u201cto support and complement existing strategies that enable local communities and institutions to better prepare for, mitigate and respond adequately to natural disasters by enhancing their capacities to cope and respond, thereby increasing resilience and reducing vulnerabilities .\" Recognising financing limits, and local responsibilities, DIPECHO project are essentially pilot projects that are designed to convince and encourage national governments, development cooperation services, civil society groups and communities themselves, to make greater investments in disaster risk reduction. Like all pilot projects the ultimate measure of their success is the extent to which they are replicated and scaled up. 7. The recurrent food crises in the Sahel region and in the Horn of Africa, where more than 30 million people are suffering from hunger, have underscored the need to work on a long-term and systematic approach to building the resilience of vulnerable countries and populations. The Drought Risk Reduction Action Plan 165 (DRRAP) focuses on increasing resilience and reducing vulnerability in local communities in the Horn of Africa through support to strategies to mitigate and respond to drought. This will be achieved primarily by 166 : \uf0b7 Fostering appropriate and sustainable preparedness activities which are coordinated with local and national public institutions, and which can be easily replicated in other parts of the region and beyond. \uf0b7 Reinforcing local response capacities and mechanisms. \uf0b7 Focusing on the areas most exposed to frequent droughts and with less coping capacities. \uf0b7 Targeting the most vulnerable communities and categories of population with the lowest coping capacities, using bottom-up participatory methods and relevant local materials/resources. \uf0b7 Supporting small-scale mitigation activities which have a demonstrative, complementary purpose and proven impact, and which can be easily replicated in other parts of the region and beyond. \uf0b7 Supporting actions related to build an evidence-based advocacy and awareness strategy as well as its implementation. 8. ECHO\u2019s contribution to disaster preparedness goes well beyond DIPECHO action plans and DRRAP as many of DG ECHO's major interventions include mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction as an objective. 164 http://www.goodhumanitariandonorship.org/gns/principles-good-practice-ghd/overview.aspx 165 Formalised by the annual funding decisions/HIPs, i.e. not formally a multiannual scheme. 166 Extracted from \u2018Operational recommendations for proposals under the 2012 DROUGHT RISK REDUCTION ACTION PLAN FOR THE HORN OF AFRICA REGION \u2019; http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/funding/decisions/2012/HIPs/HoA_annex.pdf ",
        "9. The October 2012 communication \u201cThe EU approach to resilience: learning from food security crises\u201d 167 states: \" The Commission will systematically include resilience as an element in its Humanitarian Implementation Plans. The Commission will moreover strive for joint programming of the resilience-related actions in its humanitarian and development assistance so as to ensure maximum complementarity, and to ensure that short-term actions lay the groundwork for medium and long-term interventions. \u201d The Resilience Communication resulted in Council Conclusions adopted 28 May 2013. The Resilience Action Plan 168 issued on 19 June 2013 provides the framework for continuation and scaling up EU efforts for resilience at different levels (from policy and advocacy to tools and methods) and with concrete country/region strategies and specific cases. The Communication complements ECHO's investment over the last 15 years in DRR and its strong commitment to the HFA. 10. Initiated in September 2007 by the European Commission, the Global Climate Change Alliance 169 seek to enhance cooperation and support between the European Union and poor developing countries, most vulnerable to climate change, to adapt to the effects of climate change. The costs of disasters are rising and become increasingly unaffordable, as climate change generates more severe weather related events and as the world faces new hazards and pressures such as population growth, urbanisation, land and eco-systems degradation and scarcity of natural resources. Thus, it appears necessary to integrate Climate Change adaptation into DRR actions. 2. SPECIFIC CONTEXT 2.1. Horn of Africa Droughts in the Horn of Africa (HoA) have occurred repeatedly over the last 8 years, affecting 67 million people. At the peak of the crisis in 2011, 13 million people were in need of emergency assistance across the region, and further droughts will without doubt have to be faced again in future. While drought is a normal climatic event, the pattern of development, specifically the persistence of widespread poverty, rapid and uncontrolled urbanization and environmental degradation have led many regions and countries in the arid and semi-arid areas of the HoA more vulnerable. However, it must be recognised that this vulnerability to a large extent relates to policies, institutions and unequal access to knowledge. Thus, effective DRR needs to address also these issues at the level of policy as well as projects. It is also critical to recognise that many communities, and particularly pastoralist communities, are changing rapidly. Consequently there is a great deal of livelihood diversification and urbanization in many drought-affected areas. In order to remain relevant to 167 http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/food-security/documents/20121003-comm_en.pdf 168 http://capacity4dev.ec.europa.eu/public-fragility/document/action-plan-resilience-crisis-prone-countries 169 http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/development-policies/intervention- areas/environment/climatechangealliance_en.htm ",
        "changes in pastoralist communities, interventions must be based on an understanding of these changes rather than applying a single focus on e.g. livestock interventions. Furthermore, the linear model of \u2018pure\u2019 emergency relief followed by \u2018recovery\u2019 programming appears not to be appropriate for cases of recurrent natural disasters such as droughts in the HoA, Instead, interventions focusing on flexibility and responsiveness may be effective, by which the scale and priorities can be adjusted to reflect prevailing realities. The European Union is one of the largest humanitarian donors in the HoA. In 2011, the Commission alone allocated \u20ac181 million in humanitarian aid, assisting 6.5 million of vulnerable people threatened by famine and the effects of the drought. In 2012, the Commission gave another \u20ac162 million for humanitarian assistance, and in the first half of 2013 there have already been \u20ac86.5 million allocated. Funds are as a priority channelled into providing food assistance, nutrition, clean water, sanitation and shelter to the affected populations. So far, DG ECHO has invested \u20ac90 million in such projects, distributed 170 as follows: \uf0b7 Financial decision: ECHO/-HF/BUD/2006/01000, 18 months, 10 M EUR \uf0b7 Financial decision ECHO/-HF/BUD/2008/01000, 18 months, 30 M EUR \uf0b7 Financial decision: ECHO/-HF/BUD/2009/01000, 12 months, 10 M EUR \uf0b7 Financial decision: ECHO/-HF/BUD/2010/01000, 18 months, 20 M EUR \uf0b7 HIP 2013; Horn of Africa (Incl. the DRRAP) 18 months, 20 M EUR The DG ECHO DRR actions articulate around the following different types of projects: \uf0b7 Community based operations to pilot solutions for lessons learnt and identification of good practices, in order to feed an evidence based advocacy. These projects have been targeting at community level, issues to address gaps and shortfalls identified in the development policies of their respective countries; as well as issues linked to a cross border perspective. They are mainly implemented by NGOs, in their capacity to work with remote communities, at local level. The projects are implemented in collaboration with the local authorities. \uf0b7 Technical support and technical coordination operations, to enhance the technical quality of the solutions piloted at community level, their coherence with existing national standards in place; \uf0b7 Advocacy and awareness, for dissemination of the good practices and lessons learnt from the community based activities. Using the elements provided by the different NGOs supported by DG ECHO, the dissemination is targeting both a wider audience (ex: using the www.disasterriskreduction.net website) and specific ones (ex: the Ministry for the Development of Northern Kenya and Other Arid lands). The current funding decision has built on lessons learnt from the past 4 drought decisions, including 2 mid-term evaluations of DG ECHO's Regional Drought Decision in the Greater Horn of Africa, August 2007 171 and in March-May 2009 172 . 170 To be found on: http://ec.europa.eu/echo/funding/decisions_2013_en.htm ",
        "These two evaluations pointed out the need for DG ECHO to better take into consideration the dynamic of livelihoods systems in the HoA and the need for actions outside the pastoral livelihood system, \"especially with the 'pastoral dropouts' who have little opportunities to build up the livestock capital necessary for success\". The evaluations also emphasise the need for hand-over and exit strategy, and recommend to explicitly aim at building local communities\u2019 and institutions\u2019 capacity with a sustainability objective. In 2012 the European Union developed a new approach \u2013 Supporting Horn of Africa Resilience (SHARE) \u2013 that aims to break the vicious cycle of crises in the region. In the framework of SHARE, the Commission is investing more than \u20ac270 million in supporting recovery from the last drought in HoA through close cooperation between humanitarian aid and long-term development. 2.2. Central Asia and South Caucasus Central Asia and South Caucasus are regions severely afflicted by natural disasters and manmade threats. Numerous small-scale disasters, such as earthquakes, landslides, floods, droughts and extreme temperature occur frequently in the regions and impact significantly on the daily lives of population, who are already struggling with a difficult economic situation. Meteorological hazards are expected to increase with climate change, and there is substantial evidence that this has already occurred. Furthermore, South Caucasus is one of the most seismically active regions of the world. As regards Central Asia , political, economic and social transition severely affected the population\u2019s development. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, poverty and unemployment increased, overall output decreased and social and education expenditures were sharply cut. In view of the permanent threat to the region posed by natural disasters and the existing vulnerability of the population due to the fragile economy and high levels of poverty, DG ECHO started a DIPECHO programme in 2003. Since then six cycles of DIPECHO funding have been completed. From 2003-2011 ECHO has allocated a total of EUR 28.3 million for these projects in Central Asia. An evaluation of the first three Action Plans in Central Asia took place in June \u2013 July 2006 173 , concluding that the DIPECHO programmes were effective in reducing the impact of hazards, ensuring preparedness to respond, and establishing and continuing support of early warning/intervention systems. An evaluation of the fifth and sixth Action Plans in Central Asia took place in March \u2013 June 2009 174 , and confirmed again the effectiveness of DIPECHO efforts. For DIPECHO VI, partners commissioned their own respective external evaluations. As regards South Caucasus , following two field assessment missions in 2009 in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, DG ECHO launched a Disaster Risk Reduction/DIPECHO Action Plan in the region. The duration of the 1 st circle of DIPECHO funding was 2010-2011, with a budget of EUR 2 million. 171 http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/evaluation/2007/gha.pdf 172 http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/evaluation/2009/GHA_2009.pdf 173 http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/evaluation/2006/dipecho_central_asia.pdf 174 http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/evaluation/2009/DIPECHO_Central_Asia.pdf ",
        "A joint action plan , with the budget of EUR 5 million for Central Asia and EUR 3 million for South Caucasus, started in May/June 2012. This funding decision involves 11 projects implemented in all five Central Asian countries (Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan) and 5 projects in South Caucasus (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan), with a duration of between 13 to 18 months. It includes the following: \uf0b7 Training/capacity building (working with community based organisations on disaster preparedness, capacity building, training of emergency teams, simulation exercises); \uf0b7 Assistance in contingency planning (emergency shelters, water tanks); \uf0b7 Awareness-campaigns (safer schools, safer hospitals); \uf0b7 Provision of disaster preparedness equipment (search-and-rescue and primary emergency kits, scientific material); \uf0b7 Small-scale mitigation works for demonstration purposes and awareness raising (reforestation, protection walls along river banks); \uf0b7 Early warning systems (such as radio communications), technical studies and surveys (such as hazard mapping); \uf0b7 Increased integration of DRR into education. Through DIPECHO programming, DG ECHO actively supports the implementation of HFA, which was signed by all countries of South Caucasus and Central Asia, with the exception of Turkmenistan. 3. PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE EVALUATION The main purpose of this call for tender is to have an independent overall evaluation of the actions in the regions concerned for the period of 2009 \u2013 2013 , in line with Regulation (EC) 1257/96, assessing Relevance (including coherence and EU Added Value), Effectiveness, Efficiency and Sustainability. In view of defining the strategy for the future, it is particularly important to examine the relevance and coherence of the actions evaluated to the existing major policy documents, such as the 2009 EU DRR Strategy and the 2012 Communication on Resilience. Furthermore, the accumulated impacts of the actions since their launch should be evaluated for each of the three regions \u2013 using the Commission\u2019s DRR agenda and the Hyogo Framework for Action as reference points \u2013 i.e. how the interventions have contributed to increasing the capacity of communities for preparedness, response and resilience against disasters, including triggering policy change. The evaluation focuses on two levels \u2013 the general level , common for the regions covered; and the specific level of each region (and, as appropriate, country). The Final Report should provide \uf0b7 One section covering common issues and comparisons between the regions, and; \uf0b7 Separate sections presenting the individual results of the evaluations. Further guidance on the format of the Final Report is provided in Section 12. Overall, the evaluation should provide recommendations on ",
        "\uf0b7 An appropriate approach to capitalise on overall achievements in order to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the funded operations. This should be based on an exploration of the potential for sustainability of the results and effects of the actions, scaling up and replication of the achievements of projects, and a review of key lessons learned and good practices \u2013 including a comparison of experience between the different regions; \uf0b7 The scope of future strategies and options for intervention of DG ECHO in Disaster Preparedness in the regions covered by this evaluation, e.g. taking account of the 2012 Communication on Resilience; The key users of the evaluation report include inter alia ECHO staff at HQ, ECHO at the regional and field level, national and regional stakeholders, the participating implementing partners, and other humanitarian and development donors and agencies. The information requested in the evaluation questions listed in chapter 3 is the main subject of this evaluation. The findings of the evaluation must be presented in the report in the form of evidence-based, reasoned answers to each of the evaluation questions. Conclusions will be directly linked to recommendations, if applicable. 4. SPECIFIC SCOPE OF THE EVALUATION 4.1. Evaluation questions \u2013 applying to all three regions examined These questions reflect the Commission's needs in terms of information with a view to accountability and improved performance of humanitarian actions, and they will be further discussed and validated at the Desk Phase. 1. To what extent are the DG ECHO-funded DRR interventions subject of this evaluation coherent with, and/or complementary to a. Their Legal Base; b. The 2009 EU DRR Strategy and its implementation plan; c. The 2012 Resilience Communication; d. The Hyogo Framework for Action; e. Other EU policies and programmes; f. Programmes and policies at in the regions of intervention? 2. To what extent have the following cross-cutting issues been taken into account in the design and implementation of DRR strategies and activities? a. Climate change adaptation; b. Linking Relief, Rehabilitation and Development (LRRD); c. Children, the elderly, and disabled people; d. Gender, in particular women's involvement, consultation and participation in projects; e. Involvement of local and regional community networks in the implementation of projects. ",
        "3. To what extent have DG ECHO-funded DRR interventions addressed the needs of the most vulnerable communities in the areas most exposed to frequent natural hazards? Is there evidence of (continuing) demand for the ECHO-funded actions examined from intended beneficiaries? Are the specific objectives of the actions still valid? 4. Do the actions have clearly specified impact pathways (causal chain or logical framework) for each of their principal activities and outputs? What are the logical links and assumptions in those pathways, and are those still valid? In particular: what other actions (outside ECHO) need to happen for the planned impacts to be achieved? Have those actions been directly addressed in program design (for example through assessment of the assumptions and risks in reliance on policies, capacities and actions of national institutions (public and private), partnerships, or through work on the policy environment)? 5. What has shown to be the EU added value of the DRR actions examined (i.e. the added value of EU intervention, compared to leaving the initiative to other actors)? 6. Are the actions\u2019 organisational structure and choice of partnerships (still) appropriate to achieve their aims? Have appropriate incentives been built in for partners? Do the funded actions build on the comparative advantages of the ECHO partners? Do the ECHO partners compete with or substitute for activities that other development agencies could do more appropriately or efficiently? 7. To what extent have the DG ECHO-funded actions contributed to improving the resilience of the populations that face disaster risk, or is it likely to contribute in future to the improvement of resilience? 8. To what extent have the DG ECHO-funded interventions contributed to a reinforcement of DRR and mainstreaming into the national and local governments\u2019 long-term development policies and practices of the beneficiary countries, and an increased funding for DRR-related programmes (systemic impact)? Specifically, how have the interventions stimulated replication and scaling up of projects, and promoted advocacy? What could be further done (enabling factors, tools, mechanism, change in strategy, etc.) to increase the opportunities for replicating and scaling up successful projects at country/regional level, and integrate their results into DRR national policy/strategies as well as development planning/programming? 9. What are the main lessons learnt in terms of good/bad processes/mechanisms having allowed taking over/scaling-up by governments and other donors, impact on national policies, increase in national/external investment in DRR etc. What has worked or not in the DRR approach/actions and what were the major critical success factors influencing the achievement of these actions? What good practices of intervention in the field of disaster preparedness at the level of communities have been established? What coordination mechanisms and exchange of information and experience have developed among key stakeholders in the field of disaster preparedness? How can the identification and documentation of good practices be further improved? 10. Are there any apparent unintended or unexpected effects and risks of the actions (spill- overs, institutional changes in partners, both positive and negative; effects on ",
        "nutrition; effects on the environment; effects on gender relations or other social relations)? 11. To what extent have the ECHO-funded actions contributed to reinforcing sub-national response capacities, including preparation and awareness of local communities? 12. To what extent have the DG ECHO Partners and their local implementing partners the capacity to integrate the DRR's approach in their overall strategy from response to rehabilitation and development? How committed are the partners and their staff to implement the ECHO-funded actions in the regions concerned? 13. Considering that project activities of partners in many cases have been carried over from one funding cycle to the next, to what extent have the partners been revising their approaches \u2013 being innovative \u2013 to improve effectiveness and efficiency? 14. What has been the partners\u2019 experience of working in consortia as well as with a multi-country approach? 15. Is the size of the budget allocated by ECHO to the regions appropriate and proportionate to what the actions are set out to achieve? Is it sufficient for reaching a critical mass of impacts? Could the same results have been achieved with less funding? 16. To what extent the project activities and results have had (or likely to have in future) lasting effects after hand-over? In particular, the evaluator is expected to assess to what extent supported actions and strategies at local, regional and national level are sustainable in the Horn of Africa Region. 4.2. Tasks to be carried out by the evaluator \uf0b7 An analysis of all relevant documents provided by the Commission concerning DG ECHO activities in the regions covered by the evaluation. \uf0b7 An analysis of relevant existing evidence (databases, reports, statistics, etc.) provided by other actors involved in the DRR field: national authorities, other donors, partners, international agencies. \uf0b7 Interviews with Commission involved in activities in the regions. \uf0b7 Interviews, surveys and other types of data collection tools, to be defined by the contractor and validated by the Commission, in order to get relevant information from stakeholders (affected populations, national authorities, other donors, partners, international agencies). \uf0b7 Field visits to a relevant sample of case studies in the field, to be proposed by the evaluator. \uf0b7 Analysing the whole of the information collected in order to obtain evidence-based conclusions, by properly combining primary data (i.e. information collected directly by the evaluators during their work), with secondary information (programming and policy ",
        "documents, monitoring reports and data, statistical data, relevant studies and evaluations, etc.) \uf0b7 Drafting the deliverables requested in these Terms of Reference. 4.3. Other tasks under the assignment The Contractor should: \uf0b7 Reconstruct the intervention logic for the ECHO-funded actions in the three regions; \uf0b7 Assess how the results of the 2007 and 2009 evaluations on DRRAP Horn of Africa, and the 2006 and 2009 evaluations on DIPECHO Central Asia have been taken into account; \uf0b7 Provide a one-page statement about the validity of the evaluation results, i.e. to what extent it has been possible to provide reliable statements on all essential aspects of the intervention examined.

METHODOLOGY, OUTPUTS AND SCHEDULE In their offer, the bidders will describe in detail the methodological approach they propose in order to tackle the evaluation questions listed above, as well as the tasks requested. This will include a proposal for indicative judgment criteria 175 that they may consider useful for addressing each evaluation question. The judgement criteria, as well as the information sources to be used in addressing these criteria, will be discussed and validated by the Commission during the desk phase To the extent possible the methodology should promote the participation in the evaluation exercise of all actors concerned, including beneficiaries and local communities when relevant and feasible. The methodological approach will be refined with, and validated by, the Commission during the desk phase. 5.1. Deliverables Within the framework of the present evaluation, the contractors will produce the following deliverables, in accordance with the schedule defined in this chapter: 1. Inception Report 175 A judgement criterion specifies an aspect of the evaluated intervention that will allow its merits or success to be assessed. E.g., if the question is \"To what extent has DG ECHO assistance, both overall and by sector been appropriate and impacted positively the targeted population?\", a general judgement criterion might be \"Assistance goes to the people most in need of assistance\". In developing judgment criteria, the tenderers may make use of existing methodological, technical or political guidance provided by actors in the field of Humanitarian Assistance such as HAP, the Sphere Project, GHD, etc. ",
        "2. Desk Report 3. Field Reports (per each country visited) 4. Final Report 5.2. Meetings It is expected that the contractor participate in four meetings in Brussels with the evaluation Steering Group, as specified below. For these meetings minutes should be drafted by the contractor , to be agreed among the participants. 5.3. Desk phase The Desk Phase will deal with \uf0b7 the analysis of existing Commission documents as well as other donors' or partners information, \uf0b7 the contact, and possibly, meetings with Commission staff, other donors, organisations and partners, \uf0b7 the final definition of the methodology, the finalisation of the strategy and the schedule for the field mission. The Desk phase starts when the contract is signed , and it will be based both on documents provided by the Commission and retrieved by the contractors from the start of their work. The documents may be produced by the Commission or any other relevant actor (other Commission services, international agencies, other donors, partners, communities of practice\u2026). The contractor will ensure that an appropriate literature review is carried out throughout the contract. The Inception Meeting will take place in Brussels at DG ECHO headquarters with the Steering Committee, on the basis of an Inception Report and a PowerPoint presentation that will be sent to the ECHO Evaluation Sector prior to the meeting. A phone conference may be organized before the meeting to sort out any open issues that the evaluation team might perceive regarding the evaluation. The Inception Report will contain the following elements: \uf0b7 finalized evaluation questions; each evaluation question will be accompanied by judgement criteria and indicators; \uf0b7 the rationale for each evaluation question; \uf0b7 a description of the methodology for data collection and analysis, including the chain of reasoning for responding to the evaluation questions, and indicating limitations; \uf0b7 a concise description of the 'Enhanced Response Capacity' funding governed by the Enhanced Response Capacity (ERC)- Guidelines; \uf0b7 a detailed work plan; ",
        "The report will confirm the final timing for the evaluation, including the schedule for the field work and case studies. The Inception Report will be commented on and, if satisfactory, approved by the Commission. At the latest ten days before the start of the Field Phase, the contractors will produce a Desk Report that will include: \uf0b7 A short description of the data collection work implemented, including the meetings, reviews and interviews conducted; \uf0b7 The first elements of answers to the evaluation questions when available; \uf0b7 The initial assumptions concerning the evaluation questions, to be tested during the Field Phase, on the basis of the preliminary analysis carried out during the desk phase; \uf0b7 Progress of data gathering; a conclusion on the quality of data collected so far, and whether remedial actions will be required in the next phase to close information gaps; identification of data to be collected in the field; an outline for the field visit including a preliminary schedule and list of partners, stakeholders and projects to be visited, explaining criteria used for choosing the sample of projects; \uf0b7 Methodological tools to be used in the field phase, describing how data should be cross- checked, including any possible limitations; \uf0b7 A discussion of possible issues identified during the Desk Phase that had not been previously discussed with the Commission. The Commission will consider these issues and decide on whether they merit further consideration in the light of the evaluation. A meeting will be organized in Brussels to present the desk report and discuss it with the Steering Committee. A video conference with the field office could be envisaged. The evaluator will duly consider all comments from the Steering Committee, as a condition for approval. In case of disagreement, the evaluator will provide an argumented reply explaining why a certain comment cannot be accepted. In case of substantial disagreements, the evaluator may be called for another meeting in Brussels to further discuss the subject of disagreement. The expenses for such a meeting will be covered by the existing budget of the Specific Contract. 5.4. Field Phase Following the formal approval of the Desk Report, the evaluation team shall undertake two field visits . The details of the field missions will be discussed and agreed with the Commission during the inception meeting, and will be refined in the inception and desk reports. Additional trips may be suggested as appropriate by the tenderers as a part of the research methodology. The travel and accommodation arrangements, the organisation of meetings, and the securing of visas will remain the sole responsibility of the contractor. ",
        "If, during the Field Phase, any significant change from the agreed methodology or scheduled work plan is considered necessary, this will be explained to and agreed with DG ECHO Evaluation Sector, in consultation with the steering group. At the end of the mission the consultants should meet with the Delegation, DG ECHO\u2019s experts and DG ECHO\u2019s partners for discussion of observations arising from the evaluation. The evaluation team is required to share their findings with the NGOs/IOs concerned to allow them to comment upon. The purpose is to promote dialogue, mutual learning and ownership and to build capacity of the Commission\u2019s partners. At the end of each field trip the team leader should ensure that a Field Report is drawn up and transmitted to DG ECHO Evaluation Sector. The Field Report will describe briefly the data collection activities implemented, with special mentioning of those of a participatory nature (including in annex the list of sites and persons visited, minutes from the focus groups if organized, the minutes of the workshop and any other relevant technical documents); a brief description of the situation found; as well as any relevant items identified during the field visit, which could have an influence in the methodology or the conclusions of the evaluation. N.B.: the Field Report is not an evaluation of the intervention, and should not include overall conclusions and recommendations, nor it is a collection of project evaluations. It is an operational document to allow the evaluation managers an appropriate follow up of the work done, as well as identify any possible items to be tackled during the synthesis phase (changes in the methodology, aspects not raised during the desk phase, changes in the judgement criteria, suggested changes in the evaluation questions\u2026). A meeting will be organized in Brussels to present the Field Report and discuss it with the Steering Committee. A video conference with the field office may be organised. The evaluator will duly consider all comments from the Steering Committee, as a condition for approval. In case of disagreement, the evaluator will provide an argumented reply explaining why a certain comment cannot be accepted. In case of substantial disagreements, the evaluator may be called for another meeting in Brussels to further discuss the subject of disagreement. The expenses for such a meeting will be covered by the existing budget of the Specific Contract. As a reminder, even if the evaluation will assess individual projects, conclusions and recommendations must be drafted with a view to the overall evaluation of the Commission's intervention in the area concerned, and will be based on the overall information collected during the evaluation process. 5.5. Synthesis phase A first Draft Final Report (maximum 75 pages excluding the annexes) in accordance with the format given in point 5 of the annex of the Terms of Reference shall be submitted electronically to the DG ECHO Evaluation Sector. It should be submitted after the evaluators\u2019 return from the field according to the agreed timetable. A meeting will be organised in Brussels after the submission of the first draft final report. The evaluator will make a PowerPoint presentation to DG ECHO and key staff on the main findings, conclusions and recommendations of the evaluation. The date for the meeting will be agreed between the Steering Committee and the evaluator. ",
        "Prior to the meeting, DG ECHO may provide written comments on the first draft report to the evaluation team. On the basis of the results of the meeting on the Draft Report, and duly taking into account the comments received before and during the meeting, a Draft Final Report (maximum 75 pages excluding the annexes) will be submitted to DG ECHO Evaluation Sector not later than 10 calendar days after the meeting. The Steering Committee should mark its agreement, make comments or request further amendments within 10 calendar days. 5.6 Final report On the basis of the comments made by DG ECHO, the evaluation team shall make appropriate amendments and submit the Final Report (maximum 75 pages excluding the annexes), accompanied by an Executive Summary (maximum 8 pages), within 10 calendar days. If the evaluator reject any of the comments this must be explained and substantiated in writing. The report shall follow the structure outlined in section 11.

The evaluator may be requested to present the evaluation results to DG ECHO's staff and/or stakeholders. For a detailed layout of the final report, please see section 11 below. 5.7. Dissemination and follow-up The evaluation report is an important working tool for DG ECHO, and once finalised it will be published in the public domain on the Internet. Its use is intended for DG ECHO's operational and policy staff, other EU services, humanitarian beneficiaries, EU Member States and citizens, other donors and humanitarian actors. Following the approval of the final report, DG ECHO will proceed with the dissemination and follow-up of the results of the evaluation. 6. MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION OF THE EVALUATION The Evaluation Sector of DG ECHO is responsible for the management and the monitoring of the evaluation, in consultation with the Unit(s) responsible for the evaluation subject. The DG ECHO Evaluation Sector, and in particular the internal manager assigned to the evaluation, should therefore always be kept informed and consulted by the evaluator and copied on all correspondence with other DG ECHO staff. The DG ECHO Evaluation manager is the contact person for the evaluator and shall assist the team during their mission in tasks such as providing documents and facilitating contacts. A Steering Committee, made up of Commission staff involved in the activity evaluated, will provide general assistance to and feedback on the evaluation exercise, and discuss the conclusions and recommendations of the evaluation.

THE FINAL REPORT By commissioning an independent evaluation and/or review DG ECHO expects to obtain an objective, critical, easy to read and transparent analysis of its interventions. This analysis should contain the information needed by the Commission for management, policy-making and accountability. It should also include operational, realistic recommendations at operational and/or strategic level. Above all, the report should be a document that can function as a learning tool. Therefore, while writing it, the evaluators should always bear in mind why the report is done, for whom, and how the results will be used. To each evaluation question quoted in the report the consultant will provide an evidence-base, reasoned answer. Conclusions 176 will be provided pointing out strengths and weaknesses of the evaluated intervention, with special attention paid to the intended and unintended results. Furthermore, the report is a working tool of value to DG ECHO only as long as it is feasible and pragmatic, keeping in mind DG ECHO's mandate constraints and it clearly reflects the evaluator's independent view. DG ECHO's concern is to respect this independence. The evaluation methods should be clearly outlined in the report and their appropriateness, focus and users should be explained pointing out strengths and weaknesses of the methods. The report should briefly outline the nature (e.g. external or mixed) and composition of the team (e.g. sector expertise, local knowledge, gender balance) and its appropriateness for the evaluation. It should also briefly outline the evaluators\u2019 biases and/or constraints that might have affected the evaluation and how these have been counteracted (past experiences, background, etc.). 176 A conclusion draws on data collection and analyses undertaken, through a transparent chain of arguments.

Recommendations should be prioritised, directed at specific users and where appropriate include an indicative timeframe. All possible confidential information shall be presented in a separate annex. While finalising the report and its annexes, the evaluators will always highlight changes (using track changes) and modifications introduced as resulting from the meeting and the comments received from DG ECHO Evaluation Sector. Each report and all its annexes shall be transmitted in electronic form to DG ECHO \u2013 To the attention of DG ECHO A3/Evaluation sector, AN88 04/05, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium. The final report should be sent by email to DG ECHO Evaluation Sector (ECHO- EVAL@ec.europa.eu) in three separate documents in PDF format each containing: the executive summary, the report without its annexes (also removed from the table of contents) and the report with its annexes.
