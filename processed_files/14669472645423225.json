Both are part of a series of regional blending facilities benefitting EU partner countries in all parts of the world. Their role is to combine EU development grants with loans and other risk-sharing mechanisms from European and Regional Finance Institutions to finance infrastructure pro- jects in selected sectors such as transport, energy, social and environmen- tal sectors as well as to support private-sector growth especially via small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). LAIF and CIF can speed up the implementation of development projects, mobilise additional sources of funding and raise investment and credit ceil- ings. In this way, the two facilities can leverage large infrastructure invest- ments in key sectors which may be too big to finance on market terms or by Development Finance Institutions or beneficiary governments on their own. A number of Development Banks and International and Bilateral Finance Institutions participate in the blending facilities to create multiplier effects that are many times greater than the EU\u2019s contribution. LAIF and CIF help to underpin the EU development strategies for their respective regions. LAIF resources come from the EU\u2019s Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) while CIF is funded from the European De- velopment Fund (EDF). LAIF and CIF have provided two kinds of grant (non-reimbursable) funding for development programmes and projects: \u2022 Investment grants : LAIF and CIF contributions are used to improve the terms of Finance Institutions loans or to finance specific compo- nents of the projects. They reduce the financial burden or lower credit risk. \u2022 Technical assistance : LAIF and CIF contributions can provide tailored assistance to meet specific needs of a project. Technical assistance can be provided for project preparation as well as for project implementa- tion including capacity building. It can be used in all relevant sectors to finance project pre-feasibility or feasibility studies, address aspects related to the project-enabling environment or key aspects for the suc- cess of project implementation. LAIF and CIF grants can also take the form of risk sharing instruments. These instruments, when appropriate, use the limited available funds as efficiently as possible, especially in cases where grants may not constitute the optimal type of support. This report covers the third and fourth years of LAIF operations (2013 and 2014). For CIF, it covers the period from its launch in March 2013 until the end of 2014. ",

        "7 L A I F - C I F O P E R A T I O N A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 3 - 2 0 1 4 Foreword Neven Mimica Neven Mimica Commissioner, International Cooperation and Development The Latin American Investment Facility (LAIF) and the Caribbean Investment Facility (CIF) are essen- tial tools to meet the EU\u2019s challenge of building partnerships for change with the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Their goal is to reduce poverty and stimulate inclusive growth by blending EU grant resources with loans from EU and regional financial institutions. LAIF and CIF have proved their worth. As the 2013-2014 report amply illustrates, they mobilise millions of euro of credits and investment funding in crucial infrastructure projects, which are hard to finance on commercial terms. Inadequate or non-existent infrastructures are a major bottleneck, holding back Latin American and Caribbean countries in their quest to promote economic development and raise living standards. Although the situation varies from one country to another, the general level of infrastructure and associated services often lags behind other regions in the world. LAIF and CIF projects focus on climate change adaptation and mitigation, clean energy, water and related health and sanitation issues, and transport infrastructure. They also support the private sector, especially SMEs, to mobilise other donors and investors. These priorities are clearly reflected in pro- jects approved for funding in 2013-2014 by both LAIF and CIF. Through relatively modest EU grants, they are able to stimulate European and other development finance institutions and investors to participate jointly in major infrastructure projects. Better infrastructure fosters economic integration, removing barriers to regional trade and creating a more open cross-border environment for SME expansion. Raising the quality of infrastructure for energy, water and sanitation and adaptation to climate change is an important means of supporting sustainable development. For example, a LAIF project to help develop geothermal energy in South and Central America was launched at the COP20 UN Climate Change conference in Lima in December 2014. With the addition of three new countries in 2013 \u2013 Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru \u2013 half the countries of Latin America now benefit directly from national LAIF projects. Nine projects are regional, two of which cover Central America. In this way, LAIF has taken on a truly continental dimension. One of the four projects so far approved by CIF is a credit facility for the Caribbean Development Bank. By pooling resources, the Bank can better respond to the needs of a region with a spread of small countries at different levels of economic development. LAIF and CIF are instruments of cooperation between the countries of Latin America and the Caribbe- an and the European Union to promote national and cross-border regional integration, capacity-build- ing and the creation of a stable climate for investment. They also provide opportunities for individual countries and regional organisations to share lessons learnt from projects and to apply best practice. LAIF and CIF can generate synergies that need to be exploited at the regional level. They function together with other EU-funded development programmes in their respective regions. This report testifies to the success of LAIF and CIF to date. However, many challenges remain. The European Commission, in the period to 2020, intends to improve infrastructure in the sectors of transport, energy, access to clean water and SME development. This will raise the EU\u2019s direct impact on social and economic conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean, thereby helping to reduce the long-standing inequalities in many countries of the region. ",
        "LAIF Latin America Investment Facility LAIF is an innovative financial mechanism that combines grants and loans aiming to support governments and public institutions in Latin America to overcome some major obstacles which limit their ability to promote growth and alleviate poverty. These challenges concern the need to fund and implement key infrastructure projects, to develop cutting-edge technologies and to be more competitive in global markets. LAIF\u2019s main purpose is to mobilise additional infrastructure investments in Latin America, focusing on transport, energy, and environment (including combatting climate change), as well as supporting social programmes and private sector development, with a focus on SMEs. LAIF\u2019s total budget for the period 2010-2013 was \u20ac197.7 million. These resources were made available from the EU\u2019s Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI). The total budget of \u20ac197.7 million includes \u20ac50 million earmarked for Nicaragua and \u20ac17.3 million earmarked for specific climate change projects. A LAIF allocation of \u20ac30 million for 2014 was adopted in December 2014. LAIF sets up partnerships, pooling grant resources from the EU and using them to leverage loans from European Finance Institutions and Latin American Regional Development Banks together with contributions from partner countries and beneficiary institutions in Latin America. To this end, LAIF pursues three interconnected and mutually-reinforcing strategic objectives: \u0083 Improving interconnectivity between and within Latin American countries via better ener- gy and transport infrastructures, including energy efficiency, renewable energy systems, and sustainable transport and communications networks. \u0083 Increasing environment protection and supporting climate change adaptation and miti- gation. \u0083 Promoting equitable and sustainable socio-economic development through the improve- ment of social service infrastructure and support to SMEs. Like the other EU\u2019s blending facilities, LAIF acts as a catalyst to pool resources and improve the coordination and coherence of donor actions, thus conforming to the principles of ownership, partnership and shared responsibilities set out in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the subsequent Accra Agenda for Action. LAIF has strengthened the visibility and profile of the EU and it has demonstrated its leverage capacity as a cooperation and development partner for Latin American countries. LAIF has provoked a very positive response from partner countries, EU Member States and Finance Insti- tutions. For the period 2010-2014, 25 projects were approved, representing a total investment cost of more than \u20ac6 billion with an EU grant contribution of just over \u20ac190 million. ",

Two of the seven projects (the Urban Public Transportation Improvement Programme and the Geothermal Development Facility) have regional scope. The other five LAIF contributions target Mexico and three countries which had not benefitted from bilateral LAIF support before: Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay. The transport project in Bolivia and the electricity transmission project in Paraguay contain elements of internal and cross-border integration with neighbouring countries. The focus of LAIF on water and sanitation continued with projects in Peru and Mexico. In 2013-2014 LAIF approved seven operations for a total value of \u20ac43 million. LAIF support leveraged \u20ac2.4 billion of investments (an average leverage ratio of over 1:55). The LAIF budget of \u20ac197.7 million for the period 2010-2013 was fully committed. A LAIF allocation of \u20ac30 million for 2014 was adopted in December 2014. A LAIF regional programme for the development of geothermal energy was launched at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP20) session in Lima in December 2014. By the end of 2014, nine countries had benefited directly from bilateral LAIF projects. Others took part in regional and sub-regional projects. ",

By adding grant elements to loan funding from leading Europe- an Development Finance Institutions and Latin American Regional Development Banks, LAIF has helped to secure and mobilise funds for major infrastructure projects at national and regional level, thereby contributing to the posi- tion of the EU and its Member States as leading supporters of economic growth and social pro- gress in the region. A key factor in the success of LAIF has been the participation of the Latin American Regional Development Banks, which has boosted partnerships and cooperation be- tween them and the European Development Finance Institutions.

It complements other regional programmes such as EUROCLIMA, EUROsociAL, RALCEA and AL-INVEST. As laid down in its strategic orienta- tions, the key priorities of LAIF are to improve interconnectivity between and within the Latin American countries, in particular by establishing better energy and transport infrastructure, increasing environmental protection, combatting climate change and supporting the development of SMEs. LAIF has made considerable progress in sup- porting large-scale operations through a range of Finance Institutions, improving donor coor- dination, harmonising procedures and avoiding duplication of efforts. Its approach is in line with the EU\u2019s commitments to enhance aid delivery set in the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action. In the period 2013-2014, LAIF provided a total of \u20ac43 million of fund- ing to seven projects in sectors such as energy efficiency and clean energy, adaptation of ag- riculture and rural activities to climate change challenges, water supply and sanitation, and transport, including a major regional project to improve public transport in urban areas, and a high-altitude road improvement project in the Bolivian Andes. Geographically, projects ranged from Mexico to Paraguay. The EU\u2019s international commitment to combat climate change continued in the period 2013- 2014. Two of the seven projects receiving LAIF support in this period were reported as Rio Marker 2, which means that their contribution to the climate change mitigation and/or adaptation objectives of the Rio Convention on Climate Change represents the principal objective. The first is the Combating Climate Change in Agriculture Programme in Mexico (Mex-3CAP), which aims to achieve a better adaptation of agriculture and rural activities to climate change challenges. The second is the regional Geothermal Development Facility aiming to overcome existing barriers for the development of geothermal energy in Latin America. All the other projects approved in the period 2013-2014, except the road upgrade project in Bolivia, have climate change mitigation and/or adaptation as significant objective (Rio Marker 1). ",

Operational Overview LAIF In the period 2013-2014, the LAIF Board approved seven projects. The total LAIF contri- bution for these projects was \u20ac43 million, with a total investment cost of circa \u20ac2.4 billion. In terms of geographical allocation, two of the seven projects have a regional scope. The Urban Public Transportation Improvement Programme is a major programme to facilitate investment in upgrading, expanding and modernising pub- lic transport systems in major urban centres in Latin America. The LAIF technical assistance will complement and facilitate the implementation of the programme in Peru, Ecuador, Panama and Mexico. The Geothermal Development Facility for Latin America focuses on countries in the Ande- an region and in Central America. Of the other five projects approved, two involve cross-border components at sub-regional level. The transport project in Bolivia concerns a road upgrade in the south of the country, which will benefit local populations and local economic ac- tivities but also improve Bolivia\u2019s road links with neighbouring Chile and Argentina. The electricity transmission and distribution project in Paraguay will connect poor communities to the national network, but it will also enable the country to offer surplus \u201cgreen\u201d electricity to Brazil and Argentina. The remaining three projects are bilateral. In a first project, LAIF is supporting the Mexican gov- ernment\u2019s strategy for mitigation and adaptation to the impact of climate change in the agricultural sector, through both investment and technical as- sistance grants. A second project in Mexico targets water sector development in the period 2014- 2018. The third project targets Peru, addressing the critical situation in water-poor Lima and the need to improve the water supply, sewage, and waste water treatment in its Metropolitan area. As for the distribution of LAIF grants by sector, in the period 2013-2014 \u20ac15 million (34.9% of the total contributions approved during the period) targeted energy projects, \u20ac12 million (27.9% of the total) were allocated to water and sanitation, \u20ac11 million (25.6% of the total) to transport, and \u20ac5 million (11.6% of the total) to combatting cli- mate change. Concerning the type of support provided by LAIF in the period 2013-2014, \u20ac19 million took the form of technical assistance (44.2%), while \u20ac24 million consisted of investment grants (55.8%). Three projects received exclusively technical assistance support, two projects solely investment grant sup- port and two projects received contributions for both technical assistance and investment grants. Almost all operations involved both European Fi- nancial Institutions and Latin American Regional Development Banks. The financial leverage of the LAIF contributions in the period 2013-2014 was particularly high, with \u20ac43 million leverag- ing investments of circa \u20ac2.4 billion. This implies that one euro provided by LAIF leveraged around \u20ac55 of investment. This figure mostly reflects the large size of the overall investments in the Urban Public Transportation Improvement Programme (\u20ac649 million) and the Geothermal Development Facility (\u20ac937 million).

Virtually all generation is hydroelectric. One of the main challenges that the country is facing is the transmission of electricity from the generation plants to the areas of consumption, particularly the capital, Asunci\u00f3n, which accounts for about 57% of the total national demand. Transmission capacity is undermined by frequent systems overloads, disruptions and a high level of power losses, while demand has increased more than 8% in the past ten years. The project aims to improve the competitiveness of Paraguay\u2019s productive sector by providing reliable and adequate power, strengthen supply and ac- cess for residential customers, particularly the poorest, and offer surplus clean electricity from renewable sources to neighbouring Argentina and Bra- zil, which rely mainly on fossil-fuel generation. The project has two main components. The first is the construction of a 300- km 500kV high-voltage transmission line linking the Yacyret\u00e1 hydropower plant and Asunci\u00f3n. The second is an energy loss-reduction programme that comprises of the roll-out of 625,000 electronic meters which will contribute to reducing power losses from the present level of 30% to 24% by 2020. Of these meters, 275,000 will be provided by the project promoter, the state- owned utility Administraci\u00f3n Nacional de Electricidad (ANDE), while LAIF will finance the acquisition of the other 350,000 meters. ANDE will provide own resources to cover the equipment and installation costs (cables, derivation boxes, installation material) and related services. The meters funded by LAIF will serve different purposes. 50,000 meters will be installed in informal settlements. Another 230,000 meters are destined for families who benefit from a cut-price social tariff for electricity. The re- In 2013-2014, seven projects were approved for a total LAIF contribution of \u20ac43 million . maining 70,000 meters are for residential clients with low energy consumption. Informal settle- ments and subsidised clients are traditionally not a priority for utilities as the connection costs are high and the benefits in terms of additional in- come are low. The 350,000 electronic meters funded by LAIF will contribute to the reduction of power losses. ANDE\u2019s own loss-reduction efforts linked to the installation of its 275,000 meters will centre on commercial, industrial, other private and public sector clients as well as mainstream residential consumers. The installation of the new high-voltage line and the provision of new meters will enable ANDE to manage its network more efficiently for its benefit and for the benefit of its customers. Removing bottlenecks between Yacyret\u00e1 and Asunci\u00f3n will enable Paraguay to offer more of its surplus \u201cgreen\u201d electricity to Argentina and Brazil. At the same time, by providing meters and con- nections to informal settlements, social-tariff and low-income residential customers, the promoter will provide affordable and reliable electricity to 350,000 domestic clients. The broader context The project is linked to both the Govern- ment\u2019s Economic and Social Strategic Plan 2008-2013 and the strategic plan of ANDE. It is consistent with the priorities set in the plan for public policies, especially its ener- gy-efficiency component. It is also in line with LAIF\u2019s objective to mobilise additional financing to support investment in Latin America, especially for improving energy and transport infrastructure, both domes- tic and cross-border.

This increased de- mand has been met largely by fossil fuel plants and, to a lesser extent, by hydro-power which is becoming more difficult to exploit for a variety of rea- sons, including climate uncertainty. In this situation, governments across the region are keen to develop geothermal energy as a clean, inexpensive and abundant local source of electricity. The Central American and Andean countries, located on the so-called Pacific \u201cRing of fire\u201d, are well positioned to exploit underground geothermal resources. While some geothermal de- velopment is present in Central America, there are so far no commercial geothermal projects in the Andean region. The Geothermal Development Facility represents the first coordinated mul- ti-donor scheme to support geothermal energy on a regional scale in Latin America. Its aim is to provide a means of overcoming existing barriers to the commercial extraction of geothermal energy in the form of technical assistance and access to funding. The programme is expected to facilitate the creation of at minimum seven geothermal plants with a cumulative generation capacity of at least 350MW, and a total investment volume in excess of \u20ac1 billion. The specific objectives of the programme are: \u0083 To support project preparation through the provision of grants for sur- face studies and other relevant technical studies prior to exploration through the Geothermal Risk Mitigation Fund; \u0083 To support exploratory drillings in at least seven locations through the provision of a contingency grant from the Geothermal Risk Mitigation Fund; \u0083 To provide subsequent financing for the production, drilling and con- struction stages in plant infrastructure through tailored Geothermal Investment Financing Windows for up to seven plants with an average plant size of 50MW; \u0083 To establish a Technical Assistance Forum to provide a suitable venue for policy dialogue between donors and partner governments as well as to coordinate and implement existing and planned technical assistance activities of the members involved as well as partner governments. The LAIF technical assistance grant will cover part of the cost of structuring, setting up and managing the Geothermal Risk Mitigation Fund over its ten-year lifetime. The tasks will be carried out by a fund manager who will also manage the Technical Assistance Forum. Once the project management structure is in place, a LAIF investment grant of \u20ac15 million for the op- erational phase of the project is envisaged. The programme\u2019s targets are based on the expe- riences of the Geothermal Risk Mitigation Facility (GRMF) for East Africa, which is being implemented with the support from the German government and the EU\u2019s Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund (AITF), and on the current experiences of the World Bank and IDB in support of technology development in Mexico, Central America and the Andean Region. The participating countries are Bolivia, Chile, Co- lombia, Ecuador and Peru in the Andean region, and Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Hondu- ras, Mexico and Nicaragua in Central America. ",

In a basic geothermal cycle, heat is extracted through a well from a reservoir below the earth\u2019s sur- face. Once the heat has been \u201cused\u201d in order to generate electricity, the now chilled down heat transfer fluid is re-injected into the reservoir in order to replenish its heat content and be extracted again. If well managed, this clean, renewable cycle can be maintained over dec- ades. The benefits of geothermal power generation are multiple. First, it is a mature technology with very low technical risks. Second, unlike wind or solar energy which fluctuate according to weather conditions, it can provide so-called base-load capacity. This means that it can generate electricity around the clock, which is one of the reasons why geothermal energy is relatively cheap or even \u2013 as in some Central American countries \u2013 the cheapest electricity source when compared to fossil fuel-based alternatives. It also produces much lower greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 about one tenth of the CO2 produced by a gas-fired plant and about one twentieth of a coal-fired unit. Once operational, the seven plants foreseen in this programme could save the equivalent of 1.88 mil- lion tonnes of CO2 per year. A number of Latin American countries want to develop geothermal energy as a clean, inexpensive and sustainable local energy source. ",

Strengthening FIRA\u2019s capacity to provide funding for climate change mitigation and adap- tation within the primary sector will reduce the vulnerability of farmers and the rural population to climate risks as well as support Mexico\u2019s objective to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Weather-related disasters pose a threat to Mexico where 85% of the land is already classed as arid or semi-arid. The project aims to support FIRA in fulfilling its mission to contribute to sustainable development and competitiveness of Mexico\u2019s rural areas with technical and financial services to improve the quality of life of its inhabit- ants, while mainstreaming climate change mitigation and adaptation in the agricultural sector. The specific objectives of the project are to promote modern, profitable and sustainable practices in the agriculture, fishery and forestry sectors and to optimise the use of natural resources which bring benefits to end-users and which contribute to combatting climate change through green-house gas (GHG) emissions reduction, carbon sequestration and improved resilience to climate variability. The broader context It is estimated that emissions of GHGs accounts for the equivalent of 700 million tonnes of CO2 a year in the country and the government aims to reduce emissions by 50% in 2050 compared to 2000. The agriculture and land-use sector is responsi- ble for 16% of these emissions. Agricultural emissions are mainly due to deforesta- tion and unsustainable farming practices, including inefficient use of energy and water, overdependence on chemical fertilisers and soil degradation. The government\u2019s Special Programme for Climate Change (PECC) seeks to reverse these trends through a range of measures in agro-forestry, soil conserva- tion, bio-fertilisers, conversion and rotation of crops, renewable energy production and sustainable livestock management. The aim of the project is to enhance Mexico\u2019s capacity to reach its climate mitigation target and to contribute to its adaptation strategy by promoting sustainable agricultural activities and practices through FIRA. Activities concern financing pilot and scale-up investments which address sustainability and cli- mate change adaptation and mitigation issues, promoted by the private sector, as well as tech- nical assistance for sub-project support, project administration, monitoring, impact assessment and reporting. Targeted sectors include renewable energy and energy efficiency, forest plantations and sustainable exploitation of natural forests, ef- ficient management and use of water, sustainable farming practices and waste management. LAIF will provide technical assistance for insti- tutional strengthening and market development in the field of sustainability and climate change, as well as an investment grant to ensure that innovative and value-added projects are imple- mented. The aim of the LAIF investment grant is to improve the financial profile of the pro- ject and/or the project owner by reducing the risk perceived by other financial intermediaries, improving the profitability of the project and increasing the borrowing capacity of the end-user.

By promoting mobility, public transport systems will improve the competitiveness and foster the economic development of Latin America. The programme will complement and promote national initiatives. Most Latin American countries have already embarked to promote the develop- ment of enhanced public transport systems in urban agglomerations and the countries where projects are located are ready to increase the level of The broader context According to the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN\u2013Habitat), Latin America is the world\u2019s most urbanised region with an estimated 80% of the population living in urban areas. This figure is forecast to rise to 90% by 2050. Although population growth in Latin American cities has slowed, urban sprawl and road congestion remain serious concerns. There is a need to significantly expand and improve public trans- portation systems across Latin America with an emphasis on a multimodal approach, and the integration of public transport and traffic management systems. At the same time, the challenges fac- ing the region\u2019s urban transport infrastructure require a climate- and environment-friendly response. The costs of modernising and extending mass transit infrastructures exceed by far the funding capacities for these investments and Development Finance Institutions are ready to support the necessary investments by offering financial resources and specific know-how. investments needed to improve urban transport systems through their own resources as well as through loans. However, the financial amounts needed to modernize public transport infrastruc- ture exceed considerably the available funds. The programme is a joint effort by KfW and CAF, which have already cooperated successfully on previous LAIF projects in energy, climate, water and sanitation. Credits will cover the supply and installation of signalling systems, power lines, transport vehicles and associated civil works, as well as telecommunications and access-control systems. KfW and CAF will approve and monitor each project. The grant provided by LAIF will complement and facilitate the implementation of the programme, in Peru (two projects), Panama, Mexico and Ec- uador, through feasibility and market studies as well as project monitoring and evaluation.

Its specific topography, low population density and a geographically dispersed eco- nomic base make Bolivia\u2019s transportation costs higher than in neighbouring countries. The road transport sector is critical for integrating the diverse parts of the country, unlocking large and remote areas and spurring economic develop- ment through trade, improving and enhancing access to markets and the mobility of people as well as boosting tourism. Moreover, Bolivia\u2019s land- locked situation and the fact that 95% of its non-gas trade travels by road or rail makes the transport sector a key component in its regional integra- tion. The Uyuni-Tupiza project is considered a priority by the Bolivia\u2019s national road conservation and management authority and it is part of its strategic road plan (Plan Vial). The project consists of the construction of a 188.3 km section of a single carriageway road, with one lane in each direction, between Uyuni and Tupiza in southern Bolivia. The current link is a 6m-wide winding, high-gradient and partly unpaved road in very poor condition without bridges and prone to numerous landslides. It is therefore often impassable in the rainy season. The new road will connect several communities in the Department of Potos\u00ed with the rest of the country, thus providing an important link in the national road network. It will also connect two routes in the main road network: one westward to Chile and one southward to Argentina. The project will improve access to neighbouring countries (Chile, Argentina and Paraguay), and the enhanced national and regional connectivity will increase and diversify exports and further develop the local tourism sector. This will in turn foster economic development in the area, particularly of agricultural products, and improve living conditions of local communities by incorporating them more effectively into the national economy. BOLIVIA Road F-21 tranche Uyuni-Tupiza Total cost: \u20ac118.8 million LAIF grant: \u20ac8 million Lead finance institution: EIB (up to \u20ac50 million) Co-financiers: CAF (at least \u20ac29.5 million), local contribution (about \u20ac31.3 million ) Type of LAIF support: Investment grant By connecting the Uyuni salt-flats with the Ar- gentinian and Chilean road networks, the project will also support the development of the mining/ extraction sector in southern Bolivia, including the further exploitation of the sand flats, which form the largest reserve of lithium in the world. The site is already a major touristic attraction. Once completed, the new road will decrease travel time between Uyuni and Tupiza from 8 hours to around 3 hours and 30 minutes. The LAIF investment grant will fund a number of safety features in the project, enabling it to attain higher safety and environmental stand- ards. These include metallic lateral and safety barriers, signalling systems, ground markers and additional earthworks to improve gradients and the radius of tight bends. Some funds will be re- served for measures identified as necessary by a safety audit carried out at the design and pre- launch phase of the project. The broader context The project aims to improve social and economic infrastructure, including road transport in Latin American countries, which represents a central objective of LAIF. It is part of the \u201cCorredor de Integraci\u00f3n Central Sur\u201d, whose regional dimension also seeks to connect road transport networks of land- locked countries like Bolivia to the sea. By improving access to neighbouring countries (Chile, Argentina and Paraguay), the project will have a significant cross-border and regional integration effect. The project fits into the EU\u2019s \u201cAid for Trade\u201d strategy to help developing countries to participate in cross-border trading systems and to use trade more effectively for poverty alleviation. Through aid for trade, the EU is also committed to supporting trade-based regional integration. The project contributes to this objective via its significant impact on Bolivia\u2019s regional integration both internally and internationally. ",

Rain- fall in the Metropolitan region of Lima amounts to 25 millimetres a year. More than 8 million inhabitants receive their drinking water from the river Rimac, which is fed by Andean glaciers and underground sources. At the same time, almost all parks and green areas of Lima are irrigated by val- uable drinking water or by fresh water of poor quality. While Lima\u2019s water utility, SEDAPAL, on average provides around 90% of drinking water and collects 85% of waste-water, the northern districts of the city in particular, with high percentages of rural migrants, lack sufficient water and sanitation systems. Although new national requirements for waste-water treatment are in place, SEDAPAL needs to strengthen the technical and financial capacity to treat all its waste-water appropriately. Moreover, despite the rising public awareness of the need to address water scarcity by replacing fresh and drinking water for irrigation by treated waste-water, the Metropolitan re- gion still lacks practical examples. The project aims to improve public health as well as the environment and water resource situation in the Lima Metropolitan area by extending the water and sewerage systems to the new urban settlements in the north of Lima as well as the waste-water treatment, while setting an example of efficient reutilization of treated waste-water for urban irrigation in the service area of SEDAPAL. As SEDAPAL is the biggest and most influential water utility in Peru, improvements made within Lima can generate spill-over effects to the re- maining urban utilities. The broader context While the Andes and the Peruvian rainforest receive 97% of the country\u2019s freshwater resources, only 2% flows in the direction of the coastal desert zone, home to 60% of the population, while the rest drains into the Amazon basin. The arid west of the country needs more drinking water, agricultural irrigation, mining and energy industries. The potential for user conflicts needs also to be taken into account as well as the high population growth rates (1.5% a year), the continuing migration to urban areas and the expected consequences of climate change. In addition, densely populated areas face problems of salination and water con- tamination through industrial and private waste-water. The project consists of three complementary components. First, in order to assist SEDAPAL in improving its water and sewerage coverage, water and sewage systems will be built in the poorer regions of the Lima Metropolitan area, using funding from IDB. Second, with the cred- it line provided by KfW, a major waste-water treatment plant will be constructed for urban irrigation substituting the current use of fresh river or drinking water. Third, SEDAPAL\u2019s staff will receive technical assistance in treating waste-water and improving its management capacities through the LAIF grant. The technical assistance will cover staff training, capacity-build- ing, improving control and monitoring systems, identifying integrated water resource manage- ment measures and using treated waste-water for urban irrigation. By combining their experience, KfW and IDB will be able to improve significantly the infrastruc- ture in the project areas of Lima, while setting an example of how to address climate change in Peru\u2019s coastal desert. LAIF funds will contribute to improving the project\u2019s quality, to supporting its sustainability and to strengthening SEDAPAL\u2019s planning and operational capacities beyond the project\u2019s implementation period.

The programme aims at supporting the national water sector reform agenda by implementing an innovative pilot project in the state of San Luis Potos\u00ed and promoting the dissemination of the lessons learnt in this project on a national scale. The pilot project includes an investment component supporting the improvement of the water supply and sanita- tion infrastructure as well as a technical assistance element which will elaborate innovative institutional and contractual models to improve the management of water and sanitation providers, the long-term strategic planning on municipal, State and federal level, the regulatory environ- ment in the water sector and the protection of water resources at basin level. The investment grant component will finance pilot investment in innovative technologies to accelerate large-scale introduction of this new standard in water sector infrastructure. The technical assistance component aims to enhance the quality and efficiency of the investments related to KfW and AFD loans in San Luis Potos\u00ed in terms of design (energy efficiency and water quality analysis for the wastewater treatment plant \u201cEl Morro\u201d) and environmental impact evaluation and mitigation (in particular of \u201cEl Realito\u201d and \u201cLa Maroma\u201d dams). The technical assistance will also support the implementation of organisational and institutional innovation in San Luis Potos\u00ed, suitable for replication at national level.

In 2012, the fundamental right to water and sanitation was introduced in the Constitution of the United States of Mexico paving the way for an in-depth reform in the sector. This same year, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) led a one-year high-level dialogue with the Government of Mexico, which resulted in the official delivery of a report advocating ambitious reform in the water sector. This report recommends working on governance and regulation to ensure efficient, sustainable and inclusive investment in infrastructure. The national strategic actions were presented in the National Water Programme in 2014, and in 2015 the legal framework of the sector will be modernised with the reform of the current National Water Law and adoption of a new Water and Sanitation Law. \u0083 More efficient water and sanitation infrastructure and services as well as sus- tainable water resources management in the state of San Luis Potos\u00ed; \u0083 Improved state-wide water sector govern- ance and in that way ensured sustainability of the investments; \u0083 Replication of the lessons learnt in the con- text of the national water reform agenda to achieve a large leverage effect on in- vestment financing efficiency.

The size of the LAIF support has ranged from \u20ac50 million to \u20ac1.5 million. LAIF contributions took the form of technical assistance or investment funding and sometimes a combination of both. Geographic breakdown Nine of the 25 have been regional projects, sev- en involving the whole region and two focused on Central America. The other 16 projects have concerned nine individual countries. The coun- try that has received the biggest allocation is Nicaragua with a total of \u20ac57 million for two projects, followed by Mexico with a total of \u20ac26.3 million for five projects. Other countries having benefitted from considerable allocations have been Chile, Paraguay, El Salvador and Colombia. Sector distribution Three sectors \u2013 water and sanitation, energy and environment \u2013 dominated LAIF projects in 2010- 2014 accounting for 80.6% of the contributions with a total value of \u20ac153.3 million. Contribu- tions to the six water and sanitation projects were worth \u20ac85.5 million, while LAIF support for the seven energy projects and to the four envi- ronment projects amounted to \u20ac47.8 million and \u20ac20 million respectively. Four transport projects accounted for 9.5% (\u20ac18 million) and one social sector project represented 3.7% (\u20ac7 million). Two projects for private sector support accounted for 3.6% (\u20ac6.8 million) and one multisector project constituted the remain- ing 2.6% (\u20ac5 million). While addressing climate change impact was not designated as a sector, it represented a principal or significant cross- cutting component in 23 of the 25 projects.

This represents a multipli- er effect of 33:1. In other words, the LAIF has mobilised, or leveraged, \u20ac33 for every euro of its support. Type of LAIF support LAIF grants facilitate development partners to jointly fund operations that may otherwise be financially or structurally too onerous. Technical assistance provides for functions like manage- ment, expert advice, market and operational studies that other project funders would have to pay for. Investment grants provide for equipment and supplies and therefore ease the burden on other funders, raise credit ceilings, improve bor- rowing terms and encourage other investors to participate. Of the 25 LAIF projects, 14 consisted of pure technical assistance, six were investment grants, and five received a combination of tech- nical assistance and investment grants. In terms of value, the total investment grants accounted for 61% of the allocated LAIF resources while the total technical assistance represented 39% of LAIF support. Absorption of funds By the end of 2014, contracts had been signed for 24 of the 25 approved projects. Although approved in 2012, the remaining grant for a wind-power project in Mexico was cancelled in January 2015. It is however included in the statistics contained in the present Operational Report. 1 A total amount of \u20ac 106.8 has been dis- bursed during the period 2010-2014.

The input of the Development Finance In- stitutions increases the resources to be directed towards the Caribbean beneficiary countries. Operations financed by eligible Finance Institutions pooling their loan resources with CIF support will also allow an increase in risk and credit ceilings for the benefit of the Caribbean countries and promote categories of investments which at present cannot be funded by the market or by Development Finance Institutions separately. More concretely, CIF contributes to addressing the following development challenges: \u0083 Stimulating sustainable economic growth: encouraging investment in the Car- ibbean region and attracting foreign direct investment depends largely on reliable infra- structure and the services it delivers. \u0083 Promoting competitive trade: the Carib- bean region needs an efficient transport and communications system to offer its goods to national, regional and international mar- kets. Transferring goods in the Caribbean is challenging and sometimes more costly compared to other developing regions. \u0083 Fostering regional integration: the re- gion needs to expand trade which demands commitment to integration within coherent regional trade agreements and harmonisa- tion of infrastructure policies and regulatory frameworks. Improved communication and use of e-technologies can accelerate the process. \u0083 Contributing effectively to the Millen- nium Development Goals (MDGs): The primary and overarching objective of EU de- velopment policy is the eradication of poverty in the context of sustainable development, in line with the international agenda, and with particular attention to the MDGs. CIF also includes a Climate Change Window (CCW) to support the implementation of projects supporting partner countries to tackle climate change through mitigation and/or adaptation measures. The CIF CCW follows the general rules and financing and implementation methods of CIF. The final beneficiaries of CIF are the Caribbean ACP countries which participate in the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, either directly or indirectly through their central, regional or local adminis- trations or semi-public institutions. Like LAIF and other regional financing mecha- nisms, CIF operates within the aid guidelines set by the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action. CIF supports EU policy initiatives in the Caribbean region CIF seeks to help Caribbean countries to diversify their economies. ",

The combined value of the CIF contributions was \u20ac35.05 million and the total investment cost was \u20ac101.6 million. In 2013, CIF 2012-2015 budget of \u20ac40 million was increased by a further \u20ac30.2 million, specifically earmarked for Guyana. Two CIF contributions were therefore approved for Guyana in 2013 in the form of investment grants. A \u20ac19.4 million grant concerned a power utility upgrade and a \u20ac10.7 million grant was al- located to a water and sanitation infrastructure improvement programme. The CIF grants for the other two projects took the form of technical assistance. A \u20ac2 million contribution aims to support the development of geothermal energy in Dominica and a \u20ac3 million grant targets support for a credit facility for the Caribbean Development Bank. Of the four CIF operations, the two investment grants (\u20ac30.05 million) accounted for 85.7% of the total approved projects, while the two tech- nical assistance projects (\u20ac5 million) accounted for 14.3%. By the end of 2014, grant agreements had been signed for three of the four projects. Implemen- tation is ongoing in all the three projects. 1 .

Its considerable geothermal resources could cover the electricity needs of its 75,000 inhabit- ants and part of those of the neighbouring French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique. The EU and other international donors have funded and conduct- ed feasibility and assessment studies, test drillings and economic analyses, which have confirmed the potential of Dominica\u2019s Wotten Waven geothermal reservoir to produce up to 120MW of clean and competitively-priced power. The three most recent test drillings were funded by grants from AFD, the EDF and the Fonds Franc\u0327ais pour l\u2019Environnement Mondial (FFEM). Geothermal development is the priority objective in the energy policy in Dom- inica\u2019s 2012 Strategy for Growth and Social Protection. The government aims to produce geothermal electricity by 2017, in line with the strategy goals of improving access to low-cost renewable energy, increasing foreign currency reserves, and creating a driver for growth and sustainable development. The project marks the transition from the end of the exploratory drilling phase to the production development phase which foresees the issuing by the government of concessions for the operation of firstly a small and then a large Geothermal Power Plant. This small plant would cover the needs of the island (up to 20MW), eliminating costly oil imports for fossil fuel generators. The large plant would supply, via undersea transmission lines, up to 50MW each to Guadeloupe and Martinique. The construction of the large power plant presents an estimated cost between \u20ac500 and \u20ac600 million and the government plans to set up a Pub- lic-Private Partnership (PPP) with overseas investors. The project consists of two components. The first, funded by the AFD loan, will complete the preliminary drilling phase, cover additional costs of the third exploratory well and all associated tests, and fund the drilling of the first production well together with its associated reinjection well. This will 2 .

The second, funded by the CIF grant, aims to provide technical, legal and financial assistance to the government of Dominica to support the preparation of the concession arrangements and agreements for the Wotten Waven reservoir and to supervise the initial investments. The technical assistance will provide short-term expertise to finalise draft legislation for the exploitation of geothermal energy, to draw up contractual arrangements in the best interests of Dominica, and to support the necessary adaptation of Dominica\u2019s power sector to the new situation. Longer-term technical assistance will involve a technical advisor tasked with assisting the government\u2019s project management unit on issues like negotiation of the terms of concessions, international energy PPP projects and donor relations.

The project consists of three components: \u0083 Outsourced support for GPL\u2019s senior man- agement with a view to updating skills and implementing best practices; \u0083 Preparation and delivery of a strong Cor- porate Development Programme (CDP) to enhance GPL\u2019s operational capacities and achieve a set of performance targets; \u0083 Rehabilitation of the existing distribution network and associated equipment as part of a strategic loss-reduction programme. Guyana Power utility upgrade programme Total cost: \u20ac38.75 million CIF grant: \u20ac19.375 million Lead finance institution: IDB (\u20ac19.375 million) Co-financiers: none Type of CIF support: Investment grant This project, funded by CIF and IDB on a 50:50 basis, aims to strengthen the operational efficiency and corporate management capacity of Guyana Power and Light Inc (GPL), the country\u2019s main electricity utility. For this project, the government of Guyana has transferred the amount of the CIF grant from its National Indicative Programme. GPL is a state-owned utility offering power generation, transmission and distribution to nearly 167,000 customers in the capital, Georgetown, and nearby coastal communities. This relatively small area of 500 square kilometres is home to 80% of Guyana\u2019s population. The project aims to improve the safety and reliability of GPL electricity distribution system. Quality of service is partly affected by existing conditions of the transmis- sion and distribution network. The CIF contribution will support GPL\u2019s efforts to supply electricity in an efficient and sustainable manner over the long term and avoid the recourse to debt financing under less concessional conditions for the government. IDB has a long experience in the power sector in Guyana, including in projects to reduce power losses and to extend power distribution into unserved areas of the country\u2019s hinterland. The project should result in lower levels of power losses, a reduction of fuel imports, and improved efficiency in distribution which will in turn reduce the economic and fiscal cost for Guyana.

In this context specific pro-poor selection criteria will be used to identify households that will benefit from the upgrade of pit latrines to septic tanks. Also, workshops on operating and maintaining septic tanks will be organised along with public awareness campaigns on sanitation and hygiene. \u0083 Strengthening of GWI\u2019s performance in terms of operation and maintenance. Ser- vice manuals for new equipment will be developed and 15 members of GWI staff will be trained on operation and mainte- nance and on non-revenue water reduction. The programme will finance capital investments for the improvement of the water supply system in priority areas of Guyana, which include the capital, Georgetown, and three among the most densely populated areas in the country, presently expanding. The aim is to rehabilitate part of the infrastructure of the water supply network and provide improved sanitation services, with a view to enhancing the quality of life and general welfare of local populations. The objectives of the project are in line with the EU development policy priority of achieving universal access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation to reduce poverty, improving public health and increasing work and livelihood opportunities. Guyana Water Inc (GWI), the government-owned utility tasked with providing national water and sewerage services, operates under constant challenges, such as ageing pipes and equipment, maintenance problems, high energy costs and uncertainty over aquifer yields. The programme consists of four specific components: \u0083 Increase of quality, continuity and pressure-level of the water sup- ply services in Georgetown and the three other project areas. This component will finance the construction of five storage tanks and the building, expansion or renovation of six water treatment plants. \u0083 Reduction of the level of non-revenue water lost in the programme areas, especially in Georgetown, and subsequent reduction of the energy costs for pumping operations. This component will fund an action plan to reduce non-revenue water in the programme areas, plus the rehabilitation of 64 kilometres of transmission and distribu- tion mains. A total of 16,800 water meters will be installed. The broader context Guyana faces the challenge of obtaining funding for public capital investment projects to promote growth, while maintaining borrowing at levels and costs which avoid raising the risk of debt distress. Short-to medium term growth is forecast at about 5% per year. The CIF grant for the water and sanitation sector is key to sustaining pro-poor growth and the implementation of vital infrastructure projects. As part of its poverty reduction strategy, the government is committed to improve population access to better water sources and sanitation, particularly in under-served areas. During its implementation, the programme will seek synergies and good practices from completed or ongoing projects in the Caribbean and Latin America, including EU projects \u201cLatin American network of knowledge centres in the water sector\u201d and \u201cPromoting investments in climate change adaptation and integrated water resources management for the water and sanitation sector in Latin America in the framework of the Spanish Cooperation Fund for Water and Sanitation\u201d.

The CIF technical assistance will reinforce na- tional implementation agencies for the seeding, preparation and follow-up of new projects. The grant will be open to any CDB member countries and can be used for a series of standard activi- ties such as: \u0083 Assistance in prepare sectoral strategies; \u0083 Feasibility and/or design studies and the preparation of project documentation; \u0083 Technical assistance for project implemen- tation. Although grant funds may be used to prepare projects to be financed from other sources, the credit facility and the technical assistance as- pects will be linked whenever possible. The credit facility will be used to fund projects identified by sector strategies and feasibility studies carried out as part of the technical assistance, and the technical assistance will be used to support the implementation of projects funded by the credit facility.

It will also improve CDB\u2019s asset-to- liability ratio \u2013 and its credit rating \u2013 by providing the bank with long- term resources. The Bank has engaged in a strategy of lengthening its borrowing maturities and the credit facility is part of this process. The technical assistance provided through CIF will strengthen capac- ity-building in national ministries and implementing agencies and contribute to a new pipeline of development projects among CDB\u2019s member countries. The Caribbean region consists of small countries at different levels of eco- nomic development. Foreign direct investment and Official Development Assistance (ODA) have decreased and demographic pressures continue. A series of proactive policies are needed to enhance competitiveness and a sustainable level of public finances. These include lowering energy costs, accessing concessionary credits and strengthening the resilience of local economies to external shocks, including natural disasters. CDB has established itself as one of the main catalysts for development funding in the Caribbean region with a long experience of working with its member countries.

Developing countries are particularly vulnerable due to their lack of infrastructures and their large agriculture sectors which render them particularly depend- ent on weather conditions. These factors limit their ability to mitigate the impact of climate change and to adapt to its consequences. In December 2010, advanced countries pledged to mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries to meet the challenges posed by climate change. Since then, the fight against climate change has become a mainstream activity in the EU\u2019s devel- opment cooperation programmes and projects. EU regional blending mechanisms like LAIF and CIF, with their Climate Change Windows (CCWs), are part of this effort. CCWs establish a tracking system for climate change related operations funded by the EU and other European Finance Institutions. Moreover, they ensure the transparency of EU financing for climate change projects, also distinguishing be- tween projects for which the contribution to the mitigation and/or adaptation to climate change is a significant objective and projects for which such a contribution is the principal objective. Objectives The aim of the CCWs is not restricted to the enhanced transparency of EU financing of cli- mate-related projects from LAIF, CIF and the other regional blending facilities. CCWs intend to further mainstream the fight against climate change as an instrument of EU development policy and as well as to attract additional invest- ment financing. The tracking system is based on the contribution of each project to the climate mitigation and/or adaptation objectives of the Rio Convention on Climate Change: \u0083 Rio Marker 1: projects where the contribu- tion to the mitigation and/or adaptation to climate change represents a significant objective (40% of the LAIF/CIF contribution can be reported as climate action support); \u0083 Rio Marker 2: projects where the contribution to the mitigation and/or adaptation to climate change represents the principal objective (100% of the LAIF/ CIF contribution can be reported as climate action support). Mitigation measures include \u0083 Limiting the emission of green-house gas- es (GHGs) caused by human activity; \u0083 Improving energy efficiency and increasing energy saving; \u0083 Increasing the production and use of re- newable energy; \u0083 Protecting and/or enhancing GHG sinks and reservoirs. Adaptation measures include \u0083 Reducing human and environmental vul- nerability to the impact of climate change; \u0083 Promoting climate change adaptation technologies, including the related infra- structures; \u0083 Measures for emergency prevention and preparedness to cope with natural disas- ters.

As for all EU regional investment facilities, individual projects are pre- sented by a lead eligible Finance Institution to a technical meeting where the projects are as- sessed on their technical aspects as well as their alignment with EU and partner countries priorities. The development partners request project- specific funding through the eligible Finance Institutions in order to access EU support from LAIF or CIF. The request is analysed in a technical meeting involving European Finance Institutions and Regional Development Banks, the Commis- sion and the European External Action Service, whose task is to assess the conformity of the projects with the strategic orientations and eligibility criteria of the respective facility. In par- ticular, the added value and the amount request from LAIF or CIF to support each project are carefully assessed. The meetings are chaired by the European Commission. For LAIF they include Latin American Regional Development Banks, namely the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), CAF - Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) and the Inter-American De- velopment Bank (IDB). For CIF, they include the same stakeholders plus the Caribbean Develop- ment Bank (CDB). Mature proposals that meet the criteria are then submitted to the Board, which includes EU Mem- ber States as voting members, for analysis and formulation of an opinion. All eligible European Finance Institutions and the Regional Develop- ment Banks participate as observers. Both the LAIF and the CIF Boards met three times in 2013 and once in 2014. Strategic issues, orientations and priorities of the facility are discussed with partner countries and relevant regional organisations in specific dedicated strategic meetings. Secretariat The Secretariat of LAIF and CIF is part of the \u2018Financial Instruments\u2019 unit of the Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development. The Secretariat represents an entry and contact point for grant requests presented by the Finance Institutions and for all the stakeholders involved in blending operations. The Secretariat supports the assessment and the decision-making process as well as the organization of communication events and the general implementation of the communication strategy (websites and other communication tools), thereby contributing to the visibility of the EU. This structure ensures visibility and political leverage for the EU. The participation of the EU Member States in the individual contribution decisions enhances transparency and provides accountability on the way EU budget funds are managed to its budgetary authority (European Parliament and Council) as well as to EU supervisory bodies. The structure also facilitates coordination between the different stakeholders, especially between the European Commission and its eligible Finance Institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean. ",

Although more recent, CIF is already positioning itself to fulfil a similar function for the Caribbean region. Both LAIF and CIF help to mobilise credits from finance institutions in Europe and the region con- cerned as well as from other investment sources which are many multiples of the amount of the actual grant awarded by LAIF or CIF themselves. Thus LAIF awarded grants worth more than \u20ac190 million to 25 projects in Latin America between 2010 and 2014 which aim to leverage more than \u20ac6 billion of credits and investments by other project partners. Very often, LAIF and CIF grants facilitate categories of investments that cannot be funded by the market or by development finance institutions acting on their own. The projects co-funded by LAIF and CIF reflect a range of key infrastructure sectors and associat- ed services. These focus on energy, transport, water and sanitation, climate change adaptation and mitigation as well as support for private-sector SMEs. As for other developing regions, a better infra- structure can help drive economic growth, social cohesion, and integration within and across national frontiers. It can also foster product diversification and provide an outward-oriented environment for SME development. LAIF and CIF reflect the diversity of the regions they serve. According to UN statistics, Latin America is the most urbanised region in the world. It is also a region of deep disparities between rich and poor. In recognition of this situation, five LAIF projects in 2013-2014 focused on water and sanitation, energy supplies and urban transport systems with an emphasis on the poorer segments of urban populations such as those living in informal settlements. The water and sanitation project for Lima in Peru, improved electricity supply in Paraguay and better urban transit systems in several cities across the region reflect this priority. But rural areas were not neglected. The remaining 2013-2014 LAIF projects concerned support for a programme to combat the impact of climate change in rural agricultural areas of Mexico, and a high altitude road upgrade to open the rural south of Bolivia by connecting local communities to the rest of the country and improving access to neighbouring areas of Chile, Argentina and Paraguay. CIF is establishing a similar profile. The two infrastructure projects in Guyana \u2013 electricity distribution and water supplies and sanitation \u2013 concern the main population centres in and around the capital Georgetown. A project to harness geothermal energy on the volcanic island of Dominica to supply \u201cgreen\u201d power to neighbouring islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique is an example of intra-regional cooperation and a bold initiative to cut CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. In fact, projects seeking to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change are priority goals for LAIF and CIF whenever possible. All projects are rated according to the Rio marker system. This will continue in the future. With CIF now in full operation, the lessons learnt, best practices identified and synergies developed in other regional blending facilities, such as LAIF, can be adopted by CIF participants as well.
