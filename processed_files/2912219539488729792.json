EU Member States, in collabora\u00ad tion with the Commission and the European Parliament, have begun far\u00adreaching discussions on how to reform the European Institutions without compromising the prospects of enlarge\u00ad ment. This poses particular problems for the Council, which at present is made up of repre\u00ad sentatives from governments of each Member State. Radical changes in the way it operates may be discussed at the Intergovernmental Con\u00ad ference (IGC) 2000, during which Member States must reach conclusions on a range of important issues. The aim is to resolve these problems by the end of 2000. Qualified majority voting should remain the general rule for deci\u00ad sion\u00admaking in the Council, and the Commission proposes to limit exceptions to this rule (see below). Obligatory consultation of the Parliament should be extended. The Commission further proposes to maintain 700 the maximum number of Members of the European Parliament (Art. 189 of EC Treaty). The Parliament should pro\u00ad pose new arrangements for allocating these seats. The number of Commissioners in a 28\u00ad Member Union should be fixed at 20, with a sys\u00ad tem of rotation fixed by Treaty dealing with each Member State on equal terms either on the basis of a pre\u00adset order or a one Member per Member State system. Further measures foresee a fundamental reorganization of the Commission (see below): COM (2000) 34 Bn. Adapting tlw Institutions to make a success of enlargement \u00ad Commission opinion: Cat.: KA\u00adNF\u00ad00\u00ad 002\u00adEN\u00adC (+ES,DA.DE,GR,FR,IT.NL.PT.F1,SV). \u00b1 57 pp., \u20ac8. In a second communication, the Commission presents proposals for extending qualified\u00ad \u00bf\u20ac0* i f*W majority voting to taxation and social security. As regards taxation, the Commission proposes that EU decisions on measures to remove obstacles to trade \u00ad for example penalizing a business which carries out activities in differ\u00ad ent Member States (double taxation) \u00ad should be taken by qualified majority voting. Similarly for VAT and excise duties, decisions which sim\u00ad plify current rules \u00ad e.g. as applied to the growth of electronic commerce \u00ad should also be taken by qualified majority voting. This should further apply to tax measures making a direct contribution to environmental protec\u00ad tion and measures to combat fraud, lax evasion and tax avoidance. Furthermore, the arrange\u00ad ments for coordinating national social security for migrant workers, which have been in force since 1959, should again be modernized by means of qualified\u00admajority\u00addecisions. As numerous aspects of social policy are already adopted by qualified majority, the Commission insists that this be extended to social security matters that have repercussions on the Single Market: COM(2000) 114. Commission proposal for the reform of EU courts: COM(2000) I09fin.

The Commission invites the European public to take part in a Dialogue on Europe addressing the issues at stake. Europeans know too little about how the EU Institutions operate, but deci\u00ad sions taken there are increasingly impacting on our everyday lives. This operation accompanies the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) 2000 to help to bring Europe closer to its citizens and to counter the view held by some observers that the EU's institutional system is characterized by a democratic deficit. The Dialogue on Europe should also answer other major questions such as 'how should the EU function tomorrow in order to ensure that an enlarged Europe pro\u00ad vides Europeans with all the services they expect?' littp:/Av\\v\\v.eiiropa.eu.iiit/igc2000/ What is 'constructive abstention\"? What stands behind 'Article 308' of the EC Treaty? How does the weighting of votes lake place in the Council'? The Glossary \u00ad Institutions, Policies and Enlargement of the EU contains more than 150 definitions of essential aspects of European current affairs: Free in all the official Ell languages from all European informal ion sources (see p. 11 ), http://europa. eu.inl/comm/rcprcsenl en.htm Glossary on the Internet: bt(p://europa.eu.inl/8cadplus/leg/en/cig/g4000.htm 'Accountable, responsible, efficient, transparent' The European Commission wants to apply the best administrative practices operating world\u00ad wide. The Commission's reform, to be fully implemented by the second half of 2002, is based on four key principles: 'accountability', 'respon\u00ad sibility', 'efficiency' and 'transparency'. The Commission is accountable to the European cit\u00ad izen for its actions and will have to report to the Council and the Parliament on its activities and the efficient use of its resources. Each Commis\u00ad sion official, as an individual, has to take respon\u00ad sibility for his/her actions and the chains of approval should be as short as possible. 'Effi\u00ad ciency' means that cost\u00adeffectiveness must have a premium, whereby the Commission will have to modify its own internal procedures. A modern administration must be transparent, open to the citizens. To these general principles a number of specific actions will be added, such as 'codes of conduct' for good administrative behaviour, for relations with the Parliament and new rules to enhance public access to EU documents. The Commission also proposes a radical change in financial management and control. Comprehen\u00ad sive human resources policies should enable the Commission's employees to develop their careers through improved recruitment and pro\u00ad motion systems, training provisions, manage\u00ad ment and social infrastructures: COM(2000) to Qn.; Vol. 1: Consultative document; Vol. 2: Action Plan; http:// europa.eu.int/comm/reform/index_en.htm 'Open Europe' \u00ad just a slogan? Every EU resi\u00ad dent should have the right and possibility to access official EU documents. The only excep\u00ad tions should apply to the protection of the public interest, respect for privacy, commercial or industrial secrets, confidentiality required by third parties and the protection of the interests of EU Institutions: COM(2000) 30 fin. A 'real big bang': When presenting the new White Paper on the Commission's reform, its President Romano Prodi reaffirmed to the European Parliament that reform was aimed at providing the Commission with an administra\u00ad tion that constituted a model for the 'advanced use of information technologies, a wholly com\u00ad puterized model of administration'. 'We have been accused of being submerged in paper, we shall be a paperless Commission', announced Mr Prodi. This 'revolution' will be based around three axes: 1. Definition of key policies and their concrete implementation, through targeted and flexible use of resources. The 'activity\u00adbased management approach' will be the key instru\u00ad ment allowing for coherence between aims, actions and resources to be ensured. 2. 'Our true wealth lies in our human resources', noted Mr Prodi, admitting that he had found a demoral\u00ad ized administration lacking in motivation in Brussels, whereas, before, it had been proud of its work. 3. Financial management is no doubt the trickiest element, according to the Commis\u00ad sion's President, who specified that the aim will be to create in each Directorate\u00adGeneral, a man\u00ad agement and control system that allows for opti\u00ad mal and rigorous use of resources. This will involve going from the current system based on centralized mini controls to a new system com\u00ad Taxing air travel... ... should be more closely aligned to the envi\u00ad ronmental costs, according to the Commission. It recommends that a 1997 proposal for taxing energy products be adopted by the Council of Ministers as soon as possible, so as to allow Member States to levy taxes on commercial avi\u00ad ation fuel used on domestic flights and \u00ad subject to bilateral Air Service Agreements \u00ad on flights between Member States: COM(2000) \u03b9 io fin. billing decentralized management control with an effective system of cenital auditing.

        "EXTERNAL RELATIONS S t a b i l i ty f i r s t! In the EU candidate countries, GDP grew again in the second quarter of 1999. However, the rates of growth vary from country to country: from \u00ad 4.0% in Lithuania to +6.4% in Slovenia. Since 1993 Central European countries' (CECs) trade with the rest of the world has more than doubled. In 1997 it accounted for about 2.9% of world trade, mainly involving machinery/vehi\u00ad cles and other manufactured articles. Import and export patterns are fairly similar. Trade between the EU and the CECs has also increased significantly since 1993, at an average annual rate of about +20%. In recent years, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have focused more on trade with the West. With exports reaching 52% and 46% of GDP in 1998, they have established themselves as two of the top exporting countries in Central Europe: Eurostat's Statistics in focus: Economy and Finance, No 3/2000: Cat.: CA\u00adNJ\u00adOO\u00ad003\u00adEN\u00adC (+DE.FR): External Trade, No 1\u00ad2\u00ad3/2000: Cat.: KS\u00adNO\u00adOO\u00adOOK\u00ad2\u00ad3)\u00ad EN\u00adC (+DE.FR), \u00b1 S pp., single copy 66, annual subscription \u20ac84 (paper), \u20ac60 (PDF).

Various working groups or committees were set up in the Member States to enhance national coordination and information exchange. Also important was EU participation in the work of international organizations on projects such as the UN\u00adled action in former Yugoslavia, the UN's draft firearms protocol as well as participation in regional projects (especially in Africa). The Council Working Group on Exports of Conventional Arms (COARM) agreed that Member States would concen\u00ad trate the second and third parts of the programme ini\u00ad tially on southern Africa, but other problem regions have been included in aid given by the Member States: OJ C 15,2000.

The impact of the application of available resources is yet to be optimized. EU health research in developing coun\u00ad tries has supported many projects on the tools to combat bacterial and viral diseases together with projects on non\u00adcommunicable diseases. Research was also undertaken in the field of parasitic diseases. Despite notable successes in the fight against such diseases in recent years, e.g. Chagas' disease vector control in Latin America and Onchocerciasis control in West Africa, the general situation has deteriorated in some cases: Cat.: CG\u00ad 23\u00ad99\u00ad023\u00adEN\u00adC, 432 pp., \u20ac23.

It will contain a revision clause and a financial protocol covering a five\u00adyear period. The partnership involving 71 developing countries will be implemented by means of three interactive pillars: political dialogue, development cooperation and economic and trade cooperation. The devel\u00ad opment strategies should be guided by the central objective of reducing and, in time, eradi\u00ad cating poverty through an approach integrat\u00ad ing the political, economic, social and environmental dimension. The parties also agree on four fundamen\u00ad tal principles: the equality of the partners and own\u00ad ership, participa\u00ad tion, dialogue and mutual commitments, and respect for differences. The EU has proposed that good governance be part of the essential elements, alongside respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.

In 1997 the EU provided $6.6 bn or 12.2% of all aid disbursed by the OECD countries. Indeed, taken together EU and Member States' aid accounted for well over half (55.3%) of world aid in 1997. The changing regional position of EU aid reflects to a large degree the political bias of European aid\u00adgiving. Currently, the largest aid disbursement goes to sub\u00adSaharan Africa, fol\u00ad lowed by the Central and East European countries, the New Independent States, the Middle East and Southern Europe, Latin America, and Africa north of the Sahara. The main sources of EU aid are the EU budget, the European Development Fund and the European Investment Bank.

Crossborder complaints The Commission's Green Paper on legal aid in civil matters aims to solve the problems of crossborder complainants, following the drive to create 'an area of freedom, security and justice in the EU'. 'Legal aid' is defined as: the provision of free or low-cost legal advice or court representation by a lawyer, exemption of costs such as court fees, and/or direct financial assis tance to defray any of the costs associated with litigation.

        "EUR-OP hg 1 R V i^ INFORMATION SOCIETY/TELECOMMUNICATIONS Cyberspace jobworld The 'Internet generation' is taking over the employment market. Some 9 mio Europeans already practice teleworking, and out of the 117 mio people aged at least 25 in Europe, 81 mio are already in learning establishments. By the year 2010. half of all jobs will be in sectors which are either major producers or intensive users of information technology (IT) products and services. Employ\u00ad ment in the Information Society is becoming less stable and less safe than in the past, much depends on having the 'right' skills and a capacity to adapt. What is alarm\u00ad ing, the Commission stressed in a recent report entitled Employ\u00ad ment Strategies in the Information Society, is the fact that the rate of Internet penetration in the EU only represents one\u00adthird of that in the US. The risk of social exclu\u00ad sion is reaching an alarming level, with those earning average or lower than average incomes not using the Internet. Comparisons at international level show that, in Europe, compared to their inter\u00ad national counterparts, the next generation of workers will not have key skills. The qualification deficit already exists today, and the lack of specialists in IT could reach 1.6 mio jobs by 2002 in Western Europe. To close this gap, universities must forge a pact with industry to ensure that courses deliver the skills required. By the end of this year, social partners should set framework conditions and practi\u00ad cal arrangements l'or teleworking to become widespread. In sum. Ihe Commission recom\u00ad mends lhe following in the fields of learning, working, society and enterprise: I. Link all schools to the Internel by 2002, and ensure that all teachers possess the key Information Society skills. 2. Ensure that all workers have the opportunity to gain Information Society literacy, establish a flexi\u00ad ble framework for teleworking, and apply user\u00adfriendly standards for equipment to improve the employability of people with dis\u00ad abilities. 3. Set up citizen\u00adfriendly Internet sites with information on civil rights and public services, public Internet access points plus on\u00adsite Information Society train\u00ad ing in all communities, for exam\u00ad ple in libraries or post offices; e\u00adadministration can overcome barriers of time and distance and give citizens public information and services when and where they want them. 4. Encourage entre\u00ad preneurship through fiscal poli\u00ad cies rewarding risk taking, espe\u00ad cially regarding stock options and industry\u00adresearch collaboration, and promote the use of Informa\u00ad tion Society tools by small and medium\u00adsized enterprises (SMEs) in public programmes.

Many companies and organizations seek registrations in the World Wide Web in the US\u00ad based existing TLDs, such as .com, and in other TLDs elsewhere, such as Niue (.nu) and Tonga (.to). In such cases, it is difficult to ensure the appropriate degree of adherence to European law and policies such as competition, data protection, intellectual property rights and consumer protection: COM(2000) 153 fin., http://curopa.cu.int/ comm/information_society/policy/internet/i ndex_en.htm All interested parties are invited to address their comments to: infso\u00ad dot\u00adeu\u00adconsull@cec.eu.int, fax (32\u00ad2) 29\u00ad539 e\u00adEurope for all Every EU citizen, every home and school, every business and administration must benefit from the Informa\u00ad tion Society.

Inter\u00ad national consumer protection rules are non\u00adexistent. These are examples of the shortcomings of the 'unlimited possibilities of electronic com\u00ad merce'. Consumers@shopping, an international comparative study of real\u00adlife experiences in online shopping, identified good and bad prac\u00ad tice and recommended improvements. Regulators and retailers still have a lot of work to do; in many product areas choice is still very limited, ser\u00ad vice is not reliable at all. often there is no information about complaints procedures, or consumers do not even know the 'real world' address of a company. Many retailers are very quick to charge purchasers for goods long before they arrive, but not when it comes to returning money owed. In international transactions it is often not clear which country's legisla\u00ad tion is applicable. International guidelines governing e\u00adcommerce are recommended and the development of an internationally recognized certification or labelling scheme, which would show the consumers which shops offer high standards of consumer protection. And in case something goes wrong, there should be a third\u00adparty redress mechanism for consumer complaints: http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg24/library/surveys/surl2_en.hlml No credit from e\u00admoney institutions: The business of any electronic money institution other than a credit institution (as defined by Directive 77/780/EEC as 'an undertaking whose business is to receive deposits or other repayable funds from the public and to grant credits for its own account') will soon be supervised EU\u00adwide. All business activities other than the issuing of electronic money will be restricted to the provision of closely related financial and non\u00adfinancial services, such as the adminis\u00ad tering of e\u00admoney by the performance of operational and other ancillary functions related to the issuance, as well as to the storing of data on the electronic device on behalf of other undertakings or public institutions. The planned directive also includes provisions for redeeming e\u00admoney in coins and banknotes. The regime, on the whole, responds to the specif\u00ad ic risks associated with the issuance of e\u00admoney, ensuring that it can unfold its full potential: OJ C 26,2000 (common posilion). Unified rules for the legal recognition of electronic signatures and the accreditation of certification\u00adservice providers will act against prevalent barriers to e\u00adcommerce and strengthen confidence in the new technolo\u00ad gies. The EU calls upon the Member States to meet essential require\u00ad ments specific to electronic\u00adsignature products before 19 July 2001: OJ L 13.2000. 'Knowledge networks', or 'collaborative networks', are fast becoming the basic units for innovation and production in our new economy. Com\u00ad panies are embedded within networks, such as the supply chain, techno\u00ad logy transfer brokers, boards members and investors, which all contribute to the corporate knowledge. 'Knowledge networks' should be seen as a scheme, which would permit the way between the supplier and user of information to be shortened and help valorise external resources. However, certain barriers, such as the low degree of information and communications technology literacy among heads of industrial compa\u00ad nies, must be overcome.

        "ENVIRONMENT Emissions trading 'Emissions trading' is a potential economic instrument for climate change policy in the EU It could help reduce emissions by allocating quotas to companies for their emissions. Companies that reduce their emissions bv more than their allocated quota can sell their 'surplus' to others who are not able to maintain their limits so easily. Thus, companies selling quotas can make an extra profit when reducing emissions. The Commission's Green Paper on greenhouse gas emissions trading within the EU aims to improve our understanding of emission trading. The Commission proposes a limited EU emissions trading scheme by 2005 to enable 'learning by doing' prior to the Kyoto Protocol's emissions trading (from 2008): COM(2000) 87.

To identify these substances, a procedure called COMMPS (Combined Monitoring\u00adbased and Modelling\u00adbased Pri\u00ad ority Setting) has been elaborated in collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute for Environmental Chemistry and Ecotocicology.

The Commission White Paper on Environmental Liability explores how the 'polluter pays principle', a key element underpinning the EC Treaty, can best be applied. Avoid\u00ad ing environmental damage is cur\u00ad rently the main aim. Having explored different options for EU action, the Commission concludes that the most appropriate is a new framework directive on environ\u00ad mental liability. The White Paper is in response to a request from the European Parliament for proposals for legislation in this field. Human activity severely damages the environment, as witnessed by the recent accident of the Erika oil tanker and the incident, some years ago, near the Do\u00f1ana nature reserve in the South of Spain, to name but two. Hundreds of thou\u00ad sands of birds and other creatures have suffered and died in these environmental disasters. Liability for damage to nature is a prerequi\u00ad site for making those accountable for the negative effects of their operations on the environment. A change of attitude should resull in an increased level of prevention and precaution. On adoption of the White Paper, Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstr\u00f6m slated: 'We have now laid the foun\u00ad dations for an environmental liabil\u00ad ity regime for Europe. Legislation in this field will provide common rules to ensure that polluters will effectively be held responsible for the environmental damage they cause. This will improve protection of the health of Europeans and our natural environment'. Since the protection of health is also an important environmental objective, an EU regime should cover both 'traditional damage' (damage to persons and goods) and 'environmental damage'. So far, the Member States have established national environmental liability regimes that cover damage to per\u00ad sons and goods, and they have introduced laws to deal with liabili\u00ad ty for, and the cleaning up of, conta\u00ad minated sites. However, until now, these national regimes have not really addressed the issue of liabili\u00ad ty for damage to nature (including contamination of sites and damage to biological diversity, areas and species covered by the Natura 2000 network). This is one reason why those liable have focused their responsibility on other people's health or property, but have not yet considered their responsibility for damage to the wider environment. This has traditionally been seen as an area for which society as a whole should take responsibility, rather than the individual perpetrator who actually caused the damage. Under the new EU regime, the party liable should be the one that caused the damage. In case of envi\u00ad ronmental damage, any compensa\u00ad tion should be spent on the effective restoration of the damage.

Decision\u00ad makers are constantly faced with the dilemma of balancing the free\u00ad dom of individuals, industry and organizations with the need lo reduce lhe risk of adverse effects to the environment, human, animal or plant health and safely. Enormous advances in communications tech\u00ad nology have fostered a growing sensitivity to the emergence of new risks, before scientific research has been able to fully evaluate the problems. Currently at EU level the only explicit reference to the 'precautionary principle' is to be found in the environment title of the EC Treaty (Art. 174).Thus, the Commission seeks to: I. promote the use of the 'precautionary prin\u00ad ciple' and embed il in lhe treaties and in LU administrations; 2. establish guidelines for applying it; 3. build a common understanding of how lo assess and communicate risks when scientific data are still inadequate; 4. avoid unwarranted recourse to Ihe principle (protec\u00ad tionism): COM(2000) I fin.

Production in other sectors, such as wine and milk, remained stable. Internal demand also remained unchanged. International trade was disrupted by an internation\u00ad al financial crisis leading to a decrease in world demand for agricultural products, particularly in south\u00adeast Asia and Russia. 40% of the EU's beef and pig meat was exported to Russia so that the cut back in exports to this country had particularly adverse effects on the markets in beef and pig\u00ad meat.'Ihe fall in income in the pig sector was dramatic.

Common Fisheries Policy after 2002 The Commission's Report on the application of the EU system for fisheries and aquaculture in 1996\u00ad98 reveals that the effects of conservation measures on the state of fish stocks in EU and international waters under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) have not been satisfactory. This is particularly true for the stocks of the most prized fish such as gadoids (cod, haddock, hake, ...). During 1999\u00ad2001 the Commis\u00ad sion will continue to manage and consolidate existing tools of the CFP, introducing new initiatives, such as: a) reform of the common market organization (see below); b) negotiation of new agreements, particularly with Morocco; c) proposals for a new regulation on the collection of essential biological and economic data: d) proposals for new guidelines for fisheries agreements; c) reform of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and action in favour of strengthening fisher\u00ad men's organizations and dialogue throughout the sector: COM(2000) 15 fin. During 1998\u00ad99. the main institutions and organiza\u00ad tions in the EU 15 fishing industry have expressed their grave concerns regarding the CFP after 2002 in a series of regional meetings organized by the Com\u00ad mission. On the issue of access to the 6/12 mile zone there were virtually no demands for the establish\u00ad ment of a free access regime 'up to the beaches'. Only some demands were raised by Ireland. Portugal and the UK for strengthening the current regime in favour of coastal fishermen, for example by extend\u00ad ing the current limit up to 24 miles or by abolishing the current neighbouring rights. Fishermen from Spain. Portugal. Finland and Sweden supported the abolition of all discriminatory restrictions on access to the North Sea. There was no consensus to scrap the quotas regime, although it was widely felt during the meetings that the TACs and quotas regime had failed to restrict stock exploitation rates: COM(2000) 14 fin. The new common organization of markets in fishery products takes into account new market develop\u00ad ments and current shortcomings in existing rules. It comprises a price and trading system, common rules on competition and marketing standards. The EU Member States will have to draw up and publish a list of their commercial fishery products by 1 January 2002: OJ L 17.2000. The new fishery products prices guide for the year 2000 is published. This concerns fresh and frozen fish\u00ad eries products and tuna for processing. The price of tuna and anchovy will be slightly reduced. In 1999, the price trend was positive for white fish, demand for which increased significantly on international mar\u00ad kets.

        "REGIONAL POLICY SUPPLEMENT TO EUR-OP NEWS 2000 New opportunities for our regions Commissioner Michel Barnier on the EU's regional policy During 2000\u00ad06 the Commission will spend \u20ac195 bn on regional policy. Already since the beginning of the EC, hundreds of billions of euros have been made available to the Structural Funds to finance regional development measures. EUR\u00adOP News asked Michel Barnier, Commissioner for Regional Policy, what these investments have achieved and what their impact has been on job creation. Mr Barnier: 'Regional policy has not only helped to reduce signifi\u00ad cantly the disparities in living standards within the EU, but has also created new opportunities in many regions. Its resources are rela\u00ad tively limited, accounting for less than 0.5% of European GNP, and it has thus been essential to focus on the regions in greatest difficul\u00ad ty and on priority objectives. This makes it possible to avoid any fragmentation of Community aid. The Commission's report on the situation and the economic and social development of the regions of Europe, published in 1999, also shows that the four regions tradi\u00ad tionally most economically backward \u00ad Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal \u00ad have made considerable advances over the last 10 years thanks to European regional policy, with their GNP rising from 65% of the EU average to 76.5%. Recent studies have shown that the Structural Funds enabled annual growth to increase by 0.7%. However, these studies too often appear to underestimate the real impact of the Structural Funds, since they do not take account of the changes in behaviour which regional policy has brought about in certain Member States. In Ireland, for example, many experts point out that it is thanks to EU programmes that the need to involve new operators in the development process and to concentrate on meeting priority eco\u00ad nomic objectives is now accepted. Although action under the Struc\u00ad tural Funds is known to have had an undeniable impact on eco\u00ad nomic growth in the Union, its results in terms of creating jobs and reducing unemployment are more muted. This must remain one of the EU's major concerns, since part of European growth can be explained by increased use of the new technologies. We must also bear in mind that, in a period in which the active population in Europe is growing, it is more difficult to reduce unemployment. Despite these factors, it must be remembered that the Structural Funds have created or maintained 2.2 mio jobs.' EUR\u00adOP News: 'What measures have been taken to try to achieve a balance between investment in transport infrastructures and environmental protection?' Mr Barnier: 'Improving and modernizing transport systems is cer\u00ad tainly one of the priority objectives of European regional policy, since it is a determining factor in integrating the different regions of the EU. However, I also believe that environmental protection should be one of our major concerns. Cohesion policy in Europe is not being implemented to benefit just the present generation. European solidarity must also be aimed at future generations. The Single Act established the principle that the environment should be taken into account in and by all EU policies. Regional policy, how\u00ad ever, makes it possible to directly fund infrastructures which improve the quality\u00b7 of the air. water and waste processing. On this topic. I think it is worth pointing out that the new rules for these funds establish, for the first time, the application of the 'polluter pays' principle, under which anyone responsible for damaging the environment must bear the cost of repairing the damage. The four countries receiving cohesion funding \u00ad Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal \u00ad are also obliged to achieve a balance between the envi\u00ad ronmental projects and the transport projects which they wish to have financed by the EU. The new ISPA Pre\u00adAccession Fund for the applicant countries in Central and Eastern Europe is also aimed at drawing up a balanced spread of investment projects in the fields of transport and the environment.' EUR\u00adOP News: 'The Structural Funds support measures at regional level. Do the projects implemented in each Member State have a Community dimension'? Do they contribute to the general interests of the EU?' Mr Barnier: 'Regional policy is aimed at allowing the citizens of Europe to live in their regions according to their own development model and their own social and cultural way of life. This policy is based on a European under\u00ad standing of solidarity and economic and social development. I therefore think it contributes to the general interest. It is not of course for the Com\u00ad mission to decide on the content of the projects. These are identified and devised by those who need them according to strategic priorities decid\u00ad ed from the outset in agreement with the Com\u00ad mission. Although these priorities must be adapt\u00ad ed to local circumstances, they must also promote regional competitiveness, sustainable devel\u00ad opment and equality of opportunities. I am also convinced that the Information Society technologies are an opportunity to be seized by many regions remote from the eco\u00ad nomic hubs. In this respect, I am trying to persuade the Member States to take account of this factor in their projects. It must also be pointed out that there are Community\u00adinspired programmes aimed at improving relations between certain regions of Europe Commissioner Michel Barnier and their close geographical environment. I am thinking, in particu\u00ad lar, of Interreg, which will have a budget of \u20ac4.875 bn for the period 2000\u00ad06 and is aimed at crossborder, transnational and interregion\u00ad al cooperation. For all these programmes, the Commission has put in place proven structures for disseminating methods and practices. Finally, innovative measures (0.51 % of the Structural Funds) direct\u00ad ly administered by the Commission are aimed at promoting new development strategies.These innovation 'laboratories' allow origi\u00ad nal ideas to emerge, which, through networking and exchanging information, benefit all the regions of the EU. Tire positive experi\u00ad ence gained in the past has been integrated into the guidelines for the Objective 1 and 2 programmes for the period 2000\u00ad06.' What does Europe do for your country? Because of their economic and social differences, the regions of Europe and their inhabitants are not playing on a level field. EU regional aid is designed to develop the less\u00adfavoured regions and areas facing structural difficulties by supporting investment and job creation in a sustainable context.To face the challenges of the Single Market and of Economic and Monetary Union, the finan\u00ad cial resources of the Structural Funds have continued to rise since 1988. For the period 1989\u00ad93. they had \u20ac64 bn (at 1989 prices) available, an amount which has risen to \u20ac155 bn (at 1994 prices) for the period 1994\u00ad99. At the Berlin European Council on 24\u00ad25 March 1999. the Heads of State and Government decid\u00ad ed to allocate \u20ac260 bn to structural measures in the EU for the period 2000\u00ad06. Of this sum. \u20ac213 bn was committed to the 15 existing Member States via the Structural Funds programmes (\u20ac195 bn) and the Cohesion Fund (\u20ac18 bn) (see table below). An additional \u20ac47 bn was earmarked for the applicant countries for accession to the EU, \u20ac7 bn of which will start to be distributed as early as I January 2000 through the Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre\u00adAccession (IS/'A) (see p. 4 of this Supplement).

EUR-OP glRYtf: REGIONAL POLICY SUPPLEMENT TO EUR-OP NEWS T he Structural F u n ds Reducing economic and social disparities The main aim of the EU's structural policies is to help reduce economic and social disparities. Recent reports have shown that in general with the support from the EU Structural Funds, considerable progress has been achieved during the last 10 years in the regions that are lagging behind: in the period 1986-96, GDP per head in the 25 poorest regions increased from 50% of EU average to 59%. Regional development programmes are financed by the four Structural Funds: 1. the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), which con centrates primarily on productive investment, infrastructure and the devel opment of small businesses; 2. the European Social Fund (ESF), which con centrates on vocational training and recruitment aid; 3. the Guidance Sec tion of the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), which supports rural development measures; the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (F1FG), which assists the structural adjustment of the fisheries sector. EU Structural Funds support national and regional development pro grammes in the weakest regions and labour markets. These programmes represent the culmination of a process to which all partners concerned - the Member States, the regions, other bodies and the Commission - have contributed (see below). The new programmes under the Structural Funds will involve a greater degree of concentration (both geographic and finan cial), more devolved management structures, improved efficiency and tighter checks. Regulation (EC) No 1260/99 lays down the general provisions on the Struc tural Funds; Regulation (EC) No 1261/99 on the ERDF, Regulation (EC) No 1262/99 on the ESF: OJ L 161, 1999; http://www.inforegio.cec.eu. int/wbdoc/docoffic/ official/reglem_en.hlm The part-financing of regional development programmes by the EU requires that EU priorities are taken into account. The Commission's guidelines for the period 2000-06 seek to help national and regional authorities prepare their programming strategies for Objectives 1,2 and 3 of the Structural Funds and their links with the Cohesion Fund projects. They have grown out of both accumulated experience of regional develop ment in Europe and evolving EU policies that affect this area. Three strate gic priorities have been identified: 1. regional competitiveness, 2. social cohesion and employment, and 3. the development of urban and rural areas. These priorities should help ensure the best possible use of EU assis tance at the national and regional level. Decentralized and broad partner ships, which maximize synergies and increase the commitment of all involved, are a key factor in the success of structural programmes: htlp://inforegio.cec.eu.inl/guidance Which areas?

I of this Supplement). How does the financing work? Financing from the Structural Funds is in the form of non-reimbursable assistance, not loans. The money is channeled through development pro grammes, which are negotiated between the Commission and each Mem ber State in cooperation with their regional and local authorities con cerned. The budget allocated to each programme provides finance for practical implementation of the measures it contains. The projects are selected by the (national or regional) managing authority who prepares the programme complement which specifies the final beneficiaries, financ ing plan and communication measures. Projects which receive money are therefore not selected by the Commission, but by the national or regional authorities responsible for each programme. It is here that bodies active in the social and economic life of the area (local authorities, associations, firms,...) should apply if they wish to receive support from the Structural Funds. All projects which receive European assistance must also receive Cofinancing from national or Other sources. More information about these pro grammes will be published in Inforegio News (see details above and on the Inforegio Website (http://inforcgio.cec.eu.int/) once the programmes are approved by the Commission, For lhe ml inaurine, rates, see Structural Actions 2000-06 - Comments and Regulations. Cohesion Fund Improving environmental and transport infrastructures The Cohesion Fund should continue to assist Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal, i.e. the EU Member States with a per capita GNP less than 90% of the EU average and running a programme to meet the targets of eco nomic convergence. As in previous years, assistance will go to projects in the fields of environment and transport (within the framework of trans- European networks). Resources are to be distributed* among the four recipient countries in accordance with the following bands: Spain 61-63.5%, Greece 16-18.0%, Portugal 16-18.0%, Ireland 2-6.0%. 'This distribution is based primarily on population, per capita GNP (taking into account the increase in national prosperity during the previous period) and surface area. The maximum rate of EU support granted by the Cohesion Fund ranges between 80-85% of public or equivalent expendi ture. However, that rale may be reduced in accordance with the 'polluter-pays\" principle laid down in Article 174 of the Treaty. A verification of eligibility on the criterion of 90% of the EU's average GNP will be carried out mid-term, i.e. in 2003. Appropriations will not be suspended until the public deficit of a country has actually reached 3%: Inforegio News, No 64/99: Free in all the official EU languages (see address on p. 1 of this Sup plement); http://www.inforegio.cec.eu.inl/wbncws/ncwslel64/archiv_en.htm The application of the 'polluter pays ' principle in Cohesion Fund countries: Free (+ES,DE,GR.

The financial breakdown among the Member States is based on eligible population, employment situation and the seriousness of issues, such as social exclusion, education and training levels and the participation rale of women in the labour market. Those regions and areas eligible under Objectives 1,2 and 5b in 1994-99, which will no longer meet the criteria for eligibility under the new Objectives 1 and 2, will receive transitional support to consolidale the progress already achieved. This support will be lower in 2000 than in 1999 and will cease al the end of 2005. Strictly European Community Initiatives complement priority objectives and help provide a solution to problems which have a particular impact on the EU. Pro grammes have to be drawn up on the basis of guidelines set out by the Com mission itself. Funding for these programmes has been divided between all the Structural Funds, except the fisheries fund (FIFG). Interreg III consists of three sections: 1. crossborder cooperation, i.e. pro moting integrated regional development between bordering regions; 2. transnational cooperation, contributing to an integrated and harmonious territorial development across the EU; 3. reinforcing interregional cooper ation and improving the policies and techniques of interregional economic development. Interreg HI gives special importance to crossborder activi ties, in particular with a view to EU enlargement: http://www.inforegio. cec.eu.inl/wbdoc/docoffic/official/interreg3/index_en.htm See pp. 3, 4 of this Supplement for examples. URBAN has two major objectives: 1. to promote innovative strategies for the social and economic regeneration of small and medium-sized towns and villages, and urban areas in crisis in larger connurbations; 2. to rein force and exchange knowledge and experience on regeneration and sus tainable urban development in the EU: http://www.inforegio.cec.eu.ini/wbdoc/ docoffic/official/urban2/index_en.hlm See pp. 3,4 of this Supplement for examples.

        ":\\ EUR-OP REGIONAL POLICY SUPPLEMENT TO EUR-OP NEWS SJ E ^ A T - H ?- What does Europe do for employment? Employment has become a major area of EU policy. A more com petitive economic environment induced by the Single Market must not lead to higher numbers of EU citizens out of work. Instead the gulf in levels of development and living standards between different countries must be bridged to ensure the future of the EU. Earli er comparisons with the US and Japan revealed Europe to have proportionally a much higher amount of long-term unemploy ment, worryingly prevalent amongst young people. Around 10% (18 mio) Europeans were out of work in 1999, engendering social as well as financial difficul ties for the EU model. It is esti mated that the Structural Funds, which account for approximately one third of the EU's budget, helped already to create or main tain around 2.4 mio jobs between 1994-99. 1997 marked the begin ning of the real fight against unemployment, with the insertion of a chapter on employment at the Amsterdam Treaty Summit in June 1997, providing for the develop ment of a common European Employment Strategy and the coordination of national policies. The recent reform of the Structu ral Funds for the period 2000-06 has focused on employment mat ters. The European Social Fund (ESF) as the main source of EU financial support for human resource development, clearly has a key role to play in the success of the European Employment Strate gy. The reformulated Objective 3 supports the adaptation and the modernization of education, train ing and employment policies and systems. This Objective serves as a reference framework for all mea sures to promote human resources measures in a national territory without prejudice to the specific features of each region. It takes account of the Title on Employ ment in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the new European Employ ment Strategy. Regional and local authorities also have a role to play in implementing the Employment Guidelines. There is therefore scope for a strong regional dimension in their implementation, which may be translated into con crete measures through regional programmes under Objectives 1 and 2. The Structural Funds will supple ment Member State governments' efforts, not override them. The ESF on Ihe Internet: http://europa. eu.inl/conini/dg()5/esl7en/index.hlm Where borders cross The Interreg Programme, funded in large measure by the ERDF, deals with problems spanning several borders. Interreg II (1994-99) initiatives, the largest of all the Community Initiatives (see p. 2 of this Supplement), were distinguished by the number of people's lives they affect and the diverse national teamwork they require. Through crossborder cooperation the dif ficulties in structural development of border areas were tackled, where the institutional separation of border communities normally prevents coherent management of the ecosystems or where the actual peripheral location of crossborder regions becomes a disadvantage in relation to their respective national economic centres. Particular focus was on completion of energy networks and cooperation in the area of regional planning, in particular management of water resources. Some of the greatest challenges have been the cooperation with border regions particularly in southern Europe, which often lack experience in cooperation, and the border regions on the EU's external borders, which have to overcome the greatest obstacles dur ing the implementation of Interreg due to their peripheral location and long isolation from their neighbours. These are just some of the projects: Moving in: A joint project by Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands, Swe den, the UK and a non-Member State, Norway, has focused on developing the peripheral North Sea region where unemployment and industrial decline pose serious problems. The ERDF has provided half of the total investment (\u20ac14.473 mio). The project has intended to ensure, inter alia, a greater harmony between urban and regional systems, more efficient trans port and communication systems: http://inforegio.cec.eu.int/wbpro/prord/reg_prog/ po/prog_662.htm Metropolitanism and more: The Mediterranean region is the focus of anoth er project involving various regions in Greece, Spain, France and Italy. EU (59%) and national authority money is being invested in pilot actions, including a Euro-Mediterranean free-trade zone, maritime and multimodal transport and telecommunications systems, urban development and metro politanism; http://inforegio.cec.eu.int/wbpro/prord/reg_prog/po/prog_684.htm Spain calling Morocco: EU cofinancing (54.7%) under the ERDF and the ESF were further given to a project enhancing crossborder cooperation between Spain and Morocco and to accelerate the speed of integration of the region in the Single Market - in recognition that partners outside the EU are often needed to improve the situation within: http://inforegio. cec.eu.int/wbpro/prord/reg_prog/po/prog_529.htm Interreg II: http://inforegio.cec.eu.int/wbpro/prord/prordc/prordc6. htm; Initial evaluation reporl of Interreg II: http://www.inforegio.cec. eu.inl/wbdoc/docoffic/working/sf2000_en.htm See p. 2 of this Supplement for Interreg III (2000-06). Hope in deprived neighbourhoods URBAN programmes, supported by the ERDF with the help of the ESF, are about revitalizing cities marked by a high concentration of social, environmental and economic problems, increasingly present in urban agglomerations. The novelty approach proposed by URBAN is that it tries to break this vicious circle by revalorizing the individual through his/her habitat and not in spite of it. URBAN targets neighbourhoods in extreme deprivation. It addresses the problems of isolation, poverty and exclusion through interventions that improve the ensemble of their physical and social entourage. In the programming period 1994-99, 118 programmes were funded targeting approximately 3.2 mio people, usu ally in cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants: Charleroi: In this Belgium Fourcault quarter, a project is designed to make the surroundings more attractive to investment, for example by building a permanent conference centre. Alongside other initiatives, there are plans to contribute to sector development by constructing a Cartoon and comic Strip centre: http://www.inforegio.cec.eu.int/wbpro/prord/ reg_prog/po/prog_162.htm Greek cities: Meanwhile six URBAN schemes are afoot in Ermoupolis, Keratsini, Patras, Peristeri, Thessaloniki and Volos, which contribute to solving the problems of these troubled urban areas by concentrating on social development and job creation, for instance: http://www.\u00a1nforeg\u00a1o. cec.eu.inl/wbpro/prord/ reg_prog/po/ prog_195.htm URBAN: http://www.inforegio.cec.eu.int/urban/initiative/index.htm; Initial evaluation report of URBAN 1994-99: http://www.inforegio. cec.eu.int/wbdoc/docoffic/working/sf2000_en.htm See p. 2 of this Supplement for the new URBAN initiative (2000-06). Local partnerships for Europe To increase the impact of the Structural Funds on regional and local employment, the European Territor ial Employment Pacts were launched in 1997. 89 pilot schemes received financial assistance from the Com mission between 1997-99. They all constitute a 'bottom- up' approach, involving a broad-based partnership bringing together all local players: the public and pri vate sector, private organizations and associations, which play a role in generating employment. After pre selection by national authorities, they receive technical assistance from the EU to establish their action plans. The areas concerned vary widely. In total they have tar geted 36 mio people, almost 10% of the population of the EU. Unemployment rates in these areas range from 4% to 60%, averaging 13.7% or about 2.8 mio people. It is estimated that the Pacts have generated, or will generate, some 50 000 jobs. The financial resources devoted to them in the last programming period 1994- 99 should exceed \u20ac1.6 bn, of which \u20ac500 mio has come from the reprogramming of the Structural Funds. Here are some examples of implemented Pacts: Berlin-Neuk\u00f6lln in former West Berlin is the German capital's most densely populated district. In December 1998, unemployment there was 23.2% and as high as 30% in the northern part of the district. However, Neuk\u00f6lln is an attractive location for business with a great development potential. Particularly SMEs - sup ported by a partnership of associations promoting busi nesses and employment and a management consultan cy - are called upon to create new sustainable jobs and apprenticeships. Sangro Aventino in Italy (133 000 inhabitants) has a recently developed and fragile industrial fabric. Unem ployment rises to 35% in the centre of the area, where it affects 50% of young people due to the economic imbalance with the coastal plains and tourism centres, leading to continuous outmigration. The main priority of the Pact is to promote local development by attract ing external funding and activities. One important requirement is the creation ol' efficient subcontracting links between specialist SMEs and major companies. The aim is to create around 2 000 jobs and reduce unemployment by 15% in certain areas. Turun Seutu (Turku) in Finland with 230 000 inhabi tants faces economic restructuring problems, The level of unemployment is 17.6%, 20% of whom are long- term job seekers. Priority areas of actions comprise of tailoring individual unemployment solutions in SMEs (in the field of culture, for example), boosting employ ment and developing industry and commerce. European Territorial Employment Pacts homepage: http://www. inforegio.ccc.eu.inl/pacls/ Pacts - overview: http://www.inforegio.cec.cu.int/pucls/en/indcx.hlml The 'job challenge' competition The European Job Challenge, launched in 1997, revealed the tremendous success of regional initiatives in generating jobs and a general sense of community opti mism. Open to projects part- financed by the ERDF and the ESF, the competition identified projects that have been most suc cessful not only in creating jobs in declining industrial areas (former Objective 2 areas), but in making these jobs last. Between 1994-99, the Structural Funds spent about \u20ac16 bn on the support of declining industrial areas. The 10 projects shortlisted in the competition included funding organizations, often refused financing from the private sector, that offered advice and loans to individuals with business propos als. The jobs were created effi ciently: on the basis of cost per job created, finalists spent on average less than half the total expenditure all applicants put together. Springboards for local job creation For example, the Ouest Douze Initia tive in France, which was given \u20ac61 500 from the ERDF out of a total of \u20ac248 000 needed, has provid ed advice and financial support to business start-ups in industry or in artisanal production. It created 196 net and 224 gross jobs, amongst these a profitabe business dealing with salt-dried fish. In Italy, the Tecnopar co provided back-up and support for innovative technology projects. Part- financed by the ERDF, which con tributed \u20ac11.55 mio to the total cost of \u20ac35.89 mio, the technology park initiated nearly 1 800 jobs and helped to set up 27 companies. Meanwhile in Spain, one of the tech nology centres set up by the Basque government (Ikerlan) pointed Irizar, a bus manufacturer in crisis, the way to success. 859 jobs were created with EU contribution from the ERDF covering half of the total expenses.

However, substantial gaps between the regions still remain and require attention \u00ad in regional incomes, infrastructure and human capital endowments and the competitive\u00ad ness of enterprises. Furthermore, despite the fall in unemployment rates in the EU, the overall level of unemployment and its regional dis\u00ad parities remain at unacceptable levels. Job creation is therefore still the main structural challenge fac\u00ad ing the EU (see p. 3 of this Supplement). Several thousands of projects have been organized and financed in the framework of regional policy. This page gives you a random selection, one project for each EU Member State, to illustrate the successful work done in recent years. The EU's share of the funding was drawn from the Structural Funds, in particular from the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, but also from the European Social Fund and the Interreg and URBAN Community Initiatives. Belgium New technologies for minerals: A research centre devoted to mineral extraction processes would have to be located in a traditional mining area. The International Technologi\u00ad cal Centre for Earth and for Stone in Tournai was inaugurated in May 1999. Its staff of 15 scientists and engineers is engaged in research aiming to develop and fine\u00adtune mining processes and reduce their environmental impact: http://inforegio. cec.eu.inl/wbover/ovcrslor/story _cn.htm Denmark Vision and will: In order to revital\u00ad ize the industry and trade of North Germany: Fishing docks of Bremerhaven Jutland, a science park for the ben\u00ad efit of existing and future enterpris\u00ad es was founded with EU support. 40 working places for scientists were created and there is potential for many more. Germany Rund um den Fisch: In Germany, the EU cofinanced the revitaliza\u00ad tion of the traditional fishing docks of Bremerhaven. After the decline of deep\u00adsea fishing in the 70s, the existence of these docks was threatened. Today they are a com\u00ad petitive centre of fish and food treatment providing 8 200 jobs. Tourist attractions are also being developed. Greece The Athens underground: The con\u00ad struction of the Athens under\u00ad ground railway is a major challenge due to the nature of the terrain, but also to obstacles of historical and cultural origin. Excavation work regularly turns up invaluable archaeological remains, which need to be preserved. Nevertheless, a first railway line already crosses the city from the south to the north. The EU contributes to the exten\u00ad sion of this railway with the con\u00ad struction of two additional lines going from the north\u00adwest to the south\u00adeast, and from east to west: htlp://inforegio.cec.eu.int/wbover/overstor/ story_en.hlm Spain Take a hike: The ancient pastoral system of seasonal migration of livestock from one region to anoth\u00ad er to benefit from better grazing grounds (transhumance), which has developed its own distinctive routes over the centuries, is still going strong in some parts of the EU. One of these regions is the Spanish Rioja region, which initiated a first project building on this heritage to develop new forms of cultural tourism.

New build\u00ad ings were erected and modern sci\u00ad entific laboratories were built. The university is now the largest employer in the region and one of The Netherlands' leading universi\u00ad ties in terms of its volume of con\u00ad tract research. Austria Vienna, the G\u00fcrtel Plus: Under the URBAN Community Initiative, an urban renewal programme for the G\u00fcrtel area (the most run\u00addown area of the city where over half of Vienna's immigrants live) was car\u00ad ried out. Help was provided to small firms, and a lot was done to make the area more attractive and to promote employment.

It will part\u00adfinance projects to develop transport infrastructure and envi\u00ad ronmental protection. This will help the countries catch up with environmental standards and expand and link with the trans\u00adEuro\u00ad pean networks. Under the financial perspective for the period 2000\u00ad06, ISPA is to dispense funding totalling \u20ac1 040 mio every year (see table below).

In Ireland this proportion is six times greater and in the UK five times. There were also more elderly and retired people, large families and unemployed people in the low\u00adincome groups. The relative number of unemployed was also nearly three times higher than in the rest of the population.

The uncertain\u00ad ty of future trends in working patterns has become a major concern and a constant theme of debate in Europe. Experts are unable to give clear guidance. Jobs are at the top of all political agendas due to changing patterns in production and consumption and their neg\u00ad ative effect on employment over the last 10 years. New forms of exclusion have appeared and inequalities are growing. Different challenges need to be faced. If social cohesion is to be maintained in the EU, the changes in flexible working patterns and advances in competitive\u00ad ness must be taken into account and solutions be found to the problems facing the most disadvantaged. It means, almost certainly, adapting working practices and lifestyles. The Commission's Forward Studies Unit (EFS) analyses these trends: In French only: Cat.: CM\u00ad23\u00ad99\u00ad 685\u00adFR\u00adC, 108 pp., \u20ac14.33; http://europa.eu.int/comm/cdp/cahiers/ index_fr.htm Forward Studies Unit: http://europa.eu.int/comm/cdp/ index_en.hlm The Commission proposes a three\u00adyear test\u00adperiod to evaluate the effect of reduced VAT on job creation in certain labour\u00adintensive services in the Member Slates.

A few interesting trends from this approach were highlighted by Eurostat. For example, there is a tendency among older persons (generally women) to regard themselves as unem\u00ad ployed, even though conventionally they would be con\u00ad sidered as economically inactive. Overall in the EU, among people between the ages of 18\u00ad64 (working age). 5% are subject to continuous unemployment throughout the year; another 6% experience periods of employment, unemployment and economically inac\u00ad tive periods.

A common anti-tax-fraud policy? Member Stales have come under criticism for inef fective action in combating tax fraud, attributed to the exemption mechanism in the transitional VAT system that allows goods to circulate tax-free. Amongst the main recommendations in a Commis sion report are that Member States and the Commis sion urgently consider the adoption of a common anti-fruud policy. Member States' VAT control policy deserves a complete reappraisal, all should consider EU criteria for risk assessment systems and be more efficient in following-up and analysing detected fraud.

The dynamic nature of international financial markets has resulted in the widespread use of traditional pri mary financial instruments such as shares and bonds, and also various forms of derivative financial instru ments such as futures, options, forward contracts and swaps. The growth in the use of such instruments to manage financial risks has outstripped the develop ment of guidance for their accounting. In response the Commission proposes to amend the so-called Accounting Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC as regards their valuation rules for the annual and con solidated accounts of certain types of companies: COM(2000) 80. The Commission proposes to reclassify the interest flows under swap arrangements and forward rate agreements in the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 95) from 'interest' to 'finan cial transactions included in the financial account': COM(99) 749.

EU trade is booming EU trade with its main trading partner, the US. increased strongly between 1995-98: exports rose by 55% and imports by 45%. In 1998 the EU had a surplus of \u20ac9 bn in trade with the US compared to a small deficit of \u20ac-0.4 bn in 1995. More than half of EU trade with the US is made up of machinery and vehicles, for which exports amounted to \u20ac83 bn and imports to \u20ac81 bn in 1998. EU trade by Member State reveals a varied picture: out of a total of \u20ac160 bn of EU exports to the US in 1998. \u20ac45 bn originated in Germany and \u20ac32 bn in the UK, accounting for nearly half of the EU total. The UK is by far the greatest importer of US products, equalling 27% of total EU imports. The positive trade balance with the US is not true for all Member States: in Germany exports exceeded imports by almost \u20ac18 bn whereas the UK and The Netherlands had a trade deficit of \u20ac8 bn and \u20ac9 bn, respectively. Mem ber States also vary in the breakdown of products exported: Germany has a 35% share in exports of machinery and vehicles, whilst Italy has an extremely high share (63%) of exports in primary products (animals, veg etable oil, fat): Eurostat's Statistics in focus: External Trade, No 4/2000: Cat.: KS-NO-00-004- EN-C (+DE.FR), \u00b1 7 pp., single copy \u20ac6, annual subscription \u20ac84 (paper), \u20ac60 (PDF).

The Portuguese Presidency targets the need for an annual growth rate of at least 3% over the next decade if the EU is to become the most competitive and most dynamic region in the world. This figure is based on the need for innovation and knowledge and the ability to boost economic growth, creating more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. Strong growth serves as a good basis for fostering a culture of dynamism and entrepreneurship, a culture of strengthened social cohesion, for ensuring better coordination of macroeconomic policies, structural reforms and active employment policies, for introducing new technologies in products and services (including education, aid to the elderly, public services), connecting all schools to the Internet, playing a proactive role in the organiza tion of cyberspace and strengthening trans-European telecomm unication networks. The Portuguese Presidency has also given a perspective on the future European social model and the modern ization of its structure, including higher female employment and the employment of older people. In addition the financial markets should support innovative companies, tax policy should be better coordinated, a European invention patent should be established and Child poverty eliminated.

Building on the emerging similarity in approach to corporate governance, specifical ly to achieve a European-wide code of practice for Member Slates regarding public ownership of cor porations and limiting protection ism by national governments to for eign ownership, especially where privatization is concerned. Achievement of the European Company Statute is also a priority. 5.

Achieving environmental protection in the least-cost way. relying on market- based instruments, wherever possi ble, rather than quantitative regu lations, in a pan-European rather than national framework. 16. The fight against unemployment not only as social policy but as an eco nomic imperative. High unemploy ment and limited job creation have limited the willingness of many Europeans to actively seek employment. 17. The 'European social model' needs to be modern ized so that it can better cope with the profound economic, social and demographic changes taking place throughout the world economy. Reform can best be achieved through consensus among the social partners. 18. Social cohesion, not only is it a worthwhile political and social goal, it is also a source of efficiency and adaptability in a knowledge-based economy in creasingly dependent on personal qualities and the ability to work as a team. 19. Reform of welfare systems to limit labour supply dis incentives produced by certain wel fare mechanisms and to boost labour demand by lowering non- wage labour costs. 20.

        "ENERGY/RESEARCH Towards a European research area Even more so than the century that has just finished, the 21st century is the century of science and technol ogy. More than ever, investing in research and technological devel opment (RTD) offers the most promise for the future. In Europe, however, the situation concerning RTD is worrying and still mainly undertaken at national rather than at European level. International RTD cooperation in Europe still represents a small percentage. The average research effort in the EU currently makes up only 1.8% of GDP as against 2.8% in the US and 2.9% in Japan.The trade balance in high-tech products has thus shown a deficit of 620 bn per year in Europe over the past 10 years. Researchers account for only 2.5% in every thousand of the industrial workforce as against 6.7% in the US and 6% in Japan. The number of degree-level European students in the US is twice as high as the number of American students at that level in Europe, and 50% of Europeans studying for a doctorate in the US stay there for long peri ods, sometimes forever. And this is why the Commission wants to pave the way for a European research area. This means the creation of a frontier-free area for research where scientific resources arc used to create jobs and increase Europe's competitiveness. Special attention will be given to the net working of centres of excellence and to a European approach of developing large research infra structures. This will be combined with measures to promote spin-offs from research such as action on patents and easier access to risk capital. The problems of fragmenta tion and lack of collaboration between public and industrial research in Europe are lo be addressed through better coordina tion and by encouraging the mobil ity of researchers. Philippe Busquin, EU Commissioner for Research, sees the Commission as the coordinator and catalyst of this process, persuading the Member States to open up their national research programmes to non- nationals: COM(2(HX)) 6 fin.

EU energy consumption increased by 1.8% in 1998 after falling 0.3% in 1997. Since 1995 fluctuations in energy consumption have been mainly related to climatic conditions. The share of gas in gross inland consumption reached 21.5% in 1997 compared with only 16.5% in 1990. Since 1997, the transport sector contributed only 50% of the total increase of final energy demand, the balance arising from the ter tiary-domestic sector.

A Thermie project has proven the advantages of new methane-fuelled city vehicles. 11 vehicles and different kinds of catalysts were devel oped. Emissions (gaseous and acoustic) of CNG vehicles can be main tained at a very low level and fuel costs are lower, too. Although the manufacturing costs are higher and gas filling stations are required, methane-fuelled vehicles represent a rational use of energy in trans port.

The proportion of women members in regional and local par\u00ad liaments and assemblies in the EU -a study conducted by the Committee of the Regions -shows, unsurprisingly, that more needs to be done to remove obstacles barring the access of women to political office. The presence of women members in the political decision-making bodies is a key factor for gauging the progress of equality in European society: Cat.: GF-25-99-237-EN-C (+ES,DA.DE.GR,FR,lT,NL,PT,Fl,SV),\u00b163pp.,e7. Equality between women and men in decision-making remains a vision. The proportion of women in national governments is, on average,24.5% and 22.5% in national parliaments,states a Commission report: OOM(2000) 120 fin.

The Commission examined the experience gained in applying Directive 92/51/EEC, which broadened the general system for the mutual recogni\u00ad tion of higher education and training of at least three years' duration in Member Slates, to include other levels of education and training. Teachers and engineers are the two groups that migrate most as a result of the direc\u00ad tive, whereas a legislative vacuum has existed in other areas (the 'specialist nurse', for instance): COM(2000) 17 tin. Basic training was introduced in Aus\u00ad tria for nurses specializing in the care of children/young people and for psychiatric nurses in Directive 92/51/EEC. The English and Scottish train\u00ad ing courses for recognition of social workers for mental health and trade mark agents were laken off the list: OJ L54,2000.

Leonardo da Vinci actively supports lifelong training policies con\u00ad ducted by the Member States, and innovative transnational initiatives aim to promote knowledge, aptitudes and skills necessary for successful inte\u00ad gration into working life.

Creating a Europe of knowledge Nikolaus van der Pas: 'A higher budget for education' A 'Europe of knowledge' is being created at high speed, but there are still some shortfalls on the way to it. EUR-OP News found out more in an interview with Mr Nikolaus van der Pas. Director-General of the Commission's Education and Cul\u00ad ture Directorate-General. EUR-OP News: 'How does the EU ensure that public authorities pro\u00ad vide the most suitable fiscal, legisla\u00ad tive and social environment?' Mr van der Pas: 'Demographic change in the coming decades, together with rapid technological and economic changes, pose signifi\u00ad cant challenges to Member States' and the EU's approach to educa\u00ad tion and training. The response to these problems must focus on two issues - both of which should be seen within the overall framework of lifelong learning. On the one hand, it is a matter of ensuring bet\u00ad ter access to high-quality education and training for older workers so that they can acquire new knowl\u00ad edge, skills and competence in order to make them ready to meet the demands of today's labour mar\u00ad ket. The second issue is to ensure that young people leaving the school system have acquired not only the knowledge, skills and com\u00ad petence they need for entering the labour market, but also that they are prepared for the necessity of learning throughout their working lives. Several instruments are available to the EU Firstly, within the European Strategy for Employment, a number of guidelines for Member States' employment policy address these issues. In particular, Guideline 6 invites each Member State to set a national target for participation in lifelong learning while ensuring access for older workers. Secondly, through the EU Programmes for Education and Training (Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci) support is given to developing innovative and high- quality approaches to lifelong learning in the fields of education and vocational training. In addition, the European Social Fund and the EQUAL Initiative will encourage and support actions to address the consequences of these demographic changes, especially in relation to social exclusion' (see also our Supple\u00ad ment). EUR-OP News: 'What does Europe do to improve and stream\u00ad line the information services pro\u00ad vided by local employment offices and career centres?' Mr van der Pas: 'Information for European citizens is certainly important, not least in the field of vocational and careers guidance. As the Commission underlined in its recent draft recommendation designed to overcome obstacles to transnational mobility, consider\u00ad able efforts need to be made to inform and advise citizens about opportunities for mobility. Euro\u00ad pean structures already exist to support this, such as EURES, NARIC and others. Staff in local employment offices are a crucial link in this information chain and the continual updating of their skills is required. Here Member States have a prime responsibility.' EUR-OP News-. 'Creating a Europe of knowledge is not a luxu\u00ad ry but a necessity. Why does this EU policy not receive more than 1% of the total EU budget?' Mr van der Pas: 'Indeed it is a necessity. It is also a very ambitious challenge which the Union has set itself and which has been incorpo\u00ad rated into the Amsterdam Treaty, expressing the determination of the EU to promote the highest level of knowledge for its people through broad access to education and its permanent updating. A 'Europe of knowledge' involves several areas such as innovation, education, training and research, four fundamental pillars of the EU's internal policies. Concerning the areas under the responsibility of Mrs Reding, and in particular education and training, I am pleased to note that the budgetary authority has increased the bud\u00ad getary allocations by 30% for the second phase of the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci Programmes, while the overall level of the bud\u00ad get remains low. This increase, at a time of budgetary restraint, shows that 'Europe of knowledge' has been recognized as a clear priority.'
