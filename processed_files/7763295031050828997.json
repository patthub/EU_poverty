        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 9 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Aims of the study The European Parliament\u2019s Policy Department on Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs commissioned the Institute for Social Research (IRS) to produce this study on the \u2018The use of funds for gender equality in selected Member States\u2019. According to the indications provided by the EP services, the focus of the study is on the following issues: \uf0b7 The available evidence on how gender mainstreaming is applied in the EU funds allocations on gender equality issues; \uf0b7 EU funding for childcare under the work life balance policy; \uf0b7 Gender mainstreaming in the use of Horizon 2020 funding; \uf0b7 Gender mainstreaming in the use of the REC programme, with focus on the Gender Equality Objective and the follow-up of Daphne programmes on VAW. The selected countries are: Croatia, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the UK, and the reference period is 2014-2016. The study is based on a desk analysis of the financial data and relevant documentation (programmes, calls for proposals, funded projects) currently available on the EU 2014-2020 funding programmes of interest for the period 2014-2016. The report is structured into six chapters and a number of annexes. Following the introduction, Chapter 2 provides a brief overview of the application of gender mainstreaming in the 2014-2020 EU Multiannual Financial Framework. The following chapters focus on specific EU programmes, providing an analysis of the budget allocations for each priority and of the projects addressing gender equality among those supported so far, together with an assessment of the involvement of the six selected countries. Chapter 3 focuses on the planned use of ESI funds for childcare in the 2014-2020 Operational Programmes of the selected countries. The unavailability of the annual implementation reports before the closing of this report did not allow us to assess to what extent the planned actions were implemented so far. Chapter 4 illustrates how gender issues have been mainstreamed in the implementation of Horizon 2020; and Chapter 5 on the two REC objectives directly dealing with gender issues: the Gender Equality Objective and the Daphne objective. The concluding chapter provides some policy indications emerging from the study\u2019s main findings. Main findings Notwithstanding the commitment to gender mainstreaming, Gender Budgeting is not systematically applied in the EU general budget. A clear gender strategy, with specific objectives, targets or allocations, does not emerge from the 2014-2020 MFF and often it is not possible to derive the resources allocated to achieving gender objectives. In many programmes information from a gender perspective on financial allocations, on implementation and outcomes are lacking or are incomplete. Important tools for gender mainstreaming, such as gender indicators, Gender Impact Assessment (GIA) and Gender Budgeting (GB) are very rarely adopted in both EU and national institutions. The EU Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014-2020 includes a joint declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission that the annual budgetary procedures applied for the MFF 2014-2020 will integrate, as appropriate, gender- ",
        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 10 responsive elements, taking into account the ways in which the overall financial framework of the Union contributes to increased gender equality (and ensures gender mainstreaming). It is regrettable that the MFF does not provide a clear indication of the financial resources earmarked to gender equality measures in the funded Union programmes. The MFF midterm review ( 1 ) also does not address the implementation of gender mainstreaming, and the lack of gender-differentiated and gender-relevant data on selected actions and on beneficiaries and participants in many Union programmes makes it impossible to assess their gender effects. In addition, the frequent recourse to ad hoc instruments constituted outside the EU budget (such as the Turkey refugee grant facility, the European Development Fund, the European Fund for Strategic Investments \u2013 EFSI, etc.), makes it even more difficult to assess the application of gender mainstreaming in the EU budget. It is thus difficult to identify the funds earmarked for gender equality in both the Commission work programmes and the Multiannual Financial Framework. Due to the lack of an explicit reference to the budget allocated for gender equality measures, it is only possible to assess whether and how the EU 2014-2020 funding programmes address gender equality and provide financial means promoting gender equality and gender mainstreaming in key policy areas. According to the Commission Staff Working Document for the Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality 2016-2019 ( 2 ), the overall EU funding allocated to gender equality measures in the 2014-2020 period reaches only EUR 6.17 billion , equivalent to around 0.6 % of the overall ceiling commitment appropriations. Attention to gender mainstreaming and the provision of specific funds for gender equality measures is present mainly in programmes addressing employment and social inclusion issues or fundamental human rights (e.g. the ESF, REC, some of the funding instruments for external action, AMIF and the EaSI funds). A gender equality perspective is rarely adopted in policy fields that are not seen as immediately related to gender equality, but that may have significant gender effects such as ICT, transport, business and investment support and environmental policies. The European Structural and Investments Funds (ESIF) ESIF are the European Union\u2019s main investment policy tool supporting the EU economic, social and territorial cohesion. They account for 34 % of the overall 2014-2020 ceiling for commitment appropriations. The 2014-2020 ESIFs are also the main investment instruments for supporting the key priorities of the EU as enshrined the Europe 2020 strategy, and constitute the most important financial support available for the implementation of gender equality policy in the EU. Their importance in supporting investments and growth has greatly increased with the crisis, as the ESIFs have been compensating for decreasing national investments. The ESIFs\u2019 Common Provisions Regulations on gender mainstreaming have been strengthened in the 2014-2020 programming period. Efforts for gender mainstreaming have focused on policy statements and on procedures and tools. However, gender equality is not 1 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, Mid-term review/revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020: an EU budget focused on results , COM(2016) 603 final of 14.09.2016 http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mff/lib/COM-2016-603/COM-2016-603_en.pdf 2 European Commission, Strategic engagement for gender equality 2016-2019, DG Justice and Consumers, 2015 https://ec.europa.eu/anti- trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/strategic_engagement_for_gender_equality_en.pdfre ",
        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 11 a thematic objective on its own with dedicated resources (technical, human and financial), and requirements to explicitly integrate gender equality into the Operational Programmes\u2019 planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation phases are lacking. The promotion of gender equality is a horizontal objective, and it is directly addressed in only one of the ESF investment priorities, while the regulations of the other ESI funds do not explicitly mention gender equality objectives and thematic gender aspects. The integration of the dual gender equality approach into Operational Programmes is voluntary, depending on the decisions of Member States and regions on the investment priorities in which to concentrate the ESI funding. This makes the assessment of the financial allocations directly or indirectly committed to gender equality difficult, especially in the absence of gender-relevant monitoring data on the implemented actions. According to the 2016-2019 Commission Staff Working Document for the Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality, on the basis of the Operational Programmes agreed between Member States, Regions and the Commission, approximately EUR 5.85 billion will be spent in 2014-2020 on measures promoting gender equality, equivalent to around 1.3 % of the overall funding for the 2014-2020 ESI funds. Of these, approximately EUR 4.6 billion will be spent under the ESF (equivalent to 5.3 % of the total 2014-2020 ESF EU fund budget) and approximately EUR 1.25 billion under the ERDF (0.6 % of the total 2014-2020 EU ERDF EU fund budget). EUR 1.6 billion of ESF funding is programmed under the investment priority directly addressing gender equality (Thematic Objective 08 \u2013 Investment Priority 8iv), which has been selected by 12 Member States. ERDF funding is programmed for investment in childcare and other social infrastructures which support the work \u2013 life balance of women and men with care responsibilities as well as women\u2019s employment. In addition, under Migration \u2013 Commission Priority (2014-2020), the ERDF will also support measures to integrate migrants and asylum seekers through investments in social, health, education and housing including childcare infrastructure. As for childcare , the Cohesion Funds could provide a crucial support to long-term investments in public care services both for children and other dependents in a context of declining public resources available at the national and local level due to budget cuts and changes in policy priorities. Among the six countries considered in this study, Sweden is the most successful in balancing work and family responsibilities, thanks to its long-standing tradition of policy measures and funding. Gender mainstreaming has been the guiding principle for achieving gender equality since 1994 and is effectively internalised in all policy objectives. According to Eurostat data for 2014 ( 3 ) on achievements in relation to the Barcelona targets for childcare, only Sweden with a coverage rate of 57 % is above the Barcelona objective of at least 33 % of children under 3 years of age cared for in formal childcare. The UK, Germany and Italy with a coverage rate of 29 %, 28 % and 23 % respectively were relatively close, but presented wide differences between urban and rural areas and/or between regions. The coverage rate was much lower in Croatia (17 %), and especially so in Poland (6 %). The Barcelona target of 90 % of children between 3 and compulsory school age cared for in formal childcare was reached in Sweden (95 %) and Italy (91 %). Germany was close at 89 %, followed by the UK with 70 %. Again Croatia (40 %) and Poland (43 %) were lagging behind. Within this framework, no information is currently available on the funds allocated for childcare services, but it is only possible to assess if and how childcare needs have been addressed in the six countries\u2019 Operational Programmes. 3 Eurostat 2016, Formal childcare by age group and duration \u2013 percentage over the population of each age group, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&plugin=1&pcode=tps00185&language=en ",
        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 12 The Operational Programmes (OPs) in the six selected countries show different intervention models on the actions planned for childcare and the work \u2013 life balance , reflecting also their achievement of the Barcelona target on the coverage of children in formal childcare services ( 4 ). Given that childcare and the work \u2013 life balance is already supported by national policies and funds, Sweden concentrates its effort in implementing gender mainstreaming as a horizontal objective. All ESF projects are required to take account of gender mainstreaming concerns in their activities. To this end, two structures were appointed: the GenderCoP network, dedicated to integrating the gender dimension into the ESF programmes, and the ESF J\u00e4mt providing direct support, through training and other specific measures, to the inclusion of a gender perspective in analysis, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. In Germany early childhood education has been tackled with the use of both EU and national federal funding. The German Federal Operational Programme for the implementation of the 2014-2020 ESF includes the work \u2013 life balance among its objectives for the equality of women and men, with specific initiatives programmed within Thematic Objective 8 \u2013 Investment Priority 8iv. Specific ESF measures are meant to sensitise employers on the implementation of return-to-work management policies and to encourage companies to support work \u2013 life balance working hours and services. In addition to the ESF Federal Programme, gender equality objectives related to the balance of working and family life are also considered in ten regional OPs. In order to achieve gender mainstreaming and enable programme monitoring from a gender perspective, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs established the Agency for Gender Equality in March 2009. The Agency provides ongoing support to the ministries involved in programming and monitoring the ESF, as well as specific advisory services to the actors involved in the implementation of the ESF, with the goal of mainstreaming gender equality into the ESF programmes and projects. In Italy the role of structural funds in the provision of formal care services and in supporting the work \u2013 life balance is particularly important, due to the scarcity of affordable and good quality services for children below 3 years old and elderly care, especially in southern regions. However, even if gender equality is formally acknowledged in the Partnership Agreement and in the Operational Programmes, very few references can be found in the national Operational Programmes co-funded by the ESF and the ERDF to system actions and initiatives that might support the work \u2013 life balance. Only six Italian national Operational Programmes (five ESF and one ERDF) address these issues, although in a rather generic way, out of a total of eleven national Operational Programmes funded by the ESF and/or the ERDF. Gender equality objectives related to the balance of working and family life are instead considered in all the Regional ESF Ops and in the three Multi-funds programmes. All the regional ESF programmes include interventions to support the reconciliation between working and family life such as service vouchers and working time flexibility. In many cases the ESF programmes envisage specific linkages with the regional ERDF programme in order to support and develop the access to and the creation of care services (for example kindergarten in both companies and in cities) or the development of existing social and care services. ERDF programmes instead show very few specific references to the reconciliation of work and family life, even when addressing the development of social infrastructures. Poland and Croatia provide extensive support to childcare infrastructures (nurseries and preschools) in order to support women employment and to increase the number of children cared for in based services. Currently the main objective of Polish family policy is to address demographic ageing and to increase the fertility rate through a set of measures that spread 4 It was not possible to assess the effective implementation of the actions planned in the OPs, due to the unavailability of the annual implementation reports before the conclusion of the study.

        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 13 from financial support for families with children, to the provision of childcare services. The national programme directly aiming at the implementation of the gender equality principle (with particular emphasis on children care) is the Knowledge Education Development (POWER) Programme. In addition, all 16 Polish regional OPs support the creation of childcare facilities and indicate the number of expected new places in formal childcare among the target results. Support to childcare infrastructures (nurseries and pre-schools) is expected to create 130 000 jobs which are likely to be covered by women. Poland also allocates EUR 2.95 Billion to investments in healthcare and community care centres. In Croatia , childcare services currently do not ensure access for all families. One of the strategic national priorities is to de-institutionalise social welfare and support access to quality community-based social services by investing in social infrastructures with the support of ERDF and EAFRD (in rural areas). The ESF Operational Programme Efficient Human Resources 2014-2020 (OPEHR) includes measures broadening community-based services (childcare and care for dependant family members) and ensuring equal access to early childhood services among the actions for fighting poverty and social exclusion within Thematic Objective 9. Special attention is devoted to increasing the number of children attending preschool education with a focus on Roma children and children with disabilities. Thematic Objective 10 also includes subsidies to reduce the cost of childcare for disadvantaged children and for increasing the participation rate of Roma children in preschool education. In the UK the ESI funds are expected to support the recent national strategy for a better work \u2013 life balance, especially through ESF investments. Almost all the six UK OPs consider care needs among the barriers to sustained employment and access to formal learning, and focus their actions on disadvantage groups, including lone parents, women returners to the labour market and inactive women. Some OPs invest in actions to support more flexible working practices, and promoting innovative actions to improve the availability of affordable and quality childcare. Childcare support for participants with childcare needs is considered as a target result and as a selection criterion for funding operations. Some OPs also provide for the ERDF to complement the ESF supporting childcare facilities and the creation of inclusive work places, including the reconciliation of work and private life. The Horizon 2020 Programme The programme provides for the mainstreaming of gender equality and the gender dimension in research as a cross-cutting issue in each of the different parts of the work programme. In addition to this, the \u2018Science with and for Society\u2019 work programme funds specific initiatives in support of the gender equality strategy (GERI calls). However, the analysis of the programme implementation up to September 2016 shows that out of a total of 10 128 projects funded and reported in the Horizon database, only 71 projects address gender equality (0.7 % of the total of the funded projects), besides the GERI projects. The majority (56 %) of the projects that directly and/or indirectly refer to gender equality have been financed under the Pillar \u2018Excellent Science\u2019. Out of these projects, 60 % were financed within the priorities related to Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions which provide grants for all stages of researchers\u2019 careers. Another 33 % of gender-related projects are financed under the Pillar \u2018Societal Challenges\u2019 covering activities from research to market with a focus on innovation-related activities. Gender-related topics range from gender medicine, to gender differences in job insecurity, or to the gender balance in sectors (such as aquaculture) not usually considered as \u2018feminine\u2019. Another 7 % were funded under the Science and Society Pillar, which is instrumental in addressing the European societal challenges tackled by Horizon 2020, building capacities and developing innovative ways of connecting science to ",

These projects address gender aspects in higher education or are meant to identify innovative approaches to release and disseminate research results. During the period 2014-2015, five GERI calls with an estimated budget of around EUR 18 Million were issued . The majority of approved projects were supporting research organisations in the implementation of gender equality plans. On the involvement of the selected countries, while in the 71 Horizon projects there is a strong predominance of UK leading institutions, followed at a great distance by Italy and Germany, the GERI projects are led by German and Italian institutions. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme 2014-2020 (REC) The REC programme replaces three earlier funding programmes, which expired in 2013: the Fundamental Rights and Citizenship, the PROGRESS and the Daphne III programmes. Only 2 of the 9 objectives of the programme directly address gender equality and women: promote equality between women and men and gender mainstreaming; prevent violence against children, young people, women and other groups at risk (Daphne). Also, the non- discrimination objective presents cross cutting attention to a gender perspective, especially with reference to the integration of the Roma people and multiple discrimination. The two gender objectives (Gender Equality and Daphne combating violence against women) currently account for around 35 % of the total REC funds ( 5 ) allocated for the entire 2014- 2020 period. According to the REC website, a total of 17 grants were issued between 2014 and September 2016 and a total 165 projects were funded. Of these only 7 grants were issued for the two gender-related objectives (4 calls under Daphne, 2 under the GE objective and 1 Framework Partnership Agreement covering both objectives) ( 6 ) and 46 projects have been funded, equivalent to 27.9 % of the total number of REC-funded projects. Overall the resources earmarked in the calls for both objectives (EUR 23.5 million) are about 40.8 % of those allocated in total for these objectives in the programming cycle. During this period the resources earmarked in the calls under the Daphne objective to fight violence against women and girls were twice those used for the Gender Equality Objective (EUR 15.86 million compared to EUR 7.65 million). Under Daphne, the majority of resources have been earmarked for fighting and preventing violence linked to harmful practices (39 %) and for supporting victims of gender-based violence, domestic violence or intimate relationship, by specialised services (24 %). Under the Gender Equality Objective, the majority of resources (44 %) have been spent for promoting both equal economic independence and the reconciliation of work and family life, as well as for promoting good practices on gender roles and overcoming gender stereotypes in education, training and in the workplace. For the six selected countries, Italy is the most involved country as lead partner (9 projects) for both objectives, mobilising most of the earmarked REC resources (44 %) out of the total resources allocated to the projects led by the six countries. Sweden and the UK follow respectively with 22 % and 20 % of total resources ( 7 ). The UK is the most involved partner 5 European Commission, Strategic engagement for gender equality 2016-2019, DG Justice and Consumers, 2015, see: https://ec.europa.eu/anti- trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/strategic_engagement_for_gender_equality_en.pdfre 6 The Daphne calls considered are those directly addressing violence against women and young girls. Three calls addressing children (e.g. corporate punishment, missing children, bullying at school) were not considered. 7 The analysis considered all calls under the two objectives issued so far, excluding two calls whose evaluation procedures were not yet completed.

        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 15 country, participating in 15 projects with a total of 18 UK organisations, followed by Italy with 15 organisations involved. Croatia and Poland are the least involved countries, both as lead partner (with 1 project each) and as members of the partnership with 1 project for Poland and none for Croatia. The predominance of Italy as lead partner may be explained by the scarcity of national resources dedicated to gender equality and fighting violence against women. In the same way, the lower participation of Sweden compared to Italy may be due to the greater availability of national resources allocated to these objectives. The low involvement of Croatia may be due to its recent entry into the EU and time needed by Croatian organisations to be recognised as suitable partners in EU projects. Conclusions and policy suggestions The EU\u2019s political commitment to gender equality and gender mainstreaming is not yet internalised in the budget allocations and spending decisions of all policy areas and this is likely to reduce the effectiveness of gender equality strategies. Many budget headings do not specify the amount allocated to specific policy objectives, as they often aggregate a variety of objectives and actions under umbrella items. Also, some important investment programmes are defined and funded outside the Multiannual Financial Framework and this further reduces the accountability and monitoring of the EU budget decisions in relation to gender equality. For these reasons, financial and budgetary accountability is difficult and gender equality objectives risk being marginalised in spending decisions. Without clear objectives, dedicated resources and continuous monitoring based on gender-related indicators, gender mainstreaming is likely to fail, especially in periods of crisis and budget cuts. Since the 2008 crisis, a downgrading of gender equality in the public debate and policy agenda is indeed evident both at the EU and national level. As underlined in evaluations of past programmes and budgets, the implementation of gender equality is usually fulfilled only in those programmes pursuing a dual strategy by combining gender mainstreaming and gender-specific measures, where gender objectives and actions are clearly identified from the beginning and gender-related indicators are included in monitoring and evaluation activities. On the contrary, the gender dimension tends to disappear in those programmes where only transversal gender objectives are declared, with no specific actions or conditions envisaged to provide concrete assistance in achieving the objective and monitoring progress. The 2014-2020 MFF and all the EU programmes should have a stronger commitment to gender equality and gender mainstreaming . In order to be effective, gender mainstreaming has to be operationalised and supported through predictable funding and allocations. To this end it is crucial that all EU-funded programmes and budget headings adopt explicit gender equality targets whenever possible. Greater transparency in financial allocations, enhanced use of gender-related indicators, and more systematic collection of gender-disaggregated data are needed. The further advancement in Gender Budgeting , even if challenging, should be given special focus, taking into account that it is one of the most effective ways to implement gender mainstreaming. Gender Budgeting requires an extensive analysis from a gender perspective of all the actions envisaged in EU policy intervention areas and funding programmes, from the planning stage of the MFF. This requires that: \uf0b7 Gender Budgeting is made mandatory in the EU budgeting process .

Gender equality should be integrated as a distinct policy objective in all headings of the EU budget, and the financial allocations for gender equality policy objectives and actions should be specified. Progress towards gender equality targets should be constantly monitored in the annual and midterm reviews of the MFF. \uf0b7 Gender-relevant data and indicators should be considered in all programmes and actions that receive funding from the EU budget and be used in all the budgetary procedures. Gender-disaggregated data about beneficiaries and participants in all actions that receive funding from the EU budget, as well as gender- relevant data, should be collected in the monitoring and evaluation system. \uf0b7 In order to support the effective implementation of gender mainstreaming in all the EU areas of intervention, it is necessary to improve the in-house capacity of EU institutions on gender mainstreaming by integrating a gender perspective in all EU training programmes. Providing specific training and technical support on the use of Gender Impact Assessment and Gender Budgeting tools is needed, especially in relation to those policy fields not considered as immediately related to women and gender equality, although they may have significant effects on gender equality. In relation to the programmes considered in this study, some specific policy implications emerge from the analysis: \uf0b7 The implementation of the gender equality measures envisaged in the Operational Programmes of the ESI funds should be closely monitored and evaluated.This will help to avoid the downgrading of gender equality measures in the implementation phase. To this end, the creation of permanent gender equality bodies providing technical support for gender mainstreaming in the planning and implementation stages of all funds is crucial, as shown by the Swedish and German cases. Special attention should be given to ESIF measures supporting investments in educational, social and healthcare services, which are facing reductions in public funding at the national and local level due to the crisis and deficit reduction strategies. The financial allocations for social infrastructures and services could eventually be increased, in the midterm revision. \uf0b7 In relation to Horizon 2020 , gender mainstreaming should be strengthened in all the funded pillars with the establishment of gender-relevant targets. In addition, an independent line of funding (such as GERI for 2014-2016) for gender-specific structural change projects as well as other gender equality topics in research and innovation should be maintained, in order to support the implementation of the binding legal requirements related to gender equality included in H2020. To this end, the changes envisaged in the new Science With and For Society Scoping Paper 2018- 2020 that subsume gender equality funding under the more general heading of RRI \u2013 responsible research and innovation \u2013 should be avoided. As already underlined, past experience shows that when gender equality is subsumed within another topic, it tends to be side-lined and disappears. \uf0b7 The REC programmes directly addressing gender issues should be maintained and the allocated resources increased, in order to contrast the sharp reductions in many Member States of public funds for measures promoting gender equality and fighting violence against women. A stronger involvement of NGOs active in gender equality fields should be supported in order to ensure effective implementation. \uf0b7 The interventions implemented to face the current dramatic refugee and migrant crisis should give greater attention to the specific needs of women and girls, who are disproportionally disadvantaged and at risk of being victims of violence.

INTRODUCTION The European Parliament\u2019s Policy Department on Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs commissioned the Institute for Social Research (IRS) to conduct this \u2018Study on the use of funds for gender equality in selected Member States\u2019. According to the indications provided by the EP services, the focus of the study is on the following issues: \uf0b7 the available evidence on how gender mainstreaming is applied in the EU funds allocations on gender equality issues; \uf0b7 EU funding for childcare under the work \u2013 life balance policy; \uf0b7 gender mainstreaming in the use of Horizon 2020 funding; \uf0b7 gender mainstreaming in the use of the REC programme, with focus on the Gender Equality Objective and the follow-up of Daphne program on violence against women (VAW); \uf0b7 selected countries are: Croatia, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden and the UK; reference period 2014-2016. The study is based on a desk analysis of the financial data and relevant documentation (programmes, calls for proposals, funded projects) available on the EU 2014-2020 funding programmes of interest for the 2014-2016 period. The report is structured into six sections and a number of annexes. Following the introduction, Section 2 provides a brief overview of the application of gender mainstreaming in the 2014- 2020 EU Multiannual Financial Framework. The following sections focus on the selected EU programmes, providing an analysis of the budget allocations for each priority and of the projects supported so far, together with an assessment of the involvement of the six selected countries. Section 3 focuses on the planned use of ESI funds for childcare in the 2014-2020 Operational Programmes of the selected countries; Chapter 4 on gender mainstreaming in Horizon 2020; and Chapter 5 on the two REC objectives directly dealing with gender issues: the Gender Equality Objective and the Daphne objective. The concluding chapter provides some policy indications emerging from the study\u2019s main findings. The Annex includes several tables presenting additional data and information on the programmes and projects considered in the study. ",
        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 19 2. THE USE OF EU FUNDS FOR GENDER EQUALITY 2.1. The EU commitment towards gender equality and gender mainstreaming Besides being a fundamental right in Europe, gender equality is also increasingly recognised as a key factor in achieving the EU objectives of growth, employment and social inclusion. The EU commitment in promoting gender equality has changed over the years. Since the initial approach focusing only on equal treatment in employment, the European Union has extended its activities in other areas of gender equality ( 8 ). Besides legislative intervention, since 1996 ( 9 ) the Commission adopted a dual-approach strategy towards gender equality, which encompasses both proactive intervention (gender mainstreaming) and reactive intervention (specific measures such as policies addressing the gender pay gap, gender discrimination, etc.) in tackling gender equality. Gender mainstreaming is based on the recognition that women and men do not have the same resources, needs and preferences and that many structures, systems and policies are not gender neutral, but treat men\u2019s experience as the norm ( 10 ). Adoption of a gender mainstreaming approach involves mobilising all policies and measures taking into account their possible effects on the respective situation of men and women in all stages of the policy process, \u2018so that a gender equality perspective is incorporated in all policies at all levels and at all stages, by the actors normally involved in policy making\u2019 (CoE, 1998). Introducing the gender mainstreaming approach marked a significant change from the previous Community action on equal opportunities for men and women, which was based mainly on departmental activities and programmes funded under different specific budget headings ( 11 ). However, as underlined by many experts, the adoption of a gender mainstreaming approach risks to produce a sort of \u2018gender blindness\u2019 ( 12 ), with less attention and investment in specific gender equality measures, such as policies tackling gender gaps, reconciliation policies, etc. The lack of an explicit commitment to gender equality in the Europe 2020 strategy is an example. In recent years, the Commission commitment to gender equality and gender mainstreaming was reaffirmed in the Women\u2019s Charter ( 13 ) and the Roadmap for equality between women and men for the period 2006-2010 ( 14 ) at the basis of the five-year strategy for equality between women and men for the period 2010-2015 adopted in 2010 ( 15 ). 8 While the Treaty of Maastricht (1993) marks a turning point, introducing new procedures and practices in the field of gender equality extending the adoption of the co-decision procedure on matters involved in Articles 137 and 141 of the EC Treaty, the Treaty of Amsterdam (1997) placed equality between women and men among the explicit tasks of the European Community by reinforcing and formalising the introduction of gender equality among the principles of the Treaty. With the entry into force of the new Lisbon Treaty amending the Treaty of the European Union (2009), equality between women and men has been upgraded to the status of \u2018fundamental value\u2019 (Art.2 TEU) and objective (Art.3 TEU) of the EU. 9 European Commission Communication of 21 February 1996 Incorporating equal opportunities for women and men into all Community policies and activities (COM(96) 67 final). 10 Rees T.

        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 20 The strategy represented the work programme of the European Commission on gender equality and highlighted the contribution of gender equality to economic growth and sustainable development. The strategy was organised into six priority areas : 1. equal economic independence; 2. equal pay for work of equal value; 3. equality in decision-making; 4. dignity, integrity and ending gender violence; 5. promoting gender equality beyond the EU; 6. horizontal issues, including gender mainstreaming. For each priority area, the strategy identified some key actions to be carried out until 2015 as well as more than 120 actions to be implemented by different Commission services and the European External Action Service. According to a 2015 evaluation of the strategy strengths and weaknesses ( 16 ), the strategy produced positive effects of value added especially in relation to the agenda setting and learning dimensions. It provided a valuable framework for gender mainstreaming in the European Commission and for the implementation of a coherent framework for gender equality policies in Member States. The strategy enhanced attention to the gender pay gap, innovation and gender in ICT and research. The strategy also supported an extension of the types of actions and measures implemented, with increasing attention to awareness-raising measures, data-gathering, monitoring and evaluation tools. The involvement of all the European Commission DGs, even if to different degrees, in the programming and implementation of gender mainstreaming in almost all policy areas, was another significant achievement. There was also the establishment of interdepartmental coordination mechanisms (the inter-service group on gender equality) ( 17 ) and the support for a greater gender balance in the Commission services management positions and committees. However, the implementation of gender mainstreaming in those policy domains not considered as directly related to women and gender equality ( 18 ) has been limited. In addition, some important tools for decision-making, like the Gender Impact Assessment (GIA) and Gender Budgeting (GB), are still rarely adopted in the EU or national institutions . Gender mainstreaming, even if greatly improved, still remains weakly institutionalised in the EU decision-making process. Gender equality units in the European Commission have limited power to interact on the same level with other decision-making bodies. In addition, the recent tendency to merge all grounds of discrimination , including discrimination based on sex, within the promotion of civil rights and equal treatment for all, 16 IRS, Evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the strategy for equality between women and men 2010\u20132015 , ENEGE research report, prepared for European Commission, Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers, 2015 See: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/documents/151201_strategy_evaluation_en.pdf 17 The inter-service group on equality between women and men (in which all Commission departments are represented and which meets at least twice a year) will continue to monitor and steer the integration of a gender equality perspective in policy, legal and spending programme activities, including budgetary matters, across all EU policy areas. See: European Commission \u2013 DG Justice and Consumers (2015) , Strategic engagement for gender equality 2016-2019. 18 For example environmental policies, transportation and competition policies, regional development, macroeconomic policies, and the media and communication policies that may affect women and men differently, as shown by recent developments in socio-economic research. ",
        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 21 risks is to downgrade the profile of gender equality and gender mainstreaming in the policy agenda. Another major weakness of the strategy was the lack of suitable resources (both human and financial), with no budget earmarked to the gender equality strategy , as well as to gender equality in the EU programmes. These drawbacks can also be found in the recent Strategic engagement for gender equality 2016-2019 ( 19 ) published in December 2015 as a follow-up and prolongment of the previous strategy for equality between men and women, providing a reference framework to sustain the 2011-2020 European Pact for gender equality ( 20 ). As a partial step forward in the application of gender mainstreaming in the EU policy making, the Inter-Service Group ( 21 ) will continue to monitor and steer the integration of a gender equality perspective. This will cover policy, legal and spending programme activities, including budgetary matters, across all EU policy areas. It will consider issuing a report on gender mainstreaming in the Commission in 2017 presenting sectorial aspects, such as gender equality in transport, energy, education, health, taxation, agriculture, trade, regional policy, maritime affairs and the environment ( 22 ). The European Parliament , and particularly the FEMM Committee , is also playing a crucial role in monitoring and supporting the application of gender mainstreaming in all EU policy making. However, in recent years, and especially since the 2008 crisis, a downgrading of gender equality in the public debate and policy agenda is present at both the EU and Member States levels. Research clearly demonstrates that gender equality has suffered during this current period of austerity in many European countries and that commitments to GB have been challenged ( 23 ). 2.2. The application of gender mainstreaming the EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014-2020 Gender Budgeting (GB) is a very powerful tool for gender mainstreaming ( 24 ). It implies the application of gender mainstreaming in the budgetary process through a gender-based assessment of budgets, incorporating a gender perspective at all levels of the budgetary process. It involves restructuring revenues and expenditures in order to ensure that gender equality objectives and gender mainstreaming obligations are followed consistently in all 19 European Commission \u2013 DG Justice and Consumers (2015 ), Strategic engagement for gender equality 2016-2019. http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/documents/151203_strategic_engagement_en.pdf 20 Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council conclusions, 7 March 2011. 21 The Inter-Service Group on gender equality is managed by the Gender Equality Unit in DG Justice and Consumers, which coordinates the annual monitoring and reporting of the implemented actions and provides a synthesis of the main developments in the Annual report on equality between women and men . 22 See footnote 26. 23 See Rubery J. and Karamessini M. (2013), Women and austerity: the economic crisis and the future for gender equality . Abingdon: Routledge, 368 p. 24 According to the Council of Europe definition: \u2018Gender budgeting is the application of gender mainstreaming in the budgetary process through a gender-based assessment of budgets, incorporating a gender perspective at all levels of the budgetary process and restructuring revenues and expenditures in order to promote gender equality\u2019. The focus of Gender Budgeting is twofold. First the focus is on the analysis of gender-disaggregated effects of public revenues and expenditures. Based on the results of this analysis, Gender Budgeting then aims to modify budget structures and processes in a second step so as to foster gender equality. See Council of Europe (2009), Gender Budgeting, practical implementation handbook, prepared by S. Quinn. http://www.femtech.at/sites/default/files/Gender_budgeting_-_practical_implementation.pdf ",
        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 22 budget headings that are relevant for it. It is based on the recognition that budgets are non- neutral policy instruments, but may have very different impacts on women and men. The first attempt to introduce GB into the EU budgetary process was made in 2002, when the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Men and Women of the European Commission officially acknowledged the importance of budgets for policy planning, and recommended the inclusion of EU budgetary policy in gender mainstreaming ( 25 ). The Advisory Committee also recommended the exchange of good practices among the EU institutions and the encouragement of GB initiatives at national level. In 2008, a study commissioned by the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Budget confirmed that the EU budget was suitable for GB. It suggested that GB should first be adopted in the MFF, and then in the strategic programming and planning cycle ( 26 ). The European Union\u2019s commitment to GB was also reflected in the cited Roadmap for equality between women and men (2006-2010). This indicated GB as a tool for the implementation of gender equality, and stated that the Commission would support Gender Budgeting and GIA. In 2009 the Council of Europe published a handbook on the practical implementation of GB ( 27 ) . Moreover, the new strategy for equality between women and men includes the objective of advancing GB as part of EU budgeting. Notwithstanding this commitment, GB is not yet systematically applied in the EU general budget . Even the current EU Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014-2020 only includes a joint declaration that: \u2018the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agree that the annual budgetary procedures applied for the MFF 2014-2020 will integrate, as appropriate, gender-responsive elements, taking into account the ways in which the overall financial framework of the Union contributes to increased gender equality (and ensures gender mainstreaming) \u2019 ( 28 ). However, it does not provide a clear indication of the financial resources earmarked to gender equality measures in the funded Union programmes and budget headings. The MFF midterm review ( 29 ) also does not address the implementation of gender mainstreaming. The lack of gender-differentiated and gender-relevant data on beneficiaries and participants in many Union programmes makes it impossible to assess their gender effects. In addition, as underlined in a recent European Parliament working document ( 30 ), the frequent recourse to ad hoc instruments constituted outside the EU budget (such as the 25 Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men, Opinion on gender budgeting , May 2003. 26 European Commission, DG Budget, Study to assess the feasibility and options for the introduction of elements of gender budgeting into the EU budgetary process , 2008 Specific contract ABAC 132007, under framework Contract BUDG 06/PO/01/Lot 002?ABAC-101922. 27 Council of Europe (2009), Gender budgeting: practical implementation handbook , prepared by Sheila Quinn https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680599885 28 Council of the European Union, statements forming part of the political agreement reached on the MFF, 15997/13 ADD1, 25 November 2011. http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&f=ST%2015997%202013%20ADD%201 29 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, Mid-term review/revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020: An EU budget focused on results , COM(2016) 603 final of 14.09.2016 http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mff/lib/COM-2016-603/COM-2016-603_en.pdf 30 European Parliament, Committee on Budgets, WORKING DOCUMENT on the preparation of the post-electoral revision of the MFF 2014-2020: Parliament\u2019s input ahead of the Commission\u2019s proposal, Rapporteur: Jan Olbrycht, Isabelle Thomas, 30.11.2015. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-%2F%2FEP%2F%2FNONSGML%2BCOMPARL%2BPE- 572.902%2B01%2BDOC%2BPDF%2BV0%2F%2FEN ",
        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 23 Turkey refugee grant facility, the European Development Fund ( 31 ), etc.), creates a problem of accountability in the EU. This makes it even more difficult to assess the application of gender mainstreaming in the EU budget, and to identify the funds earmarked to gender equality in both the Commission work programmes and the MFF. Box 2.1: The 2014-2020 MFF The MFF lays down the maximum annual amounts (\u2018ceilings\u2019) which the EU may spend in different political fields (\u2018headings\u2019) over a seven-year period. The upcoming MFF covers seven years: from 2014 to 2020. By specifying in which areas the EU should invest more or less over the seven years, the MFF is an expression of political priorities as much as a budgetary planning tool. The annual budget is adopted within this framework and usually remains below the MFF expenditure ceilings in order to retain some flexibility to cope with unforeseen needs. The MFF is part of a comprehensive package which also comprises the EU own resources and a set of sector-specific legislation defining the conditions of eligibility and the criteria for allocating funds for each EU spending programme. The functioning of the MFF 2014-20 has been reviewed by the Commission in 2016 taking full account of the economic situation at the time as well as the latest macroeconomic projections. According to the most recent technical adjustment of the MFF {COM(2016) 311 final}, for the period 2014-2020, the revised MFF sets a maximum amount of EUR 1 087 billion in commitment appropriations and for EUR 1 025 billion in payment appropriations (current prices). In commitments, this represents about 2.1 % of EU Member States\u2019 total government expenditure and 1.04 % of EU gross national income. For the first time the ceilings for the 2014-2020 period are lower than the previous ones, although the MFF includes new programmes that cover Europe\u2019s political priorities for the next seven years, such as research and innovation (Horizon 2020), connecting the transport, energy and IT infrastructure of all Member States (connecting Europe facility), education (ERASMUS+), job opportunities for our youth (youth employment initiative \u2013 YEI), competitiveness of Europe\u2019s businesses (COSME), and the adoption in June 2015 of the European fund for strategic investment (EFSI). The MFF 2014-20 is divided into six categories of expense (headings) corresponding to different areas of EU intervention: 1. Smart and Inclusive Growth (47 % of the overall 2014-2020 ceiling for commitment appropriations). - Competitiveness for growth and jobs includes research and innovation; education and training; trans-European networks in energy, transport and telecommunications; social policy; development of enterprises etc. This heading should absorb up to 13 % of the overall 2014-2020 ceiling for commitment appropriations. - Economic, social and territorial cohesion covers regional policy which aims at helping the least developed EU countries and regions to catch up with the rest, strengthening all regions\u2019 competitiveness and developing inter-regional cooperation. This heading includes the European structural and investment funds (ESIFs). This heading should absorb up to 34 % of the overall 2014-2020 ceiling for commitment appropriations. 2.

This heading should absorb up to 2 % of the overall 2014-2020 ceiling for commitment appropriations. 4. Global Europe covers all external action (foreign policy) by the EU such as development assistance or humanitarian aid with the exception of the European Development Fund (EDF) which provides aid for development cooperation with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, as well as overseas countries and territories. As it is not funded from the EU budget but from direct contributions from EU Member States, the EDF does not fall under the MFF.

The lack of clear commitment to GB in the EU budget has been pointed out by various independent budget assessments. A 2012 assessment conducted for the European Parliament in preparation for the 2014-20 MFF ( 32 ), underlines that implementation and evaluation especially are still lacking or incomplete ( 33 ). The study also shows that documents related to the 2014-2020 MFF present reduced gender awareness in comparison to the previous programming period, most notably in the scarcity of explicit references to gender equality as a policy objective in its own right. A 2015 EP study on \u2018The EU budget for gender equality\u2019, also concludes that the EU\u2019s high- level commitment to gender equality and gender mainstreaming is not always acted on at lower levels, and recommends greater transparency, enhanced use of gender-related indicators and more systematic collection of gender-disaggregated data. Due to the lack of an explicit reference to the budget allocated for gender equality measures, it is only possible to assess whether and how the EC 2014-2020 funding programmes address gender equality and provide financial means promoting gender equality and gender mainstreaming in key policy areas. 32 http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&f=ST%2011791%202013%20INIT 33 European Parliament, Directorate General for Internal Policies, Policy Department C (2012) The Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 from a gender equality perspective , http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201201/20120123ATT36024/20120123ATT36024EN.pdf ",
        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 25 According to the Commission Staff Working Document for the Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality 2016-2019 ( 34 ), the overall EU funding allocated for gender equality in the 2014-2020 period reaches EUR 6.17 billion, equivalent to around 0.6 % of the overall commitment appropriations. The following sections provide an overall assessment for the main EU funds and programmes addressing gender equality, while Chapters 3, 4 and 5 focus on the ESF and ERDF funds addressing childcare, and the implementation of gender mainstreaming in the projects funded up to September 2016 by Horizon 2020 and by the two REC programmes directly addressing gender issues. 2.2.1. The ESIFs ( 35 ) With an overall budget of EUR 454 Billion for 2014-2020, the ESI funds are the European Union\u2019s main investment policy tool supporting the EU economic, social and territorial cohesion. The ESIFs 2014-2020 are also the main investment instruments for supporting the key priorities of the EU as enshrined the Europe 2020 strategy and constitute the most important financial support available for the implementation of gender equality policy in the EU. Their importance in supporting investments and growth has greatly increased with the crisis, as the ESIFs have been compensating for decreasing national investments. According to the European Commission ( 36 ) in 2014-2016, the commitments from ESIFs are expected to account for approximately 14 % of total public investment on average, with the highest share reaching beyond 70 % in some Member States. The 2014-2020 ESI funds can finance numerous initiatives aimed at promoting gender equality within social and economic sustainable development policies. The ESIFs are meant to provide funding for enhancing gender equality in all policy areas, including access to employment, career progression, reconciliation of work and private life and promotion of equal pay for equal work. It should also cover infrastructures and business support that are not under a specific gender investment priority, but contribute to gender equality in a more indirect way. The ESIFs regulations for the 2014-2020 programming period include the following ( 37 ): \uf0b7 Multiple references to gender equality and non-discrimination principles. Article 7 of the common Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 for 2014-2020, provides the legal basis for mainstreaming and is reinforced throughout the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) ( 38 ), by explicit references to gender equality, non-discrimination and accessibility. \uf0b7 General ex ante conditions on gender equality, non-discrimination and accessibility (does not apply to European Territorial Cooperation programmes). 34 European Commission (2015), Strategic engagement for gender equality 2016-2019, DG Justice and Consumers, 2015 https://ec.europa.eu/anti-rafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/strategic_engagement_for_gender_equality_en.pdfre 35 European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) , the Cohesion Fund (CF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) , the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) 36 COM(2015) 639 final, Brussels, 14.12.2015 http://ec.europa.eu/contracts_grants/pdf/esif/invest-progr- investing-job-growth-report_en.pdf 37 See: European Commission Implementation guidance 2014-2020 mainstreaming of gender equality and non- discrimination version 2 \u2013 24/03/2014 http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/informat/2014/implementation_gender_equality.pdf. 38 Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/informaention/legislation/regulations/ ",

In addition to mainstreaming, equality between women and men as well as non- discrimination should be pursued through specific actions. \uf0b7 The managing authority shall ensure that the data are broken down by gender whenever possible ( 39 ). However, there is no longer a specific requirement for all funds to have statistics broken down by sex, except for the ESF (see Article 125(2)(e) CPR and Annex 1 of the ESF Regulation). The cited guidelines for EC desk officers underline that \u2018where programmes are focusing on \u201cpeople-related schemes\u201d (training, entrepreneurship measures \u2026), targets should be set, at least in terms of participation of women and groups at risk of discrimination. Where possible and appropriate, these targets should be supplemented by financial targets or even more qualitative targets (in relation to possible gaps identified in women\u2019s employment or groups at risk of discrimination in some specific economic sector for instance)\u2019. The ESIFs regulations also require a number of other criteria. \uf0b7 Member States should include their partnership institutions and non-governmental organisations working in gender equality and non-discrimination (Article 5(1)(c) CPR). \uf0b7 The managing authority shall draw up and, once approved, apply appropriate selection procedures and criteria that are non-discriminatory and transparent and take into account gender equality and non-discrimination principles . The managing authority must make sure that the project holder has carried out an analysis of the needs of men and women and/or of the impact of a project on men and women, as well as the needs of groups which suffered from discrimination. \uf0b7 The annual implementation reports submitted in 2017, 2019 and by the deadline referred to in CPR Article 138 (1) shall specifically assess the implementation of actions to take into account the principles of gender equality, non- discrimination and accessibility (Article 50(4) CPR). The monitoring committee shall examine actions to promote equality between men and women, equal opportunities and non-discrimination including accessibility for persons with disabilities (Article 110 (1) (f) CPR, Article 114 of the EMFF). Thus, institutional bodies responsible for gender equality and non-discrimination and NGOs active in gender equality and non-discrimination should be involved, except in duly justified cases. \uf0b7 The ex ante evaluation shall appraise the adequacy of planned measures to equal opportunities between men and women and to prevent any discrimination, in particular as regards accessibility for persons with disabilities (Article 55 (3) (l) CPR). However, gender equality is not a thematic objective on its own, with dedicated resources (technical, human and financial) and requirements to explicitly integrate gender equality into all the programmes\u2019 planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation phases are lacking. The promotion of gender equality is a horizontal objective, and it is directly addressed in only one of the ESF investment priorities. In addition, the integration of the dual gender equality 39 This is a regulatory requirement for the ESF (Annex I of ESF regulation). For the EAFRD , job creation by the LEADER/CLLD approach (as a target indicator) will be split by gender as well as the number of beneficiaries of the measures related to business development and to investment in agricultural holdings (as an output indicator); for the EMFF , the annual data provision on operations (Article 99 of EMFF) should include gender breakdown for the beneficiaries as well for operations, where relevant; for the other funds, the principle of equality mainstreaming should be translated in the monitoring and reporting system.

In detail ( 40 ): \uf0b7 The 2014-2020 ESF funds measures aimed at combating all forms of discrimination and promoting equal opportunities and equality between men and women in all areas. Gender equality objectives and a dual gender equality approach, both in mainstreaming and with specific actions, are mandatory requirements in the ESF for the funding period 2014-2020. The new ESF regulations: o directly address the promotion of gender equality only in Investment Priority 8iv) equality between men and women in all areas, including access to employment and career development, the reconciliation of work and family life and the promotion of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value; o four investment priorities address equal opportunities and anti-discrimination priorities for all more generally: \uf0a7 9i) Active inclusion, including with a view to promoting equal opportunities and active participation, and improving employability; \uf0a7 9iii) the fight against all forms of discrimination and the promotion of equal opportunities; \uf0a7 9iv) the improvement of the access to affordable, sustainable and quality services, including healthcare and social services of general interest; \uf0a7 10i) Reducing and preventing early school-leaving and promoting equal access to good quality early childhood, primary and secondary education including formal, non-formal and informal learning pathways for reintegrating into education and training. \uf0b7 The 2014-2020 ERDF regulations do not explicitly mention specific gender equality objectives and thematic gender aspects, although they could be addressed in all the ERDF thematic objectives and investment priorities, and particularly in the following: o TO1: strengthening research, technological development and innovation; o TO2: enhancing access to, and use and quality of, ICT; o TO3: enhancing the competitiveness of SMEs; o TO6: promoting sustainable transport and removing bottlenecks in key network infrastructures; o TO9: promoting social inclusion, combating poverty and any discrimination, by: (a) investing in health and social infrastructure which contributes to national, regional and local development, reducing inequalities in health status; promoting social inclusion through improved access to social, cultural and recreational services and the transition from institutional to community-based services; 40 European Commission (2014), Implementation Guidance 2014-2020 Mainstreaming of gender equality and non- discrimination Version 2 \u2013 24/03/2014, http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/informat/2014/implementation_gender_equality.pdf ",

Qualitative evidence from the evaluations of past programming periods ( 41 ), indeed show that women are among the beneficiaries of these measures, even if often little attention has been paid to their specific needs in the intervention design, and in defining the accessibility conditions. For example, measures supporting female entrepreneurship were often not designed with attention to the specific needs of women entrepreneurs (like, for example the need for maternity support, the greater difficulties compared to men in access to credit, the lack of social networks, etc.) and this reduced their effectiveness. ERDF support for care facilities for children and the elderly were more effective both in creating jobs for women and in improving women\u2019s work \u2013 life balance. Finally, women were often the main beneficiaries of the ERDF interventions in rural or urban regeneration. The 2014-2020 EAFRD Regulation states that EARDF funding should support women entrepreneurship in rural areas through the diversification into non-agricultural activities and the setting up and the development of non-agricultural SMEs in rural areas. Thematic sub- programmes should concern, among others, women in rural areas funding the following actions: knowledge transfer and information actions, advisory services, farm management and farm relief services, investments in physical assets, farm and business development, basic services (such as kindergartens, schools, buses, etc.) village renewal in rural areas, and cooperation, through LEADER (42) . The 2014-2020 EMFF finances initiatives to promote the role of women in fishing communities and the networking and exchange of experiences and best practice among aquaculture enterprises or professional organisations and other stakeholders, including those promoting equal opportunities between men and women. The Cohesion Fund is aimed at Member States whose gross national income (GNI) per inhabitant is less than 90 % of the EU average. It aims to reduce economic and social disparities and to promote sustainable development. A total of EUR 63.4 billion is allocated to activities under the following categories: \uf0b7 trans-European transport networks, notably priority projects of European interest as identified by the EU. The Cohesion Fund will support infrastructure projects under the Connecting Europe Facility; \uf0b7 environment, supporting projects related to energy or transport, as long as they clearly benefit the environment in energy efficiency, use of renewable energy, developing rail transport, supporting intermodality, strengthening public transport, etc. 41 Istituto per la Ricerca Sociale and CSIL (2007), Gender mainstreaming in the use of structural funding study, European Parliament, May 2007; Istituto per la Ricerca Sociale and CSIL (2009), Ex post evaluation of Cohesion Policy programmes 2000-2006 co- financed by the European Fund for Regional Development (Objectives 1 and 2) - Work package 7: Effectiveness of the Cohesion Policy: gender equality and demographic change , September, 2009. 42 http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/policy/what/investment-policy/esif-contribution/migration.pdf ",
        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 29 Although some of the funded actions could be addressed in a gender equality perspective (for example in accessibility), gender equality is not mentioned in the fund regulation. The ESI funds policy framework and regulations on gender mainstreaming are thus relatively robust. Efforts on gender mainstreaming in the structural funds have focused strongly on policy statements and on procedures and instruments \u2013 reflected in the technical guidelines. However gender equality is not a specific thematic objective with dedicated resources (technical, human and financial) in all the funds, and the lack of systematic monitoring and evaluation data are an obstacle to the implementation of GM and gender equality measures at the national and regional level and for the assessment of their gender impact. Information on funds allocated to gender equality is difficult to collect. According to the European Commission Staff Working Document for the Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality 2016-2019 ( 43 ), based on the Operational Programmes agreed between Member States, Regions and the Commission, approximately EUR 5.85 billion will be spent in 2014- 2020 on measures promoting gender equality. Of these, approximately EUR 4.6 billion will be spent under the ESF and approximately EUR 1.25 billion under the ERDF. EUR 1.6 billion of ESF funding is programmed under the specific investment priority \u2018equality between men and women in all areas, including in access to employment, career progression, reconciliation of work and private life and promotion of equal pay for equal work\u2019, which has been selected only by 12 Member States ( 44 ). ERDF funding is programmed for investment in childcare infrastructures . In addition, under the Migration Commission Priority (2014-2020) ( 45 ), the ERDF will also support measures to integrate migrants and asylum seekers through investments in social, health, education and housing including childcare infrastructure. The ESF also contributes to the YEI with EUR 3 Billion out of a total allocation of EUR 6.2 billion for 2014 and 2015. Given the persistence of youth unemployment in many regions the Commission proposed to supplement the original allocation of the YEI by EUR 1 billion over 2017\u20132020, with EUR 1 billion of matching funding to be provided from the European Social Fund. The YEI was launched in 2013 to provide targeted support to young people not in education, employment or training (NEETs) in the EU\u2019s regions with a youth unemployment rate in 2012 at above 25 %. To date, over 1.4 million young people have been covered by YEI-supported actions. In many Member States, EU funds (YEI and ESF) are used to support the national youth guarantee schemes ( 46 ). The Council Recommendation on Establishing a Youth Guarantee ( 47 ) requires that \u2018gender and diversity of the young people who are being targeted\u2019 be considered in the design of the schemes. The background analysis of the staff working document provides indications of gender differences in entering and remaining in the labour market. Furthermore, the European Youth Report, recently adopted by the Commission, and its staff working paper on the situation of young people in Europe, includes gender-disaggregated information (European Commission 2012a and b). However, there is 43 Brussels, 3.12.2015, SWD(2015) 278 final. 44 AT, CZ, DE, ES, FI, GR, HU, IT, PL, PT, SK and UK. 45 http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/policy/what/investment-policy/esif-contribution/ 46 A programme endorsed in April 2013 with the aim to ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education 47 Council Recommendation of 22 April 2013 on establishing a Youth Guarantee (2013/C 120/01), available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2013:120:0001:0006:EN:PDF ",
        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 30 no indication on whether and how gender mainstreaming should be applied in the implementation of national measures ( 48 ). The extent to which measures directly or indirectly supporting gender equality will be adopted crucially depend on decisions taken in the implementation of the ESIFs programmes by regions and Member States. An indication of the importance of the implementation phase comes from previous programming period. For example, for the European Social Fund, which should provide the largest amount of resources for gender equality, results from the evaluation of the 2007-2013 programming period ( 49 ) show that: \uf0b7 only 3.7 % of the total ESF resources on average for all Member States was allocated to specific gender equality actions, and there is no evidence that gender actions have been mainstreamed; \uf0b7 targets related to employment were more likely to be adopted by Member States; other gender-sensitive objectives in relation to poverty, care, empowerment, etc., appear to have been overlooked. In the same way, the evaluation of the 2000-2006 programming period ( 50 ) shows that, in many cases, the proportion actually allocated to gender equality actions was lower than intended in the programming documents. Failure or inability to translate intentions into specific priorities of the national operational plans could be one of the reasons. The ex post evaluation of the promotion of gender equality in the ERDF and CF 2007-2013 ( 51 ) found good overall awareness of the Article 16 requirements in programmes supported by the ERDF, with explicit reference in 64 % of the programmes analysed. The ERDF and the Cohesion Fund promoted equal opportunities in SME support, public transport infrastructure, social infrastructure (childcare facilities), and in some cases also on other policies that could potentially promote equal opportunities. The main critical aspect was the presence of only formal statements, without a clear indication of how to intervene. In general, focused social infrastructure investment is not common, which leads to some difficulties in understanding the added value of the investments, and also to the sharing of good practices among the countries. Almost all the Member States allocated resources to childcare services. However, the total expenditure has varied greatly across Member States depending on the budget available under the structural funds and the current state of the provision of services. 2.2.2.

It is also seen as an instrument to drive economic growth and create jobs. Horizon 2020 activated a large number of project proposals but, given the available resources, could finance less than one-third of the proposals evaluated positively up to 2016 ( 52 ). In Horizon 2020 gender is a cross-cutting issue and is mainstreamed in each one of the different parts of the work programme , ensuring a more integrated approach to research and innovation. Funding is also provided for the development of a common framework to evaluate national initiatives promoting gender equality in research policy . A dedicated campaign aims at encouraging girls to study science and female students to further embrace a career in research. Research is funded to analyse the impact of gender diversity in research teams on research and innovation performance. The Commission published the first Horizon 2020 Monitoring Report in 2016 ( 53 ). The report covers the calls closed in 2014 and the grants signed before December 2015, and it helps to identify the most important issues related to performance, implementation aspects and participation trends, providing data for all priorities and specific objectives of Horizon 2020. However, it is not possible to assess the overall financial commitments to gender equality in the work programmes (WP) 2014-2017, besides the EUR 43 million for the GERI programme. For a detailed assessment, see Chapter 4. 2.2.3. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship 2014-2020 Programme (REC) ( 54 ) REC defends the rights and freedoms that people are entitled to under EU law. It replaces three earlier funding programmes which expired in 2013: \uf0b7 Fundamental rights and citizenship programme; \uf0b7 Daphne III programme; \uf0b7 PROGRESS programme: anti-discrimination and gender equality strands . Among its nine objectives, one is explicitly related to gender equality and another to preventing and combating violence against women , children and young people and protecting victims and groups at risk. REC is meant to co-finance national projects promoting equal economic independence, overcoming rigid gender roles and stereotypes, and raising awareness of the gender pension gap and its causes and consequences. It also finances projects supporting victims of gender- based violence, training relevant professionals, raising awareness and preventing violence linked to harmful practices. The overall budget is EUR 439.5 million over the period 2014-2020. The two objectives ( gender equality and combating violence against women) currently account for around 35 % of the total REC funds .

        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 32 2.2.4. The Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) Programme ( 55 ) The EaSI promotes high quality and sustainable employment, appropriate social protection, combating social exclusion and poverty and improving working conditions. EaSI is managed directly by the European Commission. It brings together three EU programmes that were managed separately between 2007 and 2013 and that now form the three axes of EaSI: \uf0b7 the PROGRESS axis (targeted to the modernisation of employment and social policies, it uses 61 % of the total budget); \uf0b7 the EURES axis (targeted to the job mobility, it uses 18 % of the total budget); \uf0b7 the Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship axis (targeted to the access to microfinance and social entrepreneurship, it uses the 21 % of the total budget). The total budget for 2014-2020 is EUR 919.5 million at 2013 prices. The objectives of this programme are to: \uf0b7 strengthen ownership of EU objectives and coordination of action at EU and national levels in the areas of employment, social affairs and inclusion; \uf0b7 support the development of appropriate social protection systems and labour market policies; \uf0b7 modernise EU legislation and ensure its effective application; \uf0b7 promote geographical mobility and boost job opportunities by developing an open labour market; \uf0b7 increase the availability and accessibility of microfinance for vulnerable groups and micro-enterprises, and increase access to finance for social enterprises. In pursuing these objectives, EaSI finances gender equality mainly through its progress axis which supports initiatives promoting gender equality in employment and in the labour market. It also involves the microfinance facility for employment and social inclusion axis which supports women\u2019s entrepreneurship through ensuring their access to credit and other financial mechanisms. In addition, the promotion of equality between women and men, including through gender mainstreaming, and, where appropriate, GB, is among the cross- cutting objectives. It is however difficult to assess the financial allocations for gender equality and gender mainstreaming. The Commission produces an annual monitoring report of good practices and performance, and it has recently published an evaluation roadmap for the EaSI programme ( 56 ). The EaSI monitoring and evaluation will have to assess the extent to which horizontal issues, such as gender equality, non-discrimination, inclusion of vulnerable groups and others, are regularly taken into account in the EaSI-supported activities. This will be undertaken by: i) estimating the extent to which outputs of the programme have a horizontal issue dimension. This process will be based on a separate column in the annual work programme, which will be allocated to indicate whether an output takes into account any of the horizontal issues; 55 See : http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1081&langId=en 56 http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/roadmaps/docs/2016_empl_010_easi_mid-term_evaluation_en.pdf ",

This information will be collected from the final technical implementation reports available for all activities. Initial monitoring results for 2014 ( 57 ) show that gender equality and non-discrimination issues were less notable during EaSI funded events than in the overall policy debate. The EaSI monitoring report on 2014 also shows that out of 10 013 natural persons benefiting from loans over the whole duration of the PROGRESS microfinance, 36.5 % were women. Number of intermediaries focused on providing loans specifically to female entrepreneurs. PROGRESS also funded networks in the areas of non-discrimination and gender equality. Overall, EaSI-supported key EU-level NGO networks, which besides the production of guidelines and reports, also organised 257 courses, peer reviews and other mutual learning events, as well as 136 information and communication events, with a total of 12 062 participants, of whom the majority (55 %) were women. 2.2.5. Other programmes with gender effects ( 58 ) According to the Commission\u2019s document on Strategic engagement for gender equality 2016- 2019 , the programmes indicated below address the promotion of gender equality and gender mainstreaming; however, it is not possible to assess the share of financial allocations that have been used for supporting women or gender mainstreaming. Gender equality is a fundamental value of EU external relations and is integrated into its main external instruments financed under the EU budget. Under the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) , out of EUR 19.7 billion (2013 prices), EUR 100 million will be committed to improving the lives of girls and women through the 2014-2020 global public goods and challenges specific thematic programme. Out of these funds, EUR 70 million is earmarked for the \u2018gender, women\u2019s empowerment and girls\u2019 rights\u2019 budget heading and EUR 30 million for the \u2018child well-being\u2019 heading, which will include EUR 18 million to tackle harmful practices such as FGM and child marriage. In the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) , with an overall allocation of EUR 15 432.63 million (current prices), gender equality and equal opportunities are among the cross-cutting issues to be addressed in the fund priorities. In Regulation (EU) No 232/2014 establishing the fund, \u2018gender equality, the rights of persons belonging to minorities and the fight against discrimination and inequalities are cross-cutting objectives in all actions undertaken under this Regulation\u2019 . The European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), with a total amount of EUR 1,332.75 million (2013 prices), providing support for the promotion of democracy and human rights in non-EU countries, includes among its redefined objectives: i) a stronger wording on the role of civil society, including a specific reference to the cooperation between civil society, local authorities and relevant state institutions; ii) a stronger emphasis on each vulnerable group (national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and inter-sex persons (LGBTI) and indigenous people); iii) a stronger emphasis on economic and social rights. The new 2014-2020 Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance for candidates countries (IPA II) with a budget of EUR 11.7 Billion, includes the promotion of gender equality among its five main policy areas. According to Regulation (EU)No 231/2014 of 11 March 2014 ( 59 ): \u2018Assistance should mainly focus on a 57 EaSI monitoring performance report on 2014 European Commission, Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion , June 2015. 58 Source of financial data: http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mff/programmes/index_en.cfm 59 http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/financial_assistance/ipa/2014/231-2014_ipa-2-reg.pdf ",

Gender mainstreaming is also among the funding principles of the recent Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) . AMIF, with a total amount of EUR 3.1 billion for 2014-2020 (current prices), plus the per capita lump sum allocated for the resettlement of each migrant or refugee ( 60 ), supports measures addressing all aspects of migration including asylum, legal migration, integration and the return of irregularly staying non-EU nationals. According to Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 of 16 April 2014 ( 61 ) establishing the fund: \u2018Eligible actions \u2026 should, in particular, ensure that special attention is paid to, and a dedicated response is provided for, the specific situation of vulnerable persons, in particular women, unaccompanied minors and other minors at risk\u2019 and \u2018 \u2026 the fund should take account of the mainstreaming of equality between women and men and anti-discrimination principles\u2019. In addition, women are among the vulnerable groups qualifying for a higher financial support in resettlement measures. In order to face the dramatic increase of refugee and migration inflows, special instruments provided for in the MFF Regulation (such as the flexibility instrument and the emergency aid reserve) have been mobilised in the last two years to top up the AMIF funds. In addition, a number of European trust funds and a facility for refugees in Turkey (with a budget of EUR 3 billion for 2016 and 2017) have been established outside the EU MFF. These funds are very difficult to monitor, especially from a gender perspective. The programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (COSME) has a total amount of almost EUR 2.3 billion (current prices). COSME is meant to improve access to finance for SMEs through two financial instruments that have been available since August 2014 to facilitate access to loans and equity finance for SMEs where market gaps have been identified: the Loan Guarantee Facility, and the Equity Facility for Growth. The overall COSME budget of over EUR 1.3 billion is expected to mobilise up to EUR 25 billion from financial intermediaries via leverage effects. The financial instruments are managed by the European Investment Fund in cooperation with financial intermediaries in EU countries. The Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan is the policy framework for COSME and among its main areas of action is the provision of role models and outreach to specific groups , such as young people, women and senior entrepreneurs. An example of action already supported by COSME is the European Network of Mentors for Women Entrepreneurs ( 62 ) providing advice and support to women entrepreneurs in the start-up, running and growth of businesses; the creation of a European E-Platform for Women Entrepreneurship in October 2016; the European Network of Business Angels for Women Entrepreneurs is also to be created in 2016.

An assessment of the ERASMUS mobility programme in 2011-12 ( 64 ) shows that 61 % of ERASMUS students are female, which is a share 1.13 times higher than the fraction of female students attending tertiary education in the ERASMUS countries. The over-representation of female students is systematic across subject areas and countries. Women also represented 51 % of those involved in the staff mobility programme in 2012-2013 ( 65 ). The European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) , adopted in June 2015, is meant to mobilise EUR 315 billion in new investment in the real economy over the following three years (2015-2017). It will support strategic investments in key areas such as infrastructure, education, research and innovation, as well as risk finance for small businesses. To establish the EU Guarantee Fund, a gradual contribution from the EU budget has been envisaged reaching EUR 8 billion by 2020, constituted partly by the MFF unallocated margins (EUR 3 billion) and the rest by redeployments from existing programmes, namely Horizon 2020 and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). According to the Commission midterm review of the MFF 2014-2020, around 300 projects had been approved in 26 EU Member States by July 2016. These projects are expected to support some 200,000 SMEs and to mobilise EUR 115.7 billion in total investment, representing more than one-third of the overall objective. The gender equality horizontal principle is included in the statute of the EFSI and the investment areas can have significant gender equality effects if gender issues are considered in the projects\u2019 planning and implementation. However, there is no indication of the gender composition of supported entrepreneurs and of the potential gender impact of supported projects. The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) with a total allocation of EUR 21.9 billion (2013 prices) supports the development of high-performing, sustainable and efficiently interconnected trans-European networks in energy, telecommunications and transport. The CEF will allow the construction of projects that would not be taken up by the market otherwise.

Introduction Childcare has moved up on EU priorities since the EC 2013 Recommendation Investing in Children \u2013 breaking the cycle of disadvantage ( 66 ), which proposed a long-term social strategy to support children and to help mitigate the effects of the current economic crisis. There are three key pillars to this recommendation ( 67 ): 1. access to suitable resources; 2. access to affordable quality services; 3. children\u2019s right to participate. Quality childcare and early childhood education is not only considered as a tool for the work \u2013 life balance, but also as a way to tackle child poverty and social exclusion. According to recent socioeconomic research, social investment in individual capacities during the early years is particularly beneficial for children from a disadvantaged background, breaking the intergenerational transmission of poverty and providing large social returns. The availability of affordable, quality childcare is also important to support the labour market participation of women (and men) with children and, together with the sharing of family responsibilities, is a prerequisite for the advancement of women\u2019s careers and their ability to engage in decision- making roles. In 2002, the Barcelona European Council set objectives in this area, stating that: \u2018Member States should remove disincentives to female labour force participation, taking into account the demand for childcare facilities and in line with national patterns of provision, to provide childcare by 2010 to at least 90 % of children between 3 years old and the mandatory school age and at least 33 % of children under 3 years of age \u2019 ( 68 ). Although some progress has been made since 2002, and despite the commitment of the Member States under two successive European pacts for equality between women and men, the provision of childcare facilities at European level in 2014 was still not in line with these objectives. Furthermore, the situation appeared to have been deteriorated in some Member States since the crisis. According to Eurostat data for 2014 ( 69 ), only nine Member States have met the Barcelona targets for children up to the age of three (BE, DK, F, LU, NL, PT, SL, ES and SE). Nine Member States reached the target for children from age three to mandatory school age are in childcare (BE, DK, EE, F, IT, MT, SL, ES and SE). For the six considered countries, the same Eurostat data on the achievement of the Barcelona targets on children cared for in formal childcare show that in 2014 only Sweden with 57 66 European Commission (2013), Investing in children: breaking the cycle of disadvantage, Communication from the Commission, Brussels, 20.02.2013, COM (2013) 778 final. 67 European Commission (2013), Barcelona objectives: The development of childcare facilities for young children in Europe with a view to sustainable and inclusive growth , Report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/documents/130531_barcelona_en.pdf 68 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/documents/130531_barcelona_en.pdf 69 Eurostat 2016, Formal childcare by age group and duration \u2013 % over the population of each age group, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&plugin=1&pcode=tps00185&language=en ",
        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 37 % had achieved and surpassed the Barcelona objective of at least 33 % of children under 3 years of age cared for. The UK , Germany and Italy with a coverage rate respectively of 29 %, 28 % and 23 % were relatively close, but presented wide differences between urban and rural areas and/or between regions. The coverage rate was much lower in Croatia (17 %), and especially in Poland (6 %) . As for children between the age of 3 and compulsory school age ( 70 ), the Barcelona target of 90 % cared for in formal childcare was reached in Sweden (95 %) and Italy (91 %). Germany was close at 89 %, followed by the UK with 70 %. Again Croatia (40 %) and Poland (43 %) were lagging behind) . 3.2. The use of ESI funds for childcare as part of the work \u2013 life balance policy in the six considered countries An assessment was conducted in 2016 by RAND on ESF support to childcare ( 71 ) based on the brief descriptions of Operational Programmes available on the ESF website. In the 2014- 2020 programming period 11 Member States (BE, BG, CZ, EE, DE, EL, HU, IT, PL, PT and SK) provide ESF support for childcare provisions under the thematic objective of social inclusion (TO9). In order to assess whether ESI funds have been considered to support childcare in the 2014- 2020 programming period in the six considered countries, a desk analysis of the 2014-2020 national and regional Operational Programmes was carried out ( 72 ). The unavailability of the Annual Implementation Reports before the closing of this report did not allow us to assess to what extent the planned actions were implemented so far. The table below summarises the results of the assessment, while additional information is provided in the following sections for each of the selected countries. 70 Compulsory school age is 4, 5, 6 or 7 depending on the Member State. 71 Rand Europe (2016), The role of the European Social Fund in supporting childcare provision in the European Union . http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1300/RR1364/RAND_RR1364.pdf 72 The analysis of the OPs was based on the synthesis provided in the EU web site http://ec.europa.eu/contracts_grants/funds_en.htm and on additional reports and documentation available in English, Italian, German and Polish.

        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 38 Country Provisions for childcare in national strategies Provisions in the OPs 2014-2020 Croatia \uf0b7 From 1997, significant efforts have been made for the promotion of gender equality with specific national policies, however the protection and promotion of gender equality still needs to be strengthened by also creating equal opportunities in the labour market. \uf0b7 The reconciliation of private and professional life for women is particularly difficult due to cultural bias: care responsibilities are considered as exclusively women\u2019s tasks, while job and career are higher on the list of priorities for men than for women. \uf0b7 In Croatia the highest poverty rates affect single women households, single parents and families with children and low work intensity. Currently in Croatia early childhood care does not ensure universal access to all families needing such services and it does not support employment of parents. Ensuring equal access to public services and to early childhood services can reduce poverty and social exclusion. \uf0b7 The National Strategy for the Rights of the Child in the Republic of Croatia for the period from 2014 to 2020 points to \u2018Improving the System and the Provision of Child-Friendly Services\u2019 among its strategic areas. Another strategic priority is to deinstitutionalise and transform social welfare providers. \uf0b7 Several investments in preschool care and education services are implemented outside the ESF by the State at the national and local level (state kindergartens) or by religious communities (kindergartens of religious communities) and by other Croatian legal and natural persons (private kindergartens). \uf0b7 The ESF Operational Programme Efficient Human Resources 2014-2020 (OPEHR) activates EUR 1.849 billion overall, of which EUR 1 582 billion is from the EU budget including EUR 66 million from the Youth Employment Initiative. Early childcare community-based social services previously financed under IPA are to be further supported by the ESF, with the aim to develop non-institutional forms of care (e.g. day-care centres and other facilities for children and other disadvantaged people) and to enhance access to affordable, sustainable and high-quality social services for vulnerable groups. \uf0b7 Under TO8 \u2013 Promoting sustainable and quality employment and supporting labour mobility, OPEHR includes women among the target groups with reference to training, retraining, traineeships and focuses on promotion and support of women\u2019s self-employment for reducing unemployment. \uf0b7 Childcare and early childhood services are also dealt with under TO9 \u2013 Combating poverty and social inclusion. The investment priority Improving access to high-quality social services, (Axis 2, IP 9iv) provides measures for broadening community-based services, including childcare and care for dependent family members. Investment Priority 9i) supports actions to combat all forms of discrimination and devotes special attention to increasing numbers of children attending preschool education taking into account specific regional situations and with particular focus on the Roma minority and children with a disability. \uf0b7 TO10 Education and lifelong learning (IP 10iii) underlines the large regional differences in coverage and quality of preschool programmes. Planned initiatives will provide subsidies to support access of disadvantaged children to preschool education, and particularly for Roma children. \uf0b7 ESF actions are complemented by ERDF and EAFRD (in rural areas) investments in social infrastructure for providing community-based services (e.g. day or half-day care centres). These funds can also support the infrastructural investment of other social services providers, such as CSOs. Germany \uf0b7 Improving the reconciliation between work and private life is still a challenge in Germany. \uf0b7 This policy need has been tackled by the use of both EU funding and national funding which was used to implement actions and initiatives outside the ESF at the federal level in the area of early childhood education. \uf0b7 The German Federal Operational Programme for the Implementation of the ESF in the period 2014-2020 includes reconciliation within its objectives with regard to equality of women and men. In detail, initiatives are programmed within the Thematic Objective 08 \u2013 Investment Priority 8iv \u2013 Equality between men and women in all areas, including in access to employment, career progression, reconciliation of work and private life and promotion of equal pay for equal work. \uf0b7 To achieve gender mainstreaming and enable an optimisation of programme control from a gender perspective, in March 2009, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs contracted the Agency for Gender Equality within the ESF \u2013 a support structure for achieving more gender equality as a desired outcome of the European Social Fund. The Agency offers ongoing support to ministries involved in programming and monitoring the ESF and implementation bodies advise the responsible actors on different levels of implementation of the ESF, with the goal of mainstreaming gender equality into the ESF programmes and their respective projects. \uf0b7 In addition to the ESF Federal Programme, gender equality objectives related to the balance of working and family life are considered in 10 regional OPs. Italy \uf0b7 in Italy there is a low provision of appropriate and affordable childcare and elderly care facilities and inadequate work \u2013 life balance policies (even if with great differences at regional level) and the role of structural funds on this issues is paramount. Even if gender equality is acknowledged formally in the partnership agreement and in the Operational Programmes, very few references can be found in the national Operational Programmes for both ESF and ERDF to support system actions and initiatives that might increase the reconciliation of working and family life.

        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 39 Country Provisions for childcare in national strategies Provisions in the OPs 2014-2020 The national project La Femme was financed in the programming period 2007-2013 and aimed at implementing services specifically addressed to companies. Its objective of supporting the implementation of initiatives of working time flexibility and business welfare plans is considered to be good practice, to be further implemented. In addition to the ESF National Programmes, gender equality objectives related to the balance of working and family life are also considered in the regional OPs financed through ESF and ERDF as well as in the three Multi-funds programmes. Poland \uf0b7 The main objective of the Polish family policy is to address demographic ageing and to increase the fertility rate through a set of measures that spread from financial support for families with children, to the provision of social services. Affordable childcare for families with low or medium incomes and the creation of childcare centres and kindergartens are planned. \uf0b7 The number of childcare services rapidly increased from 571 in 2011, to 2 910 in 2015; incentives were introduced to legalise the employment of nannies (through state contributions to social and health insurance); a national programme (\u2018Maluch\u2019) was implemented and an additional 9 000 childcare places were created. From 2015, the programme was expanded by additional funds for the creation of around 1 436 childcare places at universities; since September 2013, the government has reduced the cost of kindergarten for families. \uf0b7 In 2015-2016 new parental and family benefits were introduced, together with a mechanism to extend eligibility for the benefit. In January 2016, the parental leave system was made more flexible and paternal leave was introduced entitling fathers to two weeks leave over two years. \uf0b7 On May 2014 activation benefits and telework grants were introduced for the unemployed re-entering the labour market after taking care of a dependent person. Poland will receive EUR 86 billion from ESI funds over the period 2014-2020 and is the largest beneficiary of the Cohesion policy (ERDF, ESF, Cohesion Fund) to be invested on the basis of 24 national and regional programmes. Investments are aimed at addressing main development gaps and strengthening social, economic and territorial cohesion. ESI funds will assist Poland in achieving national targets of EU2020 and its flagship initiatives. Support to childcare infrastructures (nurseries and pre-schools) is expected to create 130 000 jobs which are likely to be covered by women. Almost all the Polish regional Operational Programmes envisage the creation of childcare facilities. Sweden \uf0b7 Sweden is one of the EU\u2019s most successful countries in balancing work and family responsibilities with a background of policy measures, initiatives and funding. Gender mainstreaming has been the guiding principle for achieving gender equality since 1994 and is included at national level in the policy objectives. \uf0b7 With no need to finance childcare (which is generously financed by national funds), Sweden concentrated its effort in implementing gender mainstreaming as an horizontal issue instead of adapting specific objectives addressed to women and the achieving of gender equality. All ESF Sweden projects are required to take account of gender mainstreaming concerns in their activities. To this end, two structures were drawn up: the GenderCoP network, which is specifically dedicated to integrating the gender dimension into the ESF programmes, and the ESF J\u00e4mt which will provide direct support initiatives in the form of training and other specific support including a gender perspective in analysis, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 40 Country Provisions for childcare in national strategies Provisions in the OPs 2014-2020 UK \uf0b7 In recent years implementation of reforms on shared parental leave and flexible working schemes have been carried out. \uf0b7 The 2011\u20132015 programme for the Delivering Social Change framework includes strategic actions to reduce child poverty, also through providing integrated and affordable childcare and childcare cost support for low income parents. \uf0b7 The 2014-2020 UK Partnership Agreement underlines that social and childcare, will be tackled by both the ESF and ERDF, investing around EUR 11.8 billion across the UK. The ESF share of EUR 4.9 billion is funding the six operational programmes and includes EUR 206 million for the YEI ( 73 ). \uf0b7 The ESF OP for England within its priorities, focuses on disadvantaged groups in the labour market among which are the unemployed or economically inactive, especially disadvantaged groups such as people with disabilities, lone parents, older workers and ethnic minorities; women returners and other groups of women currently outside the labour market. - TO8: the programme includes actions to assist women into work through reskilling, retraining and help women returners to the labour market after caring for children and to low skilled women and/or in part-time jobs wanting to progress. - TO9: focus is on the most disadvantaged, including inactive ethnic minority women, older women and those at risk of poverty and social exclusion. It provides them with help to address barriers to work including caring responsibilities and childcare needs. - Targeted advice to women are provided under TO8 and 10 (Priority Axis 1 and 2). Providing childcare support for participants with childcare needs is considered as a target result by the programme. \uf0b7 The Scotland ESF Programme outlines the accessibility of childcare advice and childcare support for employment or entering into formal learning. Childcare and social care are considered among the main key barriers to work for people disengaged from the labour market. New services and innovative solutions for accessing childcare and social care services are supported. In addition, under TO8 and TO9 the selection criteria include the presence of a sound understanding of gender equality in removing barriers for women returners, targeting childcare provision and assisting lone parents. The Youth Employment Initiative Priority Axis also addresses childcare costs when providing training or employment services. \uf0b7 ESF East Wales programme in TO9 considers care needs among the barriers to sustained employment and supports innovative actions to improve the availability of affordable and quality childcare. TO8 invests in actions to support more flexible working practices and childcare, and targets employers to raise their awareness of gender disadvantage in the workforce and to develop diversity policies. \uf0b7 The ESF West Wales and the Valleys programme specifically sets among its objectives to reduce inequalities in the labour market among women and recognised equality groups (4 Objective) . Under the Priority Axis 1 \u2013 Tackling Poverty through Sustainable Employment (TO 9: Promoting Social Inclusion, Combating Poverty and any Discrimination) specific actions targeted at people at risk of slipping out of employment as also for caring or childcare responsibilities are provided. The Priority Axis 2 - Skills for Growth (TO10: Investing in Education, Training and Vocational Training for Skills and Lifelong Learning and TO8: Promoting sustainable and quality employment and supporting labour mobility) has been developed in line with two objectives including the objective 4 \u2013 \u2018to reduce inequalities in the labour market among women and recognised equality groups\u2019 as well. Under this objective, there is a specific focus on improving the position of women in the workforce throughout actions facilitating the provision of more flexible working practices which can assist women to progress their career while recognising care or childcare responsibilities. Actions also raise the awareness of employers of gender disadvantage in the workforce and they support the development of diversity policies to overcome discrimination regarding pregnancy and maternity or to meet the need for childcare . \uf0b7 The ESF Northern Ireland programme supports specific activities targeting women and lone parents, as well as parents of children with disabilities participating in the Community Family Support Programme (under TO9). 73 See: http://ec.europa.eu/esf/main.jsp?catId=381 ",

        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 42 3.2.1. Croatia Gender equality is among the highest values of the constitutional order of Croatia (Art. 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia). The 2008 Law on Gender Equality sets out the basis for the protection and promotion of gender equality. It defines and regulates protection from gender-based discrimination and it lays down the preconditions necessary to create equal opportunities for men and women. From 1997, through four documents of the National Policy for the Promotion of Gender Equality, women\u2019s rights in all spheres of activities (political, social, economic, cultural and public life) are promoted. Three crucial areas in which women need to be guaranteed the full enforcement of their rights were identified: family, working environment and society. According to the European Parliament (2013) ( 74 ), significant efforts have been made in the promotion of gender equality through national policies, but the system of protection and promotion of gender equality still needs to be strengthened. Improvements are needed in the promotion and protection of human rights of women by creating equal opportunities in the labour market, introducing gender-sensitive education and balancing the participation of women and men in the decision-making processes. Institutional mechanisms and methods for implementation of the equal opportunities policy also require further strengthening. As for reconciliation of private and professional life, women in Croatia have difficulties in reconciling their professional and private lives as it is generally considered that childcare, elderly care and housework are exclusively women\u2019s tasks, while job and career are higher on the list of priorities for men than for women (European Parliament, 2013). Raising awareness actions on the family responsibilities shared between women and men combined with measures such as flexible working hours and parental leave can make it easier for women to balance professional and family life. Particularly strategic is reinforcing infrastructure, such as nurseries and kindergartens. In this sense, the National Strategy for the Rights of the Child in the Republic of Croatia for the period from 2014 to 2020 points to \u2018improving the system and the provision of child-friendly services\u2019 among its strategic areas. Extra-institutional forms of support for families is given by the act on nannies that regulates the performance of activities of nannies and also allows women co-funding local and regional self-government in the development of this type of service. In this way, parents opting for this type of childcare can hire a professional who takes care of children and whose work is supervised ( 75 ). In addition, with the aim of providing services to children in line with their needs, one of the strategic priorities of the Government of the Republic of Croatia over the recent years was to deinstitutionalise and transform social welfare providers . The work \u2013 life balance and childcare issues are also considered within the 2014-2020 programming period especially through ESF investments which in Croatia are being made available through the ESF Operational Programme Efficient Human Resources 2014-2020 (OPEHR). This programme contributes to the creation of jobs and strengthens social cohesion in Croatia, focusing on the improvement of the socioeconomic conditions and devoting special attention to the people at risk of poverty and social exclusion. 74 European Parliament (2013), The policy on gender equality in Croatia , Update 2013, Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs European Parliament, 2013. see: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/note/join/2013/493016/IPOL-FEMM_NT(2013)493016_EN.pdf 75 See: http://europa.eu/epic/countries/croatia/index_en.htm ",

Its investments covers four main areas ( 76 ) among which are the following aims: \uf0b7 to support access to sustainable and quality employment for job seekers and inactive persons; \uf0b7 to support the provision of high-quality social services adapted to the specific needs of targeted population and areas ( Community-based services targeting children, persons with disabilities and youth without suitable parental care will be developed) to tackle the high risk of poverty and social exclusion rate in the country. This Operational Programme formulates clear objectives on the equality of women and men by including women among the target groups of its actions in the Priority Axis 1 High employment and labour mobility (TO8 \u2013 Promoting sustainable and quality employment and supporting labour mobility). The most significant allocation provided for in this priority axis was the general objective of the OPEHR, aiming at increasing employment and employability. In more detail: \uf0b7 Under 8i \u2013 Access to employment for job seekers and inactive people, including the long-term unemployed and people far from the labour market, also through local employment initiatives and support for labour mobility, ESF Investments provide training, retraining and traineeships for the disadvantaged groups, in line with real LM needs aiming at increasing employability and relevant skills attainment and include women as specific target together with long-term unemployed, low skilled workers and older workers. The programme also focuses on the promotion and support of self- employment among women, considering family or personal responsibilities among the main reason for inactivity among women , while for men is education. \uf0b7 Under 8viii \u2013 Modernisation of labour market institutions, such as public and private employment services, and improving the matching of labour market needs, including through actions that enhance transnational labour mobility as well as through mobility schemes and better cooperation between institutions and relevant stakeholders, the implementation of micro-projects in line with strategic needs and priorities in employment and education are supported focusing on specific target groups including women recognised among the most vulnerable people on the local labour markets. Local labour markets play a crucial role in combating unemployment as well. Childcare and early childhood services are broadly dealt with under Priority Axis 2 \u2013 combating poverty and social inclusion (TO9) and Priority Axis 3 \u2013 education and lifelong learning (TO10) Priority Axes. Axis 2 underlines that Croatia has one of the highest rate of persons at risk of poverty and social exclusion in the EU. The highest rates are for single women households (42.7 %) and for single parents (40.4 %) and in families with children and low work intensity (70.6 %). Ensuring equal access to public services and to early childhood services, as well as increasing adequacy of social benefits in the social welfare system and raising 76 The other two areas are: to ensure an adequate match between the skills of the workforce with the labour market needs; to support the national reform of the public administration through better management of public finances and developing the e-administration and social dialogue.

        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 44 employability of working active population, especially for vulnerable groups, are provided among the actions for combating poverty and social exclusion. The programme underlines that the access to quality community-based social support is limited and a shift from institutional to community-based care is recommended. It also outlines that lack of services puts an additional burden on those caring for dependant members and prevents them from entering the labour market or keeping a job . Currently in Croatia early childhood care does not ensure universal access to all families needing such services and it does not support employment of parents. To respond to this need the specific objective \u2018Improving access to high-quality social services, including support to the shift from institutional to community care\u2019 (Axis 2) under Priority Investment 9iv: \u2018Enhancing access to affordable, sustainable and high-quality services, including healthcare and social services of general interest\u2019 , it provides measures for broadening the community- based services ( childcare and care for dependent family members ) also resulting in enhanced reconciliation of work and family life. Furthermore, the programme states that continuation of projects by local stakeholders providing early childcare community-based social services financed through IPA will be further supported by ESF as well as projects developed by social service providers in local communities are also supported with aim to develop non-institutional forms of care in a community (such as day-care centres and other facilities for children, persons with disabilities, elderly people) in order to enhance access to affordable, sustainable and high- quality social services for vulnerable groups. Investments in social infrastructure to support the process of deinstitutionalisation and to improve conditions for providing social services in the community have supported by ERDF and EAFRD (in rural areas) in a complementary manner . Investments cover adaptation, reconstruction, equipment of existing infrastructures of social welfare institutions in order to use them for the provision of community-based services (e.g. day or half-day care centres ) developed under ESF. In addition, where capacities of institutions are not sufficient for completion of deinstitutionalisation process, infrastructural investment of other social services providers, such as CSOs, are to be financed by the programme. Axis 2 also supports actions to combat all forms of discrimination and under 9i: \u2018 Active inclusion, including with a view to promoting equal opportunities and active participation, and improving employability\u2019 , devotes special attention to increasing the number of children attending preschool education taking into account specific regional situations and with particular focus on the Roma minority and children with a disability.

The number of kindergartens and programmes designed for preschool- age children was increased and efforts were made to adjust working hours of preschool institutions to parents\u2019 needs. However, there are large regional differences in coverage and quality of preschool programmes. ",
        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 45 The planned interventions are related to the subsidies of the cost of the involvement of children with a socio-economically disadvantaged background in preschool education. As for the need to increase the participation rate of Roma children at the level of preschool education, a targeted investment in the form of subsidising the cost of participation has been introduced. Finally, several actions and investments in preschool care and education services are implemented outside the ESF by the state at the national and local level (state kindergartens founded by the Republic of Croatia and by the local government) or by religious communities (kindergartens of religious communities) and by other Croatian legal and natural persons (private kindergartens). They are organised in nursery and kindergarten groups at preschool and kindergarten facilities and are provided for children from age six months to primary school age ( 77 ). Box 3.1 illustrates two interesting projects on childcare and the work \u2013 life balance funded respectively as part of the 2014-2020 and 2007-2013 programming cycles. BOX 3.1: Examples of projects funded under the 2014-2020 and 2007-2013 programming cycles Early integration project In the context of the 2014-2020 programming period, Croatia implements an EU-funded programme for children with disabilities. In the neighbourhood of Gajnice, an ESF co-funded nursery school with 90 new places for children with disabilities was recently opened. Besides providing day care, the school will also implement Croatia\u2019s \u2018Early support network programme\u2019 promoting the integration of children with disabilities into the education system. The programme is being run in partnership with the primary school Ban Josip Jela\u010di\u0107 and the City of Zagreb\u2019s Department of Education, Culture and Sports. Busy bees \u2013 Community improvement and employment ( 78 ) The Busy Bees project was carried out in 2011-2012 and funded under the 2007-2013 programming with an ESF contribution of EUR 94 551. It was established in partnership with the City of Pleternica, the Oppidum Association and the Croatian women\u2019s society. The aim is to provide childcare for working parents and jobs for individuals properly trained for this purpose in childcare and preschool education. The participants gained work experience through newly established playgroups. The project was targeted to 225 young people in the Pleternica county, mainly with secondary school or college diplomas and among these a core group of 30 individuals was selected (Grad Pleternica 2016) ( 79 ). Among its results, this programme also trained 10 unemployed young people in childcare services, and equipment was provided for two children\u2019s playrooms in two remote villages (Udruga Oppidum 2016) ( 80 ). 3.2.2. Germany In Germany, the gender equality policy is based on Article 3, Section (2) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany: \u2018Men and women shall have equal rights. The state shall promote the actual implementation of equal rights for women and men and take steps to remove disadvantages that now exist.\u2019 This formulation points to the need to take action in respect of continuing gender inequalities which were specified in the first gender equality 77 See: http://europa.eu/epic/countries/croatia/index_en.htm 78 Europe Commission, 2013, see: http://ec.europa.eu/esf/main.jsp?catId=46&langId=et&projectId=483 This project is also included in Emma Harte, Joanna Hofman, Anastasia Sikiaridi, The role of the European Social Fund in supporting the provision of childcare in the European Union, Rand Europe , 2016; See: http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1300/RR1364/RAND_RR1364.pdf 79 Grad Pleternica (2016), Busy Bees: About Project, as of 28 February 2016: http://www.pleternica.hr/busybees/about-project 80 Udruga Oppidum projects (2016), as of 28 February 2016: http://www.oppidum.hr/english ",
        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 46 report of Germany in 2011, New Pathways \u2013 Equal Opportunities Gender Equality over Women\u2019s and Men\u2019s Life Courses. This report has special significance for the gender equality policy in Germany in several respects: for the first time the guiding principle of the life course perspective is comprehensively introduced and presented as a principle for equality policy perspectives for all policy areas. Within this context, attention to work \u2013 life balance policy has been considered among the levers to contribute to creating jobs and strengthening social cohesion across Germany through the best use of Cohesion Funds. Indeed, according to the Position of the Commission Services on the development of partnership agreements and programmes in Germany for the period 2014-2020 ( 81 ) improving the reconciliation between work and private life by promoting innovative ways of work organisation and developing innovative solutions for the provision of childcare and long-term care services, is still a challenge in Germany . Thus it will be particularly important to give higher priority in CSF funding to enhance gender equality and facilitate women\u2019s reintegration into high-quality employment after career breaks due to care duties. In particular, a high priority is given to the improvement of the quality of affordable and flexible care services (such as full-time childcare and out-of-school care) and thus increase the participation in care facilities. Having started slowly, the number of child day-care facilities increased through to 2013 \u2013 particularly in western Germany \u2013 with the introduction of the legal entitlement to childcare. However, the expansion of childcare facilities in Germany carries with it additional challenges both in the quality and quantity of childcare. In particular, this includes better qualification of the care personnel, higher participation rates below the age of three, ongoing efforts with a view to disadvantaged children and the development of new concepts for the educational preschool and school phases. This is particularly true in a country like Germany where a very high percentage of part-time work for women exists with a lack of care facilities. A more gender-balanced distribution of unpaid care work is equally considered to be crucial to strengthen the measures listed above. All these aspects are considered within the 2014-2020 Programming Period especially through ESF investments which in Germany are being made available through 17 Operational Programmes, one for each of the German L\u00e4nder and one at federal level ( Bund ). The German Federal Operational programme for the implementation of the ESF in the period 2014-2020 formulates clear objectives on the equality of women and men which address: \uf0b7 the increase in employment securing a livelihood and the economic independence of women; \uf0b7 a better reconciliation of work and personal life ; \uf0b7 the removal of gender-specific stereotypes in career choice; \uf0b7 the increase in the share of women in decision-making positions. In detail, the main objectives of the German ESF Operational Programme at federal level are the promotion of employment, social inclusion and education. The programme will contribute to the following priorities: \uf0b7 Promoting social inclusion and combating poverty with a focus on the sustainable labour market integration of the long-term unemployed, the sustainable placement of migrants into employment or vocational and educational training, and improved 81 Ref. Ares(2012)1320393 - 09/11/2012 ",
        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 47 access of disadvantaged young people to employment, training and education (including through implementation of the Youth Guarantee). Approximately 73 000 long-term unemployed, 150 000 migrants and 100 000 disadvantaged young people are due to be supported through these measures. \uf0b7 Investing in education, skills and lifelong learning. Expected results include the improvement of skills and qualification levels and widening access to education systems, supporting the transition from school into employment, including through implementation of the Youth Guarantee, and strengthening the capacities of SMEs in vocational education. Approximately 100 000 young people and 71 000 employed people are due to be supported through these measures. \uf0b7 Promoting sustainable and quality employment and support labour mobility. The main target groups are small and medium-sized companies (SMEs), employed people including the self-employed, women and migrants. Expected results include improving the capacity of SMEs to adapt to demographic change, to overcome a crisis or to remain in business, better reconciliation of private and professional life and the recognition of professional qualifications obtained abroad. Approximately 260 000 SMEs, 20 000 (inactive) women and 18 000 migrants will be supported in this context. Given the need for action, several action and investment promotion programmes will be implemented outside the ESF at the federal level in the area of early childhood education. Among those are the \u2018Child day-care facilities focusing on language and schooling\u2019 federal programme, several modules of the child day-care programme of action as well as federal investment promotion programmes and funding programmes from the Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) \u2013 Germany\u2019s state-owned development bank. These national efforts are supported by the federal ESF in targeting as yet untapped workforce potential of people wishing to change careers and become an educator within the investment priority \u2018Enhancing equal access to lifelong learning for all age groups in formal, non-formal and informal settings, upgrading the knowledge, skills and competence of the workforce\u2019. In many other cases, potential for improving conditions to reconcile family and career commitments is offered in the form of organisational changes at SMEs, also with a view to facilitating a return to work after a family-related career break. This includes an increase in working hours to help safeguard the economic independence of women and men. Therefore, the ESF support also contributes to strengthening the framework within companies for workers to achieve a better work \u2013 life balance and to improve equality of opportunities on the labour market. ESF pilot measures are also to be trialled to determine how the labour market participation and working hours of women can be increased, particularly of women who are not in gainful employment or women in marginal employment, and of mothers with a migrant background. The aim is also to sensitise employers to sustainable return-to-work management policies and encourage them to offer support services so workers can avoid having to give up their job to care for a family member or so workers can increase their volume of work if family members are in need of care or long-term care. The measures are implemented in the investment priorities \u2018Equality of men and women in all areas, including in access to employment, career progression, reconciliation of work and private life (...)\u2019 and \u2018Enhancing equal access to lifelong learning for all age groups in formal, non-formal and informal settings (...)\u2019.

These objectives are said to be implemented with the support of specific actions and the gender mainstreaming strategy, and are monitored by (the ESF\u2019s own) control tools, including GB, which enables an optimisation of programme control from a gender perspective. To this end, in March 2009, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs contracted with the Agency for Gender Equality within the ESF . Box 3.2: The Agency for Gender Equality within the ESF in Germany The Agency is a support structure for achieving more gender equality as a desired outcome of the European Social Fund. The Agency, based in Berlin, offers ongoing support to ministries involved in programming and monitoring the ESF and implementation bodies. It advises the responsible actors on different levels of implementation of the ESF, with the goal of mainstreaming gender equality into the ESF programmes and their respective projects. In addition to the ESF Federal Programme, gender equality objectives related to the balance of working and family life are also considered by the following regional OPs : \uf0b7 In the ESF OP Bavaria : female job seekers are a target to support with specific regard to mothers seeking to get back to work. \uf0b7 In the ESF OP Berlin : measures for job and mobility will target women returning to work who need updated skills. In addition, a specific dedicated priority for gender equality is included. \uf0b7 In the ESF Brandenburg : the priority is to increase mobility in the labour market in particular among disadvantaged people which includes women in part-time jobs. Moreover, in families where both parents are unemployed, special assistance will be provided to improve the educational and professional opportunities available to their children. \uf0b7 In the ESF Bremen : the aim is to ease the transition to work, in particular for women and migrants. \uf0b7 In the ESF Hamburg : within the priority covering employment, the project is to help reconcile work and family life.

Italy Labour force participation and employment rates in Italy are well below EU averages and is still far from achieving the 67-69 % national target set for 2020 for the employment rate. Some vulnerable categories, namely young people but also women are affected more acutely by the inefficiencies and rigidities of the labour market. This situation reflects a number of factors, notably an education system that does not effectively respond to labour market needs and insufficient focus on appropriate active labour market and work \u2013 life balance policies. Indeed, the low provision of suitable and affordable childcare and elderly care facilities and inadequate work \u2013 life balance policies contribute to this phenomenon. However, the situation varies considerably within the country, with a particularly problematic situation in southern regions. Within this context, the role of structural funds on these issues is paramount. Through 75 national and regional programmes, Italy has been allocated EUR 42.77 Billion from ESI funds over the period 2014-2020. With a national contribution of EUR 30.96 Billion, Italy has a total budget of EUR 73.73 billion to be invested in various areas, from jobs and growth to boosting research and innovation as well as protecting the environment and increasing labour market participation. The Commission position paper on the partnership agreement states the following: \u2018The participation of women in the labour market should increase substantially. Therefore, promoting equality between men and women and reconciliation between work and private life should be a priority for CSF Funds\u2019 investments. Funds\u2019 investments should also concentrate on improving quality and access to affordable care services, such as child- and elderly care services throughout the country, including through investment in public infrastructure\u2019 Since 2012, one of the Country Specific Recommendations (no 4) is the following: \u2018Adopt the labour market reform as a priority to tackle the segmentation of the labour market and establish an integrated unemployment benefit scheme. Take further action to incentivise labour market participation of women, in particular through providing childcare and elderly care [\u2026]\u2019 Despite these statements, very few references on these issues can be found in the national Operational Programmes. The following are the national Operational Programmes that present a direct or indirect references to the issue: ",
        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 50 \uf0b7 National programme Enterprises and Competitiveness (ERDF): Within the intervention axis related to the Thematic Objective 3, references are made to support female entrepreneurship. Support could also be provided through the implementation of specific services (action 3.5.1) among which is \u2018new organisational solutions that could improve reconciliation between working and family life\u2019. The economic sectors of welfare care and services are also considered among those to be prioritised when supporting female entrepreneurship. \uf0b7 National programme Inclusion (ESF): In Axis 3, there is reference to the possibility of implementing system actions to promote awareness-raising and the increasing of knowledge of social services; in Axis 4 there is a reference to the need to integrate social services to better provide answers to women\u2019s needs. When dealing with the design of inclusion pathways for women victims of trafficking, attention should be also devoted to the implementation of system actions to support reconciliation between working and family life. Finally, reference is also made to integration between employment support actions and reconciliation actions as defined in the National Reform Plan. \uf0b7 National programme Active Policies for Employment (ESF): Priority 8iv includes reconciliation actions between working and family life among the possible actions to be implemented. As examples to be followed, references to specific projects implemented in the previous programming period are made. In particular, the La Femme project on company welfare is mentioned. In addition to this, within priority 8.24, specific measures to promote company welfare and women-friendly work organisations are mentioned together with the design of specific measures supporting women returning from maternity leave. The La Femme project was aimed at implementing services specifically addressed to companies with the objective of supporting the implementation of initiatives for working time flexibility and business welfare plans. \uf0b7 National programme School (ESF): To guarantee that gender equality is respected with regard to the equal access of both women and men to the financed interventions, conciliation services could be provided. \uf0b7 National programme Legality (ESF): A general reference is made to the promotion of reconciliation measures as stated by the National Reform Plan. \uf0b7 National programme Metro (ESF): A general reference is made to the promotion of reconciliation measures as stated by the National Reform Plan. All the other national Operational Programmes do not make any reference to the issues related to childcare provision or to reconciliation policies and measures. It is worth specifying that in the Operational Programmes where references are made (see above), these are very vague and general with no indication of the way measures could really be implemented. In addition to the ESF National Programmes, gender equality objectives related to the balance of working and family life are also considered in the regional OPs financed through ESF and ERDF as well as in the three Multi-funds programmes as shown in Box 3.3 below. Box 3.3: Examples of Multi-fund OPs addressing the work \u2013 life balance and childcare in Italy Puglia Multi-fund Programme (ESF, ERDF). This is to increase women\u2019s participation in the labour market through better access to care from public and private services. Some interventions are programmed to develop services aimed at supporting the reconciliation between working and family life. In particular, through the Thematic Objective 9 (ERDF), this has programmed EUR 340 million to reinforce and develop social and health services infrastructures (care services are among ",
        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 51 these). Additional interventions cover the issues related to working time flexibility, company welfare interventions and use of service vouchers. Specific attention to reconciliation measures is also envisaged when dealing with interventions addressed to disadvantaged people or people in a situation of social exclusion, in order to avoid multiple discriminations. Calabria Multi-fund Programme (ESF, ERDF). As above, interventions are programmed to support the reconciliation between working and family life such as: service vouchers, working time flexibility and other use of organisational measures (smart working, co-working, etc.) to improve flexibility within TO8 (ESF). In particular, child and family welfare is programmed to support vulnerable families. ESF interventions are strictly linked with those financed through ERDF in Thematic Objective 9 for the development of social and health services. Molise Multi-fund Programme (ESF, ERDF). Interventions are programmed to support the reconciliation between working and family life such as: service vouchers, and working time flexibility to improve flexibility within Thematic Objective 8 (ESF). ESF interventions are strictly linked with those financed through ERDF in Thematic Objective 9 for the developing of social and health services. For ESF programmes , all the regions have programmed interventions to support the reconciliation between working and family life such as service vouchers, and working time flexibility to improve flexibility within Thematic Objective 8. The use of service vouchers is often linked with inclusion pathways as these instruments are considered to be a lever to increase support for disadvantaged individuals and families (especially in the southern regions). In many cases the ESF Programme envisages linkages with the regional ERDF programme in order to support and develop access to and the creation of care services (for example kindergarten both in companies and in the cities) or the development of existing social and care services. For ERDF programmes, very few specific references (even in Thematic Objective 9) when dealing with the development of social infrastructures are connected to the general objective of promoting a development of urban settings, instead of promoting the reconciliation of working and family life. 3.2.4. Poland The Polish law ensures equal rights for both women and men as prescribed in the Constitution, the Labour Code and the Act of 14 December 2004 on employment and combating unemployment. In order to reinforce support of women\u2019s rights, on the basis of a resolution of the Council of Ministers, the Women\u2019s Plenipotentiary Office was established on September 1986 in the Ministry of Labour. In 2002, the office became the Office of the Plenipotentiary for Equal Status of Women and Men, with a mandate to incorporate the rule of equal status for women and men into all policy fields ( 82 ). In 1997, the government adopted a first National Programme of Activities in Support of Women with the aim to remove formal and informal barriers to the social advancement of women, to support their professional and political activity and to fight against stereotypes as regards the role of women in public, professional and family life. In 2003, the government adopted the second implementation stage of this national programme. In the new version of this programme, strong emphasis was placed on the fight against unemployment, women\u2019s activation, non-standard forms of employment, 82 In 2002, the Plenipotentiary for Equal Status of Women and Men started to implement the PHARE 2002 programme Policy of Equal Treatment Women and Men, which main purpose was the strengthening of the policy of equal chances on the national and regional levels.

According to the EPIC Platform ( 84 ), currently the main objective of Polish family policy is to address demographic ageing and to increase the fertility rate through a set of measures that spread from financial support for families with children ( 85 ), to the provision of social services. In particular, the introduction of affordable childcare for families with low or medium incomes and the creation of childcare centres and kindergartens are planned. Within this framework, the number of childcare services rapidly increased from 571 in 2011 to 2 910 in 2015; incentives were introduced to legalise the employment of nannies (through state contributions to social and health insurance); a national programme called \u2018Maluch\u2019 (Toddler) ( 86 ) was implemented to encourage local governments to create cr\u00e8ches and children\u2019s clubs. As a result of the Maluch programme, an additional 9 000 childcare places were created. From 2015, the programme was expanded by additional funds allocated for the creation of around 1 436 childcare places at universities. In addition, since September 2013, the government reduced the cost of kindergarten for families. In 2015-2016 new parental benefits ( 87 ) (+500) ( 88 ), and family benefits were introduced, together with a mechanism named \u2018zlotowka za zlotowke\u2019 (\u2018penny for penny\u2019) allowing an additional 160 000 families to be eligible for the benefit. This was made possible by gradually reducing the benefit according to the family income exceeding the threshold for entitlement to family benefits. On January 2016, the parental leave system was made more flexible ( 89 ), and a paternal leave was introduced entitling a father to two weeks\u2019 leave over two years. On May 2014 activation benefits and telework grants were introduced for the unemployed re-entering the labour market after taking care of a dependant person. Turning to the ESI funds , Poland has been allocated EUR 86 billion from ESI funds over the period 2014-2020 and is the largest beneficiary of the cohesion policy (ERDF, ESF, Cohesion Fund). With a national contribution of EUR 18.8 Billion , Poland has a total budget of EUR 104.8 billion to be invested on the basis of 24 national and regional programmes ( 90 ) in various 83 See: http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/gender-equality-and-womens-rights-empowerment-poland_en 84 http://europa.eu/epic/countries/poland/index_en.htm 85 A number of tools to improve the income situation of the families have come into force (since January 2016). First, the income threshold for entitlement to family benefits is increased as well as the amount of child benefits and other allowances, the increase of tax-free amount to 8,000 PLN (around EUR 1 810), an housing programme, are planned for the families; Since January 2015 tax relief increased for the third child and for the fourth and the following child. The tax credit was also introduced for the families who, because of low income and low tax, were unable to deduct child tax relief in full. 86 Funds earmarked within the \u2018Maluch\u2019 were steadily growing in 2011-2015 from around EUR 3.4 million to EUR 34 million. In 2016, around EUR 34 million will be allocated for the programme. 87 They are provided for the person not entitled to maternity allowance, unemployed students, farmers and also those employed on the basis of civil contracts. 88 It is provided for second and consecutive children in every family as well as first child when the income threshold is met. 89 The maternity leave lasts 20 weeks and paid parental leave lasts 32 weeks (that can be divided into four parts) for a total of 52 weeks. 90 Three national OPs co-financed by ERDF (OP Smart Growth, OP Digital Poland, OP Development of Eastern Poland); one national OP co-financed by ERDF and CF (OP Infrastructure and Environment); one national OP co-financed by CF (OP Technical Assistance); one national OP Knowledge, Education and, Development co-financed by ESF; sixteen regional multi-fund OPs co-financed by ERDF and ESF; one national OP financed by the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD). Moreover, one OP for Development of Rural Areas and one OP for maritime areas will be supported from EAFRD and EMFF. Overall a larger share of allocation will be managed by regions (ca 55 % of ERDF and 66 % of ESF compared to 25 % of ERDF in 2007-13).

Significant attention is given to the territorial dimension of interventions in particular in the area of urban development and access to public services. At least 5 % of ERDF allocation will be invested in sustainable urban development actions implemented in Poland mainly through Integrated Territorial Investments in regional capital cities and their functional areas. At least 5 % of total EAFRD contribution to the rural development programme will be reserved for Leader/CLLD. Both choices could support gender equality if the needs of women in accessibility are explicitly taken into account. Investments are aimed at addressing main development gaps and thus strengthening social, economic and territorial cohesion.

One-quarter of the expected change is to be delivered by the ESI funds. \uf0b7 Similarly the ESIF contribution to the achievement of the target of the Digital Agenda (100 % broadband access) has been assessed at 25 %. \uf0b7 In relation to energy objectives, ESI funds provide for more than one-third of investment needed to achieve a renewable energy share of 15 %. \uf0b7 The Funds will also contribute to increased employment rates, reduced poverty and improved adaptation of education to labour market needs. \uf0b7 Increased transport accessibility. \uf0b7 The funds aim to improve the Polish business environment by reducing the administrative burden for businesses. \uf0b7 Support to childcare infrastructures (nurseries and pre-schools) is expected to create 130 000 jobs which are likely to be covered by women . The 2014-2020 financial framework is implemented in Poland through six national Operational Programmes managed by the Ministry of Development (Infrastructures and Environment, Smart Growth, Knowledge Education Development, Digital Poland, Eastern Poland, Technical Assistance) and 16 Regional Operational Programmes (ROPs) managed by local government institutions (voivodeship boards). Each of the programmes takes into consideration the gender equality principle as a horizontal issue. The horizontal approach to this principle is based mainly on activity planning, in particular thematic objectives, e.g. ensuring equal access to quality elementary, primary and secondary education; improving women\u2019s access to digital services; taking women\u2019s needs into consideration while introducing low-emission economy. Moreover, the gender equality principle is implemented at each stage of programme implementation (gender mainstreaming). In the process of project selection a set of evaluation criteria is applied. The criteria include a checklist to confirm whether the gender equality principle was applied, for example at the stage of diagnosis, actions, results or project management. The monitoring, evaluation and control process is used to verify the application of the principle during the project implementation. At the stage of monitoring and reporting, all indicators of project/programme development on the number of people involved, are collected for women and men separately. The interim evaluation is planned, so that managing authorities could assess the effectiveness of the implementation of gender equality principle in the first years of programme duration. ",

Box 3.4: The Polish National Operational Programme Knowledge Education Development 2014-2020 (POWER) According to POWER, the key gender equality factors are: - Creating the appropriate living environment that helps women reconcile their work with family life as a necessary condition (prerequisite) for increasing labour activity levels \u2013 particularly among women; - Ensuring proper conditions and legal environment for improved access to quality care for children and the vulnerable; - Counteracting gender-related stereotypes; - Enhancing financial independence and entrepreneurship among women; - Increasing awareness of equal opportunities for men and women; - Building and expanding systemic solutions for assessment of how public policies can effectively enhance equal opportunities for men and women. Two types of actions aiming at achieving the above-mentioned goals are undertaken based on POWER \u2013 specific actions to ensure equal opportunities and taking the perspective of equal opportunities into consideration across the board in all the interventions of the European Social Fund (horizontal principle). Examples of specific actions described in POWER include interventions based on the investment priorities 8.8 and 9.3 aiming at support for work \u2013 life balance and countering discrimination based on the grounds of different factors including sex. The planned support is to be targeted towards, inter alia, creating systemic solutions in the form of programmes countering discrimination in the workplace including monitoring of gender pay gap, models of ensuring proper work \u2013 life balance or increasing awareness of various forms of discrimination in the labour market, or promoting full and equal access to the labour market. As for the Polish ROPs , all envisage the creation of childcare facilities ( 91 ): in each of them, the goal is to increase access to childcare services. Additionally, in line with the horizontal principle, each of the programmes takes into consideration the need for enhancing the situation of women in other areas. \uf0b7 The Podlaskie Operational Programme aims to improve access to high-quality preschool education for children of 3 \u2013 4 years of age. The share of children attending pre-schools will be increased from 56 % to 74 %. Available capacity in the childcare and education facilities will be increased by 40 000. The programme also aims at increasing the percentage of employed women. \uf0b7 The K\u00f3dzkie Operational Programme also aims to extend the capacity of supported childcare or education infrastructure (RAND, 2016) ( 92 ). It is expected to open eight kindergartens and invest into 952 places. Also, a number of actions are to be taken in order to engage women in training that corresponds with the demand of the local labour market. \uf0b7 The Dolno\u015bl\u0105skie Operational Programme (ERDF/ES) is expected to create around 4 700 new places in nurseries and around 3 100 places in kindergartens; moreover, initiatives for equipment, modernisation and adaptation of infrastructure required to provide such services will be carried out in the already existing institutions. 91 See http://ec.europa.eu/esf/main.jsp?catId=576&langId=en 92 Emma Harte, Joanna Hofman, Anastasia Sikiaridi, The role of the European Social Fund in supporting the provision of childcare in the European Union, Rand Europe, 2016 ",

Of these funds, EUR 1.7 billion is allocated by the ERDF OPs for healthcare infrastructures and e-health, and EUR 1.2 billion by the ESF for access to healthcare and active and healthy ageing. Although gender differences are not made explicit, these measures are likely to indirectly benefit women both as care providers and care receivers (as elderly women represent the predominant component of the elderly population). 3.3. Sweden Sweden is one of the EU\u2019s most successful countries in balancing work and family responsibilities. Indeed the country\u2019s family policy is aimed at supporting the dual- earner family model and ensuring the same rights and obligations regarding family and work for both women and men . Generous spending on family benefits , flexible leave and working hours for parents with young children and affordable, high- quality childcare are the main factors for success. The aim of the Swedish financial family policy is to contribute to improved conditions for good living standards for all families with children, increased freedom of choice and empowerment of parents, as well as to promote equality in parenthood between women and men. Public childcare is guaranteed to all parents and it operates on a whole-day basis : most childcare facilities are open from 6.30 a. m. until 18.30 p. m. Preschool is free for children aged between three and six for up to 15 hours per week. Parental fees are directly proportional to parents\u2019 income and inversely proportional to the number of children in a family. As a result, 55 % of children under three and 96 % of children between three and six are enrolled in formal childcare . These figures are well above the EU Barcelona targets for childcare provision and the EU averages of 27 % and 82 % respectively. In Sweden, gender mainstreaming has been the guiding principle for achieving gender equality since 1994. Currently, at the national level, policy goals set out for gender equality policy are to be reached through the systematic integration of a gender equality perspective with all policy areas, at all levels and stages, and by the actors involved in the policymaking processes. Gender equality is structured along an overarching Swedish national gender equality objective (\u2018Women and men shall have the same power to shape society and their own lives\u2019) and four sub-objectives: \uf0b7 equal distribution of power and influence \uf0b7 economic equality between women and men \uf0b7 equal distribution of unpaid care and household work \uf0b7 ending of men\u2019s violence against women. In addition, the official statistical office is required to present all official statistics on individuals or groups disaggregated by gender. Achieving the above gender policy objectives plays an increasingly important role since the European Commission recognised that gender equality policies are vital for economic growth, prosperity and competitiveness. In the previous programming period, specific attention to gender equality in the use of ESF funds has been granted by the implementation of the GenderCoP network , which is also specifically dedicated to integrating the gender dimension into the ESF programmes in the 2014-2020 programming period. Since 2010 GenderCoP has worked towards the goal of gender mainstreaming as an integral part of ESF management \u2013 from planning, programming and implementing to monitoring and evaluation. The network is led by the Swedish ESF ",
        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 57 managing authority and includes within its members ESF managing authorities/intermediary bodies from 13 Member States: Austria, Belgium (Flemish and Walloon regions), the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Spain. At the same time, a national project, ESF J\u00e4mt , was financed to provide free support for ESF Sweden projects engaged in gender equality activities. The support was in the form of gender training, counselling and providing methods to make it possible to map and transform an organisation by means of a gender equality perspective. The point of departure has been the national gender equality policy objectives and gender mainstreaming as a strategy. Instead of adapting specific objectives addressed to women and the achieving of gender equality, all ESF Sweden projects are required to take account of gender mainstreaming concerns in their activities . In order to achieve maximum outreach, ESF J\u00e4mt services have been provided via eight project supporters based at the eight locations in Sweden that have a regional office. ESF J\u00e4mt has employed gender equality policy objectives as a platform in its efforts to explain what is involved and to motivate people to engage in active gender equality initiatives within ESF Sweden projects. ESF J\u00e4mt participated from the start in The European Community of Practice on Gender Mainstreaming (GenderCop) for European Social Fund programmes, which produced a minimum standard for gender equality in relation to the EU-2020 targets. Box 3.5: ESF J\u00e4mt concrete results During the 2007 \u2013 2013 programming period, the Swedish Managing Authority financed the project ESF J\u00e4mt whose purpose was to assist other ESF-funded projects with implementing gender equality. Between 2009 and 2012 eight project supporters and a national coordinator worked in ESF J\u00e4mt to make gender equality a central feature of selected European Social Fund projects and projects applying for funds. The methods used by the project supporters include: - initial talks and an introduction to gender equality; - concrete advice and ideas on how to integrate a gender equality perspective into the projects; - basic training and workshops in gender equality and gender mainstreaming. More than 2 000 different ESF projects have received individual guidance by ESF J\u00e4mt; nearly 900 courses have been taught and around 4 000 men and 9 000 women participated in its activities. Source: A journey into gender equality in Sweden In the 2014-2020 programming period, the support provided by the four ESIF in Sweden is distributed via 27 programmes. In the period 2014\u20132020, ESF will invest around SEK 6 billion in Sweden. This will be matched by equal national co-financing, which may come from both public and private sources. The programme is being implemented in eight geographical regions, plus one at the national level. The same applies for ERDF with an investment of around SEK 1.7 billion in Upper Norrland, Sweden. This will be matched by equal national co- financing. With no need to finance childcare (which is generously financed by national funds), Sweden is dedicating a major part of ESF funding to boosting the labour force, in particular helping young people and those with a migrant background, especially women . In the application of equality between women and men as a horizontal principle, the 2014- 2020 programming period will contribute to creating conditions for sustainable work for both men and women. A gender perspective is integrated into programme through the selection of priorities and guiding criteria for selection . In efforts to strengthen the individual\u2019s position in the labour market analysis, both women\u2019s and men\u2019s skills are utilised and developed in the projects. In the analysis, planning and implementation of projects it ",
        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 58 will be ensured that both women and men must have access to interventions based on their individual abilities to increase their job chances. To this end, the Social Fund aims to promote gender equality on the basis of the programme\u2019s objectives, target groups and priorities through the following. \uf0b7 The project has gender expertise internally or through external support. \uf0b7 A gender analysis is included in the project\u2019s problem analysis. \uf0b7 Activities of the project take into account the gender perspective according to the analysis. \uf0b7 A gender perspective is included in the evaluation of the project. Over 70 % of the ESF and YEI allocation will be invested in labour integration of people at the margins of the labour market. Labour integration pathways, (re)training, and individual coaching will be the most prominent tools used. The actions funded through the ESF are complementary to the relevant national policy instruments; 20 % of the ESF allocation is used to support activities within the thematic objective \u2018Promoting social inclusion and combating poverty\u2019, namely through active inclusion measures to improve employability of the most vulnerable groups. The remainder of the ESF investments will go to enterprises and employees to create conditions that enable workers to stay in current or new employment longer, mainly through measures for lifelong learning. Most of the ESF allocation, and the specific YEI allocation, will be handled in one single national OP that comprises EUR 810 million of EU support. Under the single national OP there will be eight regional action plans, which will ensure that the ESF-supported measures and the YEI-supported measures will be fully adapted to the regional specifics. It will also help ensure the coordination with ERDF-supported measures in the regions. The ESF national programme will support projects that streamline programme implementation. This refers, for example, to projects that contribute to increased knowledge and effective methods, which link to the horizontal principle of equality between women and men . The Swedish ESF Council is responsible for the facilitation and streamlining of the implementation of gender mainstreaming in the programme and project implementation. This should be achieved through the minimum standards for gender mainstreaming developed at EU level by the GenderCoP network. The support structure is still the ESF J\u00e4mt which will provide direct support interventions in the form of training and other specific support by including a gender perspective in analysis implementation, monitoring and evaluation. 3.4. The United Kingdom Over recent years, reforms on shared parental leave and flexible working schemes have been carried out. In June 2014, all workers gained the right to request flexible working. The 2011\u20132015 programme for Government oversees the Delivering Social Change framework, including strategic actions to reduce child poverty among which is the implementation of a strategy for integrated and affordable childcare. The government has also introduced measures to support families with low incomes including childcare cost support as it is essential to improving children\u2019s life chances and supporting parents who want to return to work. In addition, the CSR on affordability of childcare is addressed by plans to help families meet the costs of childcare and to increase the affordable provision. ",
        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 59 In line with the UK\u2019s commitment to tackling poverty and welfare dependency through work, the ESF focuses on disadvantaged groups, including women needing childcare provision ( 93 ). As part of the 2014-2020 programming cycle, the UK Partnership Agreement underlines the need to form a coherent package of support at an individual, family and community level and that issues such as social and childcare , financial inclusion and employment will be tackled by the ESF and ERDF. According to the UK Partnership Agreement, work \u2013 life balance and childcare issues are thus considered within the 2014-2020 programming period especially through ESF investments. In the UK these are being made available through six ESF Operational Programmes in England, West Wales and the Valleys, East Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar. Overall, the ESF and European Regional Development Fund are investing around EUR 11.8 billion across the UK. The ESF share of EUR 4.9 billion is funding the six Operational Programmes and includes EUR 206 million for the YEI ( 94 ). Details of the ESF Operational Programmes are as follows: - The European Social Fund Operational Programme for England has been developed around three interrelated priority axes ( 95 ). Within these priorities, the programme focuses on disadvantage groups in the labour market among which are: o people who are unemployed or economically inactive, especially disadvantaged groups such as people with disabilities, lone parents, older workers and ethnic minorities; o women returners and other groups of women currently outside the labour market. In general, under Thematic Objective 8 \u2013 Employment, the programme finances projects to increase employment levels facing obstacles to getting a job. Actions to get women into work include reskilling, retraining and help to women returners to the labour market and to women in low skilled and/or part-time work who want to progress. Under Thematic Objective 9 the programme has a stronger focus on the most disadvantaged people tackling multiple and complex barriers to work, among which are economically inactive people, inactive women from ethnic minorities, elder women and those at risk of poverty and social exclusion. It provides them with help to address barriers to work including caring responsibilities and childcare needs . In more detail, Axis 1 \u2013 Inclusive labour markets brings together ESF investment priorities from thematic objectives 8 (employment) and 9 (social inclusion). It includes the Investment Priority 1.1 access to employment for jobseekers and inactive people that helps those who are disadvantaged but still relatively close to the labour market to tackle their barriers to work and sustain employment. Under this investment priority, the Specific Objective (1.1.5) \u2013 to provide support for women at disadvantage in the labour market, and particularly those who are currently inactive, to contribute to our efforts to reduce the gender employment gap, provides some activities targeted 93 See: http://ec.europa.eu/esf/main.jsp?catId=381 94 See: http://ec.europa.eu/esf/main.jsp?catId=381 95 Inclusive Labour Markets, which combines activities to address employment and social inclusion issues; Skills for Growth; Technical Assistance.

        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 60 at women in order to increase their participation, especially in occupations or sectors where they are under-represented. Support to women who meet barriers to entering the labour market (including caring responsibilities ) is provided. Participants in the actions can include women wishing to return to work after caring for children , inactive lone parents (most of whom are female) or older unemployed women. The main result the programme intends to achieve is that the participants will be in sustainable employment (including self-employment) or engaged in active job search on leaving. Under the Investment Priorities 1.2 Sustainable integration of young people and 1.3 Youth employment initiative, additional support is also provided to help young lone parents to move into sustainable employment (including self-employment) and to overcome the barriers they face in participating in the labour market, including assistance with childcare . Investment Priority 1.4 Active inclusion helps people who are more distant from the labour market and tackle multiple and complex barriers to work. It promotes equal opportunities and combats discrimination in the labour market. This investment priority includes support for economically inactive women from ethnic minorities, including those with child or elder care responsibilities and who often face multiple disadvantages. With reference both to the Priority Axis 1 \u2013 Inclusive labour markets (Investment Priority: 8ii - Sustainable integration into the labour market of young people (ESF) in particular those not in employment, education or training, including young people at risk of social exclusion and young people from marginalised communities, including through the implementation of the Youth Guarantee) Priority Axis 2 \u2013 Skills for growth (Investment Priority \u2013 10iii \u2013 Enhancing equal access to lifelong learning for all age groups in formal, non-formal and informal settings, upgrading the knowledge, skills and competence of the workforce, and promoting flexible learning pathways including through career guidance and validation of acquired competence) targeted advice to women to help them make important career choices is provided. These actions can be useful to face the work \u2013 life balance theme. Finally, a contribution to childcare costs is provided by the programme since availability of childcare can affect an individual\u2019s ability to participate in ESF provision. This provision is reflected in specific objectives and targets in the appropriate investment priorities. - Scotland\u2019s ESF Operational Programme has been developed around four interrelated priority axes ( 96 ).The analysis of need for the Scotland ESF programme in respect of high-quality employment and labour mobility has outlined challenges around rising long-term unemployment and youth unemployment, demographic trends and the participation of women in the workforce. For this reason this programme considers some targeted action on childcare and lone parents which may contribute to greater equality in the workplace.

Priority Axis 2 \u2013 Promoting social inclusion, combating poverty and any discrimination, Investment Priority 9i \u2013 Active inclusion, including with a view to promoting equal opportunities and active participation, and improving employability, recognises that some people, mainly those that have disengaged from the labour market due to complex and multiple factors require longer-term and more intensive support (e.g. workless households, lone parent households and other disadvantaged people). In this case as well, childcare and social care are considered among the main key barriers to work and for this reason new services and innovative solutions for accessing to childcare and social care services are to be supported . In addition, under Axis 1 (PI 8i) and Axis 2 (PI 9i and 9v) ( 97 ) operations to be financed have to demonstrate a sound understanding of gender equality in removing barriers for women returners, targeting childcare provision and assisting lone parents . Finally, the Youth employment initiative priority axis (Priority Investment 8ii) ( 98 ) also gives attention to childcare specifying that where required by the individual\u2019s circumstances, barriers which directly enable the carrying out of activities including childcare costs have to be removed , where these are directly linked to the offer of training or employment. - East Wales ESF Programme has been developed around three interrelated priority axes ( 99 ). Gender inequalities exist in Wales with women more likely to be underemployed, working part-time and earning less than men. Axis 1 - Tackling poverty through sustainable employment , aims to support efforts to tackle poverty and social exclusion in East Wales. This is performed by supporting key target groups to increase employability and achieve sustained employment. Under Investment Priority 9i \u2013 Active inclusion, including with a view to promoting equal opportunities, active participation and improving employability, the actions that support individuals to address the multiple and complex barriers can be funded, including care and childcare to achieving sustained employment. In this context innovative actions linked to improving the availability of affordable quality childcare are provided. 97 Promoting social entrepreneurship and vocational integration in social enterprises and the social and solidarity economy in order to facilitate access to employment. 98 8i - Sustainable integration into the labour market of young people (YEI), in particular those not in employment, education or training, including young people at risk of social exclusion and young people from marginalised communities, including through the implementation of the Youth Guarantee. 99 Priority Axis 1: Tackling Poverty through Sustainable Employment is focused around TO9: Promoting Social Inclusion, Combating Poverty and any Discrimination Priority Axis 2: Skills for Growth is focused around TO10 \u2013 Investing in Education, Training and Vocational Training for Skills and Life-long Learning and it also incorporates a single complementary Investment Priority from the TO8 \u2013 Promoting Sustainable and Quality Employment and Supporting Labour Mobility. Priority Axis 3: Youth Employment is focused around TO8 \u2013 Promoting Sustainable and Quality Employment and Supporting Labour Mobility and it also incorporates a single complementary Investment Priority from TO10 \u2013 Investing in Education, Training and Vocational Training for Skills and Life-long Learning.

Objective 3 \u2013 To improve the position of women in the workforce, specifically targets employed women, complementing interventions being taken forward under Priority Axis 1 to increase the employability of those women who are economically inactive or long-term unemployed and who face complex barriers to work. This specific objective, recognising the range of factors influencing the position of women in the workforce, also targets employers to raise their awareness of gender disadvantage in the workforce and to develop diversity policies and flexible working practices. The adoption of flexible working practices is likely to be of significant benefit to women for achieving their full potential, as they may be subject to inequality of opportunity or even discrimination regarding pregnancy and maternity rights or the need to provide childcare . Finally, activities with enterprises to challenge traditional stereotypes and to raise participation levels in occupations/ sectors where a particular gender are under- represented are provided. - ESF West Wales and the Valleys programme This programme specifically sets among its objectives the aim to reduce inequalities in the labour market among women and recognised equality groups (four objectives). Under Priority Axis 1 \u2013 Tackling poverty through sustainable employment (TO9: Promoting Social Inclusion, Combating Poverty and any Discrimination) aiming to support efforts to tackle poverty and social exclusion in WWV, specific actions are provided targeted at people at risk of slipping out of employment as a result of long- term sickness absence or other barriers such as caring or childcare responsibilities . Priority Axis 2 \u2013 Skills for growth (TO10: Investing in education, training and vocational training for skills and lifelong learning, and TO8: Promoting sustainable and quality employment and supporting labour mobility) has been developed in line with the aim \u2018 To invest in skills as a driver of productivity and growth, to aid progression within employment and improve the skills mix and diversity of our workforce\u2019 with two specific objectives: o to increase skills levels of the workforce, increasing the number of people qualified to intermediate level or above, reducing the number of people with no skills or basic skills only and increasing higher level skills in research and innovation; o to reduce inequalities in the labour market among women and recognised equality groups . Under this objective, there is a specific focus on promoting gender equality in employment and improving the position of women in the workforce.

However, among the planned actions by the programme there are only detailed assessment of needs taking into account personal barriers to employment and family and social circumstances (Priority Axis 1 \u2013 Access to employment) and the possibility of undertaking engagement with parents of children with disabilities to address their specific needs for participants on the Community Family Support Programme (Priority Axis 2 \u2013 Social inclusion, Investment Priority 9i). Overall, support with childcare for programme participants is provided. - Gibraltar ESF Programme The Government of Gibraltar recognises the importance of good quality care for dependants in order to encourage women to attend courses or employment. There are 12 government and 6 privately run nurseries/preschools, which adequately covers the childcare requirements of the jurisdiction. Since 2000, the local education system provides for children to remain in school over the lunch period and this has also encouraged women to join the labour market. The Operational Programme (Priority Axis 1: Employment and education) intends to increase employability of workers and their flexibility, remove barriers to access the labour market and encourage employers to employ individuals with difficulties entering the labour market. However, no specific action is targeted to women or focuses on childcare issues in the programme. Only in the section of the programme specifically devoted to horizontal issues is it stated that consideration will also be given to training and investments which facilitate the return to the labour market of persons with children or dependent relatives .

Activities to be delivered through this project include: - supporting opportunities to identify existing skills and interests; - building confidence and effective communication skills; - developing a sense of self confidence; - provision of effective information advice and guidance to enable participants to understand and develop their future learning and work options and pathways; - supporting participants to access other services (including statutory) where these would address wider barriers to employment, thus also including childcare. The project must involve at least 1 625 people in activities to improve their work readiness, including at least 812 women (the minimum target of the project). Made to measure \u2018help for homeless families\u2019 ( 102 ) This project was carried out by Community Links in 2011-2012 and funded under the ESF Operational Programme England and Gibraltar 2007\u20132013, with a contribution of EUR 300 000. It aimed to help people overcome barriers to employment and to support homeless families in London, particularly focusing on those with out-of-work single parents (European Commission, 2013) ( 103 ). Recruitment took place in the local community by reaching out to places where jobless parents would gather (such as women\u2019s refuges and children\u2019s centres). Over 165 people enrolled in training and 25 jobs were created. The Family Links project provided tailored one-to-one support and training to guide participants into employment. The support included childcare provision if participants needed it. Overall, its success was measured by the original objectives being met midway through the project\u2019s implementation (European Commission, 2013) ( 104 ).

In particular, among barriers to pursuing the project\u2019s activities, participants identified access to childcare , finance and transport (Department for Work and Pensions 2012) ( 107 ). For these reasons, this project has integrated childcare provision and transport into its model to ease the burden and to support the educational and professional aspirations of the women and 145 women took part in the programme (European Commission 2012) ( 108 ). Results from this period show that 95 % of participants gained qualifications in literacy and numeracy, with an overall retention rate of 90 % (Department for Work and Pensions 2012) ( 109 ).

Since it was established, the number of young parents engaged in education, employment and training in Cornwall has increased from below 20 % in 2009 to 34 % in July 2012 (European Commission, 2012) ( 110 ). The establishment of a number of other branches may also demonstrate the success and impact of the project across Cornwall. In addition, the achievements of YMWA were recognised in November 2010 when they won the National ESF Equal Opportunities Mainstreaming Leader Award. As stated above, the UK Partnership Agreement states that social and childcare will be tackled by the ESF and ERDF . More details of the contribution of the ERDF Operational Programmes for the promotion of equality between men and women and especially to the strengthening of the childcare system by the Operational Programmes follow: \uf0b7 Both the West Wales/Valleys and the East Wales ERDF Operational Programmes affirm in the specific section devoted to equality between men and women that the ERDF programmes complement the ESF by supporting: - the competitiveness of the childcare sector where it meets the objectives of the related priority axis; - the creation of an environment which promotes inclusive workplaces, equality of opportunity for staff, including the reconciliation of work and private life ; - entrepreneurship and business start-up initiatives to encourage more take up from women. \uf0b7 the Gibraltar ERDF Operational Programme states that attention will also be given to opportunities for investments and training which facilitate the return to the labour market of people with children or dependent relatives .

GENDER MAINSTREAMING IN THE USE OF HORIZON 2020 FUNDS IN THE SELECTED COUNTRIES AND EXAMPLE OF GOOD PRACTICES Horizon 2020 is the EU research and innovation programme implementing the Innovation Union, an Europe 2020 flagship initiative aimed at securing Europe\u2019s global competitiveness. To this end it is structured along three main pillars: \uf0b7 excellent science to strengthen the EU\u2019s world-class scientific excellence and make the EU research and innovation system more competitive; \uf0b7 fostering industrial leadership to speed up the development of technologies that will support businesses and innovation, including for small companies; \uf0b7 tackling societal challenges to respond to the priorities identified in the Europe 2020 strategy. In addition, part of the Horizon 2020 budget goes towards funding the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, research activities carried out under the Euratom Treaty and non-nuclear research carried out by the Joint Research Centre, the European Commission\u2019s in-house science service. However, as Figure 4.1 below shows, most resources are allocated to the three pillars of the programme. Figure 4.1: Breakdown of the budget between Horizon 2020 priorities (EUR 78.6 billion, i.e. in current prices) Source: Factsheet: Horizon 2020 budget ( 111 ) There are also dedicated budgets for two horizontal programmes: \uf0b7 Spreading excellence and widening participation; \uf0b7 Science with and for society. Horizon 2020 funding is organised through multiannual WPs which cover most of the support available. The Horizon 2020 programme mainstreams gender equality and the gender dimension in research as a cross-cutting issue in each of the different parts of the Work programme in line 111 http://ec.europa.eu/research/horizon2020/pdf/press/fact_sheet_on_horizon2020_budget.pdf ",
        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 67 with the objective of promoting equality between women and men which, as enshrined in Article 3 of the TEU and Article 8 of the TFEU, is a fundamental value of the EU obliging the EU to mainstream gender equality in all of its activities. In order to ensure a more integrated approach to research and innovation, three mainstreaming objectives underpin the strategy on gender equality in Horizon 2020: \uf0b7 Fostering gender balance in research teams , in order to close the gaps in the participation of women; \uf0b7 Ensuring gender balance in decision-making , in order to reach the target of 40 % of the under-represented sex in panels and groups and of 50 % in advisory groups; \uf0b7 Integrating the gender dimension in R&I content, helps improve the scientific quality and societal relevance of the produced knowledge, technology and/or innovation. The aim of the first objective is to reach the Commission\u2019s target of 40 % of the under- represented sex in each group and panel. For the second objective, applicants for funding are encouraged to promote equal opportunities and to ensure a balanced participation of women and men at all levels in research and innovation teams and in management structures. Gender balance in teams is also to be taken into account when ranking proposals with the same evaluation scores. Finally, for research content, gender is referred to in several topics across the Horizon 2020 work programme. In addition to this, the Science with and for society work programme funds specific initiatives in support of the gender equality strategy. Support is given to research performing organisations (RPO) and research funding organisations (RFO) in order to: \uf0b7 remove barriers that generate discrimination against women in scientific careers and decision-making (supporting research organisations to implement gender equality plans); \uf0b7 integrate a gender dimension in research content. In order to better understand the way gender is being mainstreamed within the Horizon 2020 funds, the following methodology has been adopted: 1. The database of all Horizon 2020 projects funded by the Horizon priorities was searched using the key words: \u2018gender equality\u2019 and \u2018gender\u2019 in order to identify the number of projects that effectively mainstreamed gender equality within their contents; 2. The database of all Horizon 2020 projects funded by the Science with and for society work programme was searched with regard to the calls specifically dedicated to gender equality (the GERI calls). The analysis has focused on the six selected countries in order to detect differences in the access and use of funds. ",

Mainstreaming gender equality within Horizon three pillars and horizontal programmes projects As previously underlined, the Horizon funds are organised along three main pillars and two horizontal programmes. According to the Horizon database ( 112 ), a total of 10.128 projects were funded at September 2016. An initial screening of all these 10.128 projects through the use of the key words: \u2018gender\u2019 and \u2018gender equality\u2019 resulted in a total 122 projects (0.01 % of the total of the funded projects) . These 122 projects\u2019 summaries and objectives were then assessed in order to verify the reliability of the automatic search and refine the search. Not considering at this stage the GERI projects ( 113 ), only 71 projects addressing gender equality (0.007 % of the total of the funded projects) were obtained .

The majority of these projects (60 %) were financed within the priorities related to Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie actions which provide grants for all stages of researchers\u2019 careers \u2013 be they doctoral candidates or highly experienced researchers \u2013 and encourage transnational, intersectoral and interdisciplinary mobility. Within this group of projects, reference to gender equality is included according to the research topics chosen by researchers, ranging from a study on the role of women in different historical periods, to other social and economic inequalities. Box 4.1: An example of Marie Curie study addressing gender equality issues Visualising memories of violence in urban places: gender and well-being in Istanbul The study focus on the way violence in urban areas affects women of all ages, socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds in particular. The immediate and extensive costs of violence targeting women perpetuate the existing gender hierarchies by setting boundaries on women\u2019s movement, mobility, presence: that is, on their use of urban space. Another 33 % of projects are instead financed within the \u2018Societal Challenges\u2019 Pillar covering activities from research to market with a focus on innovation-related activities. The gender-related topics range from gender medicine analysis in the challenge related to health and well-being, to gender differences in job insecurity, or to the gender balance in sectors (like aquaculture) not usually considered as \u2018feminine\u2019. Box 4.2: An example of Societal Challenge study VicInAqua The project\u2019s innovative core idea is to develop and test new technologies which enable the integration of sanitation with the aquaculture in a sustainable manner. The overall concept will promote sound approaches to water management for agriculture, taking into consideration broader socioeconomic factors and also supporting job creation and greater gender balance in decision-making. Another 7 % of projects were funded through the Science and Society Pillar, which is instrumental in addressing the European societal challenges tackled by Horizon 2020, building capacities and developing innovative ways of connecting science to society. In this case, projects deal with gender aspects in higher education institutions or are meant to identify innovative approaches to release and disseminate research results.

Support to research organisations for the implementation of gender equality plans (GERI- 4-2015 and GERI-4-2014): the funded actions should provide support to RPOs, including higher education institutions, and RFOs to achieve systemic institutional changes, in particular through the implementation of gender equality plans (GEPs). GEPs should be aimed at: \uf0fc conducting impact assessment/audit of procedures and practices, including relevant data on Human Resources (HR) management, teaching and research activities, in order to identify gender biases at organisation level; \uf0fc implementing innovative strategies to address gender biases such as, inter alia, family-friendly policies (e.g. work schedule\u2019s flexibility; parental leave; mobility, dual- career couples); gender planning and budgeting; training on gender equality in HR management; \uf0fc developing the gender dimension in research content and programmes; \uf0fc integrating gender studies in Higher Education Institution curricula; \uf0fc setting targets and monitoring progress via indicators at organisation level. Box 4.4: Support to research organisations to implement GEPs (GERI-4-2015 and GERI-4-2014) funded projects The six funded projects ( Baltic Gender , EQUAL-IST , SAGE , LIBRA , GENERA , and PLOTINA ) have similar objectives and steps. Generally speaking they are aimed at i) Stimulating a gender- aware culture change; ii) Promoting career development of both female and male researchers to prevent the waste of talent, particularly for women; iii) Ensuring diversification of views and methodologies (in this case by taking into account the gender/sex dimension and analysis) in research and teaching. The work plan usually proceeds in three overall stages: i) Assess the current situation in all partner RPOs; ii) Design GEPs for each RPO; iii) Design, implement and evaluate actions in the partner RPOs to address the targets of the GEPs. 2.

Box 4.5: Evaluation of initiatives to promote gender equality in research policy and research organisations (GERI-3-2015) funded project EFFORTI (Evaluation Framework for Promoting Gender Equality in R&I) is aimed at analysing and modelling the influence of measures to promote gender equality on research and innovation outputs and on establishing more responsible and responsive RTDI systems. To this end, EFFORTI will: - Develop an evaluation framework which enables evaluators, science managers, policy-makers and programme owners to conduct a sound analysis of the research and innovation outputs, outcomes and impacts of gender equality measures across Europe, with a focus on the national level; - Design a differentiated concept to characterise a variety of policy measures and assess their performance, taking into account the diversity in the national policies as well as in organisational contexts; - Derive general lessons for evidence-based and thus \u2018good\u2019 policy making in gender equality within the RTDI system. This means that not only progress towards more gender equality in RTDI has been achieved but also that RTDI has been able to benefit from this progress through enhanced scientific outputs and productivity but also through a higher responsiveness to societal needs and challenges. 3. Impact of gender diversity on Research & Innovation (GERI-2-2014): the actions have to develop concepts and methodologies for the evaluation of the impacts of gender diversity in research teams and organisations on research quality and productivity, as well as on innovation applying the concepts and methodologies developed to a selected range of sectors using a comparative approach across countries. Box 4.6: Impact of gender diversity on research and innovation (GERI-2-2014) funded project GEDII (Gender diversity impact \u2013 improving research and innovation through gender diversity) will develop a reliable diversity measure that is sensitive to power, status and information sharing differentials within teams and across public and private organisations. This gender diversity index (GDI) will thus provide a much more nuanced and realistic measure of the impact of gender diversity on research productivity, quality and innovation across countries and sectors. GDI scores will be explored in relation to a flexible set of performance indicators, including patent and bibliometric measures, combined with new indicators of social impact. GEDII\u2019s evaluation framework thus responds to the growing concern with responsible research and innovation. To address the social relevance and utility of our research, GEDII will engage stakeholders early and often: through advisory groups, virtual challenges and theme-based innovation testimonials. By combining disparate conceptual approaches to gender diversity with an innovative assessment tool, GEDII will for the first time provide clear and comprehensive evidence for the link between gender diversity and research performance and enable research policy and decision-makers to significantly enhance the capacity of European research. 114 The initiatives are related to: (i) research quality and productivity as well as innovation; (ii) research organisations and higher education institutions in terms of structure, efficiency, competitiveness, quality of the workplace and recruitment capacity; (iii) research system level in terms of intensity and productivity.

Innovative approach to communication encouraging girls to study science (GERI-1-2014): the actions should be carried out in the umbrella of the campaign Science it\u2019s a girl thing (which the Commission launched in 2012 to encourage 13-18 year old girls to study science) in order to carry out a set of awareness-raising activities (workshops, seminars, hands-on activities, etc.). Box 4.7: Innovative approach to communication encouraging girls to study science (GERI-1-2014) funded project Hypatia will bring about lasting change in the way schools, science museums, research institutions and industry engage teenage girls in STEM across Europe. Bringing these stakeholders together with gender experts and teenagers themselves, Hypatia will develop, pilot and disseminate a unique modular toolkit of activities and guidelines for engaging teenagers in STEM in a gender-inclusive way. These innovative activities, based on existing European good practices, will be implemented in 14 EU countries and further afield, in schools, science museums and by institutions in research and industry, thanks to hubs of stakeholders strengthened through the project. The activities will have a central focus on gender-inclusive ways of communicating STEM, empowering teenage girls and exploring the range of skills that are needed for the great variety of STEM studies and careers open to young people. The Hypatia hubs will provide a sustainable basis for these activities to be carried out in the long term, with a focus on dissemination through networks and stakeholder engagement allowing the project impact to multiply.

GENDER MAINSTREAMING IN THE USE OF REC PROGRAMME (THE GENDER EQUALITY OBJECTIVE AND THE FOLLOW-UP OF DAPHNE PROGRAMMES ON VAW) AND EXAMPLE OF GOOD PRACTICES The Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme 2014-2020 (REC) ( 115 ) replaced three earlier funding programmes which expired in 2013: \uf0b7 Fundamental Rights and Citizenship programme \uf0b7 PROGRESS programme: anti-discrimination and gender equality strands \uf0b7 Daphne III programme This programme defends the rights and freedoms that people are entitled to under EU law through nine objectives. Among its nine objectives ( 116 ) are included two objectives directly addressing gender equality and women: \uf0b7 promote equality between women and men, and gender mainstreaming; \uf0b7 prevent violence against children, young people, women and other groups at risk (Daphne). Under the first objective, the programme co-finances national projects promoting equal economic independence, overcoming rigid gender roles and stereotypes, raising awareness of the gender pension gap etc. The second objective is meant to invest in the prevention and fight against violence against women and children (boys and girls) by financing projects supporting victims of violence, training relevant professionals, raising awareness and preventing violence linked to harmful practices. In general, violence against women is both a cause and consequence of gender inequalities. On the one hand it results from unequal power relations between women and men, and on the other, it prevents women from fully participating in the labour market, families and society. In addition, it is worth underlining that although not directly addressed to women or gender issues, the non-discrimination objective can also sometimes present cross-cutting attention to a gender perspective with reference to the Roma people integration issue, especially in the context of multiple discrimination. The overall REC budget is distributed between two budget headings : a) Ensuring the protection of rights and empowering citizens (33 02 01) This budget heading covers five REC objectives ( 117 ). Among these is the Daphne objective \u2013 to prevent and combat all forms of violence against children, young people and 115 Regulation (EU) no 1381/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme for the period 2014 to 2020, see: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?qid=1397223391719&uri=CELEX:32013R1381 116 REC Objectives are to : 1. Promote non\u2013discrimination; 2. Combat racism, xenophobia, homophobia and other forms of intolerance; 3. Promote the rights of persons with disabilities; 4. Promote equality between women and men and gender mainstreaming; 5. Prevent violence against children, young people, women and other groups at risk (Daphne); 6. Promote the rights of the child; 7.

The promotion of equality between women and men, and the advancement of gender mainstreaming is one of the objectives . The overall budget for the programme is EUR 439.5 million over the period 2014-2020 . The two objectives (Gender Equality and Daphne combating violence against women) currently account for around 35 % of the REC funds ( 119 ). According to the REC website ( 120 ), a total of 17 grants were issued as of September 2016 and a total 165 projects were funded. Looking at the REC Work Programmes of 2014, 2015 and 2016 ( 121 ), it is possible to identify the planned actions to be funded with the annual budget breakdown by objectives, grants/procurement and the resources planned under these objectives out of the total REC budget. As shown in Table 5.1, over the 2014-2016 period the majority of funds have been allocated under the Daphne objective (EUR 35 694 157) ( 122 ), compared to the Gender Equality Objective (EUR 21 878 009 ). In 2014 the funds planned under both objectives amounted to EUR 19 345 000, that is about 35.7 % of the overall REC annual budget (EUR 54 158 000). In 2015 and 2016 resources planned were EUR 17.341.166 and EUR 20 886 000 respectively, with a lower incidence, around 30.8 % and 35.5 % respectively, on the overall REC annual budget (EUR 56 323 637 in 2015 and EUR 58 852 000 in 2016). - to contribute to ensuring the highest level of protection of privacy and personal data - to promote and enhance the exercise of rights deriving from citizenship of the EU - to enable individuals in their capacity as consumers or entrepreneurs in the internal market to enforce their rights deriving from Union law, having regard to the projects funded under the Consumer Programme. 118 Other objectives are : - to promote the effective implementation of the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, and to respect the principle of non- discrimination on the grounds provided for in Article 21 of the Charter - to prevent and combat racism, xenophobia, homophobia and other forms of intolerance - to promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities. 119 European Commission (2015), Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality 2016-2019, DG Justice and Consumers, 2015, see: https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/strategic_engagement_for_gender_equality_en.pdf 120 See: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants1/programmes-2014-2020/rec/index_en.htm 121 See: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants1/programmes-2014-2020/rec/index_en.htm 122 Regarding the Daphne objective, our analysis focuses only on Daphne calls aimed to contrast every kind of violence against women (gender based violence, domestic violence, sexual harassment and/or sexual violence, harmful practices), even if they are not only targeted to women, but also to children, young people, as well as other groups at risk, assuming that women and young girls are the main victims of these kind of violence.

In particular, the call for proposals \u2013 Action grants to support national or transnational projects on non- discrimination and Roma integration (JUST/2015/RDIS/AG/DISC) \u2013 addressed multiple discrimination, underlining that gender can be considered as grounds for discrimination in addition to other forms of discrimination and requiring the identification and exchange of good practices regarding Roma women. In addition, the restricted call for proposals \u2013 Action grants to support National Roma Platforms (JUST/2015/RDIS/AG/NRP2) supported a nationally-led participatory multi- stakeholder process of working meetings, aimed at strengthening partnerships across all levels, including Roma women\u2019s organisations as relevant stakeholders in the implementation of the National Roma Integration Strategies at the local level.

It is led by ActionAid International Italia Onlus (coordinator) and involves an extensive partnership with stakeholders from different countries (Spain, Greece, Cyprus, UK, Sweden). The project\u2019s aim is to strengthen support services for women victims of domestic violence in Europe, with particular regard to training and advisory services that shelters/women\u2019s centres provide to women victims of violence. It focuses on the capacity building of these centres\u2019 trainers and workers and the development of new methods to address the lack of economic alternatives for women victims and to enable them to exit situations of violence as a result of being empowered. For these purposes, the project has carried out a comparative research on the existing services for women victims and developed common methodologies on data collection. Mutual learning events have been implemented for practitioners to exchange good practices on methodologies supporting the economic independence for women victims. Finally, training sessions are envisaged for practitioners and victims to test innovative economic empowerment services that can help women exit situations of violence through economic alternatives. Universities Supporting Victims of Sexual Violence (USVSV): Training for Sustainable Services is another project responding to this priority. The project is led by Brunel University London, UK (coordinator) and aims to develop learning from research and good practices adopted in university sexual violence policies/care pathways and \u2018first response\u2019 training in partner countries. The project also intends to create national and international networks of experts, specialist agencies, student union and university staff in order to share knowledge and to deliver innovative first response training in universities which enables staff to treat victims appropriately.

Training and awareness-raising activities targeting public sector institutions, regional/local governments and students are provided. The project includes a set of innovative auditing activities aimed to raise awareness on the need for more gender-sensitive labour practices facilitating a greater balance between professional and private life, and a set of training activities designed to increase the institutional capacity of local governments to plan, fund, and promote policies supporting women and men in pursuing a more effective balance between their professional and private lives. The project is particularly focused on developing work arrangements in the public sector encouraging men to assume a greater role in childcare. Public sector employers (9 institutions and companies), and officials in relevant state institutions (400) are involved in measures aimed to increase their institutional know-how and personal capacity of developing policy measures and work arrangements facilitating the reconciliation of private and professional life for both women and men.

        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 88 The high involvement of UK institutions as partners (much less as coordinators) may be explained by the need of other Member States participating in European projects to have a UK organisation in their project team because English is the language used to draft project documents. Finally, Croatia only recently entered the EU and Croatian organisations need time to be recognised as suitable partners in EU projects. ",

CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS The assessment conducted in this study shows that the MFF 2014-2020 needs to make a stronger commitment to gender equality and gender mainstreaming. The EU\u2019s political commitments to gender equality and gender mainstreaming does not seem to be internalised in the budget allocation and spending decisions of all policy areas and this is likely to reduce the effectiveness of gender equality policies. Many budget headings do not specify the amount allocated to identified gender policy objectives and actions. This makes financial and budgetary accountability difficult and raises the risk of gender equality objectives being marginalised in spending decisions. Important tools for gender mainstreaming, such as gender indicators, Gender Impact Assessment and Gender Budgeting, are very rarely adopted both in the EU and national institutions. Attention to gender mainstreaming and the provision of specific funds for gender equality measures is present mainly in programmes addressing employment and social inclusion issues or fundamental human rights (e.g. the ESF, REC, some of the funding instruments for external action, AMIF and the EaSI funds). A gender equality perspective is instead rarely adopted in policy fields that are not seen as immediately related to gender equality, but that may have significant gender effects such as ICT, transport, business and investment support and environmental policies. In addition, the frequent recourse to ad hoc instruments constituted outside the EU makes it even more difficult to assess the application of gender mainstreaming in the EU budget. The gender dimension tends to disappear in those programmes where only general objectives are indicated, limited at best to the generic concept of gender equality with no specific actions or conditions laid down to provide concrete assistance in achieving the objective. Several programmes do not incorporate specific gender indicators and do not require the collection of gender-disaggregated data as part of the monitoring and evaluation of actions funded from the EU budget. In the absence of precise objectives on gender equality, the transversal treatment of gender risks a downgrading of gender equality and gender mainstreaming goals in the policy agenda. This risk is further exacerbated by the recent tendency to merge all grounds of discrimination, including discrimination based on sex, within the promotion of civil rights and equal treatment for all. Another particularly critical issue relates to the funding of gender equality strategies and the fiscal consolidation and budget constraints imposed by the crisis, that are likely to further reduce the available resources for gender equality strategies and bodies. Policy implications The 2014-2020 MFF and all the EU programmes should have a stronger commitment to gender equality and gender mainstreaming . In order to be effective, gender mainstreaming has to be operationalised and supported through predictable funding and allocations. To this end it is crucial that all EU-funded programmes and budget titles adopt explicit gender equality targets whenever possible. Greater transparency in financial allocations, enhanced use of gender-related indicators, and more systematic collection of gender-disaggregated data are needed. The further advancement in Gender Budgeting from the planning stage of the MFF to implementation, auditing and evaluation, even if challenging, should be given special focus, taking into account that it is one of the most effective ways to implement gender mainstreaming. Gender Budgeting requires an extensive analysis from a gender perspective of all the EU policy intervention areas and funding programmes. This requires that: ",
        "Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 90 \uf0b7 Gender Budgeting is made mandatory in the EU budgeting process . All EU institutions and policy directorates should confirm their commitment to mainstream gender equality in the policy fields of their competence, adopting appropriate gender mainstreaming tools in the policymaking processes. Gender equality should be integrated as a distinct policy objective in all headings of the EU budget, and the financial allocations for gender equality policy objectives and actions should be specified. Progress towards gender equality targets should be constantly monitored in the annual and midterm reviews of the MFF. \uf0b7 Gender-relevant data and indicators should be considered in all programmes and actions that receive funding from the EU budget and be used in all budgetary procedures. Gender-disaggregated data on beneficiaries and participants in all actions that receive funding from the EU budget, as well as gender-relevant data, should be collected in the monitoring and evaluation system. \uf0b7 In order to support the effective implementation of gender mainstreaming in all the EU areas of intervention, it is necessary to improve the in-house capacity of EU institutions on gender mainstreaming. This can be achieved by integrating a gender perspective in all EU training programmes, as well as providing specific training and technical support on the use of Gender Impact Assessment and Gender Budgeting tools. This is needed especially in relation to those policy fields not considered as immediately related to women and gender equality, although they may have significant effects on gender equality. In relation to the programmes considered in this study, some specific policy implications emerge from the analysis: \uf0b7 The implementation of the gender equality measures envisaged in the Operational Programmes of the ESI funds should be closely monitored and evaluated, in order to avoid the downgrading of gender equality measures in the implementation phase. To this end, the creation of permanent national structures providing technical support for gender mainstreaming in the planning and implementation stages of all funds is crucial, as shown by the Swedish and German cases. Special attention should be given to ESIF measures supporting investments in educational, social and healthcare services, which are facing reductions in public funding at the national and local level due to the crisis and deficit reduction strategies. The financial allocations for social infrastructures and services could eventually be increased, in the midterm revision. \uf0b7 In relation to Horizon 2020 , gender mainstreaming should be strengthened in all the funded pillars with the establishment of gender-relevant targets. In addition, an independent line of funding (such as GERI for 2014-2016) for gender-specific structural change projects as well as other gender equality topics in research and innovation should be maintained, in order to support the implementation of the binding legal requirements related to gender equality included in H2020. To this end, the changes envisaged in the new Science with and for society scoping paper 2018- 2020 that subsume gender equality funding under the more general heading of RRI \u2013 responsible research and innovation \u2013 should be avoided. As already underlined, past experience shows that when gender equality is subsumed within another topic, it tends to be sidelined and disappears. \uf0b7 The REC programmes directly addressing gender issues should be maintained and the allocated resources increased, in order to contrast the sharp reductions in many Member States of public funds for measures promoting gender equality and fighting violence against women. A stronger involvement of NGOs active in gender equality fields should be supported in order to ensure effective implementation. ",
        "The use of funds for Gender Equality in selected Member States 91 \uf0b7 The interventions implemented to face the current dramatic refugee and migrant crisis should give greater attention to the specific needs of refugee and migrant women and girls, who are disproportionally disadvantaged and at risk of being victims of violence. The MFF revision should provide for specific funding to support targeted measures ensuring that the basic rights, safety and security of refugee and migrant women are protected. The role of the European Parliament, and particularly of the FEMM Committee, is crucial for the constant monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of gender mainstreaming and gender equality in EU budgeting decisions and policy making.
