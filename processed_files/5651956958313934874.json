Recalls that the protection of personal data should always be ensured and must not be arbitrarily disregarded, and calls on all authorities to legislate and act in accordance with that rule; 16. Welcomes the progress made in respect of the judicial system, but underlines that implementation of the reforms is still at an early stage; takes the view that judicial reform, including the enforcement of court decisions, is a key prerequisite for Albania\u2019s EU membership application process, and underlines the importance of the separation of powers in a democratic society; stresses that a transparent, impartial and efficient judiciary, independent of all political or other pressure or control, is fundamental to the rule of law, and calls for the urgent adoption of a comprehensive long-term strategy in this field, including a roadmap for adopting the necessary legislation and implementing measures; calls on the opposition to be involved in the drafting process and to give full support to the reform of the judiciary; stresses, moreover, that the judiciary needs to be provided with sufficient funding to enable it to operate effectively throughout the country; looks forward, therefore, to new assistance initiatives from the Commission and welcomes, in this regard, the recent inauguration of a Serious Crimes Court in Tirana; 17.

Underlines the crucial importance of professional, independent and pluralist media \u2013 both public and private \u2013 as a cornerstone of democracy; is concerned that little progress has been made in completing the legal framework for the media; urges the authorities to make every effort to adopt and implement the legal framework in line with EU standards, and to ensure media freedom from political or any other interference, including that of the executive; is concerned about political pressure on the National Council for Radio and Television (NCRT), and calls on the relevant authorities to secure its independence; calls for steps to be taken to ensure transparent media ownership and funding; deplores the absence of established working rights for journalists, which undermines their ability to work objectively and independently, and urges the authorities to take adequate steps to address this situation; calls, in particular, for the legislation on electronic broadcasting to be adopted and for the civil codes to be adjusted in order to decriminalise libel and defamation; welcomes the lack of government restrictions on internet access, and urges the government to make it more widely available to all citizens; EN C 351 E/88 Official Journal of the European Union 2.12.2011 Thursday 8 July 2010 ",

Welcomes the legal reforms in recent years with regard to the protection of victims of domestic violence and trafficking; recognises, however, that these are inadequate and that further steps should be taken, and remains seriously concerned about widespread domestic violence and trafficking in women and children for the purposes of sexual exploitation and forced labour; expresses concern that a significant increase in the reporting of incidents in this field is not always followed by proper police investigations or court protection orders; calls for full implementation of the existing legislation protecting women and children against all forms of violence and for the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive system for their protection and rehabilitation, including mandatory, efficient registration of all children and newborns, comprehensive provision of free legal, social and psychological aid to victims, public awareness-raising campaigns, adequate training for law enforcement agencies and the creation of a network of shelters (which should be of sufficient quantity and quality and able to meet the different needs of victims of domestic violence and trafficking); calls on the Commission to strengthen its support for the Albanian authorities in this regard; 27.

Acknowledges Albania\u2019s good relations with its neighbours as making a vital contribution to regional stability, and welcomes the recent positive trend in relations between Albania and Serbia, along with the country\u2019s active participation in regional initiatives such as the South-East European Cooperation Process, the Regional Cooperation Council, the Energy Community and the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), the South East Europe Transport Observatory (SEETO) and the negotiations on the establishment of a Transport Community Treaty; emphasises that regional cross-border cooperation is essential in dealing with issues such as human trafficking; 35. Notes with satisfaction Albanian initiatives to waive visa requirements for neighbouring countries, which are a positive step that facilitates people-to-people contacts and enhances regional reconciliation; is of the opinion that such initiatives should be undertaken in parallel to the visa liberalisation process involving the Schengen countries and Western Balkan countries; EN C 351 E/90 Official Journal of the European Union 2.12.2011 Thursday 8 July 2010 ",

Welcomes the Albanian authorities\u2019 efforts to improve the business climate by simplifying procedures for registering businesses and obtaining licences and permits; stresses, however, that further improvement is needed, since Albania\u2019s business climate is still regarded as one of the toughest in the Western Balkans; calls on the authorities to address numerous shortcomings, for example in relation to procedures for acquiring land ownership titles, enforcement of contracts, weak public administration and high levels of corruption; 41. Underlines the need \u2013 bearing in mind that a significant proportion of Albania\u2019s economy relies on remittances from emigrants living in neighbouring countries \u2013 for continued work on public policies and investments with a view to upgrading infrastructure in fields crucial to sustainable economic development and social cohesion, including education, health, justice, transport and agriculture; 42.
