        "With 59.8 out of 100 points , Estonia ranks 17th in the EU on the Gender Equality Index. Its score is 7.6 points lower than the EU\u2019s score. Between 2005 and 2017, Estonia\u2019s score increased by 7.6 points (+ 3.1 points since 2015). Estonia is progressing towards gender equality faster than other EU Member States. Its ranking has improved by four places since 2005. Estonia\u2019s scores are lower than the EU\u2019s scores in all do- mains except in the domain of time, where Estonia ranks fifth in the EU. Gender inequalities are most pronounced in the domains of power (34.6 points) and knowledge (55.5 points). Estonia\u2019s highest score is in the domain of health (81.9 points), although this is one of the lowest scores in the EU (ranking 24th). Since 2005, Estonia\u2019s score has improved the most in the domains of power (+ 12.1 points) and mon- ey (+ 11 points). Progress has stalled in the domain of work (+ 0.5 points) and health (+ 0.9 points). Between 2005 and 2017, Estonia improved its Index score, but it remained much lower than the EU\u2019s score in the same period. Estonia moved towards gender equality at a faster rate, decreasing its distance to the EU\u2019s score over time. 1 100 EL HU SK RO PL LT HR CZ CY BG LV EE PT MT IT AT DE EU-28 SI LU ES BE IE NL UK FI FR DK SE EE 59.8 EU 67.4 Full inequality Full equality 2017 2005 \u25b2 Increase since 2005 \u25b2 5.4 \u25b2 7.6 Each year we score EU Member States and the EU as a whole to see how far they are from reaching gender equal- ity. The Index uses a scale of 1 to 100, where 1 is for total inequality and 100 is for total equality. The scores are based on the gaps between women and men and levels of achievement in six core domains: work, money, knowledge, time, power and health. Two additional domains are integrated into the Index but do not have an impact on the final score. The domain of intersecting inequalities highlights how gender inequalities manifest in combination with age, dis/ability, country of birth, education and family type. The domain of violence against women measures and analyses women\u2019s experiences of violence. In addition to providing a snapshot into the Index scores, the Gender Equality Index 2019 includes a thematic focus on work-life balance.

        "Work Estonia\u2019s score in the domain of work is 71.5, showing slight progress of 0.5 points since 2005 (- 0.6 points since 2015), with increased participation of women and men in employment. Estonia ranks second in the EU in the sub-domain of participation. The employment rate (of people aged 20-64) is 76 % for women and 84 % for men. With the overall employment rate of 80 %, Estonia has reached its national EU 2020 employment target of 76 %. The full-time equivalent (FTE) employment rate rose from 48 % to 51 % for women and from 58 % to 65 % for men between 2005 and 2017, widening the gender gap. Between women and men in couples with children, the gap is far greater than in couples without children (26 percentage points (p.p.) and 1 p.p.). The FTE employment rate increases and the gender gap shrinks as education levels rise. About 15 % of women work part-time, compared to 7 % of men. On average, wom- en work 37 hours per week and men work 40 hours. The uneven concentration of women and men in different sectors of the labour market remains an issue: 25 % of women work in education, health and social work, compared to 4 % of men. Fewer women (10 %) than men (40 %) work in science, technology, engineering and math- ematics (STEM) occupations. Money Estonia\u2019s score in the domain of money is 69.4, showing progress of 11 points since 2005 (+ 2.7 points since 2015), with significant improvements in the financial situa- tions of both women and men. Despite increases in mean monthly earnings of both women (+ 53 %) and men (+ 48 %) from 2006 to 2014, the gender gap persists: women earn 29 % less than men. This is the widest gender gap in the EU. In couples with children, women earn 38 % less than men, while in couples without children, women earn 22 % less. Gen- der gaps are prevalent across all levels of education: women with low, medium and high education earn around a third less than men. The risk of poverty increased between 2005 and 2017. Around 25 % of women (+ 6 p.p.) and 19 % of men (+ 3 p.p.) are at risk. People facing the highest risks of poverty are: single people, especially women (58 % of women compared to 45 % of men), women aged 65 and over (48 %), women with low education (44 %) and women with disabilities (40 %). Inequalities in income distribution slightly decreased among and between women and men from 2005 to 2017. Women earn on average 74 cents for every euro a man makes per hour, resulting in a gender pay gap of 26 %. The gen- der pension gap is 3 %. Knowledge Estonia\u2019s score in the domain of knowledge is 55.5, with a 6-point increase since 2005 (+ 2.3 points since 2015). Estonia ranks 22nd in the EU in the domain of knowledge. There are improvements in both sub-domains of attainment and participation, and segregation. The share of women tertiary graduates increased (from 32 % to 42 %), while the share of men also increased (from 23 % to 26 %), widening the gender gap between 2005 and 2017. The gender gap in attainment is higher for lone parents (22 p.p.), and between women and men aged 25-49 (21 p.p.), to the detriment of men. Estonia has reached its national EU 2020 target of having 40 % of people aged 30-34 obtain tertiary education. The current rate is 47 % (58 % for women and 38 % for men). Participation in formal and non-formal education and training also increased from 15 % to 21 % for women and from 16 % to 18 % for men, between 2005 and 2017. Estonia\u2019s participation rate in lifelong learning is the eighth highest in the EU. Despite an increase in the sub-domain score, the uneven concentration of women and men in different study fields in tertiary education is a challenge for Estonia: 42 % of women students and 16 % of men students study education, health and welfare, and humanities and art. \u25b2 2.6 \u25bc 0.9 89.8 57.0 Participation Segregation and quality of work 71.5 \u25b2 0.5 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25bc decrease since 2005 \u25b2 16.9 \u25b2 0.3 58.3 82.5 Financial resources Economic situation 69.4 \u25b2 11.0 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25b2 3.4 \u25b2 7.2 70.1 44.0 Attainment and participation Segregation 55.5 \u25b2 6.0 \u25b2 increase since 2005 ",
        "Time Estonia\u2019s score in the domain of time has not changed since the last edition of the Index, because new data is not available. The next data update for this domain is expected in 2021. More frequent time-use data would help to track progress in this domain. Estonia\u2019s score in the domain of time is 74.7. It ranks fifth in the EU. Since 2005, ine- qualities have decreased in the distribution of time spent on care activities. Women take on more responsibilities in caring for their family: 35 % of women care for and educate their family members for at least one hour a day, compared to 31 % of men. Among couples with children, more women (92 %) than men (66 %) are involved in daily care activities. Around 76 % of women compared to 47 % of men do cook- ing and housework every day for at least one hour. This gender gap is even wider among people in couples with children. Fewer women (34 %) than men (38 %) participate in sporting, cultural or leisure ac- tivities outside the home. Slightly more women (13 %) than men (11 %) are involved in voluntary or charitable activities, with declining levels of engagement for both. Power Estonia\u2019s score in the domain of power is 34.6, with progress of 12.1 points since 2005 (+ 6.4 points since 2015). This is the lowest score for Estonia across all domains and ranks 20th in the domain of power in the EU. The increase in score is driven by improvements in the sub-domains of both political and social power, while progress in the sub-domain of economic power has stalled. The share of women increased significantly in political decision-making. Women comprise 28 % of ministers in Estonia (compared to 14 % in 2005), and 29 % of members of parliament are women (compared to 19 % in 2005). The share of wom- en among members of local councils is 31 %. The share of women on the boards of the largest publicly listed companies decreased from 13 % to 8 % between 2005 and 2018, while the share of women on the board of the central bank increased from 13 % to 18 %. The share of women among board members of publicly owned broadcasting organi- sations is 50 %, which is the second highest rate in the EU. Women comprise 14 % of board members of research-funding organisations and just 9 % of board members of the highest decision-making bodies of national Olympic sports organisations. Health Estonia\u2019s score in the domain of health is 81.9, with no significant change since 2005 (+ 0.4 points since 2015). Health status has improved in terms of gender equality, while progress has stalled in health services. There is no new data for health behaviour. The overall level of health satisfaction in Estonia slightly decreased from 51 % to 50 % for women and 57 % to 56 % for men between 2005 and 2017. Health satis- faction increases with a person\u2019s level of education and decreases in proportion to their age. Women with low education levels and women aged 65 or over have even lower levels of health satisfaction, compared to men in the same groups. Both life expectancy and healthy life years increased for both women and men, between 2005 and 2016. Women on average live nine years longer than men (82 years com- pared to 73 years). On average, women have 59 years and men have 54 years of healthy life (compared to 52 and 48 years in 2005). Adequate access to medical care has decreased overall while access to dental care has increased since 2005. Around 16 % of women and 11 % of men report unmet medical needs (compared to 9 % in 2005). About 8 % of women and 6 % of men report unmet needs for dental examinations (compared to 16 % and 15 % in 2005). More women and men with disabilities report unmet needs for medical care (22 % and 18 %), compared to those without disabilities (12 % and 8 %). \u25b2 2.7 \u25bc 1.9 85.9 65.0 Care activities Social activities 74.7* \u25b2 0.1 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25bc decrease since 2005 * Scores not updated since 2017 edition. \u25b2 12.5 \u25b2 0.5 \u25b2 22.7 48.5 23.4 36.5 Political Economic Social 34.6 \u25b2 12.1 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25bc decrease since 2005 \u25b2 3.2 \u2014 \u25bc 0.2 83.9 70.1* 93.5 Status Behaviour Access 81.9 \u25b2 0.9 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25bc decrease since 2005 * Scores not updated since 2017 edition.

        "Violence Violence against women is both a consequence and cause of persisting gender inequalities in the areas of work, health, money, power, knowledge and time. In con- trast to other domains, the domain of violence does not measure differences between women\u2019s and men\u2019s situ- ations but examines women\u2019s experiences of violence. For this reason, the domain of violence is not captured in the calculations of the Gender Equality Index. Instead, it is calculated as a separate composite measure of three aspects: prevalence, severity and disclosure of violence against women. The calculation of scores relied on the 2014 European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights survey data results. No EU-wide survey on gender-based violence has been carried out since then. Until the com- pletion of the next survey, the scores cannot be updated. Estonia signed and ratified the Council of Europe Con- vention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention) in February 2018. The domain of violence presents updated data on three additional indicators to help monitor femicide, female genital mutilation and trafficking in human beings. How- ever, not all Member States collect such data and im- provements in data collection are necessary. Estonia does not provide data on women victims of in- tentional homicide by an intimate partner or family mem- ber. Nor does it provide data estimating the proportion of girls (in the resident migrant population) at risk of fe- male genital mutilation. Statistics on trafficking in human beings are gathered and reported. There were seven reg- istered women victims of trafficking in human beings in 2016. Comparable data, disaggregated by sex, is essential to the development of EU-wide strategies on preventing and eliminating violence against women across Member States. Thematic focus on work-life balance Gender Equality Index 2019 focuses on work-life balance \u2014 an issue of high political importance in the EU. In addi- tion to work-life balance related indicators captured by the Index (e.g. in the domains of work, time and knowledge), the thematic focus presents additional indicators \u2014 a work-life balance scoreboard (WLB scoreboard). The WLB scoreboard cuts across three broad areas: paid work, unpaid work (care) and education and training. It presents 15 indicators in six specific areas of concern: parental leave policies; caring for children and childcare services; informal care for older persons and persons with disabilities and long-term care services; transport and infrastructure; flexi- ble working arrangements; and lifelong learning. Parental leave policies Parental leave helps parents balance their caring duties and work life. However, it is often unavailable to potential par- ents as their eligibility might be dependent on criteria such as whether a person is in paid work; if they are an employee or self-employed; the sector in which they work; the length of service; or leave might not be accessible to same-sex couples or migrants. Changes in the labour market, such as the spread of atypical forms of employment (e.g. temporary contracts and on-demand work, bogus self-employment, voucher-based work) have increased concerns about par- ents\u2019 access to leave, especially in cases where it is based on definitions of traditional standard employment. In 2016, all women and men potential parents, aged 20-49, were eligible for parental leave in Estonia. In contrast to most of the EU countries, eligibility for parental leave is not constrained by employment status, duration or type of em- ployment. Same-sex parents are also eligible for parental leave in Estonia. ",
        "Informal childcare and childcare services As the number of dual-earning and single-parent families grows, new needs for childcare services appear. High qual- ity, available, accessible and affordable childcare services are essential to allow parents to stay in or join the labour market and reduce the gender gap in employment. In Estonia, 56 % of all informal carers of children are wom- en. Overall, 53 % of women are involved in caring for or educating their children or grandchildren at least several times a week, compared to 56 % of men. Compared to the EU average (56 % of women and 50 % of men), slightly few- er women and slightly more men are involved in caring for or educating their children or grandchildren in Estonia. The gender gaps are wider among women and men who are working in the public sector (62 % and 48 %) and within the 50-64 age group (41 % and 29 %). Estonia has reached only one of the Barcelona targets to have at least 33 % of children below the age of three and 90 % of children between the age of three and school age in childcare. About 27 % of children below the age of three are under some form of formal care arrangements, and 21 % of children this age are in formal childcare for at least 30 hours a week. Formal childcare is provided for 95 % of children from age three to the minimum compul- sory school age (88 % are in formal childcare for at least 30 hours a week). Around 9 % of households report un- met needs for formal childcare services. Lone mothers are only more slightly likely to report unmet needs for formal childcare services in Estonia (10 %), compared to couples with children (9 %). Informal care for older persons and persons with disabilities and long-term care services Available, accessible, and affordable care services and infra- structure are crucial if people with caring responsibilities are to maintain a healthy balance between their care duties and work life. This is especially relevant for women, who are often more engaged than men in both formal and informal care of older persons and/or persons with disabilities. In light of emerging demographic trends, such as ageing so- cieties, lower birth rates and consequently the decline of the working-age population, the need for formal and infor- mal long-term care services becomes more important than ever. Most informal carers of older persons and/or persons with disabilities in Estonia are women (56 %). The shares of wom- en and men involved in informal care of older persons and/ or people with disabilities several days a week or every day are 12 % and 11 % respectively. The proportion of women involved in informal care is 3 p.p. lower than the EU aver- age, while the involvement of men is 1 p.p. higher. Around 53 % of women carers of older persons and/or persons with disabilities are employed, compared to 43 % of men com- bining care with professional responsibilities. In contrast, there are fewer women than men informal carers working in the EU. The gender gap is narrower in Estonia than in the EU (9 p.p. compared to 14 p.p. for the EU). In the 50- 64 age group, 67 % of women and 26 % of men informal carers work, compared to the 20-49 age group, where 80 % of women and 92 % of men carers work. Around 15 % of women and 11 % of men in Estonia report unmet needs for professional home care services, which is the second lowest in the EU. Transport and infrastructure Access to affordable and quality public infrastructure, such as care and educational facilities, health services and trans- portation, impacts women\u2019s and men\u2019s opportunities to balance paid work with other activities. The uneven division of caring duties and household tasks between women and men influences the ways in which they use or need certain types of transport and infrastructure. Time spent commut- ing is a good indication of whether existing public infra- structure helps or hinders women and men in juggling their everyday activities. In Estonia, women and men spend a similar amount of time commuting to and from work than (around 41 min- utes per day for men and 43 minutes for women). There are minor differences between couples with and without children, however, men in couples without children travel around 8 minutes less than men in couples with children. Single people spend similar time commuting as people in couples do, with single men travelling around 48 minutes per day compared to 40 minutes per day for single women. Women spend more time commuting than men, regardless of whether they work part- or full-time. Women working part-time travel 40 minutes from home to work and back, and men commute 38 minutes, compared to 44 minutes for women and 41 minutes for men working full-time. Generally, men are more likely to travel directly to and from work, whereas women make more multi-purpose trips, to fit in other activities such as school drop-offs or grocery shopping. ",

If carefully designed, keeping in mind the different needs of women and men, flexible working arrangements can make it easier to balance work and family life. They can support people with caring responsibilities to enter the labour market, as full-time employees. Around 58 % of women and 59 % of men are unable to change their working time arrangements. Access to flexible working arrangements in Estonia is close to the EU average (57 % of women and 54 % of men). The private sector provides more flexibility over working time to both women and men (55 % and 58 % have no control over their working time arrange- ments), compared to the public sector, where women have less access to flexibility than men (66 % compared to 60 %). Women are less likely to transition from part-time to full- time work than men in the majority of EU countries, even though they are over-represented among part-time work- ers. In Estonia, 32 % of women and 42 % of men part-time workers transitioned to full-time work in 2017. Lifelong learning Constant advances in technology require workers to contin- uously upskill and stay up-to-date with new developments and technologies over the course of their careers. Lifelong learning is also a catalyst for gender equality as it gives women and men greater choice in their work options and more opportunities to achieve their full potential. Insuffi- cient financial resources and time-related barriers such as conflicts with work schedules and/or family responsibilities can prevent access to lifelong learning for both women and men. Lifelong learning can help women re-enter the labour market after career breaks due to care responsibilities. Estonia is above the EU average in terms of participation rate in lifelong learning (17 %), with the fourth widest gen- der gap (6.9 p.p.). Women (aged 25-64) are more likely to participate in education and training than men regardless of their employment status. The highest difference is re- ported among unemployed women and men (9.7 p.p.) Con- flicts with work schedules are a greater barrier to partici- pation in lifelong learning for men (32 %) than for women (22 %). Family responsibilities are reported as barriers to engagement in education and training for 29 % of women compared to 12 % of men. Both work schedules and family responsibilities are less of an obstacle for participation in lifelong learning in Estonia than in the EU overall. In the EU, 38 % of women and 43 % of men report their work sched- ule as an obstacle and 40 % of women and 24 % of men report that family responsibilities hinder participationin lifelong learning.
