        "(4) In this context, it is important to be able to report on the reforms and investments financed by the Facility which have a social dimension. Pursuant to Article 29(4), point (b) of Regulation (EU) 2021/241, the Commission is to define a methodology for reporting social expenditure, including on children and the youth, under the Facility. (5) Pursuant to Article 31(3), point (c) of Regulation (EU) 2021/241, the annual report of the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council should include information on the expenditure financed by the Facility under the six pillars referred to in its Article 3, incorporating social expenditure, including on children and the youth. (6) The methodology should consist of two steps: firstly, each reform and investment included in the recovery and resilience plan of a Member State with a primary social dimension should be associated by the Commission, in consultation where necessary with that Member State, to one of nine social policy areas under the four broader social categories set out in the Annex; secondly, each measure of a social nature that includes a focus on children and the youth, and also on gender equality as Regulation (EU) 2021/241 puts an emphasis on gender equality, should be flagged, allowing for a specific reporting on expenditure focused on children and the youth, and respectively on gender equality. (7) Given that the social expenditure methodology should be operational by 31 December 2021 and in order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union . HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Definition of the methodology 1. The methodology for reporting social expenditure, including on children and the youth, and on gender equality under the Facility shall be based on the estimated expenditure provided in the approved recovery and resilience plans and on the steps set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. 2. Reforms and investments with a primary social dimension shall be associated to one of the nine social policy areas set out in the Annex. Each social policy area shall be linked to a broader social category. A reform or investment may only be associated to one social policy area, and therefore to one social category. 3. Each measure of a social nature that includes a focus on children and the youth shall be flagged, allowing for a subsequent specific reporting on expenditure under the Facility on children and the youth. 4. Each measure of a social nature that includes a focus on gender equality shall be flagged, allowing for a specific subsequent reporting on expenditure under the Facility on gender equality. 5. The social policy areas and social categories, and the flags to identify measures of a social nature that include a focus on children and the youth, and on gender equality as referred to in paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 shall be those set out in the Annex. 6. The Commission shall use this methodology in the annual report referred to in Article 31(3) of Regulation (EU) 2021/241 to provide information on the social expenditure, including on children and the youth, and on gender equality financed by the Facility. Article 2 Entry into force This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
