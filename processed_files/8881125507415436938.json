        "4 The Social Protection Committee The SPC has been bringing together representatives from EU Member States and the European Commission since 2000. It is a high-level policy forum which allows Member States and the European Commission to work together and exchange ideas as part of the Social Open Method of Coordination (Social OMC). The SPC prepares reports, formulates opin- ions and undertakes other work within its fields of competence, at the request of either the Council or the Commission or on its own initiative. As of 2011, it also compiles an Annual Report assessing social aspects of the Europe 2020 Strategy. The Social Open Method of Coordination The EU approach to social policy is based on the OMC. This is a mecha- nism for coordinating Member State social policies. The aim is to move towards common European goals through a process of policy exchange and mutual learning while allowing Member States to define their own policies for achieving these goals. Under the Social OMC, Member States draw up national action plans, outlining priorities and planned actions. The European Commission supports and monitors progress on the basis of common objectives, indicators and standards. In 2011, the objectives and working methods of the Social OMC will be adapted to fit the aims set out by the Europe 2020 strategy of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. ",
        "5 Introduction Europe 2020 is the EU\u2019s growth strategy for the coming decade. It will enable the EU to become a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. Its success depends on actions in all of its priority areas supporting each other. This should enable the EU and its Member States to deliver high levels of employment, productivity and social cohesion. Concretely, the EU has set five ambitious objectives - on employment, innovation, education, social inclusion and climate/energy - to be reached by 2020. Member States will adopt their own national targets for each of these areas. Concrete actions at EU- and national-levels will underpin the strategy. The SPC has published a report assessing social aspects of the Europe 2020 strategy. This leaflet provides a summary of this 2011 Report. ",
        "6 The target for poverty reduction and social inclusion One in five people in the EU is at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Such a high num- ber of people living on the margins of society undermines social cohesion and limits Europeans\u2019 potential. This is particularly damaging in a period when Member States are working to ensure recovery from the economic and financial crisis. EU heads of state and government are committed to lifting at least 20 million peo- ple away from the risk of poverty and social exclusion by 2020. To reach this goal, Member States have to set national targets in line with EU aims and adopt measures to meet them. This will ensure that fighting poverty forms a key part of the overall recovery strategy. ",
        "7 Poverty and social exclusion in the EU: state of play and recent trends The European poverty and social exclusion headline target has been set on the basis of three combined indicators \u2013 the number of people at risk of poverty, levels of severe material deprivation and numbers of people living in households where under-employment features prominently. These indicators address the various features of poverty and exclusion across Europe and the differing situations and priorities among Member States. Together, the three indicators reflect the Europe 2020 strategy\u2019s aim of ensuring that the benefits of growth are widely shared and that people currently on the margins can play an active part in society. 114 million people at risk of poverty or exclusion (2009) At risk of poverty (80 million) Living in severe material deprivation (40 million) Living in very low work intensity households (34 million) 48.7 At risk of poverty, not deprived, not jobless At risk of poverty, deprived, not jobless Not at risk of poverty, deprived, not jobless Not at risk of poverty, not deprived, jobless At risk of poverty, not deprived, jobless 12.8 6.7 12.1 18.8 2.3 12.5 At risk of poverty, deprived, jobless Not at risk of poverty, deprived, jobless Source: EU-SILC (2009) \u2013 Income reference year 2008 Note: Income data and low work intensity data refer to the previous year (2008) except for IE - 2008-2009 and UK - 2009. Material deprivation data refers to the survey year (2009) ",
        "8 Shares of people at risk of poverty; in severe material deprivation but not at risk of poverty; and living in a household with zero or very low work intensity but neither at risk of poverty or in severe material deprivation; 2009 Monitoring of progress towards this goal will be based on past trends of numbers of people at risk of poverty or exclusion, both for the total population and for the main groups at risk. At risk of poverty rate People whose disposable income is less than 60% of the median for their country are considered to be at risk of poverty. This is a relative measure of poverty, linked to income distribution and taking account of all sources of monetary income. National- level employment, education and welfare policies aimed at fighting poverty can thus have a considerable impact on risk levels. 0 10 20 30 40 50 Living in a household with zero or very low work intensity, not at risk of poverty and not in severe material deprivation In severe material deprivation, not at risk of poverty At risk of poverty BG RO LV HU LT PL EL IE PT IT ES EE CY UK MT BE DE SK FR LU DK SI AT FI SE NL CZ EU-27 % o f t o t a l p o p u l a t i o n Source: EU-SILC (2009) \u2013 Income reference year 2008, except IE (2008-09) and UK (2009) ",
        "9 Poverty risk levels vary according to the different living standards across the EU. Pov- erty thresholds are four to five times higher in the Netherlands, Austria and Cyprus than in Romania and Bulgaria. Severe material deprivation This indicator describes the situation of people who cannot afford commodities con- sidered essential for a decent life in Europe. It reflects both distribution of resources within a country as well as differences in living standards and GDP per capita across Europe. On average, 8% of Europeans suffer severe material deprivation, but rates for some countries reach 30%. People living in households with very low work intensity This indicator describes the situation of people who live in households in which nobody works (or in which household members work very little), but who are not necessarily living on a very low income. A job remains the best safeguard against poverty and exclusion. The poverty risk faced by unemployed working-age adults is more than five times that faced by those in work (44% against 8%) while that for the inactive (excluding retired people) is three times higher than that for the employed (27% against 8%). Use of this indicator reflects Member State efforts to tackle exclu- sion from the labour market. Who is at risk of poverty and exclusion? Children, the elderly, single women, lone parents, the low-skilled, the unemployed, inactive people of working age including those with disabilities, people living in rural areas and migrants face the highest risk of poverty or exclusion. Ethnic minori- ties, including the Roma, cannot be identified through official EU statistics but some national sources indicate that they also face a high risk of exclusion. ",

More accurate measurement of poverty, labour market exclusion and the impact of tax and benefit systems is needed. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Inactive (not retired, not children) Working Children Single female Unemployed Single parent households Single male Non-EU migrants Total population Risk of poverty or exclusion for specific population sub-groups, % Share in population at risk of poverty or exclusion, % 100 6 7 9 10 11 22 22 27 Source: EU-SILC (2009) Income reference year 2008 except IE (2008-09) and UK (2009) Reading note: 63% of the unemployed are at risk of poverty or exclusion and they represent 10.5% of the population at risk of poverty or exclusion.

        "11 Learning from peer reviews: Belgium's use of reference budgets A recent study entitled \u201cMinibudgets: What is the necessary income to live a life in dignity in Belgium?\u201d set out a realistic monthly basket of products and services in order to determine the necessary budget for given types of household. The researchers focused on products and services considered essential for health and independent living. An interesting aspect of the study was that it enabled people in poverty to give feedback on results obtained using a scientific methodology. Development of reference budgets can help to assess the adequacy of minimum income levels and could support social and financial counselling. In order to be accurate, reference budgets should be determined on the basis of scientific data with input from a broad cross section of society, including people in pov- erty. Such budgets can indicate income-based poverty thresholds and improve understanding of social inclusion levels across Member States. ",
        "12 Policies to prevent and reduce poverty Europe 2020 is an integrated strategy, the success of which depends on all of its actions supporting each other. This is especially important in the areas of employ- ment, education and poverty. Economic growth and the design of successful employment and education policies play a crucial role in fighting poverty and social exclusion. Reducing poverty will improve workers\u2019 job opportunities and children\u2019s chances of doing well at school. Promoting inclusive growth Despite the presence of social protection systems, the financial crisis has hit the most vulnerable hardest, thus increasing inequality. Notwithstanding the need to strengthen public finances, particularly against the backdrop of an ageing society, the benefits of recovery must be shared as widely as possible. Active inclusion strategies to underpin employment measures Countries with high employment rates tend to have lower levels of poverty and exclu- sion. However, a job is not always a guarantee against poverty and the employed represent 24% of those at risk of poverty or exclusion in the EU. In 2009, 8,4% of people in employment were living below the poverty threshold. This figure has not improved since 2005. It is therefore important that employment policies ensure that those in work earn a decent wage by addressing labour market segmentation, low pay and under-employment and helping young people, lone parents and second earners to access the job market.

        "13 Learning from peer reviews: The Finnish National Programme to reduce long-term homelessness In February 2008, the Finnish government adopted a programme aimed at halv- ing long-term homelessness by 2011. Adequate housing provision is considered a prerequisite for solving other social and health problems. The programme helped homeless people to secure permanent accommodation based on ten- ancy agreements and converted shelters into units for rent. It provided hous- ing advice and financial support to help prevent eviction as well as guidance for use of welfare services. Plans for rehabilitation of and provision of services to homeless people were also drawn up. The first evaluation of the programme found that it had resulted in a saving of EUR 14 000 per person, over 50% of the average total cost of homelessness to the government. The Finnish government estimates that achieving the programme\u2019s target of creating 1 250 new dwell- ings and supported housing or care places for the long-term homeless could result in savings of EUR 17,5 million a year. Education and skills as determinants of social inclusion Improving education levels and ensuring access to lifelong learning will help to reduce poverty in the medium and long term. As highlighted in the figure below, the risk level of poverty and exclusion for the low skilled is 10 percentage points higher than for those with medium education levels, and more than 20 percentage points higher than for the highly skilled.

        "14 People aged 18 and over at risk of poverty or exclusion by level of education (%); EU27 2009 Sustainable and adequate social protection Social protection insures people against social risk and helps to reduce poverty. At the same time, it is vital to adapt social protection systems so that they encourage activity and inclusion. This should go hand in hand with strategies for growth and more and better jobs. Design of tax and benefit systems determines the way in and extent to which they affect income inequality and help the poor. Important features include progressivity of taxes and benefits and targeting of and conditions attached to benefits, as these can create disincentives to work, if inappropriately designed. Wide variations between Member States have been noted as regards net cash support for low-income households. 05 10 15 20 25 30 35 HIGH: Tertiary education MEDIUM: Upper secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary education LOW: Pre-primary, primary and lower secondary education All (18 years and over) Households with very low work intensity Severe material deprivation At risk of poverty At risk of poverty or social exclusion % o f p o p u l a t i o n a g e d 1 8 + ( a g e d 1 8 - 5 9 f o r l o w w o r k i n t e n s i t y ) Source: EU-SILC (2009) ",
        "15 In the EU, pension expenditure represents on average 43% of gross expenditure on social protection benefits and along with general earnings-related schemes, minimum income provision for older people plays an essential role in reducing the risk of poverty amongst the elderly. Overhauls of pension systems are ongo- ing in many Member States. Major trends in pension reform concern strength- ening of the link between contributions and benefits, raising of statutory and effective retirement ages, establishment of automatic adjustment mechanisms to take account of life expectancy and GDP developments and broadening of the role of private pension schemes. As regards health care, investing in raising awareness of the benefits of health and pre- vention of physical and mental illness, as well as ensuring universal access to quality care are vital to increase effectiveness. Sustainable financing for the sector, cost-effec- tive use of care, increased use of day case surgery, integration of hospital services and innovative approaches to care delivery could also help to strengthen provision. Social inclusion policies Breaking the inter-generational transmission of poverty and ensuring fair chances for all is of great importance. Action in this area should start with fami- lies and children. Intervention during early childhood in areas such as health care and education must be strengthened. Ensuring a proper balance between work and private life and promoting labour market participation of parents is essen- tial. Availability and high quality of child care, and adequate income support for families through a combination of tax relief and well-designed and targeted uni- versal benefits are essential tools for this. Active inclusion is a key factor in attaining the EU\u2019s poverty reduction target and ensuring that the benefits of growth and employment are shared fairly. It consists of strategies combining adequate income support, access to the labour market, espe- cially for those on the margins of society, and quality services. These are needed to prevent long-term exclusion and to increase the efficiency of social spending. Cover- age of social safety nets should be improved by ensuring sustainable financing of social services and the quality of interventions should also be raised. ",
        "16 EU financial instruments to combat poverty The European Social Fund (ESF) is the main EU-level financial instrument for pro- moting employment, social inclusion and equal opportunities and for developing peoples\u2019 skills and competences. With a total budget of EUR 76 billion for the 2007- 2013 period, the ESF is directly supporting actions aimed at reaching the Europe 2020 targets in the fields of education, employment and social inclusion and is also contributing to attaining the research and development goals. The PROGRESS Programme supports projects which help to achieve EU aims and develop knowledge in the areas of employment policy, social inclusion, social protec- tion reforms and equal opportunities, as well as the implementation of EU social policy. The European Microfinance Facility aims to contribute to providing around EUR 500 million for loans to small businesses in the years leading up to 2020. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) aims at reducing disparities between regions and combating persistently high levels of poverty. The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) funds development of social and educational infrastructure and services, and more generally, improve- ments to quality of life and management of economic activity in rural areas. The Research Framework Programme supports advanced European socio-economic research, notably through development of new methodologies, progress indicators and research infrastructure. ",
        "17 The way forward \u2013 main messages The following messages draw on the findings of the SPC annual report and were adopted by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council of Ministers at its meeting on 7 March 2011 1 . (cid:116)(cid:1) One in five people in the EU is at risk of poverty or social exclusion and 40 million people are in a condition of severe deprivation. EU heads of State and Govern- ments have committed to lift at least 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion in the next decade. Fulfilling this objective requires ambitious national targets and the necessary measures to meet them, so to ensure that fighting poverty is part of the overall recovery strategy. It also requires the mobilisation of all stakeholders. (cid:116)(cid:1) A rapid return to growth and well designed employment and education policies are crucial to reduce poverty and social exclusion. At the same time, efforts to restore sound public finances and reform social protection systems should both aim at ensuring their sustainability and adequacy. This will also help preserving their important role as automatic stabilisers. In doing so, Member States should aim at combining effectiveness, efficiency and fairness. The most vulnerable should be protected from bearing the brunt of the consolidation measures. (cid:116)(cid:1) As Member States pursue recovery, active inclusion strategies combining income support, access to the labour market and health and social services are needed to prevent long-term exclusion while increasing the efficiency of social spending. This entails facilitating labour market participation of all, in particular women and the young; linking social assistance to activation measures and access to enabling services; as well as improving the coverage and adequacy of social safety nets where needed. Ensuring the sustainable financing of high quality social services is also crucial. 1 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/lsa/119656.pdf ",
        "18 (cid:116)(cid:1) 25 million children are at risk of poverty or exclusion in the EU. In order to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty Member States need to prioritise early childhood intervention in areas such as health and education, to enhance the availability of quality child care and enabling services, to promote the labour market participation of parents, and to guarantee adequate income support to families with children through a combination of well designed universal and targeted benefits. (cid:116)(cid:1) Policies to tackle the most persistent and severe forms of poverty and social exclusion require a combination of universal and targeted approaches. Specific attention should be given to preventing and fighting homelessness and housing exclusion; to addressing fuel poverty and financial exclusion. Promoting social inclusion and tackling discrimination of groups at risk needs to be a core ele- ment of social policies. (cid:116)(cid:1) Maximising employment years and minimising the effects of career breaks is cru- cial in ensuring future pension adequacy and long-term financial sustainability of pensions systems . This entails raising employment rates and pension coverage \u2013 notably for the youth and women \u2013 for example by crediting involuntary career breaks and increasing the effective retirement age, including by tightening early retirement pathways and enhancing conditions and incentives for older workers to work longer and finding ways to adapt pension rights to developments in life expectancy. (cid:116)(cid:1) Ensuring universal access to quality care for all will require renewed efforts to maintain an efficient health sector. Increasing effectiveness, sustainability and responsiveness of health care and long-term care in the context of austerity and ageing will be necessary, including through innovative and coordinated health and social care delivery, such as integrated pathways for the treat- ment of chronic diseases. Investing in health promotion and disease preven- tion (including mental health problems) can bring high returns in both in social and economic terms. ",
        "19 (cid:116)(cid:1) The success of the Europe 2020 Strategy depends on an integrated and coherent approach between all relevant policy areas in particular social, employment and economic policies as well as close cooperation between all levels of government, social partners and civil society. Linking EU funds to Europe 2020 priorities and supporting social innovation will enhance effectiveness. (cid:116)(cid:1) The Commission and Member States should consider the need to strengthen their capacity to assess the social impacts of their major policy and spending deci- sions as part of overall impact assessments, in line with Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and in the context of the Euro- pean Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion. Improving the timeliness of social statistics and enhancing analytical capacity is also crucial. (cid:116)(cid:1) The SPC will provide its input on how to ensure coherence between the objec- tives and the working-methods of the Social OMC and the new context of the Europe 2020 Strategy and its governance, on the basis of the experience of the first Euro- pean Semester of Europe 2020. 2 2 European Semesters are to be held annually from 2011 and are six-month periods during which Member State budgetary and structural policies are reviewed to detect inconsistencies and imbalances.
