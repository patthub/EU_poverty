        "Research and Innovation FOOD 2030 Pathways for Action FIXING OUR FOOD SYSTEMS The global food system is facing a range of challenges from malnutrition, climate change, resource scarcity, biodiversity loss, soil degradation, a growing and ageing population, urbanisation, food waste and food poverty. COVID-19 has shown the pivotal importance of functioning food supply chains and the need to further increase their resilience to emergencies and crises like pandemics, climate change and geopolitical forces. To address these challenges, a food system transformation is required which shifts towards more sustainable and healthy diets and aims to ensure food and nutrition security for all. This requires a better understanding of the interactions between the different components of the current food systems to maximise co- benefits and accelerate such a system-wide transformation. The European Commission (EC) is now leading the way to future-proof our food systems for sustainability, health and inclusion. Through its Farm to Fork strategy and its broader European Green Deal policy priorities it commits to ambitious food systems objectives that will be decisive in ensuring a just and fair transition respecting planetary boundaries. These important policy advances also align with the recommendations set out in the EC Strategic Advice Mechanism Opinion Towards a Sustainable Food System , which highlights the need to move from food as a commodity towards food as more of a common good. The Farm to Fork strategy highlights research and innovation (R&I) as key drivers in accelerating the transition to sustainable, healthy and inclusive food systems from primary production to consumption. R&I can help develop and test solutions, overcome barriers and uncover new market opportunities. It mentions Horizon Europe (HE) and some key areas of research such as the microbiome, food from the oceans, urban food systems, alternative proteins, agro- ecological approaches and living laboratories, and the HE Soil Health and Food Mission. It further refers to the HE Partnership for Safe and sustainable food systems for people, planet and climate that is expected to put in place an R&I governance mechanism engaging Member States and food systems actors from farm to fork, to deliver innovative solutions providing co-benefits for nutrition, climate, circularity and communities. These R&I ambitions build on FOOD 2030 which, since 2016, has convened around and fostered a systems approach to R&I policy that connects land and sea, producers to consumers, from \u2018farm-to fork to gut and back\u2019. ",
        "FOOD 2030 \u2022 Provides a vision and policy narrative that through well-governed and more systemic R&I policy, we can develop impactful solutions to the urgent, complex and interconnected challenges inherent to food systems that need to be transformed to respect planetary boundaries, to provide healthy, safe and nutritious food and diets for all, and to sustain a diverse, fair and inclusive thriving food economy. \u2022 Provides a framing and multi-actor engagement process within which R&I and R&I policy can flourish, European competiveness can grow, citizens and a wide diversity of stakeholders can engage, multiple global challenges can be addressed, and innovative solutions \u2013 from new products, tools, approaches and technologies to social, governance and institutional innovation, and new business models - can be developed, tested and demonstrated. \u2022 Applies a systemic approach to connect, scale-up and boost EU R&I and investments to provide solutions to four overarching priorities: Nutrition for sustainable and healthy diets Climate -smart and environmentally sustainable food systems Circular and resource efficient food systems Food systems Innovation and empowerment of communities The Reflection Paper Towards a Sustainable Europe by 2030 , includes FOOD 2030 as an activity closely aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which implies that economies and societies are seen as embedded parts of the biosphere. FOOD 2030 PATHWAYS FOR ACTION FOOD 2030 has finally entered its deployment stage that targets ten Pathways for Action. These aim to provide a structured basis for R&I policy and R&I areas relevant to building up Horizon Europe and future R&I programmes in Europe and beyond. The Pathways represent key levers of change where R&I can have a deep and multiple impact in realising the food system vision. Each pathway sets out the systemic challenges, the expected co-benefits, barriers to and enablers of change, and highlights potential R&I areas meriting further consideration and investment. The pathways do not cover all areas requiring food system intervention. However, they all respect the FOOD 2030 philosophy in that they integrate land and sea, production to consumption, deliver co-benefits to the FOOD 2030 four priorities, which are also at the heart of the Farm to Fork strategy and Green Deal priorities. Additional key areas of work relating to sustainable primary production, biodiversity, water management and rural development aspects are dealt with in other parts of Horizon Europe, which include R&I on healthy soils, agroecology, alternative pesticides, rural growth, precision farming, and work in close complementarity with the FOOD 2030 actions.

        "Many of the pathways have strong interconnections and it is exactly here that co-creation across the different parts of the food system can lead to the expected co-benefits, and a greater farm-to-fork coherence working under a food system R&I policy framework. In addition, the Pathways will deliver on issues linked to the renewed European Research Area (ERA) policy priorities and the EU circular and sustainable Bioeconomy Strategy and Action Plan. Investments in Food systems R&I also provide promising avenues for the Next Generation EU Recovery Package to deploy a reinforced EU budget to help repair the immediate economic and social damage brought by the coronavirus pandemic, kickstart the recovery and prepare for a better future for the next generation. FOOD 2030 will make use of Horizon Europe to deliver on these Pathways; but far more can be achieved if we work together . Collaborating closely with other Food Systems R&I funders and performers will provide more focus, joined-up actions, impact and leveraging of R&I investments. As such, FOOD 2030 will continue to convene around these issues and foster better R&I governance. Horizon Europe has the chance to provide practical working examples of these pathways employing a multi-actor approach to R&I that involves a wide diversity of sectors including primary production, food processing, logistics, retailing, food services (e.g. restaurants, canteens) and public health, etc. and stakeholders including researchers and academia, policymakers, SME and industry, NGO, educators, knowledge brokers, consumers and civil society; upstream and throughout the R&I process, to implement responsible research and innovation approach. If successful, FOOD 2030 can help drive policy reform, new social norms, innovation and development of disruptive technologies that will profoundly transform our food systems for sustainability, resilience, health and inclusion, in Europe and beyond .
