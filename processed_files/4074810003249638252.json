        "www.eesc.europa.eu 1 EDITORIAL Students\u2019 initiatives win EESC Civil Society Prize 2011 Dear readers, Over the past months, many European citizens have been gripped fi rst by anxiety and then by pes- simism. Th e social costs of the ongoing economic crisis are enormous in terms of youth unemploy- ment, social exclusion and the worsening situation of more and more SMEs. We can\u2019t deny that there are reasons to be worried about our future, the future of Europeans. But before we throw in the towel, we should look back at the history of the EU, and then we will see that it has been a collective success story which has always been threatened by diff erent types of crises. A whole generation of Europeans has grown up with the values that forged this ambitious political, social and economic project. Th ese principles have had signifi cant results, two of which lie in the fact that the EU is the world\u2019s most attractive single market and that it represents the highest level of political integration among states anywhere in the world. Over the last 61 years, solidarity, integration and innovation have given our generation com- pletely new and better opportunities. Th at is why we must not give up our values. Standing by European values means combining a long-term vision with the capacity to react fast. On the one hand, the Europe 2020 strategy off ers a com- prehensive agenda of reforms designed to secure sustainable growth and to make the Union more resilient in the future. Th is is the way to improve competitive- ness through innovation and to create better opportunities for young Europeans struggling to cope with the crisis. Our everyday work at the Committee has always focused on this long-term perspective, which involves adopting opinions and hold- ing public hearings on all the issues aff ecting European civil society. Th ese day-to- day eff orts are our contribution to Europe\u2019s future. However, the current situation demands immediate measures to secure confi - dence in our long-term project and this is what the Committee tried to do at its last plenary session. During this session, we discussed eurobonds, fi nancial regulation and fi scal policy, once again off ering our institution as a platform for exchanging diff erent civil society viewpoints. European citizens have elected very diff erent governments over the last six decades. All these political representatives have made European integration a driver for welfare in Europe. Th e best example of this is the steady improvement to the single market, to which many EESC opinions and initiatives have contributed. Th e European Council meeting in December has agreed on a number of important measures, but European civil society, which we represent, tells us every day that we need more Europe. Th is is a message that we have been hearing for over 50 years at the EESC and this should encourage decision-makers to take the necessary actions.

Since its launch in 2008, hundreds of exchange students have volun- teered for tasks ranging from plant- ing trees to playing Santa Claus for children in local hospitals, donating blood or fi ghting forest fi res. Th e idea is to help students get connected with their host countries by encouraging them to take part in activities benefi cial to the local community. \u2018Some people think international students come, take what they want, and then leave. But this project shows local people the benefi ts of Erasmus, and creates real integration,\u2019 explains ESN President Tania Berman. Th e second prize went to Euro- pean Alternatives for their annual TranseuropaFestival, which in May 2011 took place simultan- eously in 12 European cities fea- turing music, films, exhibitions, lectures and debates. Trans- europaFestival is at once a cultural festival and a political event aimed at celebrating political integration, solidarity, social diversity, toler- ance and exchange, over two weeks of free public events throughout Europe. \u2018We campaign for an alternative Europe, a democratic Europe created by the people, where all citizens are equal,\u2019 says Niccol\u00f2 Milanese, Co-President of European Alternatives, which is made up of individual members and local groups in some 17 EU countries and beyond. Th e third prize was awarded to the Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions (OBESSU), which brings together secondary school student unions from 21 Euro- pean countries and campaigns to boost school students\u2019 rights. Its \u2018Light on the rights\u2019 bus tour took off in autumn of 2010, when OBESSU activists made a 10 000 km bus trip through Europe, gaining an insight into the challenges facing school stu- dents from the Balkans to Finland. It was part of a wider project aimed at supporting the European Declar- ation of School Students Rights and the accompanying campaign \u2018Light on the rights\u2019. \u2018We see the prize as a further push to promote the Declar- ation of School Student Rights,\u2019 says Secretary-General Viviana Galli. For President Staffan Nilsson, the Civil Society Prize is a symbol to highlight the excellence of initia- tives generated by civil society play- ers in Europe who have developed projects having a positive impact on Europeans\u2019 lives and have promoted European identity and integration. For 2011, he chose the theme \u2018Dialogue and participation for EU values: integration, diversity, solidarity, tolerance\u2019.

It provides a chance for all of us to refl ect on how Europeans are living longer and staying healthier than ever before \u2014 and to realise the opportunities that represents. Th e challenge for politicians and stakeholders will be to improve opportunities for active ageing in general and for living independently, in areas as diverse as employment, healthcare, social services, adult learning, volunteering, housing, IT services or transport. Th e European Year seeks to raise awareness of the issues and the best ways of dealing with them. But above all it seeks to encourage all policymakers and stakeholders to set themselves goals and take action to meet them. It should not just mean debating; it should start bringing tangible results.

        "2 More Europe: the only way out of the crisis Th e second day of the 476th EESC plenary session opened with a state- ment from the President, entitled \u2018Overcoming the crisis \u2014 Towards a policy programme for sustainable recovery\u2019. Mr Nilsson affi rmed that there is only one way to drive the EU out of the fi nancial, sovereign debt, economic and social crisis: deeper European integration. More Europe was needed in terms of fi scal policy, the mutualisation of sovereign risk and the restoration of long-term solvency, and also growth, competi- tiveness and jobs. Th e Community method must be reasserted and the Commission\u2019s leadership strength- ened. Mr Nilsson emphasised how important it is to safeguard our eco- nomic and social model, and stated that the Committee was determined to deepen its network of national eco- nomic and social councils, as for the exit from the crisis to be acceptable White Paper on transport On 5 December 2011, the EESC and the European Commission held a one-day joint conference entitled \u2018Th e White Paper on transport \u2014 Th e viewpoint of European civil society\u2019 at the EESC headquarters. Th e event brought together a broad range of transport users and stakeholders to discuss their views on this major policy document. As President Nils- son underlined, \u2018We are here today because the measures proposed in the EU plan must be fully endorsed by European civil society to deliver their full benefi ts. Th e main aim of today\u2019s event is therefore to discuss the Commission proposal from a critical perspective.\u2019 The European Commission pre- sented its \u2018Roadmap to a single Euro- pean transport area\u2019 in March 2011. It includes a set of 40 specifi c initiatives for the next decade aimed at building a competitive transport system, which will increase mobility, remove major barriers in key areas and fuel growth and employment. At the same time, From left to right: Pierre Jean Coulon, EESC rapporteur; Siim Kallas , Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for transport; Staff an Nilsson, EESC President; Jacki Davis, conference moderator; Anna Midera, Deputy Director, Polish Ministry of Transport, Construction and Maritime Economy; and Antonio Costa, COR rapporteur. the proposals will dramatically reduce Europe\u2019s dependence on imported oil and achieve a 60 % cut in carbon emis- sions in transport by 2050. Interested parties were consulted on a number of occasions while the White Paper was being draft ed and it has been under scrutiny from EU stakeholders since publication. Th e conference, however, gave the Euro- pean Economic and Social Commit- tee, the Committee of the Regions and the European Parliament the opportunity to communicate their opinions to a wider audience. Pierre Jean Coulon, rapporteur for the EESC opinion, stressed that: \u2018Strik- ing the right balance between meet- ing the long-term emission reduction targets set out in the road map and continuing to meet the transport needs of European society will clearly be a tall order and will call for more guidance from the Commission.\u2019 Th ree European citizens were also invited to play an active part in the discussions by expressing their main expectations as regular transport users. \u2018Like the European Commis- sion, we are aware that some of the proposals made in the White Paper might suffer from a lack of politi- cal and public consensus,\u2019 stressed the EESC President. \u2018Over the next three years, the Committee will work on promoting a regular debate with civil society on the implementation of the White Paper\u2019s measures,\u2019 he added. (ac) \u25cf from a social standpoint all players would have to be involved. J.-P. Delevoye, President of the French Economic, Social and Envir- onmental Council, gave a realistic and pro-European speech, convinced that \u2018Europe is not the problem but the solution\u2019. For him, deeper inte- gration meant, above all, the Member States recognising the EU\u2019s assets. The three group presidents expressed their support for both speakers. George Dassis (Workers\u2019 Group) shared his concern about the power of the fi nancial markets. Luca Jahier (Various Interests Group) called for a structured system of eurobonds to avoid more fi nancial turbulence. Henri Malosse (Employ- ers\u2019 Group) pointed out the need for better education and stronger sup- port for SMEs. (asp/mvd) \u25cf The single European sky is too important to fail There was a palpable sense of urgency at the high-level conference held in Warsaw on 28 November to look into the faltering implementa- tion of the \u2018Single European sky II\u2019 package. Adopted two years ago and intended to do away with the costly and ineffi cient division of European airspace along national borders, the package has not yet been put into eff ect. \u2018Th e creation of a single Euro- pean airspace is still far off. We risk failing to meet ever-growing demand for air travel in the com- ing years,\u2019 warned Siim Kallas, EU Transport Commissioner. His view was echoed by Jacek Krawc- zyk, EESC Vice-President and rap- porteur of numerous opinions on SES II. \u2018Failure to implement the package will have a hugely nega- tive impact on the future of Euro- pean aviation and will hit operators and passengers alike,\u2019 Mr Krawczyk said. Th e key element of the package is the establishment of functional air- space blocks (FAB), within which navigation services are provided on the basis of stringent perform- ance requirements and regard- less of national borders. However, out of nine blocks envisaged, only two have so far been signed into existence: Denmark\u2013Sweden and United Kingdom\u2013Ireland. Urging countries that are dragging their feet over establishing FABs to act, Jacek Krawczyk said: \u2018 Pacta sunt serv- anda . You cannot just walk away from what you have agreed on.\u2019 The implementation delay was further highlighted by Commis- sioner Kallas, who said that as few as fi ve EU countries had fulfi lled the agreed capacity and cost-effi ciency targets. \u2018I am not here to name and shame particular countries but it is worryingly clear that the time for refl ection is over. We need to deliver now,\u2019 he said. In line with his country\u2019s open- door policy, S\u0142awomir Nowak, the new Polish Minister for Trans- port, Construction and Maritime Economy, representing the Polish Presidency, made it clear that \u2018the external dimension of the single sky is of key importance to Poland\u2019. Referring to the title of the confer- ence, \u2018Implementation of the single European sky (SES) and its exten- sion beyond the European Union\u2019, he said that \u2018the common aviation area must not stop at EU borders\u2019. Th e conference was concluded by the adoption of the Warsaw declar- ation reiterating the need for rapid implementation of SES II, which \u2018will deliver significant benefits to all actors involved\u2019. \u2018Th e single European sky is too important to fail,\u2019 it said. Th is successful conference hosted some 300 participants and was a joint event of the Polish EU Council Presidency, the European Commis- sion and the European Economic and Social Committee.

        "3 Laying the ground for Rio+20 Is a sustainable economy an unachievable goal? EDITORIAL January 2012/1 Special edition EN ISSN 1725-1923 EE S C in fo European Economic and Social Committee a bridge between Europe and organised civil society Dear Readers, Th e upcoming United Nations summit- level Conference on Sustainable Develop- ment in Rio will focus on greening the economy and reducing poverty, which are interlinked. The summit aims to renew the commitment of our political leaders to meet global sustainable devel- opment milestones. While such initiatives should be applauded, the conference is an apt reminder that politics and policy alone cannot defeat poverty and disease, or guarantee clean water and air. Less than fi ve years on from the millen- nium development goals, nearly a billion people are still suff ering from hunger. Th ese issues recognise no borders. Renewed political commitment alone cannot build schools, clean our air or change our excessive consumerist behaviour. Nine planet Earths would be required to absorb the world\u2019s carbon if every person had the same consumer lifestyle as that enjoyed in rich countries. Global responsibility has to be taken by governments at all levels. For it to work, civil society will need to take part in all the transitional phases. Th is involves strategising and planning, implementing changes and ensuring consistent follow-up. Civil society must have a say in Rio+20 because it is civil society which will actually make the policy, govern and implement behavioural changes towards a sustainable and greener future. Civil society can pave the way for transition. Th e EESC will push world leaders at Rio to invest in sustainable tech- nologies and projects while phasing out the types of subsidies that damage the environment. A fair transition to a green economy requires a dialogue with civil society and the social partners on the eff ects of transition on the labour market and society at large. We need to guarantee dialogue between and among civil society and decision-makers. Civil societies will both recommend and implement the necessary policy recommendations. We are ready. We are part of the change. Staff an Nilsson EESC President Th e EESC is to hold a major confer- ence on sustainable development on 7 and 8 February 2012 in the run-up to the United Nations Rio+20 sum- mit in June. Th e purpose of the EESC conference is to voice the positions of European civil society on Rio+20 and to contribute to its success. Th e EESC will forward its conclusions to the negotiat- ing parties at the UN conference and to civil society partners around the world. Following an introduction to the current status of the Rio+20 proc- ess, the EESC conference will focus on the green economy as a means of enhancing sustainable development by respecting the limits of natural resources. Th e fi rst general debate will tackle the European contribution to sustainability, while the second will address sustainable development in non-EU countries. The four workshops listed below will provide the opportunity to discuss Sustainability concerns so much more than just the environment. Sustainability cuts across our econ- omies, governance and people from all walks of life. Th is is why solutions to global problems mean weaving sustainability into so many disparate policies. Given our reliance on each other in a globalised world, it is astonish- ing that sustainable solutions are still lacking. Short-term benefi ts and issues in more depth and to develop conference conclusions: \u25a0 Food, water and energy for eve- ryone; \u25a0 Sustainable consumption and pro- duction; \u25a0 A fair transition to a green econ- omy \u2014 the social dimension; and \u25a0 Involving civil society in the transi- tion to a green economy. For the past year, the EESC has been coordinating with stakeholders in the EU and the rest of the world to prepare for Rio+20. It also intends to issue a joint statement with its counterparts in Brazil, China, India, Russia and South Africa, to be presented at/to the UN conference. After a broad consultation of European civil society organised by profi t returns oft en ignore long-term consequences. As our demand for resources and energy increases, the overall challenges we face become increasingly complex. Th is is com- mon sense. Th e world as we know it is pow- ered by the economy and operated by people. But the oft en devastating impact of our economic machine on the environment has direct conse- quences for billions of people. Water, a primary resource, is becoming scarcer in many regions that rely on arable and livestock farming. Fos- sil fuels poison our rivers and skies. Changes in the balance of nature mean that many plants and animals can no longer survive. Th ese factors only exacerbate widespread poverty and poor health. We need to decouple economic growth from environmental dam- age. Th is is the foundation of a green economy. A green economy can help the EESC\u2019s Sustainable Development Observatory (SDO) through a series of hearings, the Committee adopted an opinion setting out civil society\u2019s contributions to Rio+20 in Septem- ber 2011. Th is opinion contributed to the European Union\u2019s position on sus- tainable development, which was then submitted to the UN Rio+20 confer- ence secretariat. Th e EESC\u2019s position is that Rio+20 must push for a global shift towards a green and sustainable economy. Heads of government will also need to engage in the conference. And fi nally, global responsibility has to be taken by all governments at all levels and by civil society. The EU also needs to promote a change in consumption behaviour and ensure that the transition towards a greener economy does not come at the expense of people living just above or below the poverty line. For this reason, eradicating poverty and meet- ing the seemingly elusive millennium development goals must fi gure high on the Rio+20 agenda. The EESC conference intends to pay particular attention to the environ- mental and social pillars of sustainable development. According to the Com- mittee, any transition towards a greener economy must fi nd a balanced synergy between the environment and social development. A greener economy should reinforce sustainable develop- ment, preserve natural resources and mitigate climate change. \u25cf eliminate poverty and social injustice while preserving natural resources for future generations. To make it hap- pen, the transition must respect the principles of justice, cooperation and shared responsibilities. But that takes a lot of eff ort and political will \u2014 two commodities too oft en in short sup- ply. The EESC, however, has a plan that could finally transform the world\u2019s fuel-guzzling engine into a more harmonised, just and sustain- able economy. We are proposing a \u2018green economy\u2019 UN mandate based on six pillars: indicators; regulations; education; fi scal policy; research; and targets for a green economy. We believe we can make it happen. We believe we can shift the balance back in favour of nature and people. Hans-Joachim Wilms President of the EESC\u2019s Sustainable Development Observatory The EESC has launched an online interactive platform to engage with its stakeholders, mainly for but not limited to civil society organisations willing to contribute to a joint European civil society input to Rio+20.

        "4 Action on Nepal Nepal\u2019s struggle for food security is threatened by massive imports of hybrid seeds that are not suited to local climatic conditions and soils. Th e hybrid crops do not produce seeds for subsequent crops and require expen- sive chemicals. \u2018Every year, farmers are forced to purchase new seeds from the com- panies that manufacture them,\u2019 says Bed Prasad Khatiwada of ActionAid Nepal. \u2018To offset the costs, Nepal\u2019s government subsidises the imported seeds and chemicals.\u2019 But the long-term eff ects and onus on monoculture agriculture are coun- ter-productive, added Mr Khatiwada. Nepal\u2019s climate and environment range from subtropical to temperate to arctic. One crop cannot grow in all such conditions. In 2009, hybrid maize crops failed, ruining the lives of thousands. In 2010, hybrid rice crops also failed. Nepal\u2019s government compensated the farmers with chemicals for next sea- son\u2019s harvest. \u2018In September [2011], Monsanto signed a deal with USAID in Nepal. Th ey wanted to partner with Nepal\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture,\u2019 Mr Khati- wada told EESC info . \u2018But local farm- ers protested and the government backed off .\u2019 \u2018We [ActionAid] are not against Monsanto but we are against imported hybrid seeds that are not climate- treatable and sustainable in terms of supply and costs,\u2019 he continued, add- ing that Nepal\u2019s agriculture employs around 75 % of its population and accounts for nearly 34 % of its GDP. In 2008, through ActionAid Nepal, Mr Khatiwada started a seed bank of 60 diff erent cereals and legumes. Th e seeds are endogenous and produce high-yield crops that help pave the way to greater food security, he explained. Around 400 Nepalese farmers use the seed bank. Th e project is set to expand in 2012. Th e numerous challenges faced by ActionAid\u2019s Nepal project are similar to those experienced by local com- munities throughout the world. Th e EESC considers access to resources, food and energy for everyone as a top priority on the global sustainability agenda. Any transition to sustainable development must address the social dimension, according to the EESC opinion \u2018Rio+20: towards the green economy and better governance\u2019. Indeed, food security and sustain- able agriculture is one of seven top priorities that will be addressed at the summit. However, Kirsten Hj\u00f8rnholm S\u00f8rensen, policy adviser at Action- Aid Denmark, fears the UN summit may not take into consideration the concerns addressed by developing countries, like Nepal\u2019s small farming communities. \u2018Th e risk at Rio+20 is the focus on the transition towards the green economy because it may replace one position of power, enjoyed by rich countries, with another,\u2019 she told EESC info . Any transition must be coupled with sharing technology, debt relief, ensuring democratic participa- tion and action on climate change, she added. \u25cf RIO+20, a time for change Th e United Nations Secretary-Gen- eral of the Rio+20 Conference, Sha Zukang, has the unenviable task of making sustainable development a functioning global policy. Twenty years aft er the Earth Summit was held in Rio de Janeiro, leaders, high- level offi cials, civil society and insti- tutions from around the world will gather once again in Brazil. The aim is to agree to a set of broad binding principles that will secure a brighter future for every- one \u2014 and our natural planet. Yet, 20 years on, there is still no univer- sally accepted defi nition for sustain- able development. The stakes are nonetheless high. Th e EESC Presi- dent, Staffan Nilsson, has called Rio+20 a \u2018make-or-break moment for a new economic order\u2019. In the run-up to the summit, divergent views have emerged on how best to address sustainable development. Two preparatory meetings have taken place, the first in May 2010 and the second in March 2011. Th e third and fi nal meeting will be held at the end of May 2012. Such meetings provide an insight into what to expect in Rio. \u2018During the preparatory process so far, we have reviewed progress and gaps in implementing existing commitments, and we have identi- fi ed new and emerging challenges,\u2019 said Mr Zukang. \u2018While there remains a diversity of views and per- spectives, we have seen a growing convergence of understanding and approaches toward the two themes,\u2019 he added. The conference will focus on greening the economy in the context of poverty eradication and sustain- able development. It will also aim to create an institutional framework for sustainable development. How- ever, the EESC believes that success hinges on direct input from civil society. Consequently, the UN is actively mobilising civil society for a global conversation via the Internet and social networks. The EESC is urging leaders to ensure that any transition towards a green economy is based on qualita- tive economic growth. Such growth involves eliminating poverty and social injustice. Indeed, the social dimension is imperative for sustain- able development and a more just global society. \u25cf \u00a9 A c t i o n A i d N e p a l 2 0 1 1 A green economy requires buy-in from a green society Without the active involvement of civil society, Rio+20 will not be able to navigate efforts to green the economy, said EESC member Hans-Joachim Wilms. As part of European prepara- tions for Rio+20, the EU and its Member States submitted their collective position to the confer- ence\u2019s secretariat in November (see related article). In keeping with the Union\u2019s stance towards the importance of bolstering civil society involvement, the EESC\u2019s aim was to provide valuable input to this document. \u2018For us at the EESC, it\u2019s very important to involve civil society from the outset,\u2019 said Mr Wilms (Workers\u2019 Group, Germany), the rapporteur for the EESC\u2019s opinion. \u2018We didn\u2019t just want to produce a big report, [\u2026] we wanted to find answers and, above all, get the whole of civil society on board,\u2019 added Mr Wilms, who is also the chair of the Sustainable Development Observa- tory. In the opinion on European civil society contributions to Rio+20, the EESC welcomed the fact that the EU is also now addressing \u2018the social dimension of sustainable devel- opment\u2019. However, the European Commission, in its Rio+20 com- munication, did not stress the social dimension enough, according to the Committee. \u2018A successful transition to a sus- tainable economy depends on it being accepted and supported by civil society,\u2019 said Mr Wilms, noting that this required the involvement of non-governmental organisations and businesses before, during and aft er the conference, not just internation- ally, but also at regional, national and local levels. Th is is because civil soci- ety \u2014 especially consumers and busi- nesses \u2014 is going to have to invest heavily in new innovations, change its behaviour and perhaps even make some sacrifi ces. In addition to its call for full civil society participation in the Rio+20 process, the opinion on which Mr Wilms worked urged the EU to put its own house in order so as to strengthen its position in the negotia- tions and to act as a role model for other regions. Eff orts to green the economy, he pointed out, hold the potential to help eradicate the poverty that keeps over a billion people in hunger and destitution, and to create millions of new and sustainable jobs. \u2018Th e EESC is convinced that the transition to a green economy must be integrated into an overarching sus- tainable development strategy. Active policy measures are needed to ensure a fair transition to a green economy,\u2019 he added. Th ese include measures to strike a balance between green jobs created and jobs lost, as well as to apply the \u2018decent work\u2019 principles of the International Labour Organisa- tion (ILO) to them, and to maintain ongoing dialogue between govern- ments and social players. Achieving these goals would require signifi cant public funding to be allocated to the social dimension of the green econ- omy. \u25cf EESC T IMELINE S USTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT R IO +20 DEC NOV OCT SEP 2 0 1 1 AUG JUL JUN \u2022 EESC P RESIDENT S TATEMENT ON EUROPEAN C OMMISSION C OMMUNICATION ON R IO +20 A DOPTION OF EESC O PINION ON R IO +20 21 21 7 R IO +20: EESC H EARING ON G REEN E CONOMY 7-8 1-2 EESC-B RAZIL / R OUNDTABLE ON S USTAINABLE D EVELOPMENT EESC-C HINA / R OUNDTABLE ON S USTAINABLE H OUSING R ESOURCE E FFICIENCY ALLIANCE C ONFERENCE ON R IO +20 C O - ORGANISED BY EESC EESC info \u2014 January 2012/1 Special edition ",
        "5 Towards the low-carbon revolution Low-carbon economic prosperity is possible, but it needs the right policies, technologies and political commitment. Above all, it requires a revolution in attitudes, asserts EESC member Richard Adams (Various Interests Group, United Kingdom). As the global population passes the 7 billion mark, one thing seems certain \u2014 humanity is consuming too many resources and causing too much pollution for the earth to handle. \u2018The fundamental principles underlying sustainable economics need to be taken to heart,\u2019 stressed Mr Adams, who is also a consult- ant in social, environmental and ethical business. These principles include striking a sustainable bal- ance between the global economy and ecosystem and concentrating on meeting people\u2019s needs rather than their wants. In the belief that real change begins at home, the EU has been making significant strides in shrinking its climate footprint. Over the past two decades, it has slashed its emissions by 16 % while its economy has grown by 40 % \u2014 which demonstrates that economic growth coupled with low emissions is a feasible reality. Th e EU is also on track to meet its 2020 targets of cutting emissions to 20 % below their 1990 levels and boosting the share of renewable resources in its energy mix to 20 %.

The Europe 2020 strategy launched seven \u2018fl agship initiatives\u2019 aimed at promoting smart, green and inclusive growth over the current decade. Th ese include the \u2018resource- effi cient Europe\u2019 fl agship which seeks to exploit scarce resources \u2014 from food and water to raw materials \u2014 in both a smarter and more effi cient way. Th e initiative places resource effi - ciency as the guiding principle for EU policies in a wide and diverse range of areas, including energy, transport, climate change, industry, commodities, agriculture, fisher- ies, biodiversity and regional devel- opment. In order to empower the various stakeholders to fulfil their resource-efficiency potential, the Commission has outlined a number of specifi c sub-strategies, including a low-carbon road map (see above). \u2018Th e EESC welcomes the fl agship initiative, but considers it too vague,\u2019 noted Lutz Ribbe (Various Interests Group, Germany) who was the rap- porteur for the EESC\u2019s opinion on the initiative. \u2018It is essential to set out in the most concrete terms possible what changes are needed and how these are to be implemented.\u2019 For the 20 individual sub-initia- tives outlined, the EESC asked the Commission to fl esh out what exactly it means by \u2018resource effi ciency\u2019; what can already be achieved through technical optimisation; which sectors precisely require \u2018signifi cant transi- tion\u2019; and what specifi c behavioural changes consumers and producers are required to make. Moreover, the EESC questions why \u2018resource-effi cient Europe\u2019 has been made part of the Europe 2020 strategy. \u2018Resource-effi cient Europe is a central part of the sustainable half way towards achieving its tar- get of improving energy efficiency by 20 %. Looking beyond 2020, the Euro- pean Commission has unveiled its \u2018Road map for moving to a competi- tive low-carbon economy in 2050\u2019 which seeks to reduce European emis- sions by a staggering 80\u201395 % by the middle of the century. Achieving this requires substantial investment in, among other things, new renewable energy, energy-efficient buildings, hybrid and electric vehicles, \u2018smart\u2019 energy grids and low-carbon power generation. In its opinion on the road map, which was compiled by Mr Adams, the EESC \u2018urges all the European insti- tutions to take it fully into account as a guide\u2019. In order to pave the way to the 2050 targets, the EESC believes more ambitious intermediary goals are required, such as raising the 2020 emission targets to a 25 % reduction, and aiming for a 40 % cut by 2030. The opinion also recommended that the Commission put together \u2018a comprehensive new package of measures to incentivise the massive new investment needed\u2019. In addition, it calls for civil society to \u2018be fully involved through structured and permanent dialogue on the particular strategic plans\u2019. Th is is necessary because the tran- sition to a low-carbon economy \u2018will require a radical change in public atti- tudes towards a simpler, low-carbon lifestyle to give politicians the con- fi dence to make the necessary deci- sions\u2019, emphasised Mr Adams. \u2018In short, economic sustainability needs a revolution in people\u2019s expectations and values.\u2019 \u2018Our global institutions are still in their infancy, unable to carry the bur- den of the future,\u2019 he concluded. \u2018My hope is that the EU will keep trying to fi nd a way forward.\u2019 \u25cf development strategy, but no sub- stitute for it,\u2019 explained Ribbe, who is the Director of the Department for Nature Conservation Policy of the European Nature Heritage Fund (EuroNatur). To highlight the crucial impor- tance of getting it right, Ribbe noted that \u2018the negative consequences of unsustainable economics will impact fully on future generations and have to be borne by them. \u2018Th e challenge and the question is how to develop a collective sense of responsibility towards future gener- ations amongst those alive today,\u2019 he said. \u2018We need to move beyond our focus on GDP, so a fundamental pub- lic debate on the concept of growth is overdue. \u2018It is absolutely crucial that civil society and business are properly included in this process from the outset,\u2019 Ribbe concluded. \u25cf EESC info \u2014 January 2012/1 Special edition ",
        "6 Young businesses sidelined Green investments should theoretically help to create new business opportun- ities and jobs in numerous sectors. But Europe\u2019s economic dynamism and venture capital remain wholly inad- equate, according to Dimitris Tsigos, President of the European Confedera- tion of Young Entrepreneurs. \u2018The key problem is capital and R & D to create new products and services which require risk fi nancing,\u2019 said Mr Tsigos, adding that Europe\u2019s single market has yet to reach the real economy. \u2018Risk fi nancing for start-ups in Europe is terrible when compared to the USA,\u2019 he continued. Europe\u2019s short-term trends in investment, employment and unem- ployment, as well as GDP per capita and labour productivity, remain bleak. Nearly one third of Europe\u2019s population aged 25 to 64 still have no formal qualifi cations. Given such conditions, creating and fi nding opportunities for busi- nesses is proving difficult. Despite the bleak outlook, Mr Tsigos believes that the current fi nancial crisis may actually help Europe to boost innov- ation in the real market among enter- prising SMEs. Yet Europe\u2019s young entrepreneurs are struggling to get new and greener businesses into jittery markets. Banks are still not lending. And buyers for unproven products are not guaran- teed \u2014 especially if you are young, claims Codrin Paveliuc-Olariu, Presi- dent of the Young Professionals in Local Development (YPLD). YPLD aims to empower local communities to grow faster and better. \u2018Young professionals are consid- ered \u201csecond-rate\u201d citizens of the world. Although highly qualifi ed, the opinion of young professionals is not asked or taken into consideration by decision-makers,\u2019 said Mr Paveliuc- Olariu. According to him, the result is that young professionals focus more on service-oriented businesses. Th e challenges they face, and indeed the barriers to upward labour mobil- ity, are just too onerous for them to launch innovative businesses, he explained. Creating the conditions for busi- nesses to fl ourish in the transition towards a greener economy is piv- otal for sustainable development, the EESC insists. Th e Committee wants policymakers at all levels of govern- ment to encourage the transition. But this requires regulatory meas- ures, fi scal policy instruments and public spending and investment. It also requires the involvement of enterprising individuals like Dimi- tris Tsigos and Codrin Paveliuc- Olariu. \u25cf Greener economy, better jobs road map as an agenda for a better environment, more sustainable life- styles, and future growth. However, the EESC has also expressed reser- vations about the road map, calling it \u2018too vague\u2019. Th e EESC opinion on \u2018resource-efficient Europe\u2019 argues that resource efficiency should be a separate stand-alone policy and not embedded into the Europe 2020 strategy. Nonetheless, the prospect of cre- ating new work, new businesses and more growth without destroying the environment is appealing for both Europe\u2019s trade unions and policy- Food for thought on sustainability With a growing global population and tighter food supplies, European consumers and businesses can play a crucial role in ensuring the sus- tainability of the food supply chain, according to European Health and Consumer Policy Commissioner John Dalli. Th e global food crises of recent years and the unacceptable fact that over a billion people in the world go hungry have ensured that food security will be high on the agenda at the Rio+20 conference. \u2018The economic crisis, increas- ing globalisation, climate change, increasing commodity prices and scarcity of commodities as well as sociodemographic changes are hav- ing a considerable impact on the food supply chain at every level,\u2019 explained Mr Dalli. But the fact that there are now 7 billion mouths to feed, and agri- cultural surpluses have been in decline for years, does not mean that Europeans need to eat less so that others can eat more. One of the most vital contributions Europeans can make is to waste less. \u2018[Food waste and food packag- ing] are two very important aspects in the wider context of resource effi ciency, the fi nancial crisis, glo- bal food security and combating hunger,\u2019 said Mr Dalli. Of the estimated 89 million tonnes of food waste produced in Europe each year, over 60 % can be avoided if consumers plan their shopping better, retailers manage their stocks more effectively and leftovers at restaurants get used, according to a recent EU study. Reducing such unacceptable levels of food waste, Mr Dalli suggested, requires the scaling-up of current piecemeal awareness campaigns; it requires information tools, logis- tical improvements and food redis- tribution programmes such as food banks. \u2018Minimising food waste is a chal- lenging task that requires the full commitment and cooperation of all actors along the food chain and public authorities to reduce envir- onmental, economic and ethi- cal impacts,\u2019 the Commissioner emphasised. More broadly, the EESC is com- mitted to promoting the idea of global food security, as highlighted by several of its initiatives includ- ing its recent \u2018Food for everyone \u2014 Towards a global deal\u2019 conference. In his conclusions, EESC Presi- dent Staffan Nilsson highlighted years of neglect and underinvest- ment in the developing world\u2019s agricultural sector as one of the most important reasons for strains on global food supply. Remedying this requires greater investment in agriculture and agricultural research and innovation, as well as eff ective market and environmental policies, he argued. \u2018[We must] recognise that food security is a global issue and that it needs the involvement of all stake- holders, and in particular a strong contribution from farmers, con- sumers, the private sector, workers and NGOs,\u2019 Mr Nilsson said. \u25cf The transition towards a greener economy aims to create decent work and high-quality jobs. But in the face of global recession nothing is guar- anteed. In Europe, trade unions wel- comed the 2010 Cancun Declara- tions to ensure a \u2018just transition\u2019 to a low-carbon economy. However, the European Trade Union Confeder- ation (ETUC) slammed the European Commission\u2019s Energy Roadmap 2050 for failing to make any reference to how jobs and employment will be maintained and developed during the transition. \u2018A coherent EU energy policy is an essential condition for the move to a low-carbon and sustainable soci- ety, one which is sustainable in both social and environmental terms, via democratically controlled regulators that guarantee aff ordable prices for all and safety and security of supply and via social dialogue,\u2019 Emanuela Bonacina, ETUC press offi cer, told EESC Info . Th e Energy Roadmap 2050 is part of the \u2018resource-effi ciency fl agship\u2019 of the Europe 2020 strategy. Th e Euro- pean Commissioner for the Environ- ment Janez Poto\u010dnik described the makers. But climate change and carbon-reduction targets cannot be sidelined or ignored, said the ETUC, warning that the economic crisis is eroding political will and undermin- ing green policies. Investments are required to help guarantee the tran- sition, it added. Indeed, green investments gener- ate more employment in the short and medium term, according to a report released earlier this year by the International Labour Organisa- tion (ILO). According to the report, evidence supports the view that such investments generate short-term opportunities. Such opportunities, continues the report, translate into higher long-term employment levels. \u2018The greener economy will be based on the capacity for research and innovation in green technol- ogies, which should \u2014 through public policies, regulation and social dialogue \u2014 generate quality jobs and social progress,\u2019 concluded Judith Kirton-Darling, ETUC Confederal Secretary. \u25cf \u00a9 P a v e l i u c - O l a r i u 2 0 1 1 EESC info \u2014 January 2012/1 Special edition ",
        "7 2011 Euromed Summit in Istanbul: an opportunity to take stock and to look realistically and positively to the future The 10th EU\u2013China civil society round table: \u2018Time to go a step further in our partnership\u2019 For the 10th time, the round table has brought together civil society representatives from China and the European Union to exchange ideas and best practices about issues of common interest. The meeting, hosted by the European Economic and Social Committee in Munich on 1 and 2 December 2011, addressed two main topics: sustainable urban development and the ageing popula- tion, as well as social security. With regard to social protection, Staff an Nilsson, EESC President and Chair of the EU delegation, expressed his satisfaction that \u2018for the fi rst time, on the sidelines of the G20 Summit, the B20 (business organisations of the G20 countries) and the L20 (trade union organisations of the G20 countries) issued a joint statement on employment, social protection, fundamental principles and rights at work and multilateral coherence\u2019. On demographic issues, Barbara Stamm, President of the Bavarian parliament, encouraged the audi- ence to consider the low birth rate and increasing life expectancy not as a burden but as an opportunity to enhance intergenerational solidarity. According to Ursula M\u00e4nnle, Chair of the Committee for European Aff airs in the Bavarian parliament, these two issues need to be tackled at national level, in line with the sub- sidiarity principle. On the subject of sustainable cit- ies, the EESC president reminded the audience that the next EU\u2013China Summit will launch a partner- ship for sustainable urbanisation. On the issues raised at this round table, the job of civil society will be to make its voice heard, Mr Nilsson insisted. (mvd) \u25cf A pivotal year for the Euromed region culminated between 16 and 18 November in a key event for the region\u2019s civil society organisations. Th e 2011 annual summit of Euromed economic and social councils (ESCs) and similar institutions was the fi rst major gathering of all sectors of civil society in the region since the beginning of the Arab upris- ing. With President Staff an Nilsson at the helm, the EESC delegation travelled to Istanbul to co-host the summit with the EESC\u2019s partners, the Union of Chambers and Com- modity Exchanges of Turkey and the Turkish delegation of the EU\u2013 Turkey Joint Consultative Commit- tee. Th e in-depth discussions at the summit will help to shape, amongst other things, EU policy towards civil As was to be expected in a year which has been described by most commentators as being a historic one for the Euromed region, the sense of anticipation was palpable as the summit got under way with two crucial themes \u2014 \u2018Th e policy response to the new environment in the region\u2019, where discussion centred on the outlines of future policy in the region, and \u2018Th e cur- rent and future role of civil society in a new UfM\u2019, a topic that is at the heart of the EESC\u2019s work and indeed has become pivotal in the eyes of all policymakers in the region. Th ese discussions were punctu- ated by the participation of high- level speakers such as Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy Commissioner \u0160tefan F\u00fcle and Turkish Development Minister Cevdet Yilmaz. Together with the participants they gave a fl avour of what the priorities will be for the region looking ahead: consolidation of democracy and of basic human and social rights, regional economic integration and social development, amongst others. So there are clearly many challenges but also an over- riding sense of optimism that civil society can make a major diff erence in the year ahead. (gh) \u25cf Victims\u2019 rights in the EU Is there suffi cient protection for victims of crimes that occur abroad? Th e EESC wants to ensure that victims of crime are given non-discriminatory minimum rights across the EU, irrespective of their nationality or country of residence. Th e EESC opinion on victims\u2019 rights, draft ed by Ms Walker Shaw (Workers\u2019 Group, United Kingdom), follows the Euro- pean Commission proposals intended to reinforce existing national measures. With this legislative package, the EU will contribute to making crime victims\u2019 needs a central part of the justice systems, alongside catching and punishing the off enders. Th e EESC also advocates strengthening the role of the victim and the rights and recognition of the family or rep- resentative of the victim. Th e EESC believes that rather than identifying certain \u2018vulnerable victims\u2019, and thus potentially creating a hierarchy of victims, the Commission should pro- pose that all victims of crime have access to special support- ing measures. (ail) \u25cf Tachographs prove their worth but can be further improved Although tachographs measuring driving times have already gone a long way towards increasing road safety, improv- ing working conditions and ensuring a level playing fi eld for transport companies across Europe, they can still be further improved, says the EESC. In an opinion draft ed by Jan Simons (Employers\u2019 Group, the Netherlands), the Com- mittee said that more use should be made of remote com- munication from the tachograph for inspection purposes, thus reducing the inconvenience of roadside checks. Th e EESC also called for more research into European satellite communications, which may pave the way towards cheaper, easier and more reliable recording. Moreover, the Committee suggested installing weight sen- sors capable of indicating overloading. It also proposed en- abling recording equipment to record the location at which each journey starts and ends. Th is would help Member States to monitor cabotage until it is fully liberalised. (mb) \u25cf Revised trade policy: a useful tool for achieving the Europe 2020 strategy In response to a European Commission consultation, Opin- ion REX/331 (rapporteur: Evelyne Pichenot, Various Inter- ests Group, France) notes that the proposal on a revised trade policy off ers useful insights into trade priorities in line with the Europe 2020 strategy. In particular, it aims to ensure that trade, as an external component of the strategy, contributes to sustained growth and the sustainability of the social market economy. However, the opinion also calls for greater attention to be paid to development cooperation, global solidarity and discussions on the millennium development goals, taking into account the EU\u2019s leading role in a global green economy. Taking the recent free trade agreement with South Korea as an example, the EESC highlights the growing role of civil society in implementing and following up on these trade agreements, particularly with regard to sustainable develop- ment issues. Along the same lines, the opinion suggests that the Committee could be a facilitator of cooperation with civil society in each partner country, in order to increase confi dence and trust on all sides. (mvd) \u25cf Evaluation of the fi rst European semester: more commitment needed from national governments Opinion EUR/002 (rapporteur: Michael Smyth, Various Interests Group, UK) evaluates the fi rst European semester, a new governance method aimed at improving economic policy coordination between the EU and its Member States. Th e main focus of concern is that commitments set out by Member States in their national reform programmes are insuffi cient to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, as shown by the 2012 annual growth survey. Joost van Iersel, President of the Europe 2020 steering committee, who summarised the opinion at the plenary session, pointed out that the success of the strategy depended mostly on the Member States, which have to implement their declara- tions and intentions back home. As most of the reforms have to be implemented at national level, it is essential that organised civil society follows what national governments are doing. Adopted unanimously, the EESC opinion also stresses the important role of education, seen as the only way to achieve innovation, technological progress and entrepre- neurship. (mvd) \u25cf PLENARY SESSION IN A NUTSHELL society in the Euromed region in the course of 2012. As in previous years, the sum- mit brought together representa- tives from economic and social councils, employers\u2019 organisations and trade unions, and other eco- nomic and social interest groups in the region, albeit with many new faces. The summit also saw, for the fi rst time, a number of rep- resentatives from NGOs take part. Th e purpose of their involvement was to enhance ties between the new, vibrant NGO sector which is emerging in the region, and the socio-occupational organisations that continue to play a crucial role in the economic and political devel- opment of their countries.

Next issue: February 2012 P RINTED ON 100 % RECYCLED PAPER Sixth meeting of the European Integration Forum Over 90 representatives of European and national organisations dealing with the integration of migrants met for the sixth time (on 9 and 10 November) in the Committee building for the twice-yearly Euro- pean Integration Forum, organised jointly by the Commission and the EESC. Representatives of the rel- evant national ministries and 21 members of the EESC standing study group on immigration and integra- tion (IMI) also took part. Th e particularity of the forum is that the Commissioner and other VIPs do not leave aft er delivering their speeches, but engage in a dia- logue with the participants (oft en migrants themselves) and listen to their views and concerns. Th e par- ticipants also value the forum as a space for networking and exchange of ideas at European level: a place where an Afghani from Slovakia, a Filipino from Greece and a Sene- galese from Ireland can meet and discuss their common concerns. Th e original topic of the meet- ing \u2014 \u2018The role of the countries of origin in the integration proc- ess\u2019 \u2014 required participants to look at integration from the \u2018external\u2019 point of view. In round tables, they analysed the opportunities and challenges of pre-departure integration measures, including preparatory courses and infor- mation for prospective migrants; they looked at how diasporas can act as bridge-builders for develop- ing economies; and they discussed the benefi ts and pitfalls of circular migration. These issues are part of the new European \u2018Agenda for integration\u2019 (adopted in July 2011), which paves the way for the next developments in this policy fi eld. Th e EESC opinion on this agenda, draft ed by the IMI group, will be adopted in early spring. The forum will meet again in May 2012, to look at the eco- nomic aspects of migrant integra- tion.

Henri Malosse, President of the EESC Employers\u2019 Group, spoke on the topic of relations between large and small fi rms. He emphasised that \u2018we must move from subcontracting relationships and dependency to relationships of trust and partnership, particularly in the context of \u201cclusters\u201d that can promote in- novation, research and development. We must build a European model of \u201cecosystems\u201d enabling us to be more competitive and also to preserve the vast majority of jobs in Europe.\u2019 (mm) \u25cf Soon in the EESC The EESC and the \u2018Notre Europe\u2019 think tank bring together decision-makers and civil society to promote a common energy policy Th e own-initiative opinion on \u2018Involving civil society in the establishment of a future European energy community (EEC)\u2019 off ers a concrete vision of the form a more integrated and inclusive European energy policy should take. Mr Pierre-Jean Coulon (Workers\u2019 Group, France) is the rapporteur for this opinion, which the EESC will discuss at its plenary session in January 2012. Th e fi rst event under this new approach will be a conference entitled \u2018Th e European Union moving towards a European energy community\u2019, to be hosted by the EESC and the \u2018Notre Europe\u2019 think-tank on 31 January 2012 with the support of Mr Jacques Delors. Th e conference will tackle the major challenges facing EU energy policy: creating the single market, securing energy supplies and the transition to decarbonised energy systems by 2050. In the presence of Mr Delors, who initiated the European energy community project, political leaders and repre- sentatives of civil society will discuss the operational steps required to achieve genuine energy integration within the EU. Th e aim is to better coordinate the actions of Member States, the European Union and operators, and to meet the European citizens\u2019 high expectations in relation to energy, in particular greater protection against disruptions to supply, controlled and aff ordable prices and greater solidarity.
