        "\u279c 8 Foreword If Europe wants to realise its full potential \u2014 and provide 75 % of its working population with a job \u2014 it needs to use the talents and skills of all its citizens; right now, too many young people are being left aside. Eurofound ( 1 ) estimated at over EUR 100 billion ( 2 ) the cost of the exclusion of young people from education and the labour market ( 3 ) across 21 EU Member States in 2008 \u2014 or 1 % of the concerned countries\u2019 GDP. Over the past two decades, the poverty of young adults and families with children has risen, while the youth unemployment rate is still above 20 %. The policy review \u2018Social inclusion of youth on the margins of society\u2019 looks into the lives and aspirations of young people who face severe or multiple forms of social exclusion: young migrants, Roma children and those who are long-term unemployed, homeless and in public (or foster) care. It analyses the causes and processes of their exclusion and focuses on policy solutions to break the individual and social glass- ceiling. This review is based on the findings of five separate but complementary and interrelated research projects on excluded youth (launched in 2008 and concluded in 2010-11 under the \u2018Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities\u2019 programme of the EU seventh framework programme for research). The projects provide and compare evidence from 17 European countries and from different and partly overlapping youth groups at the margins of society, acquired through both quantitative and qualitative methods. The review provides substantial insight on policy content around three thematic axes: \u2022 the biographical problems excluded young people face in their family environment and the individual talents and resilience required to overcome their problems; \u2022 the role education and learning can play, either within high-quality, inclusive and affordable learning institutions or via non-formal learning activities; \u2022 the various transitions of young people (to adulthood, parenthood, a job, civic participation and social integration), and how policies can influence these processes. The aim of this publication is to provide a summary of findings in areas of interest to policymakers in the fields of education, employment and training, family, youth and social policies.

        "\u279c 11 E x E C u T i v E S u m m a r y Executive summary The aim of the present policy review is to focus on the situation of some specific youth groups in the European youth policy context, such as the homeless or those at risk of homelessness, migrant and ethnic minority youth and young people with public care backgrounds. More specifically, the objectives of the review are: \u00b0 to provide an overview of the reasons for their precarious situations and to formulate the policy issues; \u00b0 to explore the policy challenges needed to produce greater social inclusion through more opportunities and better access to education and the labour market within the framework of solidarity between these young people and the wider society; \u00b0 to highlight policy implications for cross-border policy transfer; and \u00b0 to contribute to research-based recommendations. The review is based on the findings of a cluster of five research projects on the social inclusion of young people, financed by the \u2018Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities\u2019 programme (SSH) of the EU\u2019s seventh framework programme for research: \u00b0 yiPPEE : \u2018Young people from a public care background: Pathways to education in Europe\u2019 (Denmark, Hungary, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom); \u00b0 CSEyHP : \u2018Combating social exclusion among young homeless populations: A comparative investigation of homeless paths among local white, local ethnic groups and migrant young men and women, and appropriate reinsertion methods\u2019 (Czech Republic, Netherlands, Portugal, United Kingdom); \u00b0 Edumigrom : \u2018Ethnic differences in education and diverging prospects for urban youth in an enlarged Europe\u2019 (Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden, United Kingdom); \u00b0 EumarGiNS : \u2018On the margins of the European Community \u2014 Young adult immigrants in seven European countries\u2019 (Estonia, France, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom); \u00b0 Younex : \u2018Youth, unemployment, and exclusion in Europe: A multidimensional approach to understanding the conditions and prospects for social and political integration of young unemployed\u2019 (France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland). Altogether, research evidence comes from 9 old and 6 new EU Member States, plus Norway and Switzerland, which suggests that this policy-oriented review is based on a good coverage of the countries of the European Union. The selection of the youth groups by the research teams is meaningful because, according to the main policy evidence from research, young people with disadvantaged backgrounds (lacking family support, originating from dysfunctional, poor or socially ",
        "\u279c 12 isolated families and/or with low official country language proficiency) as well as those who are homeless, in or from public care, belonging to an ethnic minority or a migrant group or with low personal resources (drop-out from school, low aspirations for post-compulsory education, in need of welfare support) go through problematic transitions to independent living. Even if they have ambitious goals concerning education or professional life, research shows that they can only achieve these (if they do at all) in the face of significant odds, because of fewer opportunities, more limited access and more fragile solidarity in their relationships with wider society in comparison with the general youth population. Their career prospects will usually remain lower than those of the general youth population if their special transitional needs continue to be politically neglected (and more robust political attention will be best encouraged through credible academic research and statistically appropriate monitoring). There is considerable evidence to suggest that the life chances of youth with disadvantaged backgrounds are primarily dependent on the policy context (welfare policy approaches in general and employment, education, housing and other policy measures in particular) of the country where they live. Chapter 1 gives a brief overview of the EU\u2019s youth policy context. The European Union and Council of Europe have emphasised the importance of a knowledge-based approach to youth policymaking in their relevant political documents and strategies. EU documents related to youth policies stress the importance of: the creation of more opportunities for youth in education and employment; improved accessibility to full participation by young people in society; and the development of solidarity between society and youth. The importance of youth work is also emphasised in the documents: it can play an important role in developing the autonomy, empowerment and entrepreneurial spirit of young people in their transitions to independent living. The research projects have revealed that national policies differ, in particular over the division of responsibilities between the individual, the family, the state and the market. They also differ in the extent to which welfare provisions, education systems, employment policies and migration politics support individual aspirations. Chapter 2 focuses on national practices concerning youth policies and reveals the underrepresentation of some youth groups with disadvantaged backgrounds. The review highlights the need for agreement upon common definitions related to them. This will allow recognition of their educational, economic and political needs, as special transitional needs of these young people, who require additional institutional support in order to compensate for their disadvantages and to broaden their life chances. The annual collection of statistics at national and local levels using EU indicators about both the current situation of these groups and trends in the field is essential for reflexive policymaking. The research also reveals institutional weaknesses of policies affecting young people \u2014 the presence of exclusive labour market, educational and migration policies, the underexploited role of civil society and, last but not least, weak or missing links between welfare provision and education and labour market policies. In addition to their political underrepresentation, these institutional weaknesses put young people ",
        "\u279c 13 E x E C u T i v E S u m m a r y who are disconnected from family support at an extremely high risk of social exclusion. The research points to the importance of studying integrated policy impacts, as these may include unintended negative effects on youth with disadvantaged backgrounds; there may be a need to increase collaborative efforts between different institutions in order to produce more synchronised positive effects from both education and care systems, and from the welfare system in a broader sense. The third aspect highlighted in this chapter concerns the normative approach in policy regulations concerning age limits. In the case of youth with disadvantaged backgrounds, transitional needs towards independent living start at an earlier age and last for longer when compared to the general youth population that relies on family support. As a result, it is recommended that the present age limits that exist in administrative systems are revised in order to address the special transitional needs of young people with particular characteristics and disadvantages below and above the specified age limits. Chapter 3 dissects the biographical disadvantages of young people, such as low coping capacities within families of origin and the often poor connections between migrant or ethnic minority groups and society. The biographical disadvantages that the young people face create a glass ceiling preventing them from realising aspirations and achieving positive life careers. According to the studies, youth from public care backgrounds and homeless young people often come from violent, non- supportive families with acute health or social problems or having experienced the premature death of a parent, which leaves their offspring without adult support and guidance. The research illustrates that low social capital in families often leads to the poor schooling of children and low life career prospects. According to research on migrant youth, the lack of bridging and linking types of social capital in migrant families, the closed nature of these communities and low solidarity between the non-migrant part of society and migrants pose a challenge to the integration of young migrants and to their successful life careers. The recommendations for breaking down the barriers include early-years prevention programmes and targeted interventions that can be used as functional tools for overcoming the biographical disadvantages of young people. Interventions should be directed towards ensuring access to and retention in education irrespective of the material resources of the family or their ethnic or migrant background. In the case of migrant youth, additional neighbourhood-based actions of informal and non-formal learning addressed to all ages, and for both migrant and non-migrant community members, are suggested as means of broadening solidarity within society and for linking migrant or ethnic minority families with the wider community. Chapter 4 discusses the transitional needs of young people, focusing on educational systems and their impact on youth transitions. The research confirms that educational prospects after compulsory education have their roots in participation in quality pre-school education and in early educational allocation systems, which causes an educational divide among children and youth. Roma children, as well as children from migrant backgrounds and poor families, are usually greatly affected by poor ",
        "\u279c 14 access to pre-school facilities and allocated to more disadvantageous segments of education systems. Young people in and from public care are negatively affected by multiple changes of schools, and placement instability has a negative impact on their achievements at school and diminishes their prospects of continuing in post- compulsory education. The review stresses that open access to education for all children and young people from an early age is their social right and thus needs relevant policy responses. This policy review also touches on the issue of the social comparisons that all young people tend to make but which in the case of youth with disadvantaged backgrounds produces a negative outcome for them. In effect, they feel disfavoured, deprived or \u2018the other\u2019 among peers in the school environment. The accompanying labelling of these children and young people by professionals \u2014 teachers, social workers and others \u2014 results in confirmation of their low self-esteem and the undervaluation of the importance of education in their lives. As an example, after leaving care, a lack of encouragement by the school and care professionals points young people from the care system towards \u2018immature\u2019 transitions to independent living, namely the prioritisation of financial independence through work over further education, which later limits their professional opportunities and leads to lower socioeconomic positions. However, conversely, the research also indicates that many young people in care, homeless young people and those with migrant backgrounds fully understand the importance of education and are frustrated by the obstacles they have to overcome after dropping out of, or finishing, compulsory education. They are in need of support from trusted adults who would be a stable point of encouragement and counselling and would broaden their educational. The research revealed that even in the case of countries with relatively developed social services, the potential of educational and public care systems to reduce inequalities during the youth phase are underused. Rather than creating or exacerbating social inequalities through educational segregation, the school environment can be used as a crucial space for overcoming them, notably by compensating for weak family efforts in supporting the child in education and in his/her personal development. Moreover, according to the research, explicit legislation is needed to oblige local authorities and child protection agencies to provide support to young people staying in education after its compulsory stage in order to prepare them for better work careers. Chapter 5 focuses on the needs of vulnerable youth during their transitions towards financial independence, civic and political participation, and highlights the potential of young people\u2019s own agency and resilience. Young people with accumulated disadvantages after leaving home, care or education are in need of additional institutional support to compensate for missing support from the family of origin, or a lack of resources (individual, social, political) for transition to independent living. They first of all need more educational opportunities, employment schemes, housing and welfare services and the presence of supportive adults \u2014 in conjunction with each other. ",
        "\u279c 15 E x E C u T i v E S u m m a r y The research has, however, confirmed that young people\u2019s own agency displays capabilities and resilience that could be empowered with political measures. The promotion of access to social rights of civic and political participation can contribute to the promotion of equal opportunities and social inclusion. With the internalisation of these rights comes a sense of empowerment that can help young people to realise their potential, if institutionally supported. Civil society organisations can uncover underexploited capacities to involve young people and to develop subsidy schemes and scholarships for granting to youth who have been actively engaged. Political parties can consciously recruit migrant youth with the objective of developing relevant political issues and agendas and carrying out campaigns. Chapter 6 draws together the previously highlighted evidence and advances a vision for tackling multiple disadvantages and the social exclusion of youth with disadvantaged backgrounds and low personal resources. Based on the numerous recommendations drawn from the research, the main conclusion is that the social divide among youth can be narrowed by political acknowledgement of their specific social, economic and political needs, and political attention to the early prevention of social exclusion and the elaboration of institutional measures supporting youth transitions to independent living. This conclusion refers to the need for a package of inclusive educational and labour market policies combined with supportive welfare policies, an activated civil society and, last but not least, the empowerment of young people\u2019s agency from an early age by encouraging participation and citizenship in a supportive and respectful social environment. In sum, the main policy conclusions are as follows: (1) The research has revealed two directions of policy challenges: (1) the reduction of the risks of social exclusion for children and youth from an early age; and (2) the development of integrative measures assuring successful transitions into independent living targeted on youth with low personal resources and facing institutional and structural constraints. (2) An increase in institutional support, protection and formal and non-formal encouragement can open up more opportunities for the social inclusion of excluded youth. An opportunity-focused approach to the social inclusion of youth can be secured by strategic investment of financial (including youth- sensitive) budgeting and human resources (e.g. counselling, mentoring, supervision). (3) The integration of policies and strengthening of their inclusiveness can improve the accessibility to education and the labour market of excluded youth groups. This conclusion calls for at least three sets of policy responses: (1) the development of reflexive policymaking through the critical evaluation of policy responses; (2) the elaboration of policy responses aimed at reducing educational allocations; and (3) combining different policies for securing successful and smooth transitions to independent living, taking into account the politically recognised transitional needs of youth with disadvantaged ",
        "\u279c 16 backgrounds and low personal resources, and for tackling proven institutional and structural barriers. (4) The promotion of citizenship and participation can empower youth agency and encourage solidarity between society and youth. This conclusion has two main implications for policy: (1) measures should be elaborated to support the personal resilience and human resources of children and young people to achieve their better integration in society through their individual capacities and social capital building; and (2) conditions should be created for the democratic participation of young people with disadvantaged backgrounds that can lead to a sense of belonging and identity, within their communities and everyday life. There are clearly limitations to this policy review. These flow, significantly and inevitably, from: the great variations in the policy systems in different European countries; the different problems of youth at risk of social exclusion, which vary from country to country; the very different socioeconomic conditions and cultural environments in these countries; and a great diversity in the scale of migration, ethnic minority presence, youth unemployment and numbers of excluded young people. Nevertheless, it is hoped that the ideas shared here will increase awareness of the particular social, economic and political needs of young people with disadvantaged backgrounds and make their needs more visible in policy agendas. Education, employment, equal rights and opportunities for citizenship, participation and solidarity between society and youth are the key areas where change is needed to develop and execute EU youth strategy actions for the empowerment of young people\u2019s agency and for initiatives to prevent social exclusion, in support of the implementation of related and relevant policies at regional and national levels.

        "\u279c 18 Setting the scene The youth period is rich in life transitions. Young people are expected to be successful in completing education and/or vocational training, enter the labour market and, eventually, leave their parental homes. European countries differ in the age at which young people leave their homes of origin and the extent to which they can enjoy both familial and external support during their transitions. In contemporary European societies, an increased dependency of youth on their parents has become apparent. The various transitions \u2014 to working life, independent living and family formation \u2014 no longer follow a linear path and may go back and forth, especially in terms of periods of independence from and dependence on their families of origin as a result of a longer time spent in education and setbacks in transitions to working life. Bynner (2005) has estimated that young people today struggle to establish permanent employment until their mid 20s. According to data from the EU labour force survey (LFS) (Eurostat 2011), the youth unemployment rate in the EU-27 was more than double the overall unemployment rate in 2009. MacDonald (1997, p. 186) states that the institutions, arrangements and policies which structure youth transitions \u2014 in employment, training, welfare, education, housing, the family and legislation \u2014 have themselves undergone dramatic restructuring in recent decades. As a result of these changes, youth transitions have become riskier and more insecure. Adolescence and young adulthood are key transition periods which have a big impact on a person\u2019s future life chances. Empirical studies have confirmed that people who fall into disadvantaged groups at these life stages are at risk of facing a lifetime of social exclusion (see also Furlong and Cartmel 2007; MacDonald and Marsh 2005). Since they are \u2018not any more child \u2014 not yet mature adult\u2019, young people have few legitimate means in their hands to make their voices heard (Kasearu et al. 2010). According to the critical observation of Barry (2005), many young people lack status, rights and power in society. They are constrained by poverty, by their extended dependence on the family and state in the transition to independent living, and by limited opportunities available to them for higher education, employment, housing and citizenship, making them vulnerable to social exclusion. In most European countries young people have disproportionate difficulties on the labour market; compared to other age groups they therefore have the highest risk of unemployment, along with socioeconomic precariousness. The group of young people not in education, employment or training has been a cause for concern and a focus for debate about social exclusion since the 1990s (see Bynner and Parsons 2002; C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Bynner 2008, p. 255; Williamson 1997). The economic recession that started in the late 2000s has worsened young people\u2019s process of transition towards independent living. The objective of the present policy review is to focus on the needs of some specific youth groups, such as young people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, migrant and ethnic minority youth and young people with a public care background, in order to provide an overview of the reasons for their precariousness and ",
        "\u279c 19 S E T T i N G T H E S C E N E explore the policy challenges needed to produce greater social inclusion through more opportunities and better access to education and the labour market within a framework of solidarity between social actors. The present review will highlight policy implications and recommendations in two directions: (1) the reduction of the risks of social exclusion for children and youth with biographical disadvantages from an early age; and (2) the development of measures to reinsert them into society, targeted at youth with low personal resources facing institutional and structural constraints. The review is organised around three domains \u2014 families of origin, educational pathways and youth agency \u2014 in the European youth policy context. We are aware of the limitations of this review. There are great variations in the policy systems in different countries. The problems of youth at risk of social exclusion vary from country to country. The socioeconomic conditions and cultural environments are very different, and there is a great diversity in the scale of migration, ethnic minority presence, youth unemployment and numbers of excluded young people. Education, employment, equal rights and opportunities for citizenship, participation and solidarity between youth and society are the key determinants in the capacity of European policy in this area to achieve greater inclusion of young people at risk. Securing their acceptance and support at a national level remains an important political objective. Our hope is that the ideas shared here will increase awareness about the particular circumstances and risks facing young people on the margins of society in their transition to independent living and provoke discussions on the policy challenges that would promote their active participation in the European labour market and civil society. The research projects The present policy review draws on the findings of a cluster of five research projects on the social inclusion of young people, financed by the \u2018Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities\u2019 programme (SSH) of the EU\u2019s seventh framework programme (see also the methodological overview table on page 75). yiPPEE : \u2018Young people from a public care background: Pathways to education in Europe\u2019 (comparative evidence from Denmark, Hungary, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom). The aim of the project was to find out how young people who have been in state care as children can be encouraged to stay in education beyond the age of compulsory schooling and to access higher levels of education. The researchers claim that care leavers with only basic education and no family backup are at the greatest risk of long-term unemployment and social exclusion. CSEyHP : \u2018Combating social exclusion among young homeless populations: A comparative investigation of homeless paths among local white, local ethnic groups and migrant young men and women, and appropriate reinsertion methods\u2019 (comparative evidence from the Czech Republic, Netherlands, Portugal ",
        "\u279c 20 and the United Kingdom). The study aimed to understand the life trajectories of young people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness in different national contexts, identifying risk, processes of social exclusion and points of reinsertion. Over half of the sample were unemployed during the study. Edumigrom : \u2018 Ethnic differences in education and diverging prospects for urban youth in an enlarged Europe\u2019 (comparative evidence from the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden and the United Kingdom). The aim was to study how ethnic differences in education contribute to the diverging prospects for minority ethnic youth and their peers in urban settings. The project recognises the role of education in the processes of \u2018minorisation\u2019, i.e. how schools operate in their roles of socialisation and knowledge distribution and contribute to reducing, maintaining or deepening inequalities in young people\u2019s access to the labour market, further education and training, and also in different domains of social, cultural and political participation. EumarGiNS : \u2018On the margins of the European Community \u2014 Young adult immigrants in seven European countries\u2019 (comparative evidence from Estonia, France, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom). The aim was to analyse the lived experiences of young immigrants and the interconnections in an individual life story between the processes of social inclusion and exclusion over time and in different arenas. By focusing on different life arenas, like work, school, participation, neighbourhood, family and peer groups, the project reveals how young adult immigrants experience obstacles in some settings and opportunities in other settings. The study was concerned with identifying barriers and bridges to inclusion in different spheres of life and assessing whether particular national or broader European efforts are needed to address the problems faced by immigrant youth. Younex : \u2018Youth, unemployment, and exclusion in Europe: A multidimensional approach to understanding the conditions and prospects for social and political integration of young unemployed\u2019 (comparative evidence from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland). This multidimensional project focused on the social and political dimension of young people\u2019s lives and investigated the effects of unemployment on their exclusion from the social and political spheres, including their civic and political participation, as well as the consequences for their well-being. It adds understanding of the conditions and prospects for the social and political integration of young unemployed in Europe. These projects have made important contributions to a participant-oriented youth research. In tracking the implications of, for example, living in care, being homeless or living without a legal status, the researchers established innovative approaches to qualitative research methods in order to ensure that the voices of the young people were heard. They tell of their longing to belong, while at the same time capturing the structural, legal and institutional barriers constructed by mainstream society and their excluding effects. ",

        "\u279c 22 1. The European youth policy context 1.1. The European Union The European Union and Council of Europe have emphasised the importance of a knowledge-based approach to youth policymaking in their respective political documents and strategies. Following the Commission\u2019s proposals in the 2001 White Paper \u2018A new impetus for European youth\u2019 ( 6 ), Member States identified four priorities for cooperation in the youth field under the first cycle of the open method of coordination: (1) young people\u2019s participation in the exercise of active citizenship; (2) enhancing the information addressed to young people and existing information services for young people; (3) promoting voluntary activities among young people; and (4) encouraging greater understanding and knowledge of youth. The White Paper was followed by several Council resolutions on these four priorities, among them one on \u2018Common objectives for a greater understanding and knowledge of youth\u2019 ( 7 ). The \u2018Youth in action\u2019 programme (2007\u201313) aims to inspire a sense of active European citizenship, solidarity and tolerance among young Europeans and to involve them in shaping the European Union\u2019s future. It promotes mobility within and beyond the EU\u2019s borders, non-formal learning and intercultural dialogue and encourages the inclusion of all young people, regardless of their educational, social and cultural backgrounds. It supports youth exchanges and voluntary activities, and gives young people the opportunity to become involved in their societies and to gain multicultural experiences through their participation. A substantial number of initiatives are aimed at supporting excluded young people and those at risk. In 2009, the Member States adopted the EU youth strategy through the \u2018Council resolution on a renewed framework for European cooperation in the youth field (2010\u201318)\u2019 ( 8 ). The strategy acknowledges young people as both a most vulnerable group and a precious resource in an ageing Europe and promotes a cross-sectoral approach, with short- and long-term actions. Its eight fields of action involve key policy areas: education; employment and entrepreneurship; culture and creativity; social inclusion; health and well-being; civic participation; youth and the world; and volunteering. The strategy (see below) defines reinforced measures for a better implementation of youth policies at the EU level. Its main objectives are to: (1) create more and equal opportunities for youth in education and in the labour market; and (2) promote the active citizenship, social inclusion and solidarity of all young people. These goals confirm the need for investments in research in order to promote the (6) COM(2001) 681 final. (7) Council document 13511/04 JEUN 80 EDUC 194 SOC 485, of 15 November 2004.

        "\u279c 24 The European Council further developed the issue of youth participation and active citizenship under the Hungarian Presidency in the first half of 2011, adopting a resolution on \u2018Encouraging new and effective forms of participation of all young people in democratic life in Europe\u2019 ( 11 ). This also concluded the first cycle of the structured dialogue with youth on employment. The EU youth strategy also emphasises the importance of youth work. As a form of non-formal learning, youth work is viewed as a key mechanism for promoting the responsibility and accountability of children and young people by giving them an active role in safe, inspirational and pleasant environments, in which they can express themselves, learn from each other, meet together, play, explore and experiment, either as individuals or as part of a group. Youth work provides the opportunity for young people to develop a wide range of different personal and professional skills, free from stereotypes, as well as key competences that can contribute to modern society. Therefore it can play an important role in developing the autonomy, empowerment and entrepreneurial spirit of young people. In transmitting universal values regarding human rights, democracy, peace, anti-racism, cultural diversity, solidarity, equality and sustainable development, youth work is seen to have added social value because it can promote social participation and responsibility, voluntary engagement and active citizenship, strengthen community building and civil society at all levels (e.g. intergenerational and intercultural dialogue), contribute to the development of young people\u2019s creativity, cultural and social awareness, entrepreneurship and innovation, and provide opportunities for the social inclusion of all children and young people, especially by reaching young people with fewer opportunities (\u2018A contribution to youth work and youth policy\u2019 in the report of the Belgian EU Presidency running from 1.7.2010 to 31.12.2010). \u2018Erasmus for all\u2019 is a new programme proposed by the European Commission for education, training, youth and sport in November 2011. Starting from 2014, it would be based on the premise that investing in education and training is the key to unlocking people\u2019s potential, regardless of their age or background. It would also help them to increase their personal development, gain new skills and boost their job prospects ( 12 ).

The Europe 2020 strategy In the Europe 2020 strategy, the Union has set objectives in five domains \u2014 employment, innovation, education, social inclusion and climate/energy \u2014 to be reached by 2020. Each Member State has adopted its own national targets in each of these areas. The strategy aims at building a competitive, knowledge-based and sustainable Europe developing the European Research Area (researchers, research infrastructures, knowledge sharing, joint programming, international science and technology cooperation and excellent research institutions) and improve the social dimension of the ERA ( 13 ). Part of the Europe 2020 strategy is the \u2018Youth on the move\u2019 flagship initiative. The objectives of this initiative are to support wider learning and mobility opportunities for all young people in Europe, as well as the modernisation of education and training systems and the development of the youth sector, in particular through transnational and international cooperation projects and networks ( 14 ). It proposes 28 key actions aimed at making education and training more relevant to young people\u2019s needs and encouraging more of them to take advantage of EU grants to study or train in another country. \u2018Youth on the move\u2019 aims to improve young people\u2019s education and employability, to reduce high youth unemployment and to increase the youth employment rate ( 15 ). One of the aims of European youth policy cooperation is to support the occupational integration of young people, improving training, education and counselling. EU Member States and the European Commission strengthened cooperation in 2009 with the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (\u2018ET 2020\u2019), a follow-up to the earlier \u2018Education and training 2010\u2019 work programme launched in 2001.

The long-term strategic objectives of EU education and training policies are: (1) making lifelong learning and mobility a reality; (2) improving the quality and efficiency of education and training; (3) promoting equity, social cohesion and active citizenship; and (4) enhancing creativity and innovation, including entrepreneurship, at all levels of education and training. The EU-level activities are at different levels through early childhood, school and higher, vocational and adult education including, for example, expanding opportunities for learning mobility and/or enhancing partnerships between education and training institutions and the broader society. Other actions are relevant to all levels of education, such as promoting multilingualism, innovation and creativity and the adoption of ICT (information and communication technology). The strategic framework of the Europe 2020 initiative takes a holistic approach to education and training, one that explicitly links education objectives to social inclusion, improving young people\u2019s numeracy and literacy and reducing the number of early school leavers. European policies for young people related to education and employment make evident that social integration is an important goal. 1.3. The Council of Europe The Council of Europe (CoE) has conducted international reviews of national youth policies since 1997 in order to understand the breadth and depth of youth policy development and implementation throughout Europe. To date, 18 countries have participated in this review process ( 17 ). The CoE has set up the programme for \u2018Developing European youth cooperation through youth policy, youth work and non-formal education/learning\u2019 (2010\u201313) including (1) \u2018Human rights and democracy: youth policy and youth work promoting the core values of the Council of Europe\u2019; (2) \u2018Living together in diverse societies: youth policy and youth work promoting intercultural dialogue\u2019; (3) Social inclusion of young people\u2019; and (4) \u2018Policy approaches and instruments benefiting young people and children\u2019. Otherwise known as Agenda 2020, this was launched by European ministers for youth in Kyiv in 2008. As a result of the new European strategies in the field of youth, a renewed forward- looking strategy for a youth partnership between the CoE and the European Commission has been agreed for the period 2010\u201313. This provides an added value to the programmes of the two institutions and their institutional partners, fosters cooperation, complementarity and synergies, and enhances the EU\u2013CoE (16) An effort to indicate that \u2018learning\u2019 does not take place only in formal teaching/learning, but also through non-formal education/learning, self-directed learning, informal learning and peer learning, etc. (17) http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/youth/IG_Coop/Agenda_2020_en.asp ",

The national policy contexts in Europe: Notes from the projects The research projects\u2019 findings have revealed a diversity of social and policy contexts as well as diverse individual trajectories of young people with disadvantaged backgrounds who, due to high risks of social exclusion, experience problematic transitions to independent living. The life chances of disadvantaged youth are in a broad sense dependent on the policy context of the society in which they live. The contexts differ, in particular, through the division of responsibilities between the individual, the family, the state and the market. They also differ in the extent to which welfare provisions, labour force activation policies and education systems support individual aspirations. With reference to the Up2Youth project in the EU\u2019s sixth framework programme ( 18 ), the CSEHYP project noted differences in the structure of welfare policies, education and training systems, labour markets, youth unemployment policies, gender relations and representations of youth across the EU-27 countries. They highlighted a liberal (Anglo-Saxon), a universalistic (Nordic), a subprotective (Mediterranean), an employment-centred (continental) and a post-socialist (central and east European) model of welfare provision, including related youth transition regimes. The liberal welfare approach relies on individual responsibility, with young people facing pressure to enter the workforce and to become economically independent as soon as possible. Although the labour market has a high degree of flexibility it also carries much insecurity for youth and considerable risks of social exclusion. Without extra key support they are socially excluded. The universalistic welfare approach reflects the individualisation of life courses in the frame of integrated and comprehensive education systems. Young people are regarded as belonging first of all to the education system and everyone over the age of 18 is eligible for supportive education allowances. Labour market policies also leave space for individual decision-making. This model has a principle of equal opportunities. However, it relies on cooperation with families in the creation of the equal opportunities and, according to YiPPEE, no specific attention is paid to youth from public care with missing family support or youth with poor family backgrounds. The subprotective welfare approach lacks reliable training pathways into the labour market. That creates inequalities among youth depending on the resources of their families of origin. Long dependency on families leaves young people without a formal position and status. According to data from CSEHYP and YiPPEE, young people (18) See: http://www.up2youth.org/ ",
        "\u279c 28 with disadvantaged family backgrounds are at a very high risk of unsuccessful or delayed transitions to autonomous life in these countries. The employment-centred welfare approach divides youth by the school system: different tracks in education separate pupils from the age of 10 or 12 according to their performance. A two-tiered division of social security favours those who have already been in regular training or employment, while others are entitled to a lesser form of social assistance. For the youth with disadvantaged backgrounds, this model is clearly exclusive and stigmatising. Post-socialist welfare approaches vary from country to country, having a variable welfare mix of policies from the socialist past and copied from contemporary Western societies, with specific adaptations to the different countries\u2019 needs. This model is rather close to the subprotective welfare states, with public structures often being experienced as extremely unreliable. From the perspective of the needs of youth with severe housing problems, in the EU-27 only the most generous Nordic universalistic welfare regimes provide adequate or near-adequate supplies of social housing for young families or young individuals. The Netherlands provide a supported route into tenancies in social housing for some young people, and the United Kingdom provides long-term supported housing with education, training and supported transitions to independent housing for some disadvantaged young groups (young mothers, unaccompanied minors, young homeless people). In some countries (e.g. Denmark, Finland, Sweden) welfare regulations give the possibility of free education to all young people but in some others (e.g. United Kingdom) young people\u2019s educational aspirations are discouraged because of cost while they cannot take employment because youth wages are too low to pay housing expenses. These examples illustrate how diverging welfare and transition regimes relate to differing features of the risk of homelessness. Within the context of six major city areas, Younex focused on political opportunities for precarious and unemployed youth. The project shows that unemployed youth face different political contexts across Europe in terms of unemployment policies and regulations. In particular, a crucial distinction has to be made between a socially inclusive model, shaping policymaking in countries such as France and Sweden, and a highly exclusive model shaping policymaking in countries such as Italy and Poland (with other countries such as Germany and Switzerland providing an intermediate situation). In terms of labour market regulations, Younex shows considerable differences between political contexts promoting flexibility on the labour market, as for example in Sweden and Switzerland, and political contexts that are characterised by much stronger rigidity such as Italy (with France, Germany and Poland providing an intermediate situation). These differences have important implications for the social and political inclusion of unemployed young people as well as for their well-being. In a cross-national analysis of the exclusion and inclusion of young immigrants in the labour market, EUMARGINS found that two different categories of countries exist \u2014 countries with poor rights for young immigrant workers and a more developed black ",
        "\u279c 29 T H E E u r O P E a N y O u T H P O L i C y C O N T E x T market that is often open to illegal migrants and countries with social protection. In comparing these categories, it can be observed that integration in the labour market is best achieved in the countries which provide social benefits and set out rules for accessing the labour market. Equal rights and access to occupational qualifications seem to be the only means to obtain stable jobs for young immigrants. Overall, work in any form is the primary means of social inclusion; it allows immigrants to form networks, and to incorporate themselves in the host society. Edumigrom provides evidence of youth living in relatively impoverished, segregated communities in countries of post-colonial migration (France, the United Kingdom). The recognition of ethnic distinctions drives these minorities to try integrating in society, but their attempts to break through the \u2019ethnic ceiling\u2019 often fail. Typical educational careers are confined to certain skills and vocations, rarely leading to higher education. However, as recent studies (Loury et al. 2005; Modood 2010) show, there is a new tendency of upward mobility among better-integrated ethnic minority groups (e.g. certain Pakistani groups in the United Kingdom or Maghrebi groups in France). In countries of economic migration (Denmark, Germany, Sweden), the majority aims at \u2018Europeanising\u2019 newcomers, often through assigning distinct institutional and social spaces to them. The response frequently takes the form of voluntary ethnic enclosure (especially by Muslim communities) \u2014 different immigrant groups form self-segregating communities, invariably for a range of both positive and negative reasons. Chapter 1: Key messages The European Union and Council of Europe have emphasised the importance of a knowledge-based approach to youth policymaking in their relevant political documents and strategies. The EU documents related to youth policies stress the importance of: the creation of more opportunities for youth in education and employment; an improvement of accessibility and full participation of young people in society; and development of solidarity between youth and society. The EU policy documents also emphasise the importance of youth work: it can play an important role in developing the autonomy, empowerment and entrepreneurial spirit of young people. The life chances of youth with disadvantaged backgrounds (those who are homeless, in or from public care, with missing family support or belonging to an ethnic minority or migrant group) are primarily dependent on the policy context (welfare policy approaches in general; employment, education, housing and other policy initiatives in particular) of the society where they live.

Blinding evidence: Missing links and gaps in knowledge building and youth policies The whole of Europe has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and most countries have a commissioner for children and young people. Despite this, there are many differences in legislation on youth and also interpretations about children\u2019s and young people\u2019s rights across countries. The following discussion, based on the findings from the abovementioned projects, focuses on national practices concerning youth policies and highlights the general policy issues from the perspective of the youth with disadvantaged backgrounds. 2.1. ThE POlICY ISSUE: lack of statistics and political recognition The research revealed the underrepresentation of youth with disadvantaged backgrounds in policies. Their invisibility is reflected in missing domains in policy agendas and a lack of intervention practices, research and relevant statistics. The researchers express the need for caution when looking at the published statistics, especially concerning the population groups whose particular circumstances have not yet secured enough political recognition. The available statistics may fail to reveal the full picture of the processes of inclusion and exclusion among, for example, young immigrants. Official statistics can put the unemployment rates for immigrant young people lower than those for indigenous young people because immigrants often work in the informal sector where they have fewer rights and are thus excluded legally. Political participation of young migrants may be modest not merely because of their lack of interest in political participation as such but because their interests have not been reflected in policies or they are legally excluded from, for example, the right to vote. In addition politicians and decision-makers often lack information about the needs of this potential interest group. The projects\u2019 findings revealed that even if some social challenges are recognised as a policy issue, youth may stay excluded from consideration in relation to that policy challenge. As an example, although efforts to tackle homelessness date back to the 1980s and early 1990s, youth homelessness as a specific policy issue has routinely been overlooked. CSEYHP referred to the United Kingdom, where youth homelessness was briefly a policy concern in the early 1980s, dismissed as a policy issue from the mid 1980s to the late 1990s and then re-established as a policy issue by the Homelessness Act of 2002. The political understanding of homelessness, as well as service provisions, varies from country to country and from one municipality or country region to another. This gap may be caused by a missing official definition of homelessness (e.g. the Czech Republic, according to CSEHYP) or even by variations in definitions on the municipality level, thus leaving out some groups of people with housing problems, including vulnerable youth. In addition to political ",
        "\u279c 32 underrepresentation, the issue of youth homelessness commands very limited public attention. Homelessness as a social problem is seen predominantly as an issue of the mature adulthood period and not a problem linked to youth housing transitions. Youth homelessness only tends to become interesting (e.g. for the media) if it also involves violence, drugs, crime or prostitution as negative outcomes. YiPPEE showed that children in care have not been identified as a group either \u2014 mostly from the perspective of the risks of educational failure with much reduced chances of accessing higher secondary and tertiary education. A clear picture emerged from the research that, in most countries, young people leaving care are an overlooked and neglected group in policy terms with a clearly reduced chance of succeeding in education or accessing stable and rewarding employment. The policy challenge: Recognition in policies and reflexive policymaking Reflexive policymaking needs evidence from practice. As a rule, if a phenomenon is invisible there is little or no research in the field to provide policymakers with accurate data and critical reflections from practice. According to CSEHYP, in most countries no studies have been undertaken, for example, of hidden homelessness in relation to a young person staying with friends and relatives, or of the risks of insecure renting. It is therefore difficult to count or estimate the number of young people with housing problems. The lack of available statistical data combining information about education and the problem areas of young people (e.g. missing family support) means it is a challenge to make their particular circumstances, needs and opportunities related to education visible. Edumigrom highlighted the need for regular monitoring, information gathering and ongoing assessment in policy development in the complex field of education for minorities. The researchers also see unused potential in the existing social monitoring of vulnerable youth groups, mostly done by the civil society organisations. This is the case in relation to young people with a migrant background whose discrimination by employers is not sufficiently studied through field experiments or annual surveys, while immigrant organisations and NGOs working with young people are not sufficiently involved to provide specific data to which they might have daily access. This especially concerns the lack of data about the situation of second-generation immigrant young people who face ethnic penalties in the labour market in spite of being educated and socialised in the country. Therefore a deeper insight into the complex interrelationship between social disadvantages and a lack of biographical resources is needed. The policy challenge, as the European Knowledge Centre for Youth Policy states ( 19 ), is to make societies more inclusive through encouraging critical reflections on them.

Policy implications: Social monitoring and comparative statistics The positive exception among the groups of European countries studied by YiPPEE was England, where young people leaving care have been a matter of government concern for over 10 years. Since 2002, detailed annual statistics have been published on the educational attainment of children in care, comparing them with the general population. These show that among 16-year-olds in care only 14 % achieve the target standard in education, compared with 54 % of all youth. This demonstrates the use of social monitoring by visualising the need for policy intervention addressed to youth in care. Recommendations \u2022 Agree upon common definitions related to politically neglected but vulnerable youth groups like homeless young people and those in or from public care. Recognise their social, political, educational and economic needs as special needs springing from the necessity of extra institutional support to relieve their biographical disadvantages and broaden their life chances. \u2022 Reduce the statistical invisibility of young people with disadvantaged backgrounds by creating EU-wide indicators (e.g. the number of young persons in public care for 12 months or more at age 16\u201318 years, their placement type, educational qualifications). \u2022 Collect comparative statistics about the situation annually at national and local levels using EU indicators and monitor the development of policies in the area; suggest improvements in the existing legal schemes. \u2022 Support qualitative research that gives young people at risk a voice and enables them to reconstruct their resources and coping strategies and to improve the understanding of their struggles for social inclusion (visualise them as active social actors). 2.2.

Sometimes ambiguous regulations and rules concerning the sharing of responsibility between the state and the family cause a problem: who is responsible for educational achievements of children and young people in care in a given case? The universalistic Nordic welfare approach relies on family support whilst being state- centred at the same time: a young person without family support is at risk of being left without the necessary learning development, thus facing the risk of exclusion. In the Mediterranean countries, young people are staying longer than ever with their families \u2014 and longer compared to other European countries \u2014 and the political invisibility of youth disconnected from family support promotes particularly high risks of social exclusion in these countries. A key worker in the CSEHYP project reports that unemployment is not a problematic issue amongst its young clients in the Czech Republic (data from 2009). The issue of most importance is their lack of qualifications. This affects the quality of the employment they are able to secure and their ability to maintain their employment. The low salaries that these young people receive because they are in poor-quality employment lead them into housing crises: they cannot afford adequate housing and live in squats, on the streets or in poor-quality hostels and other types of temporary accommodation. In the case of migrant young people, the citizenship laws are essential preconditions that determine their access to education and the labour market. Illiberal citizenship laws in some European countries form a major restriction on the capacity to benefit from public goods, like attending school or entering the labour market. Young people born outside the EU who migrated to United Kingdom often cited their legal status as a major issue affecting their educational plans in interviews. In most of the east and central European countries, the registration of students\u2019 ethnic identity is forbidden by law in order to protect personal data. EUMARGINS cites Italy as an example of a country having a controversial law that is particularly discriminatory towards young adult immigrants. According to the Bossi-Fini law of 2003, the eligibility for a residence permit is based on the fulfilment of certain criteria that link the legal right of residency with the ability to satisfy a principle of economic self-sufficiency. All individuals over the age of 18 must apply for their own residence permit even if they are living with their parents. This has severe side effects on access to further education among non- Italian students residing in Italy, and on the quality and level of attainment in higher education. Several interviewees reported facing this situation and thus being forced into lower (working class) positions. The Bossi-Fini law also forces young adult immigrants to work in order to remain in the country, thereby not allowing them to continue their education. It means that low unemployment rates are not always illustrative of the successful inclusion of migrants into the host society because young people may either be forced to work due to specific laws or may be working in sectors that offer minimal rights or are in the black or grey labour market.

If adequately linked and coordinated with educational, housing and other policies, welfare services show considerable potential for compensating for young people\u2019s reduced biographical resources such as inadequate or missing family support or dropping out of compulsory education. They can also open the way to post-compulsory schooling and prospects for better jobs. The linking of policies that aim at supporting youth with special needs (e.g. children and youth from migrant families with low official language proficiency) in education should start from an early age. At the macro level, educational policies vary in different welfare state regimes. There are connections between structural reforms in education and the principle of equal opportunities in primary and secondary education. This needs political coordination based on foundations of multiculturalism in national and subnational policymaking. It also requires governance systems in which schools can conceptualise and develop equal opportunities and acknowledge the heterogeneous cultural and social backgrounds of all pupils. YiPPEE is critical about how links have been created between the welfare support measures for young people in care and educational policies. According to the researchers\u2019 observations, this usually means that welfare professionals do not give sufficient priority to educational participation and achievement in their work with young people in care and that education professionals rarely give children in care adequate support in schools. This leads to low readiness for post-compulsory education. The policy challenge lies in linking educational, labour force, welfare and housing policies in a sensitive way, which allows social inclusion to be increased and at the same time avoids stigmatising and labelling when enabling young people to build a career. Policy implications: Multi-agency approach in supporting youth YiPPEE cites as a case example from England the impact of multi-agency education support teams for children in care. These date back to the early 1990s and aim to mediate between schools and social workers to prevent school exclusion and improve attendance and identify unmet educational needs. They were given fresh impetus by the new duty in the 2004 Children Act for local authorities to promote the educational attainment of children they look after. At the same time social work and education responsibilities within local authorities (municipalities) were merged into departments of children\u2019s services, identified by all YiPPEE studies as a positive move. The actions led to a positive increase in educational outcomes for looked after children by 2007. After 3 years, the number of students who continued into higher ",
        "\u279c 36 education had tripled. The personal support adviser scheme was extended to age 25 in 2008. Schools in England are required by law to appoint a teacher with responsibility to improve the educational achievement of children in care who attend that school and to act as their champion. Most local authorities have also appointed a senior teacher, called the \u2018virtual school head\u2019, who is responsible for the education of all children in care in that local authority area as if they were attending a single school (Berridge et al. 2009). Another positive practice is the entitlement to a GBP 2 000 bursary for those going to university and local authority support for living and study expenses. These developments, combined with other measures, have contributed to a 200 % increase in the proportion of children in care achieving the expected level of education at age 16 and a threefold increase in those continuing into higher education between 2003 and 2008. In northern Europe, interventionist programmes have been developed, designed to structure case work with hostel dwellers (e.g. the Netherlands\u2019 \u20188 Step\u2019 programme) and prevent youth homelessness among those at risk through a cluster of local services (e.g. the \u2018Safe Moves\u2019 programme in England). Paradoxically, connectedness to the public care system may itself become a resource of transition to independent living after a young person has left care. For example, young people in England for whom the local authority does have a duty (because of the fact that they were previously under state care or were an unaccompanied minor) do gain political attention: they continue to receive education and housing support. Recommendations \u2022 Take into special consideration the needs of youth with biographical disadvantages (those without or with only poor and limited family support, young people in or from public care, those with ethnic minority or migrant backgrounds) when drawing up social inclusion, education, youth, family and childhood policies. \u2022 Evaluate and assess joint policy impacts in order to detect unintended negative effects on youth with disadvantaged backgrounds. \u2022 Synchronise care and education systems and encourage collaborative practice so that they work together to provide maximum support and encouragement to children and youth with poor or missing family support (such as those in public care or those who are homeless). \u2022 Link the care and education systems under the responsibility of the same administrative arrangements at both national and local levels. \u2022 Improve collaborative efforts of schools, welfare agencies, vocational training and labour market institutions, NGOs and the families of youth with the aim of reducing their yo-yo effect (dropping out of school, college courses and training).

ThE POlICY ISSUE: Excluding age policies The political underrepresentation of youth with disadvantaged backgrounds challenges the treatment of young people according to politically set age limits (most often the legal age) and not according to their particular needs, challenges, risks and circumstances. For young people leaving public care or who are homeless or at risk of being homeless, migrant youth and all those who possess low personal resources (family support, personal motivation, language proficiency, etc.) this kind of a normative approach results in non-entitlement to some welfare provisions due to a lack of social investment that is intended for these purposes. There are also contrasting cases where the welfare support ends with reaching the legal age. The major problem for young people is the break in social support at or around the age of 18 years and the sudden expectation of financial self-sufficiency, as illustrated, for example, by the Dutch social system. Non-entitlement to services or lack of specific services leaves young people in need invisible, such as youth below the legal age who are homeless or living in temporary places (with friends or relatives, and in dormitories, shelters, caravans and elsewhere). In the Netherlands labour force participation or being locally registered as unemployed is the basis of eligibility for housing. The young person leaving care needs to find a job first or signal the intention of doing so; only then can he or she start applying for housing. There are also age limits other than the legal age which can have an impact on young people\u2019s situation. In the Czech Republic, as reported by CSEHYP, this is age 15, when compulsory education ends. All children under 15 and those over 15 but still going to school are not allowed to work. Yet only young people who have worked in the past 3 years are eligible for unemployment support \u2014 thus automatically excluding from support those who do not get a job on leaving care or compulsory education. Furthermore, social protection in relation to housing support is dependent on an individual already owning or renting a flat in which he or she can be permanently registered \u2014 thus excluding youth who are homeless or those who leave public care and are without autonomous housing. In the Czech Republic, services for homeless people are still undifferentiated and there are no specific services available for young people aged below 25 years. Temporary housing services for the homeless (easy- access day centres, dormitories, asylum homes, halfway homes) are directed at clients over 18 years old, thereby excluding young people under this age. There need to be clearer and appropriately overlapping links between the age at which compulsory education ends and the age when the young person is allowed to enter the labour market. In the case of early home leavers, who have dropped out of school or ended compulsory education, not having the right to start to work creates dependencies but often without the right to any welfare. The research showed that welfare provision is linked to families and the right for individuals to apply for and receive welfare support starts only after reaching the legal age. ",
        "\u279c 38 The policy challenge: Political recognition of the specific needs of young people irrespective of age thresholds and restrictions The normative fixed-age approach legitimises the lack of support for young people who do not fit into the age groups defined for particular roles. Instead of accepting the real needs of young people, it concentrates on formal requirements entitling youth to receive support. For youth leaving home early, unequipped for an autonomous life, external support from adults (professionals, agencies) and welfare services are the most essential preconditions for successful transitions to independent living. Political regimes and national and local policies differ in the practices they have that exclude these groups of young people from society but equally, however, they all have the potential, given the political will, for improving their social inclusion. The policy challenge lies in increasing political awareness of the accumulated and cumulative disadvantages (individual, social and political) amongst socially excluded youth and the recognition of their special needs for a transition to independent living. These are not reflected in many age-related thresholds and restrictions on eligibility for the support they need. In order to meet this challenge, the access to education, welfare services and the labour market that is currently limited or denied needs to be addressed. Policy implications: Limits revisited \u2014 Diversified age politics According to data from YiPPEE, in Hungary and Spain young people in full-time education can stay in residential care up to age 25. This removes some of the anxiety about accommodation and living expenses and enables them to concentrate on their studies. They often form close, supportive relations with social educators and pedagogues who continue assisting them after they have left the children\u2019s home or other residential establishment. Recommendations \u2022 Reconsider and revise the age limits that exist in administrative systems in the light of the changing situation of young people (e.g. extended time in education, the growing importance of tertiary education, an increasing dependency on parents, the precariousness of the labour market). \u2022 Study the conflicting or inadequate age limits across policies that might hinder active youth participation in the labour market or in education. Find the gaps in \u2018normalisation efforts\u2019 of policies. \u2022 Highlight the particular needs of young people with disadvantaged backgrounds who are below and above different legal thresholds, yet who need more institutional support during periods of transition towards independent housing and financial self-sufficiency (when, for the majority of young people, this support is given by their families of origin).

Youth with biographical disadvantages and weak personal resources can be underrepresented in policymaking and not made sufficiently visible in national youth policies; there is a need to make them visible through research, monitoring, policy responses and assessment of improvements. Reflexive policymaking requires regular information and comparative statistics about disadvantages that impact on youth transitions and the policy achievements that may alleviate them. Statistical visibility can be assured through a set of EU-wide indicators used both nationally and locally. However this needs to be complemented by increased qualitative data and knowledge building. Policies are often structured in ways that have excluding effects on youth; efforts to bind policies together should be increased. Introducing multi-agency coordinated approaches can lead to more targeted efforts and a more efficient use of resources. Policies relating to young people are often constructed on age boundaries (most often at, or around, the legal age of 18) and not according to the special transitional needs of young people; policy endeavours should be disconnected from age thresholds and restrictions and connect more directly to the particular needs facing more disadvantaged young people as they navigate various routes in their transitions to adult life.

Bad starting conditions: Carrying adults\u2019 burdens and responsibilities The groups of young people studied in this research cluster (migrants/ethnic minority groups, the homeless and those at risk of homelessness, those from public care) face a glass ceiling in their efforts to realise their aspirations and have positive life careers due to their biographical disadvantages, combined with legal and institutional barriers. In order to understand the particular \u2018social condition\u2019 of these groups of young people and to open up pathways to social inclusion, their troubled (and sometimes troublesome) transitions need to be unravelled and translated into policy terms. In the following chapter, the major biographical disadvantages that have been revealed by research, such as low coping capacities of the families of origin and poor efforts in linking the migrant and ethnic minority groups to the wider society, are cast into focus. 3.1. ThE POlICY ISSUE: low coping capacities and social capital of families of origin According to the studies, youth from public care and those who are homeless often come from violent, non-supportive families with acute health or social problems, or having experienced the premature death of a parent, which leave their offspring without adult support and guidance. Some homeless youth come from homeless families. Both phenomena are closely related: those from public care are at risk of homelessness while the young homeless often have a public care or migration background. However, the Czech case revealed that various types of institutional care are not always related to inability of the parents to provide care, but rather to persistent poverty. Due to inadequate financial resources, these families experience housing problems in addition to problems of economic survival. Poor families may often be associated with the poor schooling of children. In the Portuguese sample of homeless young people or those at risk of homelessness, several reported that they had to leave school early, against their will, because of family poverty. Consequently, lack of intervention and institutional support for an individual wanting to continue education may result in family coping problems taking precedence over young people\u2019s educational aspirations. Young people from migrant families with diverse cultural backgrounds often have supportive family and kinship networks. However, as shown, for example, for the United Kingdom by both YiPPEE and Edumigrom, these networks form mostly a bonding type of social capital (even in the case of the second-generation immigrants) which is not enough to generate social inclusion in a broader sense. The migrant families lack bridging and linking types of social capital which are the engines of integration. The situation is influenced and perhaps exacerbated by low solidarity ",
        "\u279c 42 between the non-migrant part of society and migrants and the resultant closure of the latter communities. The policy challenge: External support that complements or compensates for poor family efforts Low coping capacities of the family of origin can sometimes be compensated for through wider kinship support. The traditions of kinship support vary from country to country and are more traditionally sustained in the southern parts of Europe while the northern parts experience looser family networks and thus people in need are reliant on welfare support to a greater extent. The wider kinship support is also dependent on the level of separation between family units and the resulting diversification of household structures, with both of these factors having the potential to weaken kinship networks and the possibilities they provide for offering support in case of need. Although over a quarter of the questioned (at risk of being) homeless youth had care experiences, the CSEHYP findings highlighted that another quarter would have liked to have had social services intervention when they were growing up (54 % overall). Those who had experienced care episodes would have liked more social services intervention. In the case of migrant youth, migration from underprivileged regions of the world to countries with higher living standards may be a success in the young person\u2019s life career but the need for societal solidarity to link and better integrate the families of newcomers to their new environments is most evident. The policy challenge lies in the elaboration of services to complement or compensate for the weaknesses of the families of origin where the young people live. Policy implications: Early intervention and targeted services CSEHYP noted early intervention and targeted services as functional tools in working with young people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Early intervention programmes can either be targeted services provided by one voluntary sector agency or they can be provided as a cluster of services provided by the local municipal authority and the voluntary sector. An example of a targeted service approach is a homeless agency working in a school. Homeless agencies provide training in schools that can offer young people the conflict resolution skills to deal with family and peer conflict in order to reduce the prospect of becoming homeless. Alternatively, homeless agencies can provide lessons about the experience of homelessness and give young people the opportunity to approach an agency worker at these sessions. Young people with public care backgrounds can appreciate the use of being in care as a resource for paving their way to independent living that the families of origin could not have provided. As one says, the residential centre \u2018\u2026 gives you stability, ",
        "\u279c 43 B A D S T A R T I N g C O N D I T I O N S : C A R R Y I N g A D U l T S \u2019 B U R D E N S A N D R E S P O N S I B I l I T I E S contrary to what your family does; studying is your choice, and they offer it to you\u2019. Being in care can be an escape from a dysfunctional or poor family setting and may provide young people with the means of getting closer to the distribution of necessary social and economic resources. Recommendations \u2022 Develop active intervention practices (e.g. risk assessment to identify children at risk, family mediation and support to improve the family situation) at an early age to tackle the negative impacts of family malfunctioning on the offspring; in very difficult family situations, placing in care or alternative housing can be carefully considered. \u2022 Establish an effective partnership of key institutional agents (education, justice, social services) to support children and youth with weak or missing family support. \u2022 Establish direct interventions (e.g. in the form of scholarships and allowances) to influence the decisions and paths of young people by including financial support as part of early intervention strategies in the family group in need, and keeping the child in education. \u2022 Focus and develop family education (education of adults together with education of youth) with the aim of broadening the social networks and bridging social capital of the families with ethnic minority or migration backgrounds. \u2022 Promote integrated family support, not only financially, but also working on the relational aspects that constrain school attendance and/or school achievement. 3.2. ThE POlICY ISSUE: Poor cultural integration of migrant and ethnic minority youth While first-generation migrant groups might have lost many kinship ties from their country of origin, in the case of the second and subsequent generations of migrants the solidarity in the family groups and in their communities remains strong (e.g. in Muslim groups). This bonding type of social capital among migrant communities is supported by an identity of the \u2018other\u2019, and in-group norms and values, if too strong, may isolate and exclude these migrant groups from the broader society (and, in extreme cases, may lead to maladaptation, disloyalty and ethnicity-based conflicts). However, this is not only a process of self-exclusion but also a result of a lack of solidarity from the broader society. A key precipitating factor in social exclusion is the absence of or low proficiency in the country\u2019s official language. Huge efforts may be made to give language lessons to minority groups, but if these are carried out too late or use ineffective teaching methods, the linguistic disadvantage among children and youth with ethnic minority ",
        "\u279c 44 or migrant backgrounds will feed the accumulation of disadvantages in education and work prospects. However, even for those who have the required level of language proficiency, wider disadvantages may exist involving housing problems and weak or absent family support, especially where the young people are unaccompanied minors. The policy challenge: Empowerment of the neighbourhood Proceeding from the evidence drawn from the research projects\u2019 findings, the disadvantage based on belonging to an ethnic minority or a migrant group appeals to the neighbourhood and community interventions to integrate the migrant or ethnic minority families and children and youth into society. Neighbourhood social space in an urban setting has major relevance here, with its potential for engaging youth in activities and collective and community action beyond the family and ethnic boundaries. Also, educational policies could possibly help to overcome structural inequalities in certain school contexts. Edumigrom points to the importance of access to education for migrants and ethnic minorities, in particular to early childhood education which is conducive to improved performance at school. The connection between structural reforms in education and the principle of equal opportunities in primary and secondary education play a significant role here. The policy challenge lies in interventions addressed to neighbourhood and community with the aim of opening and strengthening access to multiple forms of education and the broadening of the bridging social capital of ethnic minority and/ or migrant families. Policy implications: Multiple learning options in the neighbourhood With post-colonial political practices such as those that prevail in France and United Kingdom, elaborated forms of coexistence with minorities can be witnessed: ethnic feelings are more diffused and the ethnic ceiling has lowered. However, ideas of multiculturalism are often still put to the test. The research reveals that early childhood education greatly helps with language and other skills, and also promotes evidence of European thinking. The research projects\u2019 findings (e.g. from Edumigrom) demonstrate that early childhood education should be achieved by neighbourhood-based actions of informal and non-formal learning. The education practices which proved to be successful were integrative efforts through non-formal learning, for example, heterogeneous groups with several adults in the classroom engaged in interactive groups, improvement of reading skills through dialogic literary gatherings, and homework clubs where parents and children learn together as a form of family education. Another positive example is the addition of a Roma teacher in the classroom if Roma children are involved. Experience from Romania has demonstrated the benefits arising from the extension of learning time (e.g. afternoon classes). ",

Neighbourhood- based services and early language education courses are successful practices giving families and children a community identity. Recommendations \u2022 Promote comprehensive early language programmes among children from minority ethnic backgrounds, starting in kindergartens and pre-schools; computer- assisted tools for language training are recommended as a comparatively new development that merits investment and evaluation. \u2022 Develop family education (education of adults together with education of children and young people). Improve the basic reading skills of ethnic minority family groups through the implementation of learning programmes for parents. \u2022 Promote social integration of migrant and ethnic minority families through multiple education options in informal and non-formal learning within a framework of cultural navigation \u2014 for example, learning programmes of an intercultural character with the participation of members of both migrant and non-migrant communities. \u2022 Encourage and empower young people to create new learning spaces within the community and develop youth work potential, for example through giving access to micro-community grants for integrative projects at the grass roots level. \u2022 Support the creation and participation of ethnic (cultural, religious, linguistic) minority NGOs and ad hoc advocacy groups which are consulted by the municipalities and involved in the assessment of policies impacting on their communities.

The impacts of biographical disadvantages on youth are combined with legal and institutional barriers and low social solidarity. Early-age prevention programmes and targeted interventions can both be used as functional tools for overcoming the biographical disadvantages of young people. Interventions can be directed towards ensuring access to and retention in education for such children and young people irrespective of the financial situation of the family or their ethnic or migrant background.

        "\u279c 48 4. Education \u2014 potential for inclusion 4.1. ThE POlICY ISSUE: limited access to pre-school education Educational prospects after compulsory education have their roots in pre-school education. The impact of pre-school education is threefold. First, it prepares children for compulsory schooling; second, it gives opportunities for children from dysfunctional homes to find relief from potentially harmful consequences of their families; and third, it offers a good start for a child with a migrant or ethnic minority background to enter the mainstream community. Limited access to pre-school education limits the developmental horizons of youth with biographical disadvantages from an early age. Despite the fact that they need and would profit most from nursery schools and early childhood socialisation, Roma children, as well as children from migrant backgrounds and poor families, are usually significantly affected by poor access to pre-school facilities, even if attendance at them could later positively affect school performance and inclusion. The policy challenge: Multiple use of involvement in pre-school education Childcare facilities prior to school age vary due to distinctive family, gender, and welfare policies in Europe. In many EU countries (e.g. Czech Republic, France, Germany, Slovakia, Sweden) pre-primary education is not compulsory (though in some of these countries it is common). Children from socially disadvantaged families cannot attend nursery schools because of payment requirements, physical distance, discriminatory enrolment and mutual suspicion between management and parents (though not in France, where attendance in public pre-school by 3- to 6-year-olds is close to 10 %). The policy challenge is to foster access to pre-school education for children from poor and/or dysfunctional families and from the families from ethnic minorities or migrant groups. For the latter groups the main challenge is obtaining proficiency in the dominant language and making links to the neighbourhood community. Policy implications: Wider access to pre-school Both the Netherlands and England have targeted pre-school children as well as school-age children in order to reduce educational disadvantages whilst in Portugal education support is concentrated on children aged 6\u201318. In the Czech Republic, high rates of educational engagement have led to policies that provide financial support for the poorest rather than policies to introduce general educational intervention. ",

ThE POlICY ISSUE: Segregation in the compulsory education systems produces an educational divide The notion of \u2018compulsory education for all\u2019 is more an ideal than a reality. The research projects\u2019 findings show that compulsory education in Europe segregates mostly the children with biographical disadvantages: those from poor families and those with minority ethnic or public care backgrounds. The earlier the tracks of separation occur, the higher the probability is that children from disadvantaged backgrounds are allocated to more disadvantageous segments of the education systems (i.e. lower-quality schools). The educational divide starts early and is determined considerably by limited competence in the language of instruction at school when it is different from their mother tongue. This can cause some young people to be inside school but outside learning. The school environment can even become the basis for institutional discrimination. Roma, ethnic minority and migrant children are often directed to special schools for students with learning disabilities, irrespective of their actual mental abilities. Children and young people need stability during their developmental years. Multiple changes of schools and multiple placements in care have a negative impact on their educational achievements and thus they are worse prepared for transitions to independent living and future life careers. In the Edumigrom study, four types of inter-ethnic school environments were found: majority schools (schools/classes where the proportion of ethnic minority students is less than 10 %); schools with a dominance of minority ethnic students (over 75 %); mixed schools; and schools where there is a clear separation of students by ethnic background into parallel classes (\u2019within-school segregation\u2019). Ethnic minority and majority students perform poorly in schools where segregation is prevalent and practised either because the vast majority of students are \u2018visible\u2019 minorities or because parallel classes are composed of different ethnic groups. The performance of students is higher in \u2018Roma schools\u2019 and in \u2018Muslim schools\u2019, where sole or dominantly ethnic minorities are present than in schools where ethnic separation is an outcome of varied practices of streaming and internal segregation. Academic expectations of teachers in segregated Roma schools are considerably lower than in regular schools, coursework grading is more flexible and permissive, ",
        "\u279c 50 and the curriculum is comparatively less demanding. The groups most vulnerable to disappearance from compulsory schooling, according to Huttova et al. (2008), are the children of refugees, internally displaced people, nomadic groups and illegal migrants. In some EU countries, such as Romania, authorities can deny access to schools to those who do not have birth certificates. This is quite usual among Roma. The policy challenge: Reduction of educational inequalities The research revealed that even in the case of countries with relatively developed social services, the potential of schools to reduce inequalities during the youth period is underused. There are exclusionary practices, instead of supportive interventions, which, even if developed, are not sufficiently accessible to the vulnerable groups of young people. YiPPEE draws attention to the necessity of planning the capacity building of the educational system with the aim of improving the educational support provided to children in care. However, this also concerns children from poor families and those with ethnic minority or migrant backgrounds. The impact of ethnic segregation or separation in school affects students\u2019 performance, self-esteem and aspirations for further schooling and labour market participation differently, according to Edumigrom. The comparative analysis revealed a divergence between the new and older Member States of the European Union. In new Member States, there are significant differences between ethnic minority and majority students studying in the same environment. As an example, the inter-ethnic peer group relations of students attending segregated schools and classes in the new Member States also differ greatly from those of students in ethnically mixed or majority environments; such differences do not exist or are relatively minor in the old Member States. In these countries, ethnic background plays a role in forming friendships for a small fraction of students, and there is no difference in this regard between ethnic minority and majority students. In contrast, in new Member States, almost one third of the students mentioned in the survey that ethnicity played a role in forming friendships. Old EU Member States are not homogeneous but these relationships are generally not so pronounced as in the new EU Member States. The policy challenge is to tackle the early educational divide in the pre-school and compulsory education systems. The challenge for schools is to compensate for weak family efforts in supporting a child\u2019s education and use the school environment as a space that is crucial for overcoming social inequalities, not creating them by educational segregation. Policy implications: Practices against early educational divide In England, children in care and those missing family support were routinely allocated to low-prestige schools. It required government action to change this by making it mandatory to give children in public care priority for admission to high-performing schools even when they were technically full. ",
        "\u279c 51 E D U C A T I O N \u2014 P O T E N T I A l F O R I N C l U S I O N Taking into account all aspects investigated within the Edumigrom project, an ethnically mixed school and classroom environment seems best to meet the needs of both majority and minority ethnic students. Such environments provide students who perform well with opportunities to continue a suitable education, and they also assist with the healthy development of students\u2019 self-esteem and interpersonal relationships. This association is particularly strong in new EU Member States, according to the study. Both ethnic minority (Roma) and majority students from ethnically mixed or dominantly majority student populations plan to continue education at a significantly higher rate than students attending segregated schools. The internal separation of ethnic minority students seems to be equally demotivating for students in all parts of Europe. However, at schools in which ethnic groups are \u2018voluntarily\u2019 separated (e.g. Muslim schools in Denmark; the \u2018Ghandi\u2019 Roma secondary school in Hungary), students perform well and have high aspirations about continuing their education. The faith schools in general enjoy intense support of the ethnic and religious community in their surrounding context, and strengthen students\u2019 ethnic and religious pride and self-esteem. Recommendations \u2022 Recognise the inequality of educational opportunities as a children\u2019s rights issue and intensify efforts to reduce differences in the conditions and quality of schooling for children with disadvantaged backgrounds. \u2022 Consider establishing recruitment rules for schools that will reduce inequality related to a student\u2019s family background. \u2022 Postpone formalised streaming and tracking until the later phase of compulsory education, and make sure that children with different backgrounds (e.g. minority ethnic, in care, without family support) represent a fair proportion in all specialised formations. \u2022 Reach out to children of illegal migrants, unsettled groups and undocumented Roma families who currently face the greatest risk of staying out of the education system. \u2022 Promote multicultural content and forms of teaching and socialisation; provide incentives to schools\u2019 management, teachers and support staff to cope with ethnic diversity in order to encourage equal recognition, mutual respect and friendly inter-ethnic relations in schools. \u2022 Reconsider the practice of multiple placements of children and youth in care, which in turn means multiple changes of schools and causes lower educational performance by these learners.

        "\u279c 52 4.3. ThE POlICY ISSUE: The \u2018otherness\u2019 in youth diminishes good prospects in adulthood Young people make comparisons between their successes and the social advancement of their reference group (their peers). Their subjective perceptions are mediated by personal as well as normative social standards. Negative self comparisons to normative expectations and peer achievements lower aspirations to continue education or find a job amongst those with low personal capital (such as weak family or kinship support, lack of financial resources, or low or missing language proficiency in the cases of migrant youth). Low self-esteem sets the ceiling to one\u2019s personal aspirations and leads to self-exclusion from potential opportunities. Ethnic minority students often experience conflicts between the values, norms and practices of their home environment and the school, thus producing distrust in parent\u2013school relations. The values, norms and curriculum choices of majority children may develop a sense of inferiority, irrelevance, alienation and resentment for Roma, minority ethnic and migrant children. Frustrations stemming from experiences of discrimination and segregation lead to high drop-out rates which can be regarded as the primary source of marginalisation. YiPPEE highlighted the so-called \u2018professional paradigm\u2019, reflecting the focus of intervention in care that put emphasis on young people\u2019s well-being without advancing their educational values and aspirations. This behavioural pattern causes the labelling of children and young people by professionals \u2014 teachers, social workers and the others \u2014 resulting in low awareness of the importance of education in the young person\u2019s life, including after leaving care. However, the perceived social exclusion is not only built on stigmatisation and labelling, but also on a poor financial situation and the sense of belonging to a particular disadvantaged group. Similarly, Edumigrom results show that the stigma generates fear about \u2018otherness\u2019 and, for example, hinders inter-ethnic mixing, as it gives rise to the need for separation and ethnic enclosure. Young people with disadvantaged backgrounds feel being \u2018the other\u2019 is also determined by negative media representations. The stigmatising effect of the media on migrant youth is quite widespread across the countries (e.g. Muslims in United Kingdom related to the London bombings, Russian minority in Estonia related to the Bronze Night riots in Tallinn). However, the media has the power to highlight success stories as well and prospectively lift an individual\u2019s self-worth through their internalisation of the positive cases \u2014 unfortunately this is rarely done, probably due to the expected \u2018commercial thresholds\u2019 that the news have to overcome. The policy challenge: Intercultural sensitivity and support Quite understandably, poverty and various social problems in families of origin, staying in public care, being homeless or keeping \u2018uncommon\u2019 values and norms due to one\u2019s ethnic background make these young people feel \u2018different\u2019. Some of them, ",
        "\u279c 53 E D U C A T I O N \u2014 P O T E N T I A l F O R I N C l U S I O N on account of home poverty, are unable to attend peer activities (not affordable), are unable to bring friends to their homes (because they are poor, untidy, violent, isolated and different or because they are separated from home) or miss \u2018necessary\u2019 things (do not meet the cultural standards set by peers). Schools have a lot potential to help children and youth dismiss the feeling of \u2018otherness\u2019: first, through a policy of equal access to schools for all; second, through individual help from teachers to students; and third, by providing a place where children and adolescents with disadvantaged backgrounds can feel like their peers, not having to reveal existing problems in their families of origin or in their public care setting. Schools need to promote intercultural education, teacher training and the collaboration of citizens (parents and others) on various projects within school environments and beyond. Public discussions in the media can raise awareness about the problems of social exclusion in youth and can break the stigma and reveal discriminatory practices. EUMARGINS demonstrates the considerable potential of the media as a potentially positive contribution to activating civil society when it initiates social dialogues between different policy interest groups. The policy challenges lie in the development and implementation of support measures that soften the biographical disadvantages of youth, providing them with access and opportunities to feel equal with peers, stay in education and allow them to realise their educational aspirations. Policy implications: Break down stigma and cease labelling YiPPEE refers to attempts in Sweden to make young disadvantaged pupils experience schools as \u2018normal places\u2019 by helping them to overcome feelings of being deprived or excluded. To be positively noticed by a teacher and a carer, to receive encouragement about his or her capacities and to enjoy educational achievements is highly meaningful for a child from a disadvantaged background. The media can publicise success stories about young people with disadvantaged backgrounds who have broken through the glass ceiling and realised their aspirations. Positive examples of migrant youth are found in Norway, where the media has highlighted several successes of young people with migrant backgrounds: a Somali girl aspiring to a doctoral degree, or a Japanese youth who is doing very well in a Norwegian school. These cases encourage migrant youth to internalise the successes of others and can lift their own subjectively set \u2018glass ceiling\u2019 of perceived opportunities. Recommendations \u2022 Develop school- and community-based counselling services to give young people with problematic family backgrounds an opportunity to voice their problems and seek support to avoid ruptures (e.g. runaways, school drop-outs) and the aggravation of psychological problems. ",
        "\u279c 54 \u2022 Recognise young people with disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. Roma, neglected by family) in schools; provide individual tutoring and support, thus helping them to catch up with their peers and to remain in education. \u2022 Develop teacher education and in-service training towards the application of innovative methods of competence-based teaching and competence in dealing with disadvantaged groups and multicultural settings in schools; offer teachers in-service courses of intercultural and anti-discrimination training. \u2022 Facilitate informal and non-formal learning (e.g. out-of-school teaching and training programmes) addressed to youth with biographical disadvantages through being involved in sports, leisure or unpaid volunteering arranged through the local community or NGOs\u2019 actions. \u2022 Provide platforms or arenas for open dialogue among young people from a range of backgrounds together with school counsellors or other professionals who have regular contacts with children and youth and their families (e.g. teachers, administrators, youth themselves) and invite the media to attend. \u2022 Provide obligatory training for parents and carers of children and youth attending multi-ethnic schools, so they will be prepared to support their own offspring in the education process. 4.4. ThE POlICY ISSUE: low prospects for post-compulsory education Post-compulsory educational participation is becoming a norm and, simultaneously, is becoming more costly in Europe. Since the 1970s, participation in education after the compulsory phase has increased threefold, according to YiPPEE. Moreover, in the EU 84 % of young people aged 15\u201319 are in education, as are 25 % of the age group 20\u201329 years. In spite of the fact that education is high on the political agenda of European countries, wide participation in education is not a fact among all groups: young people in care stand out particularly in this respect (e.g. in Denmark, 66 % of young people in care do not have any post-compulsory qualifications). Young people with public care backgrounds prioritise financial independence through work, not further education. The YiPPEE data from Hungary show that among those living in children\u2019s homes only 14 % wished to go to university, compared with 50 % living with their families of origin. The carers and support persons (including teachers, social workers, child protection workers and other professionals) have low expectations related to education and establish unambiguous objectives instead: work, roof, food. As a result, young people with public care backgrounds are in general underprepared for continuing in learning after compulsory education and are left without continuity of adult support after leaving care which might have allowed them to continue studying. This issue is both ideological and disciplinary, but there are also indications that some countries are beginning to prioritise investment in ",
        "\u279c 55 E D U C A T I O N \u2014 P O T E N T I A l F O R I N C l U S I O N education in preference to pushing young people into low-paid unskilled jobs, which are increasingly unavailable. Besides the personal problems of those young people, there are multidimensional institutional barriers they have to face. Many young people in care or from homeless or migrant backgrounds fully understand the importance of education and are frustrated by the obstacles they have to overcome after finishing compulsory education. EUMARGINS found that the barriers varied considerably depending on the national context. Some included migrant legal status, financial status or language skills, limiting the choices for young adults with migrant backgrounds to continue a pathway through higher education. The policy challenge: Support for educational aspirations Years spent in education have extended across the EU-27, except for the most disadvantaged groups. YiPPEE revealed that even if young people have had the support of highly motivating and supportive adults (such as teachers or social workers) whilst in public care, breaking the contact after leaving care limits the young person\u2019s prospects to continue in education or to find a job. The care professionals interviewed in the YiPPEE study emphasised that, besides raising aspirations and expectations, supporting young people is crucial to further success. They also stressed the need for outreach programmes from higher institutions, with university students acting as mentors to individual children in care. Youth from care are in need of early intervention, motivating them towards education; then, after leaving care, they need adult emotional and motivational support. Even so, some young people continue to carry the low educational ambitions of their families of origin. Those who live in ethnically diverse environments often come from lower-status backgrounds and have parents with limited education and low labour market status. The value of good educational performance is largely conditioned by anticipated future rewards in the labour market. No single desegregation policy will sufficiently improve educational outcomes for students with an immigrant background if they perceive that their qualifications are not acknowledged by employers who practice various discrete forms of discrimination. As the policy challenge, explicit legislation is needed to require local authorities and child protection agencies to support young people to stay in education after its compulsory stage. Otherwise, workload and budgetary pressures are likely to cause attention and resources to shift to the next cohort entering the care system, with the older group left without the backup they need, which other children usually receive from their families. Policy implications: Make concentration on learning possible YiPPEE suggested that the British welfare system acknowledged the vulnerabilities of young people; it has been concerned with care and education, including higher ",
        "\u279c 56 education. It has stressed the importance of personal relationships and individual care. A major reform initiative called \u2018Care Matters\u2019 was launched in 2007 and appears to have had some effect in raising educational attainment opportunities, although the gap between children in care and others still remains wide. At country level there are positive developments: in Denmark, for example, a personal adviser and a support worker are appointed to a young person after leaving care. Edumigrom stressed recognition of equal opportunities in education, for example by strengthening language support for removing language and cultural barriers for immigrants and having their voices heard, educating immigrant parents about the education system and supporting learning for after-school time and summer holidays to compensate for the lack of family resources. Recommendations \u2022 Define \u2018care\u2019 for children in public care and on welfare as \u2018educationally oriented\u2019. Schools and child welfare agencies should deepen cooperation and award education a more central and prioritised status for young people with disadvantaged backgrounds in relation to their staying in education during and after compulsory education. \u2022 Invite labour market institutions to participate with care institutions in extracurricular activities for their young people, which would give young people up-to-date knowledge of the value of education, training and the contemporary labour market situation, as well as perhaps encourage their entrepreneurship. \u2022 Develop a system of targeted, individual counselling for young people, especially from disadvantaged backgrounds, guiding their decisions concerning educational pathways (on issues such as choice of type of school and type of specialisation). \u2022 Engage trusted adults (teachers, social workers, youth workers, health professionals, police, employers) as complementary support agents in the provision of advice, information and counselling, who, in partnership, could encourage young people to invest in education and assist them in school or other learning environments. \u2022 Define high-quality vocational training at the secondary level as a valuable professional option for those who cannot afford to stay for long years in education.

Guaranteeing early childhood education to all children is important. Ethnically mixed schools are the best environments for pupils, leading to positive development and high performance, while educational segregation leads to a downgrading of expectations and performance and reproduces inequalities. When ethnic separation into Roma or Muslim schools happens on a voluntary basis, it may have positive impacts on the education and self-esteem of students. The potential of schools and neighbourhoods as spaces to reduce inequalities can be more actively used. Intercultural activities (events, training, learning circles), if encouraged and funded, can engage both ethnically mixed audiences as well as actors from all groups (children, parents, teachers, administration). There is the need for improvement in equality of opportunities in the educational system for in-care and after-care young people as well as homeless and migrant youth. Young people with biographical disadvantages are in general underprepared for continuation into post-compulsory education and need external support. As the labour market demands even higher qualifications for many jobs, the prioritisation of post-compulsory education is necessary. Young people with disadvantaged backgrounds need the support of trusted adults (such as teachers and social workers) who can be a stable point of encouragement and counselling and contribute to broadening their educational horizons.

Transitions to independent living \u2014 potential for inclusion 5.1. ThE POlICY ISSUE: leaving home, school or care early \u2014 Young people are unprepared for independent living According to life course theory (Clausen 1991; Hunt 2005; du Bois-Reymond and Stauber 2005 and others), the impact of life or career transitions is determined by the time at which they take place in an individual\u2019s life: the age at which the young person leaves home, completes education or vocational training, enters the labour market and forms his or her own family. Non-participation in the key activities that are expected from a young person according to their age produces troublesome transitions and identity problems. Moreover, inequalities in opportunities to follow pathways to an independent living compared to the general population lead to poor life chances in the future. The findings on youth with public care backgrounds showed that in most countries the age of leaving care is much lower than the average age of leaving home for their peers. A very similar group are the early home leavers. These two groups of young people cannot rely on the family\u2019s support and they have to focus on questions of economic survival and accommodation at a much earlier age, with little room left in their lives for education. As a result, they are much more likely to be out of education, employment and training and to stay homeless. Other similar groups include national and ethnic minorities, particularly Roma, immigrants and refugees. The Younex project shows that long-term unemployment leads to financial difficulties, which create a predictable need to borrow money more often than employed young people. Long-term unemployed young adults also face more anxiety and are less happy than regularly employed ones. Partner support, and also to some extent family support, may help to reduce anxiety and unhappiness. However, young people from public care or the young homeless (according to YiPPEE and CSEHYP) most often cannot rely on the family\u2019s support and sustain a high risk of lasting dependence on welfare if the latter is available and the young person is eligible, in addition to the risks to individual well-being and health. The policy challenge: Integrated support of transitions to independent life Young people in Europe who are at risk of or are experiencing homelessness, are leaving care or come from migrant families carry a double burden of pressures \u2014 low personal resources (money, educational level, work) and a lack of family support. Low personal resources, lack of opportunities and constrained access to education limit their chances of having stable and well-paid jobs and becoming ",
        "\u279c 60 socially integrated. They face more difficulties in making successful transitions to independent living compared to the general youth population and thus are in need of additional societal resources to compensate for their disadvantages. The policy challenge in the case of young people with accumulated disadvantages, after leaving home, care or education, is to compensate for their low resources (individual, social, political) in order to ensure more normative transitions to independent living. Above all, they need more educational opportunities, employment schemes, housing and welfare services and the presence of supportive adults. Policy implications: Personal advisers and extended institutional support A young person, when leaving care or compulsory schooling, needs continuing support from adults, such as key support workers or foster parents, who prioritise post-compulsory education over \u2018short transitions\u2019 into low-skilled and low-paid jobs. The research projects revealed the importance of face-to-face interventions by care workers. The researchers also highlighted the positive achievements of multi-agency engagement with young people where teachers play a moderator\u2019s role between school and the person in transition to independent living or into post- compulsory schooling. Working face to face in residential settings is good practice in Denmark, Hungary and Spain and the multi-agency approach has gained success in England. Support and encouragement also involve, besides key workers\u2019 formal support, addressing other weaknesses that youth face in their transitions to independent living. Namely, they need compensation for the financial support missing from their families of origin to extend their financial access to education. Good examples are free access to education (e.g. in Sweden), based on an equal opportunities approach, and the availability of loans, scholarships and benefits (e.g. in France and England). Different types of accommodation should also be available for different types and ages of \u2018early leavers\u2019 from the family of origin (including the homeless and those at risk of homelessness), from education or from public care. Recommendations \u2022 Postpone early labour market integration trials of early leavers from home, school or care and focus on keeping them in education in ways that are equivalent to the general youth population. Enable and support completion of compulsory schooling and continuing education and training. \u2022 Design services that are disconnected from legal age limits to address challenges that are attached to key transitions in young people\u2019s lives, faced by those who are leaving home, education or care. Allow for adequate alternatives in housing which enable a smooth transition to independent living. ",

ThE POlICY ISSUE: lack of resources for civic and political participation Young people with disadvantaged backgrounds have very different opportunities for civic and political participation. First-generation immigrants invariably have language problems and lack relevant social networks, even if these issues also often affect their descendants. Several generations face the additional challenge of ethnic discrimination before they are fully (or partially) accepted and integrated. This is not only a problem for them but equally so for the societies in which they live, which should make it a key concern for policymakers. Unregistered immigrants also represent a disadvantaged group that lack resources and recognition and are often overlooked as a result of their precarious legal status (being \u2018illegal\u2019). Unfortunately, since they are undocumented, having neither citizenship nor residency status, they remain on the periphery of society. Younex showed that the effect of unemployment on social and political participation seems to vary across countries. In some countries it leads to lower levels of participation, while in other countries it does not. This suggests that the impact of unemployment is mediated by national and local opportunity structures, more specifically by access to the institutionalised political system and by the particular welfare regime. The Younex project underlines the importance of social capital in youth for political participation. Unemployed young people who are involved in voluntary associations are more likely to be politically active, and the gap in participation levels between the young unemployed, precarious young workers and regularly employed youth groups is reduced when controlling for associational membership. These results still need further research to understand the stronger political involvement of precarious workers. The policy challenge: Empowerment of youth agency Individuals have the capacity to make positive adaptations within the context of significant adversity (Luthar et al. 2000), and to adapt along appropriate developmental pathways, despite disruptions such as family breakdowns (Edwards 2007). Referring to Kasearu et al. (2010), a young person is a mediator between two generations of adults with both positive and negative life chances; young people are active in building their own human, economic and social capital. Youth agency includes capabilities and resilience that could be empowered with political measures directed towards young people with biographical disadvantages. ",
        "\u279c 62 YiPPEE visualised cases of young people with disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. low value of education, dysfunctions of birth families) and how they formed the ambition to do better than their parents. The researchers highlighted both internal and external empowering factors that were found among youth from care backgrounds who identified themselves as having post-compulsory education. The internal factors are connected to will, persistence and commitment but also valuing knowledge (an acknowledgement of further education as a necessary precondition for getting a better job and building a good future). The internal factors are closely connected to the external factors \u2014 support from school, motivating teachers or key workers bridging school and the transition to post-compulsory education, finance schemes for widening access (such as benefits, loans or scholarships) and housing schemes to ensure affordable and appropriate accommodation. YiPPEE also highlighted the value of volunteering and civic engagement for young people in and leaving care, bringing them into contact with well-integrated adults outside the care system and extending their social networks. However, lack of money and time limited their opportunities, especially after they had left care. Younex pointed to social capital, particularly that deriving from membership of voluntary associations, and how it reduces social exclusion and increases the political participation of a young person. Even in countries with weaker traditions of civic association, a number of indicators referring to the conceptualisation of social capital, such as the scope of friendship and participation in social activities, show a positive impact on the integration of unemployed youth. The policy challenge lies in developing measures addressed to the empowerment of youth agency to enable young people with disadvantaged backgrounds to break the chain of disadvantages and broaden the field of choices about their future. The promotion of access to social rights can contribute to the promotion of equal opportunities and social inclusion. With the internalisation of these rights comes a sense of empowerment that can help young people to realise their potential. Policy implications: Support for young people\u2019s capabilities and resilience The research projects noted several positive examples across countries that support vulnerable young people\u2019s transitions to autonomous life: changes in laws, functional welfare provision, good practices demonstrating how the education system and labour market policies can reduce the disadvantages of young people and civil society initiatives. The studies also highlighted the challenges around how youth agency can be empowered, for example through the process of peer learning. CSEHYP recruited homeless or ex-homeless young people as co-researchers to interview other young people who were homeless or at risk of homelessness and during the interviews the young people often asked the co-researchers how they had coped with being homeless or had got their lives back on a positive track. The young co-researchers ",

The projects also revealed that NGOs play an important role in filling the vacuum of giving support that the youth with disadvantaged backgrounds need in contexts where they are politically under-recognised and insufficiently supported by public policy. In the most positive cases, it is the network of service and policy-oriented organisations (NGOs and public institutions) that, through cooperation and partnerships, can guide young socially excluded people on more positive pathways of transition. The support should start as soon as the need emerges. As the Younex project has shown, organisations play a key role by specialising either in service provision or in policy advocacy, although in some cases these activities overlap. Civil society organisations are fundamental policy implementers across Europe: they contribute to raising political and social awareness among youth, and they also have an important impact on local and national policies. In countries with less developed welfare regimes, as Younex shows, civil society organisations are often the only way youth have to get a job or training that can improve their employability. EUMARGINS noted positive practice related to political participation in Estonia, Norway and Sweden, where young people with a residence permit are allowed to vote in local elections. Recommendations \u2022 Empower young people with disadvantaged backgrounds to fight politically for their own rights as an interest group. Consider giving voting rights to young migrants with a residence permit. \u2022 Elaborate measures that will foster more active civic and political participation among young people with disadvantaged backgrounds to enable them to access their social rights and feel responsible for shaping their own futures. \u2022 Involve civil society organisations, as bodies which complement or substitute state provisions and have extensive knowledge of young people\u2019s everyday situations, more closely in the design and implementation of relevant policies. \u2022 Include representatives with ethnic minority or migrant backgrounds in political parties and develop political issues and agendas that reflect their interests; recruit young immigrants in campaigns and create the feeling that they count. \u2022 Strengthen the recognition of non-formal education by employers and within educational systems, elaborate schemes of granting subsidy money for those extensively engaged in the youth work. \u2022 Launch community information centres to inform young people of the possibilities of, for example, active engagement, the existence of European funds to support involvement in a range of programmes and the opportunities for training.

        "\u279c 64 Chapter 5: Key messages Young people who are homeless or at risk of being homeless, youth leaving care and migrant youth are exposed to diverse risks associated with the possibility of social exclusion, leaving their families of origin earlier than the general population while being unprepared (psychologically, socially, economically) for an autonomous life. Young people who leave school, care or home early face more difficulties in making successful transitions to independent living compared to the youth population as a whole and thus are in need of societal resources to compensate for their disadvantages. Young people with disadvantaged backgrounds have very different opportunities for civic and political participation. The potential of civil society organisations to involve young people is underexploited. Consideration should be given to the development of subsidy schemes and scholarships for granting to actively engaged youth. Political parties can consciously recruit migrant youth in developing political issues and agendas and carry out campaigns to raise their awareness. The empowerment of youth agency releases resilience and the capacity of young people to fight politically for their own rights as an interest group and to be taken seriously by the governments and politicians.

The way forward: Tackling multiple disadvantages of youth on the margins of society The \u2018EU strategy for youth \u2014 Investing and empowering\u2019 ( 20 ), the \u2018Council resolution on a renewed framework for European cooperation in the youth field for 2010\u201318\u2019 ( 21 ), and \u2018Europe 2020: A European strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth\u00b4 ( 22 ) set a triple goal for European youth policies: (1) to create more opportunities for youth in education and employment; (2) to improve access and full participation of all young people in society; and (3) to foster solidarity between youth and society. The policy evidence from research on youth with disadvantaged backgrounds revealed a social divide in opportunities and access to full participation of European young people and in social solidarity. Young people with disadvantages face a glass ceiling that impedes their personal aspirations in their life careers. Even if they have ambitious goals concerning education or professional life, as the research has revealed, they can only achieve these (if at all) with delay because of fewer opportunities, lower access and less solidarity between these young people and society compared to society\u2019s \u2018contract\u2019 with the general youth population. Based on numerous recommendations drawn from the research results, the social divide can be narrowed by political acknowledgement of the special social and educational needs of these groups of children and young people who have to carry a range of disadvantages (dysfunctional or non-supportive family, ethnic minority or migrant backgrounds, institutional and structural barriers), the early prevention of social exclusion (e.g. risk-buffering educational systems reducing inequalities) and elaboration of reinsertion measures supporting youth transitions to independent living. This conclusion refers to the need for a complex mosaic of inclusive educational and labour market policies combined with supportive welfare policies, an activated civil society and, last but not least, the empowerment of young people\u2019s agency from an early age, by encouraging participation and citizenship in a supportive and secure social atmosphere. 6.1. Increase in formal support, protection and encouragement will open up more opportunities for the social inclusion of excluded youth Williamson (2007) stresses the importance of an opportunity-focused youth policy across Europe, framed at local, regional, national and EU levels, that is not (20) http://youth-partnership-eu.coe.int/youth-partnership/news/attachments/communication_final.pdf (21) http://youth-partnership-eu.coe.int/youth-partnership/documents/EKCYP/Youth_Policy/docs/ YP_strategies/Policy/doc1648_en.pdf (22) http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:2020:FIN:EN:PDF ",

An opportunity-focused approach to the social inclusion of young people can be secured by the strategic investment of financial (including youth-sensitive budgeting) and human resources (e.g. counselling, mentoring, supervision, support). The policy challenge addressed to children and youth with disadvantaged backgrounds is the elaboration of an opportunity-focused framework of generalised support and a multi-agency approach in youth policies. The policy responses are twofold: \u2022 elaboration of measures that reduce the risks of social exclusion for youth with potential biographical disadvantages \u2014 migrants and ethnic minorities, those from disadvantaged neighbourhoods and those left without family support \u2014 from an early age; and \u2022 development of social reinsertion measures targeted at youth with low personal resources, facing institutional and structural constraints. 6.2. Integration of policies and the strengthening of their inclusiveness will improve the accessibility to education and the labour market of excluded youth groups The policy challenge is the elaboration of inclusive educational policies (in certain school contexts) that can help to overcome structural inequalities facing young people in combination with social protection and inclusive labour force policies addressed to youth with biographical disadvantages (in or from public care, young people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and those with ethnic minority or migrant backgrounds). The policy responses can vary from a single measure to complex programmes involving multiple agencies and including: (1) Basing policymaking and practice on evidence and reflection. The policy challenge is making societies more inclusive through encouraging critical reflections on them. For policy responses, this means the annual collection of comparative statistics at national and local levels using EU indicators, both about the current situation and the achieved trends, but also explicit legislation to oblige local authorities and child protection agencies to provide financial and practical support for young people below and over the age of majority (usually 18) to stay in education. At the EU level this means identifying, measuring and monitoring young people with disadvantaged backgrounds (missing family support, early school- and home-leavers, with migrant history) specifically in EU strategy and in policy documents with access to regional and local regulations by applying the open method of coordination. (2) Elaboration of measures aimed at increasing the potential of education and training systems to reduce inequalities among youth. This refers to the policy ",
        "\u279c 68 challenge of making education the first priority in the lives of young people with disadvantaged backgrounds. The policy responses revolve around providing children and young people with equal access (including opportunities and expectations) to compulsory and post-compulsory education ensured by financial and social welfare measures and enabled through highly professional designated teachers and adult key workers. (3) Combining policies for securing transitions to adulthood. The policy challenge is the identification of the special social and educational needs of children and young people with disadvantaged backgrounds. This requires strategies for looking at different policies (education, labour market, welfare) together, thus discovering the institutional as well as structural barriers that can cause noticeable delays in young people\u2019s transitions to independent living. The policy responses are aimed at compensating for the lack of family support due to family dysfunction or incapacity in young people\u2019s lives with external efforts from the wider social environment. This refers to prevention and early intervention measures against both early school-leaving (the \u2018poor-family- poor-schooling effect\u2019) and home-leaving (the \u2018normalisation-according-to- legal-age effect\u2019), including housing support services, grants for continuing studying and personalised ongoing support for those who require it. (4) Paving the way towards smooth entry to the labour market for youth with disadvantaged backgrounds. The policy challenge lies in developing an education system that facilitates the entry of young people to the opened up labour market. As the policy response, a delay can be created in the insertion processes of young people into the work domain by political means in order to prolong their studies in ways similar to those that prevail amongst the wider population of the same age. 6.3. Promotion of citizenship and participation will empower youth agency and encourage solidarity between youth and society The policy challenge lies in the treatment in policy considerations of an individual child or a young person who faces institutional and structural barriers in his or her life aspirations or preferences, as an active social actor. The policy responses have at least two trajectories: (1) Supporting the personal resilience and human resources of children and young people for better reinsertion into society through their individual capacities and social capital building. The policy challenge lies in meeting the difference with tolerance and acceptance (e.g. multiculturalism in schools). The policy responses uncover participatory approaches in open and generic work with children and young people and their disadvantaged backgrounds. ",

The policy challenge lies in the encouragement of young people towards volunteering, participation in organisations and social networks (such as organised activities like after-care and after-school leisure time activities). The policy responses are related to a multisector approach that requires solidarity between different actors (e.g. apprenticeships through housing associations, NGOs and employers in the case of homeless youth), public and private service providers (e.g. training programmes developed by private business in cooperation with the homeless sector; risk assessments carried out by social workers, police and others who have a role in protecting children). 6.4. From the Europe 2020 flagship \u2018Youth on the move\u2019 to actions The EU policy challenge lies in ensuring that youth with disadvantaged backgrounds are more visible in EU programmes and funds. The policy responses uncover measures that remove economic barriers to participating in EU mobility programmes (for example, the introduction of a \u2018means-tested\u2019 application process or providing additional financial support, a European employment service fostering employment mobility, supporting job search and facilitating all additional procedures, including housing, insurance and linguistic support). The EU programmes and funds are important tools to promote learning mobility and other forms of learning and to increase young people\u2019s opportunities in the labour market. Therefore it is vital that they are open to all young people. These programmes have to be strengthened and developed in order to build further the capacity of young people to realise their personal aspirations and life careers. Finally, the EU youth strategy actions for preventing social exclusion have to be reinforced, along with holistic key working methods and the active inclusion of those most in need of support. ",

Research in this context should examine trends in the social exclusion of young women and men, and could address issues such as their opportunities, prospects and needs, availability of employment and its quality, career possibilities and education and training issues, as well as access to public and private services and facilities, housing, economic and social representation, means of formal and informal participation and empowerment and integration strategies. In addition, related questions such as poverty and inequality, social and cultural capital, discrimination, gender, migration and insecurity of various kinds facing young people could be included. In addressing such matters, questions such as life projects, identity development, attitudes, deviance and drug use ought to be considered.

The policy review \u2019Social inclusion of youth on the margins of society\u2019 looks into the lives and aspirations of young people who face severe or multiple forms of social exclusion, such as young migrants, young Roma, long-term unemployed, homeless youth and young people in public care. It analyses the causes and processes of their exclusion and focuses on policy solutions to break the individual and social glass-ceiling. This policy review summarises the evidence of a cluster of five youth-oriented research projects launched in 2008 and broadens the evidence basis for stimulating inclusive growth in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy and its flagship initiatives \u2018Youth on the move\u2019 and the \u2018European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion\u2019.
