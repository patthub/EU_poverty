        "\u0018 Summary European Commission delegations used the 50th anniversary to organise a cycle of activities publicis- ing the European Union and its achievements. The many conferences allowed politicians, academ- ics and civil society to evaluate the EU and its achieve- ments and set out the kind of relationships they want it to develop with its partner countries around the world. The events portrayed the EU as a model for re- gional cooperation respecting national diversity and committed to democracy, human rights, the rule of law and good governance. Many delegations added to the more traditional conferences and receptions, numerous cultural and sport activities involving young people, the media, and the wider general public. The aim was to raise awareness about the EU but also promote its core values. School children were involved in drawing exhibi- tions, quizzes to test their knowledge of the EU and direct discussions with diplomats. For the wider pub- lic, there were photo exhibitions, concerts, theatre and food festivals, film festivals and special TV and radio programmes. Throughout, delegations worked closely with the EU Presidency and with Member State embassies and cultural institutes coordinating activities and messages. \u00a9 E u r o p e a n C o m m i s s i o n Conference in Nicaragua ",
        "\u0018 This public diplomacy exercise succeeded in a number of ways. \u2022 It touched a wider public than the usual circle of people interested in EU activities, raising interest in the EU\u2019s work worldwide. \u2022 The more general character of these activities en- couraged the use of concise and credible messages to promote the EU\u2019s core values and explain its ex- ternal policies, development assistance and disaster relief. \u2022 It told the story of the EU, which gives it a type of brand, raising its profile. \u2022 It generated wide press coverage, with newspapers in certain countries publishing supplements on the EU or running a series of articles and special televi- sion and radio programmes. \u2022 Member State embassies and cultural institutes in the different countries were often involved in the design and organisation of these activities, reinforc- ing cooperation. Some of the figures illustrate the above: \u2022 78 special press supplements in leading national dailies and TV and radio programmes; \u2022 12 special newsletters; \u2022 4 journalism awards; \u2022 105 conferences, workshops and seminars; \u2022 62 exhibitions and stands at fairs; \u2022 73 events specifically for young people; \u2022 106 cultural events, including concerts and musical events, film festivals, dance and theatre; \u2022 48 competitions and quizzes; \u2022 19 sport events. Delegations promoted the article signed by Com- missioner Ferrero-Waldner, marking the 50th anni- versary. A total of 77 daily newspapers and magazines across the world published it. Latin America, eastern Europe, and central and south-east Asia gave it the highest coverage. ",
        "\u0018 The messages The delegations used the 50th anniversary events to reinforce the EU\u2019s core messages. Competitions, quizzes, exhibitions and film shows tackled sensitive questions concerning national identity, nationalism, press freedom, human rights and equality. The many activities highlighted the EU\u2019s core val- ues to a wider public. For example: \u2022 A journalism competition in Australia looked at the significance of EU integration. \u2022 An essay competition in Bolivia for school children focused on the benefits of integration. \u2022 A university students\u2019 essay contest in Brazil looked at \u201850 years building the EU\u2019. \u2022 A dance performance in India depicted the making of the EU. \u2022 A journalism competition in Mauritania concentrat- ed on the theme of democracy and press freedom. \u2022 A painting contest for high-school students in Moldova portrayed democracy, freedom and liberty. Conferences, workshops and seminars examined the EU\u2019s history, its economic and trade relations with the rest of the world and its future development, no- tably its world role. They involved: \u2022 hundreds of participants from the academic world and civil society; \u2022 national and local personalities; \u00a9 E u r o p e a n C o m m i s s i o n School event in Mauritania ",
        "\u0018 \u2022 national and local politicians, including members of government, providing an alternative platform to debate the EU; \u2022 the media. Speakers and participants recognised that today the EU is the world\u2019s largest donor of international assist- ance tackling poverty and providing humanitarian as- sistance. It is not just an economic power but a global political player and a trading partner of increasing im- portance. In Asia, Africa and Latin America, they examined the EU as a model for regional cooperation and de- velopment and highlighted a number of key factors accounting for the EU\u2019s longevity. \u2022 It has delivered 50 years of peace, stability and pros- perity. \u2022 It has done this while respecting democracy, human rights and the rule of law and promoting good gov- ernance. \u2022 It is a firm believer in multilateralism and partner- ship. \u2022 It has achieved a union of Member States while respecting the cultural diversity of its nations. \u00a9 E u r o p e a n C o m m i s s i o n Child\u2019s drawing from Venezuela ",
        "\u0018 Working with Member States All the delegations worked closely with the presi- dency and Member States present in the country concerned when planning and organising the events. The presidency spearheaded a number of events lend- ing its support, funds and staff time to work with Commission delegations. In addition, Member States\u2019 cultural institutes such as the Goethe Institute, the British Council and the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise played a crucial role in organising, publicising and hosting events. In many cases, delegations said it was the first time that Member State embassies had worked so closely with them. Having cemented these relationships, del- egations expect to continue this cooperation in the future. Delegations found that Member States readily co- operated with them on cultural events such as organ- ising film festivals and supporting artists and musi- cians from their countries. They also emphasised the importance of delivering a joint message. For example, in Ukraine, the delegation organised a \u2018European village\u2019 of some 50 tents. The delegation had two information tents and Member States one each. As Member States were also promoting the same 50th anniversary messages, the impact on the public was much greater. But there were also some cautionary remarks. At- tempts to bring all countries on board can make deci- sion-making slow and even endanger a project. To be more effective, some delegations suggested coopera- tion with a limited number of Member States for or- ganisational matters that need quick decisions direct- ly affecting only some embassies. This was the experience in New York, for example. Delegations took more time to organise events in partnerships (especially when many partners were in- volved). The embassies, like delegations, often did not have the extra human capacity to help substantially with organisational practicalities. This did not lessen the importance of Member State support \u2014 their cooperation usually attracted more people and great- er media interest. But delegations had to be aware they had to take on a lot of the practical work to en- sure success. \u00a9 E u r o p e a n C o m m i s s i o n Street party in Canberra (Australia) ",
        "10 Working with the media Delegations worked with the media creatively. Many warned that the media had to be prepared well in advance and be given information in good time. The delegations held press conferences often in co- operation with Member States and especially the presidency. These were always well attended. They cooperated with the media in a number of ways, including: \u2022 co-funding or co-producing documentaries and ra- dio shows; \u2022 providing information for radio quizzes and games and offering prizes; \u2022 finding speakers for panel discussions; \u2022 arranging for interviews by the head of delegation; \u2022 placing adverts in the written press; \u2022 producing TV spots; \u2022 co-financing press supplements; \u2022 holding round-table debates with the press; \u2022 providing articles ready for publication. Many newspapers but also television and radio chan- nels used the occasion to publish supplements or broadcast special programmes over a number of weeks or even days. In addition, the range of activities ensured the EU appeared as a story in its own right in newspa- per sections that would not normally cover it, such as the cultural pages, thus reaching new audiences. Here are some examples of the extensive press cov- erage. \u2022 Australia\u2019s 666 ABC radio station, working with the delegation, presented a three-hour live broadcast on Europe. It included a European themed quiz and competition as well as discussion panels and inter- views with ambassadors and other guests. \u2022 In Bolivia, there was a live one-hour programme on European integration, broadcast on a national TV channel and a national daily published a 20- page supplement. \u2022 Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Niue, Cook Islands, Samoa, Tonga and Fiji broadcast TV spots and radio soundtracks over three weeks with both general EU messages and project-related messages. A spe- cially composed Pacific\u2013EU song accompanied them as background. \u2022 In Russia, Izvestia , with a national circulation of 250 000, published an eight-page colour supple- ment on the EU. \u2022 In Brazil, TV Globo, the leading national broadcast- er, in the week before 25 March, broadcast a series of reports on EU\u2013Brazil relations. \u2022 Globonews, a pay-per-view channel, in the weeks leading to 25 March, presented each week a 25- minute programme called Sem Fronteiras , dedicated to aspects of European integration. \u2022 In the USA, more than 25 national and local televi- sion and radio stations featured the anniversary. The amount of coverage exceeded by far coverage of other major EU events such as the EU\u2013US summit. \u2022 Uganda broadcast a one-hour TV and radio show. \u2022 The Japanese press published 30 articles during the anniversary weekend. \u2022 In Peru, there was a TV documentary with inter- views on 50 years of European integration and a supplement in a daily newspaper. \u2022 Jordan\u2019s Ad-Dustour daily published three 24-page supplements. \u2022 In Mexico, the daily Reforma published a supple- ment. \u2022 In Nicaragua, there was a 30-minute radio pro- gramme on the EU\u2019s anniversary and three radio programmes on the association agreements and a historical TV programme. ",
        "11 In general, media coverage pointed to the EU\u2019s suc- cesses since its creation. But there was also a lot of discussion about the EU\u2019s future. Stories: \u2022 described the EU\u2019s historic achievements including securing peace and democracy and creating stability and prosperity on the continent; \u2022 covered key issues such as global warming, terrorism, energy security, border controls and illegal immigra- tion, the euro, the EU\u2019s agricultural, trade, foreign and security policies, future EU enlargement and what the papers described as enlargement fatigue, Member State divisions and the economic stagna- tion and growing economic gaps of recent years; \u2022 recognised the EU\u2019s increasing clout in world affairs and explored its current and future role on the world stage; \u2022 analysed the EU to see how far it could serve as a regional cooperation model for other parts of the world. Many stories said the EU was going through an identity crisis. Some pointed to a discrepancy be- tween its aspirations and the reality which, combined with the EU\u2019s regulations and bureaucracy, resulted, they said, in a lack of public support and a widening gap between institutions and citizens despite the achievements. Delegations helped to place Commissioner Ferrero- Waldner\u2019s signed article entitled \u201850 years of the EU\u2019. It traces the history of the EU and sets out the challenges. The press take-up was impressive. Figures show that at least 77 daily newspapers and magazines across the world published it. Latin America, eastern Europe, and central and south-east Asia gave it the highest coverage. The External Relations Directorate-General also pro- duced a video news release (VNR) showing 50 years of the EU\u2019s external service. TV stations such as Sky News, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio Canada, Phoenix and Rai News 24 re- quested it. In total 43 stations expressed an interest in receiving a copy of the VNR. The majority of interested stations were from the EU. However, there was also a good spread of interest from other regions. Comparing the initial interest in the report to the broadcasts actually secured, few used the VNR in their coverage of the event. Stations reported receiving many reports from various EU institutions and Commission Directorates- General (DGs), many of which relied on the same archi- val footage as the External Relations DG\u2019s VNR, though in a different context. The broadcasts that were secured happened both in March, for the anniversary, and also in early May to coincide with the 9 May celebrations. The External Relations DG also sent to all delega- tions a DVD of this via the diplomatic pouch. It is available in eight languages.

        "12 Engaging, informing and influencing All delegations reported that the public embraced the many events they organised, participating in high numbers. Film festivals, music events, Europe day festivities and radio quizzes attracted most people. Events in- volving children and youngsters were also well at- tended. A number of factors ensured high participation: \u2022 clear messages; \u2022 well targeting the event; \u2022 early preparation and publicity; \u2022 cooperation with Member States; \u2022 cooperation with the appropriate national and local authorities and groups. The private sector was a willing partner giving its backing to the anniversary celebrations. European companies provided prizes, sponsorship, co-organised events and gave out EU promotional material to their clients. For example: \u2022 More than 30 companies with some 800 outlets in 29 provinces and regions across China offered spe- cial birthday promotions to their customers in what was the biggest nationwide European event in the country. \u2022 Eighteen major hotels in Indonesia joined forces with the EC delegation there to organise an EU food festival celebrating the 50th anniversary. \u2022 Lufthansa Airlines provided the prize of a return trip to Europe for two for the winner of the jour- nalism competition in New Zealand. Display panels provided by the External Relations DG were widely used in exhibitions and other events. They include a map of Europe, the 27 Member State flags as well as pictures and captions featuring key milestones of the past 50 years. They use dates that people can identify with such as the first moon land- ing. The panels exist in 11 languages including Chi- nese, Japanese, Russian and Arabic (see below). The Communication DG also produced a series of products that delegations appreciated, although some delegations complained that they received material too late or in insufficient quantities. Some events at- tracted over 100 000 people, for example. \u00a9 E u r o p e a n C o m m i s s i o n Georgia celebrating the 50th anniversary ",
        "1\u0018 The lessons learned Public diplomacy deals with the influence of public attitudes. It seeks to promote EU interests by under- standing, informing and influencing. It means clearly explaining the EU\u2019s goals, policies and activities and fostering understanding of these goals through dia- logue with individual citizens, groups, institutions and the media. The 50th anniversary celebrations provided the in- centive to launch this huge public diplomacy exercise across the world. Delegations used a string of activities \u2014 film festi- vals, concerts, exhibitions, conferences, festivals, quiz- zes and competitions, sports events and so on \u2014 to increase the understanding of EU policies, inform the general public and broaden the dialogue. A cultural activity such as a film festival shows an- other aspect of the EU. The Mauritius delegation said, for example, that the EU had received \u2018a lot of nega- tive press in Mauritius due to the sugar market re- form. For me, one of the biggest achievements of the film festival was to show a positive, more down-to- earth side of the institution. Many people expressed their appreciation of the festival\u2019. Delegations worked closely with the presidency and Member State embassies and cultural institutes coordinating activities and policy messages. \u00a9 E u r o p e a n C o m m i s s i o n Children in Fiji ",
        "1\u0018 A number of conclusions can be made. \u2022 Delegations need the close cooperation of Member State embassies to coordinate activities and messages. \u2022 The messages need to be clear, concise and credible, avoiding jargon. \u2022 The EU\u2019s policy delivery is enhanced when Mem- ber States integrate EU policy messages into their diplomatic and public messages and policies. \u2022 Visual language is important. The wide use of the anniversary logo helped promote the common im- age and core messages of the anniversary. \u2022 Channels for dialogue need to be maintained and developed. \u2022 EU-funded projects can be better publicised so that the public can see where the aid money is spent and how it is benefiting. \u2022 Delegations need to adapt the way they relay informa- tion to meet the needs of different local audiences. \u2022 National formal and informal networks are impor- tant for information sharing and exchange and for building a stronger support base in the country. \u2022 The many public events allowed the public to have a direct dialogue with diplomats and officials and so improve understanding. The same applies whether it is a high level event or a discussion with school chil- dren or students. In all cases, these events strengthen the EU\u2019s presence in a country by building trust and understanding. \u2022 The local and regional media needs to be targeted. In many countries, local press, television and radio may be more appropriate to reach certain audiences such as young people, for example, than the national press. \u2022 The EU is a brand name able to attract the private sector, with European companies ready to provide support in kind in order to associate themselves with public events organised by the EU. \u2022 Targeted placement of information material can be effective for specific events or to reach specific tar- get groups. Especially successful were radio pro- grammes mixing political discussion with music, quizzes and question and answer sessions. \u2022 The many cultural events underlined the EU\u2019s di- versity and at the same its unity. The huge number of activities promoted EU poli- cies and models and increased the EU\u2019s visibility. They reinforced a positive image of the EU and raised awareness about what it does around the world and its ability to act as an economic but also a political power. \u00a9 E u r o p e a n C o m m i s s i o n Exhibition in Nicaragua ",
        "1\u0018 Some examples Celebrations at the United Nations A visit of the world-renowned Norddeutsche Rundfunk (NDR) symphony orchestra to Carnegie Hall turned into a major event celebrating the EU\u2019s 50th anniversary. The EU delegation with the EU Presidency invited the orchestra to extend its stay so it could play at the UN General Assembly hall. All Member States gave their backing and co-organised the reception that followed. Over 1 600 people heard Commission Vice-Presi- dent Siim Kallas alongside Deputy Secretary-General Asha-Rose Migiro for the UN. The orchestra played Beethoven\u2019s Eroica symphony with Christoph von Dohnanyi conducting. Video images of the 50th anniversary celebrations in Berlin followed the speeches and the delegation placed copies of the Berlin Declaration in the concert programmes. UNTV televised the opening speeches and the concert\u2019s first minutes. It made this available as a feed for the international broadcast media. NDR German TV and Estonia TV also broadcast part of the con- cert. \u00a9 E u r o p e a n C o m m i s s i o n 50th anniversary concert at the United Nations General Assembly ",
        "1\u0018 Japan\u2019s schools welcome the EU Japanese schools opened their doors to EU diplo- mats to hear more about the EU and its Member States. In total 75 speakers from all EU Member States including 24 ambassadors visited 77 middle and high schools mainly in the Tokyo area but also as far afield as Hokkaido and Kyoto. More than 20 000 students participated in the event which had the backing of the Ministry of Education. The aim was to awaken the student\u2019s curiosity for Europe and its countries. It was the first time a delegation organised such a massive awareness event explaining the origins of the EU and its aims. In January, it sought out schools interested in par- ticipating by publishing a call for applications on its website. School interest was so high that the delega- tion had to search for additional speakers to meet the demand. The delegation prepared a presentation for the speakers to adapt as they liked. They were encouraged to speak in Japanese, otherwise the delegation ar- ranged interpretation. It also gave them the short \u00a9 E u r o p e a n C o m m i s s i o n A school in Japan opens its doors to the European Union animated film You control climate change from the Eu- ropa website, maps, flags and some promotional items. It briefed speakers to encourage questions and where possible introduce games and even quizzes. Twenty-two ambassadors and charg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires at- tended the press conference to launch the event held at the German Embassy. The press widely covered the event with NHK TV broadcasting an interview with the head of delega- tion. It reported that teenagers who had listened to his presentation found the EU\u2019s history impressive es- pecially when they discovered that the six founding countries had come up with the idea out of a need to nurture peace in the region. The strong cooperation between the embassies and the delegation was crucial to the event\u2019s success. It has created a good network with the schools that it plans to reinforce through more activities targeting the young. ",
        "1\u0018 Children in Venezuela paint their EU vision Nine European schools in Caracas embraced the EU 50th anniversary celebrations when they agreed to back the \u2018Lets paint together!\u2019 competition. Between March and April 2007, the delegation talked to some 800 children aged 7 to 13 in the nine schools explaining the EU\u2019s past, future, goals and val- ues. After each presentation, they asked the children to participate in a drawing contest under the theme \u2018Juntos/together\u2019 portraying what Europe meant to them. Originally the delegations planned to select 13 winners to use their drawings to illustrate the delega- tion\u2019s calendar for 2008. However, the quality and the quantity (750 received) of the entries were so high that the delegation organised an exhibition of all the entries and not only the wining ones, in the Univer- sidad Central de Venezuela (UCV), who held the ex- hibition in their central library. The exhibition opened on May 14 for two weeks, and was visited by over 35 000 people. Ukraine\u2019s \u2018Europe village\u2019 tells EU history A birthday tent telling the history of the EU marked the 50th celebration in Ukraine. Every year the EC delegation organises a European village by erecting tents in the city centre. In total, 50 tents went up. In addition to the birth- day tent, each Member State occupied a tent as well as the EC delegation. Other tents housed drawing competitions, public discussions on political and eco- nomic issues and so on. Visitors received information on the EU, its crea- tion, achievements and challenges. They also learned about its relations with Ukraine. They could visit an exhibition dedicated to the 50th anniversary or par- ticipate in quizzes on the EU\u2019s history. Member States also promoted the 50th anniversary in their tents and gave a clear message of unity. Additional events drew in the crowds. There was a mini football tournament and a rock concert with two Ukrainian and one Latvian band closing the Eu- rope village day. The delegation worked closely with the Member States but also the Kyiv City Administration and the \u00a9 E u r o p e a n C o m m i s s i o n Child\u2019s drawing from Venezuela ",
        "1\u0018 Ukrainian government to organise the event, in par- ticular the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Ministry of Sports, Youth and Family. Between 50 000 and 60 000 people participated. Nearly all weekend news programmes on national channels covered it on the day while newspapers printed articles announcing it. Birthday greetings from China EU Member State embassies and consulates, Eu- ropean chambers of commerce and more than 30 European companies with some 800 outlets in 29 provinces and regions across China jointly cele- brated the EU\u2019s 50th anniversary. They offered spe- cial birthday promotions to their customers in the biggest nationwide European event in the coun- try. The EU Embassy in Beijing and the delegation worked together on the \u2018Happy birthday Europe\u2019 campaign to shape the concept and develop the visu- al identity. The campaign brought together the Chi- nese people who like to shop and eat out and the increasing number of European retailers. All EU Member States participated with ambassadors and consuls present at outlets to talk with customers and even have their picture taken with them. Ten EU ambassadors, for example, cut a huge birthday cake at IKEA and shared it with custom- ers. The supermarket chain Metro offered special promotions in its stores and weekly mailings to customers and had a wine and food tasting session for invited companies mainly from the gastronom- ic industry. Participating airlines such as Austrian, Air France- KLM and Lufthansa handed out the birthday post- card (see below) and other gifts while their crew wore a special pin with the anniversary \u2018Together\u2019 logo on flights between the EU and China. Hotel chains such as Novotel, Mercure, Kem- pinski, Sofitel and Swissotel served European spe- cialities in their restaurants to mark the anniver- sary. National and local print, online and television me- dia widely covered the campaign. The light-hearted approach of much of the coverage complemented the more formal reporting of the special EU summit and the Berlin declaration. Europe\u2019s capitals in open-air exhibition in Dominican Republic A photo exhibition of the EU\u2018s 27 capitals opened in the Parque de la Independencia in the Colonial Zone of Santo Domingo to mark the EU\u2019s 50th an- niversary. The exhibition was to run for six weeks but the delegation extended it to seven after a Ministry of Culture request. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, in the country to attend the EU\u2013Rio Group ministerial meeting, opened the exhibition on 19 April with the Domini- can Minister for Culture, Jos\u00e9 Rafael Lantigua. Over 100 000 people visited the exhibition\u2019s 138 panels with photos and information displays about the EU and its relations with the Dominican Republic. A catalogue for schools accompanied the exhibi- tion. Many creative activities were organised in the square for visiting youngsters. Some 2 500 school children participated. They painted pictures of the capitals, made monuments and maps of Europe out of cardboard, flew kites and so on. The delegation closely collaborated with the six Member State embassies present in the country and \u00a9 E u r o p e a n C o m m i s s i o n Postcard from China ",
        "1\u0018 with the country\u2019s Ministries of Culture and Foreign Affairs. The French Embassy had organised the first such exhibition in 2006. Cameroon/EU programme widely aired Some 35 African television channels and five in the EU and the USA broadcast a programme on EU and Cameroon cooperation produced by the country\u2019s main television company (CRTV) between 8 and 10 May. CRTV produced the one-hour-long show in French, English, Spanish and Portuguese. The EC del- egation closely cooperated, using funding from the Development DG. It also produced a series of short radio programmes using the television clips. The tele- vision show combined a panel discussion with four documentaries. The first examined the peaceful reso- lution of conflict looking at the EU\u2019s role in the 2006 agreement between Nigeria and Cameroon on the Bakassi peninsula. The other three documentaries looked at regional integration, sustainable develop- ment of the country\u2019s forests, and rural development, using EU-aided projects as examples. The radio programmes covered the same four themes with a short clip followed by a discussion with a studio guest. Looking for answers in Beirut In the informal atmosphere of a popular cafe in Beirut, the delegation organised a political debate to explore if Europe\u2019s road to peace could offer answers to today\u2019s Lebanon. The delegation selected the Time Out caf\u00e9 because it has many student clients but also older professionals. The head of delegation, a representative from the German Embassy as well as two invited academics presented their case. A discussion followed with a Daily Star journalist animating. Some 60 people participated. The caf\u00e9 environment guaranteed a lively debate. One indicator of the event\u2019s success was the wide press coverage that it received. Aspiring journalists in New Zealand explain EU To mark the EU\u2019s 50th anniversary, the New Zea- land delegation transformed its annual competition for working journalists into one for young people as- piring to enter the profession. To take part, they had to either write an article (1 500 to 2 500 words) or produce a podcast (two to three minutes) on the topic \u2018EU \u2014 What does it mean 4U?\u2019. The delegation cooperated with the presidency and Member State embassies in the country. They selected a shortlist of nine winners to attend a two-day Eu- rope workshop in Wellington at the end of June. The head of each of the nine European missions present in the city sponsored and hosted one of the winning students. The workshop selected the final overall winner. Lufthansa Airlines provided the prize of a return trip to Europe for two, with a one-week stay in Brussels and Strasbourg. First European film festival in Mauritius marks anniversary For the first time a European film festival took place in Mauritius as part of the 50th anniversary celebra- tions. The delegation wanted to reach a wider audi- ence and opted for this event. It selected two cinemas for easier access and kept the ticket prices low. It approached the French and British Embassies, the two Member States present in Mauritius. They agreed to participate and gave the lead role to the Centre Charles Baudelaire and the British Council. They also agreed to share the cost of renting the cinemas. In addition, the British High Commission assigned one of its trainees to work on the event.

The delegation made an agreement with a media company to advertise the festival free of charge. In return, it gave it exclusive publication rights of the event. It also found other local sponsors and worked closely with local cultural groups to promote it. The festival was the most talked about event in Mauritius during the months of March and April and had extensive press coverage. All major newspapers, magazines, radio and televi- sion stations picked up the event. For example, one of the main newspapers donated a full back page to the festival. In the two-week run-up, at least one medium featured the festival nearly every day. ",

India celebrates with Jean Monnet A string of organisations cooperated to arrange the Jean Monnet Exhibition in New Delhi as part of the EU\u2019s 50th anniversary celebrations. The Auroville- based Pavillon de France came up with the idea. The delegation worked with them and widened the exhi- bition into a discussion on regional cooperation and development.

The result was a 10-day exhibition, a day-long sem- inar and a round-table discussion with experts, former ambassadors and the current ambassadors of France and Germany as well as the head of the EC delega- tion to India. The theme of the three events was \u2018Uniting people\u2019. The exhibition looked at Monnet\u2019s contribution to building the EU and at regional experiences such as SAARC and ASEAN. The seminar and round table also explored Mon- net\u2019s vision and what it meant for today\u2019s EU and its relations with Asia. Central to the debate was how regional unions can resolve old divisions. The press, including The Hindu , The Pioneer and The Indian Express covered the event.

Over 50 events mark EU birthday in USA The United States\u2019 EU birthday celebrations ran for 14 days with over 50 events in 19 states bringing on board all sections of society. The Delegation and the EU embassies in the coun- try pooled together their resources to mount a com- mon European week. They could not squeeze the number of events into seven days and so had to stretch the final programme to 14, running from 18 to 31 March. The Delegation worked in partnership with uni- versities, schools, cultural centres and foundations, think tanks, research centres, museums, and federal and municipal bodies. They organised their own events and adopted many EU-themed events organised by others under one umbrella. In Washington, a presidency-inspired EU open house day attracted 38 000 people for a behind-the- scenes look. Member State embassies and the delega- tion agreed to open their doors to the public on 12 May. The presidency rented six Washington Metro buses and drivers offering the public a free shuttle service between the embassies and the delegation. They also financed bus and metro adverts using the slogan \u2018Take metro to Europe\u2019. They sold the event as a chance to visit Europe without leaving DC. Visitors could collect stamps from all EU embassies and the delegation in a \u2018pass- port\u2019 specially designed for the event. The European Poetry in Motion\u00ae project, also a big success, featured 135 European poems (five from each EU country). The poems appeared in their orig- inal language with an English translation on over 600 bus placards and 20 metro stations in the Washington DC metropolitan area during May. The Goethe Institute hosted a marathon poetry reading of all the poems with American poet Ernie Wormwood moderating, and a downtown caf\u00e9 and book store held an afternoon of poetry with over 10 EU Member States participating. All EU embassies and the EC delegation partnered with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Au- thority and the Poetry Society of America to organise it. Many other organisations also gave their support. ",
