        "4 Foreword As a European civil-service organization, it is natural that the JRC must balance many priorities when setting its work programme. So it is all the more necessary to protect a small space for novel and creative pro- posals from the researchers themselves, which might otherwise be crowded out. Reading the descriptions of the seven Exploratory Research projects conducted at IPSC in 2007-2008, one is struck immediately by their variety. They show just how much original thinking exists here and confi rm the value of encouraging staff to follow their own imagination. Many of the ideas have been inspired by the day to day work of the people involved and, far from being a distraction, are specifi cally aimed at developing that work. Indeed, the ex-post Evaluation of JRC Direct Actions in the 6th Frame- work Programme, conducted this year by the panel chaired by Sir David King, saw exploratory research as a means to help to bring inseparably together the scientifi c and policy support dimensions of JRC activities. It recommended thoroughly re-evaluating the position and management of exploratory research to this end, a challenge that I hope the Scientifi c Committees will be able to pick up in 2009. Having taken up the post this October, I must lastly acknowledge my predecessor, Dr Naouma Kourti, who was Secretary of the Scientifi c Committee for the duration of these projects, and thank her for her commitment and enthusiasm in steering the work of the committee and handing it over smoothly to us.

        "Dear reader, The IPSC strategy, re-defined at the beginning of 2008, calls for an en- hancement of research activities in the areas of protection and secu- rity. The new strategy has been presented to Institute staff on several occa- sions throughout the year. The role of Exploratory Research within the Institute\u2019s strategy is clear: to be a source of new ideas, to stimulate creativity and innovation and to motivate researchers. Currently IPSC\u2019s resources are mainly devoted to satisfying a strong demand from external customers. We are, however, committed to keeping and exploiting the Exploratory Research concept. The high scientific value of the results obtained in 2008 shows that we are on the right track. I encourage IPSC staff to use the Exploratory Research mechanism as an opportunity to explore new horizons. Enjoy the report!

The green frame indicates the ground plate area, while the red frame identifies the model position. 6 3-D Urban Structure information from Very High Resolution InSAR imagery Objectives In the domain of emergency response to natural disasters (e.g. earth- quakes, tsunamis) and man-made conflict events (e.g. large scale destruction), rapid situation assessment is crucial for initiating ef- fective emergency response actions. Remote sensing satellites, such as optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors, can provide important information due to their capability to map extended areas of interest in a fast and censorship free manner, giving an objective overview of the crisis area shortly after the event. Current spaceborne optical satellites such as Ikonos and Quickbird have meter and sub-meter resolutions, respectively. These sensors belong to the category of passive optical systems, depending on day- light and cloud free weather conditions during the acquisition phase. In contrast, active SAR sensors have their main advantages in the in- dependence of the solar illumination, as well as the relative insensi- tivity to weather conditions. However, until recently spaceborne SAR systems were only capable of imaging the earth surface with a spatial resolution of not better than 9 meter. This changed when the new very high resolution (VHR) SAR sensors onboard the TerraSAR-X and Cosmo-SkyMed satellites were launched in 2007 with spatial resolu- tions up to 1 meter. In VHR imagery, features from individual urban structures, like buildings, can be identified in their characteristic set- tings in urban settlement patterns (e.g. residential areas, city centers, industrial parks). JRC-IPSC\u2019s action \u201cGeo-Spatial Information Analysis for Global Secu- rity and Stability (ISFEREA)\u201d is developing its expertise in urban set- tlement characterisation as part of its activities in support of crisis management, damage assessment, territorial management in third world countries and assessment of urbanisation in African mega cit- ies. Future use of VHR SAR is expected to become an important com- plimentary methodology to urban characterisation based on high and very high resolution optical imagery. There are two main objectives for this project: 1. Explore the information content of VHR SAR imagery of 3-D urban structures. 2. To assess the potential and the added value of VHR SAR for ur- ban applicati0ns. Results First phase To investigate the main scattering mechanisms of buildings in SAR, we measured in the first phase of the project a scaled building model in the European Microwave Signature Laboratory (EMSL), which is an anechoic chamber with a hemispherical shape with a diameter of 20 m. The building-like flat roofed structure is designed as cuboid in scale 1:10, with dimensions 120 cm x 90 cm x 60 cm (length, width, Fig. 1 Setup of EMSL experiment.

It consists of a glued wooden frame with 2.6 cm thick gypsum plates attached to it. The ground plate is 400 cm x 450 cm and consists of a wooden frame covered with thin aluminium plates. The setup of the experiment is shown in fig. 1. The building model was measured with various viewing configurations resulting in total in more than 800 im- ages. The data were analysed using state of the art SAR techniques and compared to actual VHR SAR data as well as to theoretic electro- magnetic backscattering models, leading to a refined model for build- ings in VHR SAR. Second phase To assess the potential and the added value of VHR SAR for urban applications, we developed in the second phase of the project a novel automatic 3D reconstruction method capable to extract the height of man made structures from single detected SAR (power) imagery. The method is based on a \u201dhypothesis generation - rendering - matching\u201d procedure. A series of hypotheses are generated and rendered by a SAR imaging simulator taking into account the acquisition param- eters of the actual VHR SAR data. The simulations are compared to the actual VHR SAR data; the estimated height corresponds to the hy- pothesis, whose simulation matches best with the actual scene. The main novelty of the method consists in the use of detected single VHR SAR images instead of multi-dimensional data (e.g. interferometric, polarimetric, multiaspect). We tested the method on two VHR SAR airborne scenes from a built- up area (Dorsten) in Germany, which are from the same region but acquired under different aspect angles, with a resolution around 30 cm. As ground truth data we used a digital surface model (DSM) from laser scanning measurements, with a horizontal resolution of 1 me- ter and a vertical resolution around 10 cm, as well as manual height measurement. We chose a set of 40 flat and gable roof buildings, which were imaged in each scene of our dataset. The analysis showed that the proposed method is flexible with respect to the shape of the object for which the height shall be estimated and its aspect angle, i.e. the angle be- tween the front wall of the object and the flight track of the sensor. The main difference between estimation and actual height is 0.2m, indicating that the method has no tendency for under- or overestima- tion, while the standard deviation is about 1.0 m, highlighting its good performance for estimating the height of the buildings.

        "8 Towards secure airport: advanced trusted traveller paradigm using adaptive multi-modal biometrics Objectives Security of air travel is a major concern for the citizens where airports play a pivotal role. New security measures incur additional costs and often lead to delays and inconvenience with little evidence for en- hanced security. Airports are piloting the idea of Trusted Traveller, where scheme members receive prior security vetting, and are passed through pref- erential lanes thus accelerating their progress towards the boarding gate, as shown in Fig. 1. Current schemes based on a single biometric such as finger, face or iris, are restrictive and need to include multi- biometrics. Key challenges are performance, reliability and security of a multi-modal biometric system in large-scale applications such as airport security. The objectives of this project are therefore: 1. To develop a formal concept of a secure airport and define an advanced trusted traveller (ATT) paradigm based on adaptive multimodal biometrics; 2. To evaluate the performance of multimodal biometrics; 3. To identify usability issues, including those of the disabled, re- garding biometrics based ePassport and trusted traveller cards. Results An advanced trusted traveller paradigm An advanced scheme called Registered Traveller (RT) was defined using two concepts: 1) strong identity of individuals based on their biometrics as well as biographic data; 2) risk assessment for the in- dividual based on a dynamic trust model. Fig. 2 shows the dynamic trust profile for decision support at the security check point based on up-to-date information on passengers. Secure airport concept The Simplified Passenger Travel (SPT) framework was used for proc- ess modelling. A probabilistic model for security of travel processes was developed. A quantitative measure of security, called permeabil- ity of the departure process was defined. This allows one to evaluate the effectiveness of security measures individually as well as cumu- latively for the entire process. A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out for large airport hubs. We compared the process permeability for the registered traveller (RT) stream against mainstream of non-vetted passengers. It was found that the probability of an RT passenger go- ing on-board undetected is less than 2 in 1 million, compared to 4400 in a million for the mainstream passengers. Biometric image quality assessment Our project uses MegaMatcher software for biometric matching. For biometrics quality assessment we quantified the matcher\u2019s perform- ance with respect to the quality of input samples for face and iris bio- Fig. 1 Biometric Identity: Glue between Airport Process and Trusted Traveller.

Impact of defocus, motion blur, lens distortion, brightness and contrast in the biometric image was evaluated. Image brightness and contrast were manipulated from -127 to +128, around the original image. The matching scores dropped with varia- tions on either side. The results are shown in fig. 3. The iris recogni- tion algorithm was found to be more sensitive to contrast variation than to brightness effects. In other tests showed that algorithms were more sensitive to color variations than to low image resolution and defocusing. Usability issues in air travel process The usability study examined the accessibility of the disabled and elderly passengers to the passenger departure process, with or with- out biometric identification. A generic analytical framework was de- veloped for the analysis of process usability. Specific usability analysis of the airport process involved identifica- tion of the various factors contributing to passenger (in)convenience as well as security risks to the departure process. This analysis was repeated for several user profiles. Fig. 4 shows usability characteris- tics of the departure process for a specific passenger profile. System Prototyping Prototyping is being done using Microsoft.NET development plat- form, including MegaMatcher SDK for biometric identification. A da- tabase has been implemented for passenger data, flight information and black-listed passengers. User interfaces are defined for different stage of the departure proc- ess. These include passenger enrolment (fig. 5), flight booking, check-in, security checkpoint and boarding gate. At every stage the passenger provides his biometric and other credentials to proceed towards the plane. Passenger enrolment includes both the biographic data and the bio- metric data. Security model of .NET framework has been incorporated for role-based access control.

        "10 Fig. 1 The LOUIS image system. A low-cost portable kit for gathering near real-time information in post disaster scenarios Objectives In disaster management and relief operations retrieving timely and relevant maps and information of affected areas is still an issue. A large number of countries lack of appropriate data and often the ef- fects of the disaster event reduce the possibility to find data through existent traditional distribution channels. When the information is promptly available it is not said that they have the appropriate time and spatial accuracy. Very High Satellite imagery has become a pre- cious source to be used in this scenario. The increased image resolu- tion and the lowering of the prices pushed up their use into this field of applications. But, it is not always possible to collect data at any time and position desired because of returning time of satellite and meteorological conditions. In some regions the cloud coverage might prevent data collection for quite a long time in certain period of the year. In certain circumstances it is felt that having \u201creal time data\u201d is even more important than having \u201chigh quality data\u201d. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been used in the military sec- tor for quite a long time covering a set of applications ranging from intelligence gathering to tracking and targeting and the UAV remote sensors have proved crucial in meeting the persistence-surveillance and situational-awareness needs of forces on the ground. It has been only recently that, thanks to the miniaturization of digital sensors and the advances in the field of GPS navigation, the mini-UAVs mount an imaging and navigation system on board. Some commercial companies offer out of the box solutions produc- ing excellent results but the lack of modularity reduces their practical use in the field and the high prices are not affordable for low budget NGOs. The research project objective is to perform a feasibility study of a portable kit for data collection and analysis to be used directly in field campaigns (as an example in the aftermath of a natural disaster event), in order to support relief operations and decision making. The aim of the kit is to collect real or near real-time imagery using a light and rough mini UAV carrying GPS-based navigation system and a sensor, to analyze the data through a set of predefined proce- dures running on a laptop computer and to prepare maps and report to share with other field operators, disaster managers and decision makers. Results After a preliminary needs and requirements analysis, followed by a market research, the Terrapan Labs\u2019 LOUIS Imaging System project was chosen. Terrapan Labs, a spin off of the University of San Diego, was willing to participate actively to the research project building a ",
        "11 first functional prototype and piloting it during the first fly-test ses- sion held during the last week of May 2008 at the air field of Brebbia (VA), Italy. The Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering of the University College of London (CEGE-UCL) participated to the project as advisor on sensor calibration and photogrammetric mat- ters. During the test week an informal workshop on UAV for disaster sup- port was organized. The outcome of the tests and the workshop, as well as the limitations experienced and lessons learnt during that session, drove the design- ing of a reviewed prototype. The second LOUIS model has a totally modular design; the airframe and the imaging system are made up of components easily replaceable worldwide. The airframe is made up of fuselage components that fit in a common guitar rigid box and can be easily assembled in the field (fig. 1). All the main navigation and acquisition devices are stored into a main carbon fibre pod very resistant to the shocks and to possible crash- es. The imaging device is a commercial digital camera. The autopilot component allows presetting mission and failover procedures. The airplane can fly autonomously for about 25 minutes while following an acquisition schema preliminary defined. The autopilot has a pro- grammable interface that allows firing the camera according to the position of frame and the time. For this to work only Canon camera are currently supported. The rest of the fuselage components are part of cheap commercial frames and can be easily assembled by the mean of magnets and electric connectors. A series of post-processing procedures were defined in order to geo- reference in near real time the collected aerial photographs and to in- tegrate the extracted information into the existent impact models, as- sessment procedures and collaborative Web applications (portals). Two different approaches were adopted to meet the requirements of two different user categories: \u2022 For users expecting to have near real time data, even if with poor spatial accuracy, a process for the rough registering of the single camera shots according to the IMU log has been defined. Also, a set of basic commercial stitching utilities were tested. \u2022 For users requiring photogrammetric products some of the tradition- al and close range photogrammetric procedures have been studied. The first outcomes of the tests showed that the chosen configuration of the system doesn\u2019t allow delivering photogrammetric products. The current status of the project will be presented in the Fifth Annual European Geospatial Intelligence Conference (DGI Europe 2009), Jan- uary 19 th \u2013 22 th , 2009 QEII Centre, London, UK.

        "12 Quantifying the impact of the almost complete cessation of commercial fishing in the North Sea during World War II Objectives Understanding the mechanisms via which commercial fishing pres- sures, management regimes and environmental changes interact with the ecology of wild fish populations is a key question for fisheries man- agement science. Such questions are, however, difficult to address using recent time-series datasets, say 1950 to the present, because fishing pressure was sustained and ubiquitous during that period. The only reliable way to separate the effect of fishing from that of the en- vironment would be to set up huge \u2018designed experiments\u2019 in which different marine regions were subjected to different \u2018treatments\u2019 but manipulation of such large ecosystems is probably impossible. An unintended \u2018experiment\u2019 in fisheries science did occur in the North Sea during World War II (WWII) when commercial fishing almost ceased because fishing vessel movements were restricted due to the dangers and the fact that many fishermen were called up, and their vessels requisitioned for war service. This gives us the opportunity to split potential environmental drivers (temperature, salinity) from those due to commercial fishing. The objective of the current project, therefore, was to re-examine the fisheries and environmental data collected either side of WWII and use them to make predictions about what might happen to fish stocks if fishing capacity and effort can be reduced, which is an objective of the Common Fisheries Policy. Results The first goal was the construction of a fisheries (scientific and com- mercial trawl catches) database and environmental (sea surface temperature, salinity, North-Atlantic Oscillation Index) database for the North Sea, spanning the period 1928 to 1958. These data have enabled us to scrutinize the impact of WWII on the important com- mercial fish species of the North Sea using a range of multi-variate statistical and age-structured population models. We have been able to observe how real fish populations reacted as they transited a pe- riod of zero harvesting. We have also examined in detail how environ- mental factors, such as temperature, salinity and the North Atlantic Oscillation Index changed during WWII and how these factors might have influenced fish recruitment and abundance. Dramatic increases in landings per unit effort occurred, in all the species we examined, between 1939 and 1945. In fig. 1 we have plotted the total landings (kgs) per hour for cod, haddock and whiting in the North Sea before WWII (1938) and afterwards (1947). Using trawl survey data we have also shown how the abundances of recruits and spawners were differentially affected by zero fishing effort and changes in the physical environment. The older, sexually mature, fish (spawners) reacted much more quickly than the recruits to the reduction in harvesting (see fig. 2). Recruitment responded less quickly, since the effects of enhanced survival rates take longer to \u2018feed\u2019 through into the population. This can also be explained by con- sidering the following theoretical model.

If commercial fishing stops survival rates will increase. Also suppose that the birth rate per fish is b t k in age- class k and is zero in age-class 0. This gives three equations for the fish population thus: N 0 t+1 = b t 1 N t 1 + b t 2 N t 2 (1) N 1 t+1 = s t 0 N t 0 (2) N 2 t+1 = s t 1 N t 1 + s t 2 N t 2 (3) When harvesting ceases, mortality due to fishing obviously stops and survival rates in every age-class subject to fishing will increase, the values of {s tk } in the population will get larger and these will then feed forward into greater abundances {N tk }. If we assume that birth rates do not change then, from equations (2) and (3), it can be seen that in age-classes 1 or 2 increases due to change in survival rates can be felt at once in the following year. From equation (1), however, it is not so clear. By manipulating the equations (1-3), and by assuming that birth rates are constant in time (b tk = b k ) for all k and all t we can derive the following: N 0 t+2 = s t 2 N 0 t+1 + b 1 s t 0 N t 0 + (b 2 s t 1 s t-1 0 - b 1 s t 2 s t-1 0 ) (4) By writing (4) at time t instead we get: N 0 t = s t-2 2 N t t-1 0 + b 1 s t-2 0 N t t-2 0 + s t-3 0 (b 2 s t-2 1 - b 1 s t-2 2 ) N t t-3 0 (5) So, assuming that the only inputs which change in time here are the survival rates s tk it is clear that the effect of these changes cannot be felt by N t 0 until two years after they happen. The effect of the unplanned closure in the North Sea during WWII, therefore, had an immediate and positive effect on the abundance and relative proportion of older fish in migratory populations from temperate latitudes. The study will be concluded by discussing the results in the context of topical issues such as the instigation of ma- rine protected areas and fishery induced change in the genetic com- position of fish stocks.

        "14 Fig. 1 The tree of the global Millennium Develop- ment Goals indicator: a score is given to each base-level indicator and then aggregated into an index to measure progress in meet- ing the needs of the worlds\u2019 poorest. The effects of aid allocation rules on the well-being of the poor in developing countries Objectives Over the last decade, two developments characterized the world of international aid to poor countries. On the policy-making side, for the fi rst time in history, the recipient and donor communities agreed upon a set of shared priorities and adopted indicators to measure progress towards them: the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The eight goals adopted by the United Nations (UN) assembly in 2000 range from halving extreme poverty to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and providing primary education. The UN recommended that the alloca- tion of development aid should attempt to maximize progress towards the MDGs and to increase the welfare of the poorest segment of the world population. At the same time, on the research side, academia and the donor community engaged a debate on the conditions under which aid can be most effective in enhancing prosperity. However, this debate has focused mainly on how to boost economic growth. As a re- sult, some of the largest donors - including the European Union - have been considering the idea that aid should be allocated preferentially according to a rule which is \u201ceffi cient\u201d in terms of income increases. While economic growth and the MDGs are certainly linked, they are not coincident. This exploratory research project aims to assess if economic growth is suffi cient to assure progress towards the MDGs and the conditions under which development aid best contributes to reaching them. More generally, it aims to contribute to the quality of EU cooperation policy which is a key element of global security. In order to reach this objective, we propose to explore the relationship among economic growth and the MDGs and then adopt the econo- metric methods used by the main strand of the \u201caid effectiveness\u201d lit- erature 1 . Normally, in this kind of regression, the growth rate of Gross Domestic Product per capita is used as the dependent variable, while international development aid and factors supposed to affect its ef- fi cacy are used as explanatory variables. In our approach, the depend- ent variable is substituted by a global indicator of the MDGs computed applying the methodologies 2 and tools 3 developed by our colleagues at the unit of Econometrics and Applied Statistics. Results Confronting methodological challenges In order to make the proposed approach workable, it was necessary to tackle the issues of rescaling effects in composite indicators panels (data on aggregate indicators for many countries and time periods) and of using composite indicators as dependent variables. The composite indicator includes 7 sub-indexes covering all the UN goals except the aid fl ows. These sub-indexes are computed by aggre- gating 39 indicators of progress, forming a complex indicator tree (fi g. 1). Originally, the index was built for single year comparisons. There- fore each of its elementary components is rescaled using reference points varying over time. This change in reference points could deter- mine apparent movement of countries without any modifi cation in the 1. Craig Burnside and David Dollar. \u201cAid, policies and growth\u201d.

In order to solve this problem of inter-temporal assess- ments, the index was adapted by introducing fixed reference points over the whole panel. This change implied rescaling all variables and required the development of an ad-hoc software to recalculate the indicator. Moreover, we developed a general theoretical contribu- tion demonstrating how the choice of reference points for the whole panel is similar to a choice of measurement unit. As a consequence, the choice of a particular reference does not influence the substance of the conclusions coming out of regression analysis conducted on the resulting indicator, allowing the use of composite indicators as standard dependent variables. Creation of a database We have been assembling the necessary data from a set of available sources (Penn World Tables, United Nations Millennium project da- tabase\u2026) and proceeding to buy access to some of the non free da- tabases such as the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators. All data have been merged in a common database containing data on economic characteristics, institutions and policies for most countries in the world for the 1990 to 2004 period. Statistical analysis The analysis at first focused on the basic characteristics of the data assembled on income growth and the MDGs index and sub-indexes. The preliminary results seems to give ground to the original hypoth- esis that income growth is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for pro-poor outcomes as measured by the MDG indicator. In particu- lar, while high levels of income per capita are linked to higher levels of the MDG indicator, changes in the two variables do not seem to be closely associated (fig. 2). These results seem to point to the fact that other factors besides income growth could be important in deter- mining progress towards the MDGs. Firmer conclusions on the exact nature of this relationship would require the complete replication of the two seminal papers by Burnside, Collier and Dollar mentioned above. Capacity building and inter-institutional contacts Within the context of this project, we started cooperation with the Africa Caribbean Pacific (ACP) Observatory, a JRC inter-institute ini- tiative grouping ongoing work with ACP countries under a common \u201cumbrella\u201d. Our unit also received requests by Directorate General EuropeAid for organizing training activities on the MDG dashboard and the use of indicators.

        "16 Objectives Bubbling systems or Pneumercators are commonly used in chemical and radiochemical process industries such as reprocessing plants to determine accurately the height, volume and density of solutions in process tanks. These results are used for process control by the Op- erator but also by Safeguards bodies to perform Nuclear Material Ac- countancy and Control. This study aims to verify experimentally the impact of differences in some characteristics such as the density, dip tube immerging depth, surface tension on the accuracy of the meas- urements by visualising the bubble dynamics. In addition, this allows to follow-up the status-of-health of the dip tubes immerged in the solution. The objectives of this project are: a) The height of solution is proportional to the pressure monitored in the gas line feeding a gas at constant flow rate through the dip tubes. To take into account the pressures exerted by the columns of gas in the dip tubes which depend on the positioning (altitude) of the ma- nometers and making the assumption that the bubbling gas is air, the equation is the following: h i being the altitude of the manometer from the tip of the dip tube i , r the density of the solution and g the gravitational acceleration. The term corresponds to the overpressure normalized to a liquid height. This study proposes to validate the above semi-empirical relation of Hartland and Hartley/1 1 for solutions having different properties such as salt concentration and density. b) The possibility given by the proposed experimental tank design will allow to simulate an increasing liquid level by applying pressure over its surface permitting not to use huge vessels to investigate the influence of hydrostatic pressure on the bubble dynamics with forma- tion, shape and bubbling frequency. c) The bubble dynamics will then be studied to derive criteria for the on- set of the clogging phenomenon occurring at the dip tube tips immerged in concentrated solutions. During the bubbling phase, just after the bub- ble detaches from dip tube, solution enters the tip before being flushed out by the next bubble. The gas will then dry out the film of liquid cover- ing the inner wall of the tube. This can lead to the deposit of crystals and a restriction of the inner tube diameter. This is particularly important for heavily concentrated solutions such as for instance the output solutions of uranyl nitrate which concentrations can reach 400 g/L. In function of some parameters such as gas flow, salt concentration and dip tube inner diameter, the phenomenon of clogging is in this Fig. 1 General view of the BuSCA vessel.

Results Status The first part of the study will allow to collect data concerning bubble formation, size and shape according to several parameters such the pressure exerted by the column of liquid i.e. the level of the solution, solution characteristics such as its density, viscosity and superficial tension and equipment parameters such as the internal diameter of the dip tubes, the gas flow rate. The project proposed relies on three main pillars: 1) Experimental tank The first pillar is the conception and the realization of a tank which versatility will allow to perform experiments with the possibility to change some characteristics such as the internal diameter of the dip tubes which will be exchangeable and to control important param- eters such as the temperature of the solution. The design of the tank has been realized. It consists of Perpex panels to allow the visualiza- tion of the bubbles and the determination of their size by making use of cameras and software already developed by TAME for a previous study. The dimensions of the vessel which is a square parallelepiped are about 500 x 500 x 800 (h) mm. The pictures hereunder show the tank which was manufactured at the Ispra workshop. 2) Other equipment The second pillar is the different pieces of equipment which will be used to performed accurate measurements of the liquid characteris- tics such as its density, viscosity and superficial tension. In order to do so, accurate instrumentation has been procured. As the parameters are temperature dependent an offer has also been requested for a thermostatic bath with external loop. 3) Test solutions The third pillar is the choice of the solutions to be used to perform the tests. Cesium chloride has been chosen as it can be dissolved to give aqueous solutions reaching a density of up to 1.9 g/cm 3 and then span the densities of the solutions encountered in the process of nu- clear industries. The second part of the study will aim at the determination of the clog- ging phenomenon of the dip tubes. The versatility and reduced vol- ume of the tank will allow us to study this phenomenon with different salt solutions, tube diameters and gas flow rate to find the possibility to monitor the clogging to determine at which stage it is importune to perform the rinsing process. Following steps All instrumentation and mechanical parts should be available and in- stalled before the end of 2008. Experiments, data collection and treatment will then be performed during the year 2009. Fig. 2 Top view of the BuSCA vessel.

        "18 Fig. 1 Loss of rain due to runoff during spring wheat growing season in Altay region of Russia (for all meteorological grid cells for the period 1991-2000) Crop yield loss estimation based on precipitation runoff Objectives The project aims at improving the system currently used by the Euro- pean Commission for crop yield forecast in different countries of the world. Currently, although precipitation runoff modelling is used in environ- mental studies, it is not used in crop yield forecasting. The intention of the project is to bridge this chasm by exploring a technique to in- corporate precipitation runoff modelling into crop yield forecasting. The main objective of the project is to evaluate the potential effect of surface runoff on crop yield. In specific, the linkage between the Crop Growth Monitoring System (CGMS) and surface runoff model is to be investigated. The main tasks are: \u2022 To elaborate the most suitable runoff model to be used together with the CGMS. \u2022 To assess the potential runoff. \u2022 To simulate crop yield loss due to precipitation decreased caused by runoff. Spring wheat in Altay region of Russia was selected for the testing of the approach. Results A simple balance runoff model has been elaborated. The main com- ponents of the model are: amount of precipitation, infiltration, sur- face storage of water, interception of rain by plants, and evaporation of water from soil, and from open water surface. The calculation of the above mentioned components was done based on approaches described in the scientific literature 1 which were adopted to the spe- cifics of crop growth simulation and CGMS database construction, and to local natural conditions. The main source of input data is the CGMS database (version elaborated for Russia, Mediterranean and Central Asian countries). The runoff is calculated as a difference between amount of rain and infiltration and evaporation of water. The time step of the modelling is one rain event. The model has been calibrated based on the results of 3 field experi- ments, which were conducted in the region of investigations in 1993 and 1995. The loss of rain due to runoff was modelled for 10 seasons of spring wheat growth. As a result, we have found that runoff does not take place when amount of rain is less than 10 mm per day. Only 60 per- cent of rains with amount of precipitation more than 10 mm in Altay region lost water due to runoff. In most cases only near 10% of rain is lost due to runoff. Only during some rain events water loss due 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 0 r a i n l o s s ( m m ) seasonal precipitation sum (mm) 1.

Statistically significant correlation between amount of rain during one rainy event and loss of water due to runoff was not found. Amount of rain loss due to runoff differs from year to year. However, periodicity of such changes or other kind of regularity was not observed. Additionally it was found that amount of rain loss weakly correlates with the stage of wheat development. An effect of rain loss on crop growth strongly depends from amount of rain, amount of water loss during previous rain events, and from the crop development stage. Analysis of the results of wheat growth sim- ulation based on corrected and non-corrected amount of rain leads to the conclusion that runoff in Altay region affects wheat growth. The strongest influence of water loss due to runoff on potential wheat growth was found for the regions with seasonal amount of precipita- tion less than 350 mm. Such regions occupy near half of the territory of investigations. Big loss of water during the middle of the growing season stronger affects wheat growth than at the beginning or at the end of the season (fig. 2). Crop biomass loss differs from year to year, however, periodicity of such changes or other kind of regularity was not observed. Regression analysis between cumulated seasonal potential wheat biomass aggregated at region level and official wheat yield statistical data was used as a method for crop yield prediction. We have found that spring wheat yield can be predicted based on simple linear re- gression with original (non corrected) rain data with R 2 = 0.77. After the correction of amount of rain based on runoff modelling the R of the regression model has increased up to 0.79. Thus, the crop yield prediction quality was slightly improved. However, this improvement is not very significant, and we don\u2019t recommend introducing into the CGMS runoff modelling for spring wheat simulation in Altay region. However, it is likely to be that an effect of rain loss due to runoff in other regions can be stronger and can not be ignored. Additionally, the experience gained from this project leads to conclusion that ef- fects of runoff modelling will be more evident for yield prediction of such crops as potatoes, maize, sugar beets, or sunflower than for spring wheat. rain loss agb_orig agb_cor ",
