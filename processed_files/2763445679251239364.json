        "G. whereas, if current trends regarding Member States\u2019 ODA levels continue, some Member States will not meet the targets to which they are committed of 0,51 % for the EU 15 (i.e. the Member States part of the EU prior to the 2004 enlargement) and 0,17 % for the EU 12 (i.e. the Member States which acceded to the EU on 1 May 2004 and 1 January 2007) of GNI by 2010, H. whereas programmable aid to Africa is rising despite the general decrease in ODA in 2007, I. whereas significant new development challenges have recently emerged, including climate change, structural changes in commodity markets and in particular those for food and oil, and important new trends in South-South cooperation, including support for infrastructure by China in Africa and lending by the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) in Latin America, J. whereas financial services in many developing countries are underdeveloped as a result of many factors including restrictions on supply of services and lack of legal certainty and property rights, 1. Reaffirms its commitment to poverty eradication, sustainable development and the achievement of the MDGs, as the only ways to bring about social justice and improved quality of life for the approximately one billion people globally who live in extreme poverty, defined as an income of less than one US dollar a day; 2. Calls on Member States to place a clear division between development spending and spending on foreign policy interests and emphasises, in this regard, that ODA should be in line with the criteria for ODA established by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD/DAC) and the OECD/DAC recommendations on untying ODA; 3. Underlines the absolute need for the EU to aim for the highest level of coordination in order to achieve coherence with other Community policies (environment, migration, human rights, agriculture, etc.) and avoid duplication of work and inconsistency of activities; 4. Recalls that the immediate and necessary actions to be taken by the EU to tackle the dramatic consequences of the soaring food prices in developing countries should not be understood and carried out as part of the financial efforts required by the Monterrey Consensus; therefore looks forward to a concrete proposal from the Commission on the use of emergency funds; 5. Stresses that the excessive and disproportionate administrative burden in some of the partner countries impairs the effectiveness of development aid; fears that this burden risks jeopardising the achievement of the MDGs; 6. Notes that the EU still has to find the right balance between two contradictory approaches towards development aid: on the one hand, to trust partner countries in the adequate allocation of the funds and to help their administrations develop the right tools for implementation of the funds; on the other hand, to earmark the financial aid in order to avoid misuse or ineffective allocation of the aid; Volumes of ODA 7. Points out that the EU is the world's leading donor in ODA, representing almost 60 % of the world official development aid, and welcomes the fact that the EU share of global ODA has been increasing over the years; nevertheless requests the Commission to provide clear and transparent data on the share of the EU budget devoted to EU development aid in order to assess the follow-up to the Monterrey Consensus by all European donors; also expresses its regret that the level of EU financial contributions to developing countries lacks visibility and invites the Commission to develop appropriate and targeted communication and information tools to increase the visibility of EU development aid; EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/3 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",
        "8. Welcomes the fact that the EU met its binding ODA target of the EU average of 0,39 % of GNI by 2006, but notes the alarming decrease in EU aid in 2007 from EUR 47,7 billion in 2006 (0,41 % of EU collective GNI) to EUR 46,1 billion in 2007 (0,38 % of EU collective GNI) and calls upon Member States to raise ODA volumes to achieve their promised target of 0,56 % of GNI in 2010; 9. Insists that reductions in Member States\u2019 reported ODA should not take place again; points out that the EU will have given EUR 75 billion less than was promised for the period 2005-2010 if the current trend continues; 10. Expresses serious concern that a majority of the Member States (18 out of 27, especially Latvia, Italy, Portugal, Greece and the Czech Republic) were unable to raise their level of ODA between 2006 and 2007 and that there has even been a dramatic reduction of over 10 % in a number of countries such as Belgium, France and the United Kingdom; calls on Member States to fulfil the ODA volumes to which they are committed; notes with satisfaction that some Member States (Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands) are certain to reach their ODA targets for 2010, and is confident that these Member States will maintain their high levels of ODA; 11. Welcomes the firm stance of the Commission on the efforts to be concentrated on both the quantity and the quality of development aid from Member States, and strongly supports its warning against the potential highly negative consequences of the Member States\u2019 failing to fulfil their financial commitments; calls on the Commission to use its expertise and authority to convince other public and private donors to honour their financial promises; 12. Is extremely concerned that some Member States are backloading ODA increases, leading to a net loss for developing countries of more than EUR 17 billion; 13. Welcomes the approach of some Member States to develop binding multi-annual timetables for increasing ODA levels to meet the UN target of 0,7 % by 2015; asks Member States that have not yet done so to disclose their multi-annual timetables as quickly as possible; stresses that Member States should adopt these prior to the abovementioned Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Doha and fulfil their commitments; 14. Observes that the 2007 decreases in reported aid levels are due in some cases to the artificial boosting of figures in 2006 by debt relief; calls on Member States to increase ODA levels in a sustainable manner by concentrating on figures with the debt relief component removed; 15. Views as totally unacceptable the discrepancy between the frequent pledges of increased financial assistance and the considerably lower sums that are actually disbursed and is concerned that some Member States are demonstrating aid fatigue; 16. Stresses the fact that consultation with partner governments, national parliaments and civil society organisations is crucial in the decision making on ODA volumes and destinations; Speed, flexibility, predictability and sustainability of financial flows 17. Stresses that assistance needs to be delivered in a timely manner and expresses dissatisfaction that the processes for delivery are often subject to undue delays; 18. Stresses the need to balance flexibility in the delivery of cooperation funds, in order to respond to changing circumstances, such as rising food prices with the imperative for predictable funding to allow partner countries to plan for sustainable development and climate change adaptation and mitigation; EN C 8 E/4 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",
        "19. Calls strongly for the clear observance of the principles of responsible lending and financing, to make lending and financing operations sustainable in terms of economic and environmental development along and in line with the equator principles; calls on the Commission to participate in establishing such principles and press in international fora for binding measures to put them into practice in such a way that their coverage extends to new development actors from public and private sectors; Debt and capital flight 20. Fully endorses efforts by developing countries to maintain long-term debt sustainability and to implement the initiative for very Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC), which is of key importance to fulfil the MDGs; regrets, however, that the debt relief plans exclude a large number of countries for which debt remains an obstacle to fulfilling the MDGs; stresses the need for an urgent international debate on extending the reduction of international measures to a number of indebted countries currently excluded from the HIPC initiative; 21. Calls on the Commission to address the issue of \u2018odious\u2019 or illegitimate debts, meaning debts having arisen from irresponsible, self-interested, reckless or unfair lending and the principles of responsible finance in bilateral and multilateral negotiations on debt relief; welcomes the Commission's call for action to limit the rights of commercial creditors and vulture funds to be repaid, in the event of judicial proceedings; 22. Calls on all Member States to adhere to the framework of debt sustainability and push for its development to take account of a country's internal debt and financial requirements; calls on all Member States to recognise that lender liability does not just involve compliance with the sustainability framework, but also entails: \u2014 taking into consideration the vulnerability of borrowing countries to external shocks, making provision in such cases for the possibility of suspending or easing repayment, \u2014 incorporating transparency requirements, for both parties, in borrowing agreements, \u2014 exercising greater vigilance in ensuring that the borrowing does not contribute to human rights violations or an increase in corruption; 23. Urges the EU to promote international efforts which aim to put in place some form of international insolvency procedures or fair and transparent arbitration procedure to deal efficiently and equitably with any future debt crisis; 24. Regrets that the Commission does not place more emphasis on the mobilisation of internal resources to finance development, as these are sources of greater autonomy for developing countries; encourages Member States to be fully involved in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and to call for it to be strengthened; calls on the Commission to ask the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to include among these international accounting standards a country-by-country reporting requirement on the activities of multinational companies in all sectors; 25. Regrets that the Commission communication package on aid effectiveness (COM(2008)0177) does not mention capital flight as a risk factor for the economies of developing countries; points out that capital flight does serious damage to the development of sustainable economic systems in developing countries and points out that each year tax evasion costs developing countries more than they receive in the form of ODA; calls on the Commission to include measures to prevent capital flight in its policies, as required by the Monterrey Consensus, including a frank analysis of the causes of capital flight, with the goal of closing down tax havens, some of which are located within the EU or operate in close connection with Member States; EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/5 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",

Recalls that the quality of Community legislation and its implementation is of major importance to the proper functioning of the Internal Market, and that the number of cases before the European Court of Justice related to unclear provisions and incorrect implementation of secondary legislation demonstrates the need to draft Community legislation more precisely; therefore calls on the Commission to introduce indicators in the Scoreboard regarding the number of proceedings before the European Court of Justice concerning quality of secondary legislation, as well as its incorrect implementation; 16.

Calls on the Commission, in cooperation with Parliament and the Presidency of the Council, to hold a yearly Internal Market Forum with participation of the Member States and other stakeholders in order to establish a clearer commitment to proper implementation in due time and to provide an arena for bench\u00ad marking and exchange of best practices; 31. Calls on the Council to give a higher priority to Internal Market issues either by establishing a new Council formation addressing these questions or by giving them top priority on the agenda in the existing Competitiveness Council; 32.

Welcomes the Commission's intention to ensure a better communicated Internal Market, and holds the view that the two Scoreboards are important steps in that direction; 35. Emphasises that while the two Scoreboards are interlinked and that it is important to promote their coherent development, they have however different target addressees and hence should be kept separate with different sets of indicators; 36. Holds the view that a review of the indicators used as well as the relationship between the two Scoreboards should be carried out on a regular basis in order to adapt them to development in the Internal Market; * * * 37.

Highlights the marked differences between the average wages of teachers, not only between different Member States, but also in relation to average national incomes and GDP per capita; believes that teachers should benefit from good remuneration packages which reflect their importance to society, and calls for action to address the \u2018brain-drain\u2019 of top teachers to better-paid private sector posts, particularly in the areas of science and technology; 15. Emphasises that teachers must be better equipped to meet the range of new demands made on them; recognises the challenges that developments in ICT present to teachers, but also the opportunities; encourages the prioritisation of ICT education during initial and subsequent training to ensure up-to-date knowledge of recent technological developments and their educational application and to ensure that teachers have the necessary skills to take advantage of these in the classroom; 16. Believes that training should aim, amongst other objectives, to provide teachers with the innovative framework they need in order to mainstream the environmental perspective into their activities and into the new subject areas; favours local seminars aimed at meeting needs detected in particular contexts and courses intended for the staff of a given establishment, with a view to implementing concrete projects which take into account their needs and their particular context; 17. Emphasises that teacher mobility, better cooperation and team work could improve the creativity and innovation of teaching methods and would facilitate learning based on best practices; 18. Calls on the Commission to reinforce the financial resources available to support teacher education through the Lifelong Learning Programme, and in particular teacher exchanges between schools in neigh\u00ad bouring countries and regions; emphasises that mobility facilitates the spread of ideas and best practice within teaching and promotes improvements in foreign language skills as well as awareness of other cultures; stresses that teachers should benefit from greater language learning facilities throughout their careers, which, inter alia, will maximise the opportunities provided by Union mobility programmes; 19. Calls for media studies to be assigned priority in teacher training and for media studies modules already underway to be an important component in the basic training of teachers; 20. Highlights the crucial role of the Comenius and Comenius-Regio school partnership in this teacher mobility framework; 21. Strongly supports foreign language learning from a very early age and the inclusion of language lessons in all primary curricula; emphasises that sufficient investment in recruiting and training foreign language teachers is vital in order to achieve this objective; 22. Stresses that every teacher should be a role model as regards the mastery of his or her own language, since this is a vital tool for correct transmission and facilitates pupils\u2019 learning of the remaining subjects while developing their ability to communicate, a factor of ever greater importance in numerous professional activities; EN C 8 E/16 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",
        "23. Underlines the need for teachers in all Member States to have certificated competence in at least one foreign language; 24. Calls for media competence to be promoted in the school, post-school and extramural education of teachers in the context of media studies and lifelong learning by means of cooperation between the public authorities and the private sector; 25. Emphasises that there is no substitute for the time teachers spend in the classroom with students and is concerned that increasing administration and paperwork can be detrimental to this and to time spent preparing classes; 26. Calls for civic education to become a compulsory subject both in teacher training and at schools, so that teachers and pupils have the requisite knowledge of citizens\u2019 rights and obligations and of the Union and can analyse and critically assess topical political and social situations and processes; 27. Considers that every school has a unique relationship with its local community, and that school leaders should have greater decision-making responsibility that allows them to address the educational challenges and teaching requirements particular to their environment, in collaboration with parents and with local community stakeholders; stresses that, with the arrival of a highly diverse immigrant population, the teaching profession needs to be made specifically aware of intercultural issues and processes, not only within schools but also in relation to families and their immediate local environment, where diversity flourishes; 28. Emphasises the extremely beneficial impact of the Comenius programme on teachers and its importance for small communities, especially in socially and economically deprived areas, in that it promotes inclusion and greater awareness of the European dimension in education; 29. Welcomes the agreement of the Member States to work together to enhance the coordination of teacher education policies, notably through the Open Method of Coordination; urges the Member States to take full advantage of this opportunity to learn from each other and asks be consulted on the timetable and developments in this area; 30. Underlines the need for better statistics on teacher training across the Union, in order to encourage the sharing of information, greater cooperation and the exchange of best practice; proposes that the Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, put in place systems that ensure comparative data is readily available on teacher education across pre-school, primary and secondary education; 31. Considers that, in order to deal with violence at schools, it is vital to achieve closer cooperation between head teachers and parents and to create the tools and procedures to tackle the phenomenon effectively; 32. Stresses the importance of gender-sensitive teaching and of the gender aspect in teacher training; 33. Calls on the Commission to disseminate best practice models from the Member States which improve general life skills by means of school projects, e.g. healthy diet and sport, domestic science and private financial planning; 34.

        "E. whereas particular attention should be paid to the appropriate funding of students\u2019 learning, living costs and mobility, F. whereas Parliament has consistently made the mobility of students its budgetary priority and has endeavoured to ensure an appropriate level of funding for Community programmes in the field of education; whereas its firm position on that issue led, despite cuts introduced by the Council on the Commission's proposal, to an increase in appropriations for the Lifelong Learning and Erasmus Mundus programmes negotiated under the Multi-annual Financial Framework 2007-2013 and recent budgetary procedures, G. whereas reliable statistical data on student mobility are required in order to observe, compare and evaluate, as well as to develop, adequate policies and measures, H. whereas recognition of informal and non-formal learning forms the cornerstone of a lifelong learning strategy, and the importance of adult learning in this process also needs to be recognised, I. whereas the choice to go abroad should not be hindered by any administrative, financial or linguistic barriers, J. whereas mobility encourages foreign language learning and the improvement of overall communication skills, K. whereas reform and modernisation of universities in terms of quality, studies structure, innovation and flexibility is urgently needed, L. whereas the quality of teaching is as important as the quality of research and should be reformed and modernised throughout the European Union, and whereas these two dimensions are closely linked, M. whereas different national recognition systems constitute a significant obstacle to equal treatment of students and to their progress in the European Higher Education Area and the European labour market, N. whereas mobility can be hindered by both the failure to give full and proper recognition to courses attended and the lack of equivalence of grades obtained, O. whereas it is urgent to implement, coordinate and promote a coherent approach among all countries that signed the Bologna Process, P. whereas the Bologna Process must create a new progressive model of education which guarantees access to training for all, whose principal objective is to transmit knowledge and values, and which creates a sustainable society for the future which is self-aware and free of social imbalances, 1. Considers that an increase in student mobility and the quality of the various educational systems should be a priority in the context of redefining the major goals of the Bologna Process beyond 2010; 2. Stresses that in order to achieve student mobility, actions must be taken across various policy areas; various aspects of mobility go beyond the scope of higher education and concern the scope of social affairs, finance, and immigration and visa policies; 3. Welcomes the efforts of Member States within the framework of intergovernmental cooperation to enhance the quality and competitiveness of education in the Union by, in particular, the promotion of mobility, ensuring recognition of qualifications and quality assurance, particularly in light of the limited room for manoeuvre due to the narrow margins left in Heading 1a of the Financial Framework; 4. Is convinced that the consultation method undertaken by all stakeholders involved in the process should continue: institutions as well as student representatives should closely cooperate in order to tackle the remaining barriers to mobility and problems related to quality and the implementation of the Bologna Process; EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/19 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",
        "5. Points out that in implementing the Bologna Process, particular attention should be devoted to close and intensive cooperation and coordination with the European Research Area; Student mobility: Quality and Efficiency 6. Insists on the urgent need for comparable and reliable statistics on student mobility and the socio- economic profile of students, such as common indicators, criteria and benchmarks, in order to overcome the current lack of data and promote the exchange of good practices; 7. Calls on universities to improve and simplify the information provided online and off-line, both for incoming and outgoing students; calls on universities and Erasmus National Agencies to collaborate with student organisations in order to make available all the necessary information in due time; calls on universities to support student rights, in line with the commitments they have made, by adhering to the Erasmus University Charter; 8. Emphasises that in order for the Bologna Process to fulfil its objectives, reciprocity in terms of the flow of students and scholars is necessary; underlines the disparities in current trends, and in particular the poor mobility towards the Member States which acceded to the EU in 2004 and 2007; 9. Points out the importance of mentoring for the social, cultural and linguistic integration of incoming students; 10. Stresses that an improved command of languages is a considerable asset and one of the reasons for student mobility, and that it is important for intensive language courses to be offered to incoming students, before and/or during Erasmus study periods; Higher education reform and modernisation of universities: quality, innovation and flexibility 11. Calls on universities in the Union to undertake an innovative, far-reaching and methodical curricular reform, since ambitious and high-quality content and restructuring of organisation is crucial for student mobility and for greater flexibility; calls for a \u2018mobility study period\u2019 to be introduced into all degree programmes to enable students to go abroad; 12. Calls for emphasis to be given to the need for joint European doctoral programmes promoting doctoral student mobility and for the creation of a framework for a European doctorate; 13. Stresses the essential role of the quality and excellence of teaching, given that the development and ongoing training of qualified teachers in all sectors of studies is crucial for their attractiveness and effec\u00ad tiveness and for achieving the Bologna Process objectives; 14. Reiterates the need for more trans-national dialogue and exchange of information and experiences to facilitate a convergence of teacher education, including primary teacher education, and the effectiveness of continuing professional development; Funding and investment in student mobility and the social dimension 15. Special assistance should be provided to students from disadvantaged groups in society by, for example, proposing inexpensive and decent accommodation, considering that extra support after arrival is often necessary; 16. Proposes the introduction of a harmonised European Student Identity Card, in order to facilitate mobility and to enable students to get discounts for accommodation and living costs; EN C 8 E/20 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",
        "17. Calls on the Member States and the competent authorities to guarantee an equal and universal access to mobility by simple, flexible and transparent grant-awarding procedures and by additional financial support for high-cost destinations and for those students who need it; considers it essential for students to receive this support before their departure, to avoid placing an excessive financial burden on them; 18. Welcomes the fact that, in the context of the mid-term review of the Multi-annual Financial Framework provided for in the Declaration attached to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management, increasing the financial envelope allocated to the programmes in the field of education and notably for Erasmus grants could be considered, subject to the results of monitoring and evaluation of the programme; 19. Points out that new means of financing student mobility, such as interest-free loans and transferable loans, should be introduced and promoted; 20. Invites European universities to cooperate with the private sector (e.g. economic or business organi\u00ad sations such as chambers of commerce) in order to find new effective mechanisms of co-financing student mobility during each cycle (bachelor-masters-doctorate), thereby improving the quality of educational systems; 21. Suggests a fruitful dialogue and a two-way exchange between companies and universities in order to come up with innovative partnerships and to explore new ways of cooperation; Quality and full recognition of diplomas 22. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to proceed with the implementation of the European reference frameworks (Bologna Qualifications Framework, European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning, European Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance, and the Lisbon Recognition Convention) in order to establish the European High Education Area; 23. Stresses the urgency, therefore, of implementing the comprehensive, unified and effective credit transfer system ECTS, in order that students\u2019 and academics\u2019 qualifications may be easily transferable throughout Europe thanks to a single common framework; 24. Emphasises that the three-cycle degree system (Bachelor degree, Masters Degree and Doctorate) could become more flexible especially by using a \u20184+1\u2019 instead of \u20183+2\u2019 system for the first and second cycles; notes that for some studies this could be more appropriate in order to enable greater mobility and employability of graduates; 25. Calls for internships and other informal and non-formal mobility experience approved by universities to be granted ECTS credits and recognised as an integral part of study curricula; Bologna Process implementation in all countries concerned 26. Calls on the Member States\u2019 competent authorities and European universities to encourage and foster the exchange of best practices and awareness-raising initiatives; 27. Urges Member States to facilitate visa procedures and to reduce the procedural costs for mobile students, especially those from more easterly Member States and candidate countries, in line with the EU Directives on visas; * * * 28.

ANNEX TO THE RESOLUTION: DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE CONTENT OF THE PROPOSAL(S) REQUESTED Recommendation 1 on financial stability, capital and universal regulatory coverage The European Parliament considers that the legislative act to be adopted should aim to regulate: Capital requirements \u2014 Investment firms including partnerships and limited partnerships, insurance companies, credit institutions, conventional funds (such as UCITS and pension arrangements) should be required to comply with capital requirements. The Commission should ensure that appropriate capital requirements be risk based, not entity based, for all financial institutions. Consideration regarding adherence to codes of conduct may be taken into account by supervisors. Those capital requirements should, nevertheless, not be additional requirements to already existing rules and should in no case be regarded as a guarantee in the event of any fund failure. Originators and Securitisation \u2014 The Commission's proposal(s) concerning capital requirements should require that originators hold portions of securitised loans on their balance sheets or impose capital requirements on the originator that are calculated on the assumption that it held those portions or provide other means to align the interests of investors and originators. EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/31 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",
        "EU oversight of Credit Rating Agencies \u2014 The Commission should establish a mechanism for EU review of Credit Rating Agencies, procedures and compliance, with duties allocated to existing bodies such as the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), also in order to foster competition and enable market access in the field of credit ratings. Valuation \u2014 The Commission should adopt principle-based legislative measures on the valuation of illiquid financial instruments in line with the work of competent international bodies in order better to protect investors and the stability of financial markets, taking into account the various initiatives on valuation currently under way in the EU and globally and examining how best to promote this valuation. Prime brokers \u2014 The transparency requirements applicable to any institution providing prime brokerage services should be increased in line with the complexity and opacity of the structure or nature of the exposures, to which their dealings with all products and actors, including hedge funds and private equity expose them. Venture capital and SME sector: The Commission should propose legislation to provide a harmonised EU- wide framework for venture capital and private equity, and particularly so as to ensure cross-border access to such capital for the SME sector in line with the Lisbon Agenda. For this purpose, the Commission should implement, without delay, the policy proposals set out in its communication on removing obstacles to cross-border investments by venture capital funds. The proposal should be in line with principles of good regulation and should avoid additional legal, fiscal and administrative complexities at EU level. Recommendation 2 on transparency measures The European Parliament considers that the legislative act to be adopted should aim to regulate: Private Placement Regime \u2014 The Commission should submit a legislative proposal for the establishment of a European private placement regime allowing for cross-border distribution of investment products, including alternative investment vehicles, to eligible groups of sophisticated investors. Such a proposal should establish, where appropriate, the following principles of disclosure to investors and relevant public authorities: \u2014 general investment strategy and fee policy, \u2014 leverage/debt exposure, risk-management system and portfolio valuation methods, \u2014 source and amount of funds raised, including internally, \u2014 rules providing for full transparency of high level executives and senior managers\u2019 remuneration systems, including stock options, \u2014 registration and identification of shareholders beyond a certain proportion. Investors \u2014 The Commission should, in cooperation with supervisory authorities, devise rules to ensure clear disclosure and communication of relevant and material information to investors. Private equity and protection of employees \u2014 The Commission should ensure that Directive 2001/23/EC always grants the same rights to employees, including the right to be informed and consulted, whenever control of the undertaking or business concerned is transferred by any investors, including private equity and hedge funds. Pension schemes \u2014 Since the mid-1990s, there has been an increasing number of pension funds and insurance companies with holdings in hedge funds and private equity and any failure would negatively affect the pension entitlements of the pension schemes\u2019 members. In reviewing Directive 2003/41/EC, the Commission should ensure that employees or staff representatives are informed directly or via trustees about the way in which their pensions are invested and the associated risks.

        "Recommendation 3 on excessive debt measures The European Parliament considers that the legislative act to be adopted should aim to regulate: Leverage for private equity \u2014 The Commission should, while reviewing Directive 77/91/EEC on capital, ensure that any amendments adhere to the following fundamental principles: there is capital held according to risk, there is a reasonable expectation that the level of leverage is sustainable both for the private equity fund/firm and for the target company, and that there is no unfair discrimination against specific private investors or between different investment funds or vehicles that use similar strategy. Capital depletion \u2014 The Commission should propose harmonised supplementary measures at EU level, where needed, on the basis of a review of existing national and Community legislative options in order to avoid unreasonable asset stripping in target companies. Recommendation 4 on conflicts of interest measures The European Parliament considers that the legislative act to be adopted should aim to regulate: The Commission should introduce rules to ensure effective separation between services that investment firms provide for their clients. The European Parliament wishes to reiterate that any adjustments should be applicable to all financial institutions and thus non-discriminatory. As recommended by the IOSCO, financial institutions, which provide a range of different financial services should have policies and procedures, including proper disclosure, at the firm or group level that enable it to identify, assess and develop appropriate means of addressing conflicts or potential conflicts. Credit Rating Agencies \u2014 Credit Rating Agencies should be required to increase information and eliminate or mitigate asymmetric information and uncertainty and disclose the conflicts of interest under which they operate without destroying the transaction oriented financial system. In particular, Credit Rating Agencies should be required to separate their rating business from any other services (such as advice on structuring transactions) that they provide in respect of any obligations or entities that they rate. Market access and concentration \u2014 the Commission's Directorate General for Competition should launch a general review of the effects of market concentration and of the effects of dominant players in the financial services industry and in the light of the international situation including hedge funds and private equity. It should asses whether Community competition rules are applied by all market players, whether there is unlawful market concentration or any need to remove barriers to new entrants as well as the need to remove legislation favouring incumbents and current market structures where competition is limited; Recommendation 5 on existing financial services legislation The European Parliament considers that the legislative act to be adopted should aim to regulate: The Commission should undertake an examination of all existing Community legislation relevant to financial markets in order to identify any lacunae as regards the regulation of hedge funds and private equity and, based on the results of such examination, to submit to the European Parliament a legislative proposal or proposals amending the existing directives where necessary, in order better to regulate hedge funds, private equity and other relevant actors. Such proposed regulation should be purposive. EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/33 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",

Requests the Commission to submit to Parliament, on the basis of Articles 44, 47(2) or 95 of the EC Treaty, depending on the subject matter, a legislative proposal or proposals on the transparency of hedge funds and private equity; calls for such proposal(s) to be drawn up in the light of interinstitutional discussions and following the detailed recommendations below; 2. Confirms that the recommendations respect the principle of subsidiarity and the fundamental rights of citizens; 3. Considers that the requested proposals have no financial implications; 4. Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the accompanying detailed recommendations to the Commission and the Council, and to the parliaments and governments of the Member States. ANNEX TO THE RESOLUTION: DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE CONTENT OF THE PROPOSALS REQUESTED The European Parliament asks the Commission to propose a directive or directives guaranteeing a common standard of transparency and to tackle the issues mentioned below covering hedge funds and private equity, on the basis that the directive(s) should give Member States, where necessary, enough flexibility to transpose EU rules into their existing company-law systems; in parallel, it asks the Commission to encourage improvements in transparency by supporting and monitoring the evolution of self-regulation already introduced by managers of hedge funds and private equity and their counterparties, and to encourage Member States to support these efforts through dialogue and exchange of best practice. Taking into account the fact that there is no uniform public disclosure of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), the European Parliament welcomes the initiative of the International Monetary Fund to establish a working group to draft an international code of conduct for SWFs, and believes that such a code of conduct would go some way to demystifying SWF activities; it calls on the Commission to take part in that process. EN C 8 E/38 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",
        "On hedge funds and private equity The European Parliament asks the Commission to submit the appropriate legislative proposals by way of review of the existing acquis communautaire affecting the various types of investors and counterparties, together with an impact assessment and with the involvement of the industries concerned, to explore the possibility of differentiating between hedge funds, private equity and other investors and to adapt or establish rules providing for the clear disclosure and timely communication of relevant and material information so as to facilitate high-quality decision-making and transparent communication between investors and the company management as well as between investors and other counterparties; where proposals already exist they should be implemented accordingly; it invites the Commission to explore ways of enhancing the visibility and understanding of risk, as distinct from creditworthiness; attention should be paid to the question whether existing and future directives and transparency measures are not undermined by excessive disclaimers in contracts. The new legislation should require shareholders to notify issuers of the proportion of their voting rights resulting from an acquisition or disposal of shares where that proportion reaches, exceeds or falls below the specific thresholds starting with 3 % instead of 5 %, as mentioned in Directive 2004/109/EC; it should also oblige hedge funds and private equity, as far as those categories of investors can be differentiated from others, to disclose and explain \u2014 vis-\u00e0-vis the companies whose shares they acquire or own, retail and institutional investors, prime brokers and supervisors \u2014 their investment policy and associated risks. These proposals should be based on an examination of the existing Community legislation, carried out with a view to ascertaining the extent to which the existing rules on transparency can be applied to the specific situation of hedge funds and private equity. With a view to the abovementioned legislative proposals, the Commission should in particular: \u2014 explore the possibility of contract terms, to be applied to alternative investments, that provide for an unambiguous disclosure and management of risk, for measures to be taken in the event of thresholds being exceeded, for a clear description of lock-up periods and for explicit conditions governing cancel\u00ad lation and termination of the contract; \u2014 investigate the issue of money laundering in the context of hedge funds and private equity; \u2014 explore possibilities of harmonising rules and recommendations for hedge funds and \u2014 as the case may be \u2014 private equity to register and identify shareholders beyond a certain proportion, as well as to disclose their strategies and intentions \u2014 bearing in mind that an overflow of information should be avoided; \u2014 explore the need for, and ways of, obliging intermediaries to enable the original shareholders to participate actively in voting at general meetings of shareholders and to make sure that their voting instructions are respected by proxy-holders, as well as to ensure that voting policies of identified shareholders are disclosed; \u2014 establish, together with the industry, a code of best practice on how to rebalance the current structure of corporate governance with a view to reinforcing long-term orientation and discouraging financial and other incentives for short-term excessive risk-taking and irresponsible behaviour; \u2014 establish rules providing for full transparency of managers\u2019 remuneration systems, including stock options, through formal approval by the general meeting of the company's shareholders. EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/39 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",
        "On hedge funds specifically The European Parliament asks the Commission to establish rules that enhance the transparency of voting policies of hedge funds, on the basis that the addressees of Community rules should be the managers of such funds; such rules could also include a system of EU-wide shareholder identification; where proposals already exist they should be implemented accordingly. With a view to the abovementioned legislative proposal(s), the Commission should in particular: \u2014 investigate the effects of securities lending and voting on borrowed shares, having regard to better regulation principles; \u2014 examine whether reporting requirements should also apply to cooperation agreements between several shareholders and to indirect acquisitions of voting rights via option arrangements. On private equity specifically The European Parliament asks the Commission to propose rules that forbid investors to \u2018plunder\u2019 companies (so called \u2018asset stripping\u2019) and thus misuse their financial power in a way that merely disadvantages the company acquired in the long term, without having any positive impact on the company's future and the interest of its employees, creditors and business partners; moreover, the Commission should explore common rules to guarantee the capital maintenance of companies; in parallel, the European Parliament also asks the Commission to examine whether the Member States have put in place measures to counteract asset stripping. With a view to the abovementioned legislative proposal(s), the Commission should examine ways of addressing the issues arising when banks lend huge amounts of money to acquirers, including private equity, and then disclaim any responsibility whatsoever as to the purpose for which that money is used or the provenance of the money used to repay the loan, bearing in mind that these points ultimately remain the responsibility of the debtor and that capital requirements for comparable risks must be the same across the entire financial system. The European Parliament also asks the Commission to examine whether the Transfers of Undertakings Directive ( 1 ) needs to be adjusted to the specific situation of leveraged buy-outs.

Stresses that the legal scope of the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be recognised if the Lisbon Treaty is fully ratified, and that this will formally enshrine its independent binding character, and points out that specific measures will have to be envisaged to determine what effect this will have on citizens\u2019 rights and, as a consequence, on the work and competences of the Committee on Petitions; 3. Reiterates its requests to its Secretary-General to conduct an urgent review of the \u2018Citizens Portal\u2019 on Parliament's website with the objective of enhancing the visibility of the portal as regards the right of petition and to ensure that citizens are provided with the means to append their signatures electronically in support of petitions, as provided for in Rule 192(2) of the Rules of Procedure; urges that the Citizen's Portal must ensure web-browsing software interoperability in order to provide citizens with equal rights of access in this respect; EN C 8 E/44 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",

Calls for the initiation of negotiations between Parliament and the Commission with a view to better coordinating their work on complaints in a way that facilitates, simplifies and streamlines the complaint procedures and makes them more transparent and expeditious; calls on the Secretary-General to report back to the Committee on Petitions within six months; 6. Supports the formalisation of a procedure whereby petitions in the field of the internal market are transferred to the Solvit network with a view to significantly shortening the petitions process in the field of internal market issues such as car taxes, recognition of professional qualifications, residence permits, border controls and access to education, while preserving Parliament's right to examine the issue should a satis\u00ad factory solution not be found through Solvit; 7. Reiterates the need for greater involvement on the part of the Council and the Member States\u2019 Permanent Representations in the activities of the Committee on Petitions, and urges them to increase their presence and participation in the interests of the citizens; 8. Considers that, in the context of the reinforcement of the secretariat of the Committee on Petitions, and in the context of development of the e-Petition system, the introduction of an IT facility for online tracking aimed at petitioners would help to create a more transparent and efficient process by means of, inter alia , regular status updates and calls for additional information; notes that such a measure would better meet the expectations of EU citizens while also fostering improved performance of the institutional responsibilities incumbent on Parliament and on its Committee on Petitions; 9. Calls on the Commission to take full account of the recommendations of the Committee on Petitions when reaching decisions regarding the initiation of infringement proceedings against Member States, and reiterates its demand that the Committee on Petitions be directly and officially notified by the Commission when an infringement procedure is launched which is related to a petition under consideration by the Committee; 10. Reiterates in this connection the representative nature of the Committee on Petitions as well as the institutional role and duty that it performs vis-\u00e0-vis EU citizens and residents; 11. Expresses concern about the excessive length of time taken to conclude infringement cases by the Commission services and the Court of Justice, if and when the Court is involved, and \u2014 recognising that this is frequently the result of slow and often deliberate obstruction within the Member State adminis\u00ad trations involved \u2014 calls for the introduction of more stringent timescales; expresses its doubts about the efficiency of the so-called \u2018horizontal infringement procedures\u2019, which take longer to conclude; calls for a review of the infringement procedure aimed at ensuring greater respect for the application of EC legislative acts; 12. Calls on the institutions concerned to make better use of this procedure as a means of ensuring full respect for Community law, and deeply regrets that too often the slowness of the procedures used and the frequent obfuscation of what is at stake lead to de facto breaches of Community law by Member States, who thus act with impunity against the interests of directly affected local communities who have petitioned Parliament; EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/45 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",
        "13. Considers it problematic that the present system for the monitoring of Community law allows Member States to delay compliance until a pecuniary sanction is actually imminent and still avoid respon\u00ad sibility for past intentional violations, and that citizens often appear to lack adequate access to justice and remedies at national level even when the Court of Justice has ruled that a Member State has failed to respect citizens\u2019 rights under Community law; 14. Recommends that priority be given to ensuring that the Committee on Petitions is effective and efficient in all aspects of its operations from start to finish, as this represents a real and tangible commitment to its citizens indicating that the EU is willing and able to respond to their legitimate concerns; 15. Expresses its concern and dismay at reports by petitioners that, even when they have obtained the support of the Committee on Petitions on the substance of their petition, they too often experience great difficulty in obtaining any compensation from the authorities and national courts involved; believes that such systemic weaknesses need to be further investigated, notably in so far as they apply to the financial services sector, as in the case of the findings of the Committee of Inquiry into the Equitable Life Crisis, which were based on petitions received by Parliament and on which a report was produced in 2007; 16. Welcomes the fact that in 2007 the Commission and the Court of Justice acted swiftly, including by means of an injunction, to prevent the imminent destruction of an area protected under the Habitats Directive in the Rospuda Valley by the Via Baltica road corridor, in respect of which the Committee on Petitions had conducted its own independent investigation and fact-finding visit and made specific recom\u00ad mendations; laments the fact that there were not more examples of this kind; 17. Urges the Commission, when dealing with petitions and complaints related to environmental policy \u2014 which is one of the predominant concerns of petitioners in the EU \u2014 to be more ready to act to prevent breaches of Community law; notes that the \u2018precautionary principle\u2019 has insufficient practical legal force and is too often ignored by responsible authorities in Member States who are nevertheless under an obligation to apply the EC Treaty; 18. Regrets the lack of support given to the Committee on Petitions by the Commission when, as a result of fact-finding visits in particular, compelling evidence is obtained concerning failure to respect citizen's rights as enshrined in the Treaty or failure to apply legislation, and calls for new procedures to be established which allow Parliament to bring such cases directly before the Court of Justice; 19. Fully recognises that the petitions process, as recognised in the Treaty, is nevertheless primarily concerned with obtaining non-judicial remedies and solutions with regard to the problems raised by EU citizens through the political process and, in this context, welcomes the fact that in many instances satis\u00ad factory outcomes are achieved; 20. Recognises also that in many instances satisfactory solutions cannot be found for petitioners because of the weaknesses in the applicable Community legislation itself; 21. Calls on the responsible legislative committees, when preparing and negotiating new or revised legislative acts, to pay close attention to the problems reported through the petitions process; 22. Calls on the Commission to be more concerned about the use of Cohesion Funds in areas of the EU where large infrastructure projects have a major impact on the environment, and urges Member States to ensure that EU funds are directed towards sustainable development in the interests of local communities, a growing number of which are petitioning Parliament to protest that such priorities are not always respected by regional and local authorities; welcomes the work being undertaken by the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Court of Auditors in this respect; EN C 8 E/46 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",
        "23. Notes that a growing number of petitions received, notably from citizens from the new Member States, concern the question of the restitution of property, even though this subject remains essentially one of national competence; urges the Member States involved to ensure that their laws concerning property rights resulting from regime change are fully in accordance with Treaty requirements and the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, as required also by Article 6 of the EU Treaty as amended by the Treaty of Lisbon; emphasises that petitions received on this subject do not concern the system of property ownership but the right to legitimately acquired property; in this context, urges the Commission to be particularly vigilant not only in its dealings with existing Member States but also in its negotiations with candidate countries; 24. Reaffirms its commitment to upholding the recognition of rights of EU citizens to their private property which has been legally obtained, and condemns all attempts to divest families of their property without due process, proper compensation or respect for their personal integrity; notes an increase in the numbers of petitions received on this issue, especially regarding Spain in 2007, and notes also the report and recommendations of the fact-finding visit conducted by the Committee on Petitions to investigate the problem for the third time; notes that, as regards the Public Procurement Directives, ongoing infringement procedures are still open; 25. Notes also the criticisms raised by the Committee on Petitions following its fact-finding visit to the Loiret, in France, in 2007, and in particular requests the French authorities to act decisively to ensure compliance with EU directives which risk being infringed should certain planned projects for the construction of bridges over the River Loire be allowed to go ahead, bearing in mind that the Loire Valley is not only protected under the terms of the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive but is also a Unesco World Heritage Site and one of Europe's last remaining wild river systems; 26. Expresses its ongoing concern about the lack of implementation of the provisions of the Drinking Water Directive in Ireland, the absence of any assessment in advance of a 2007 decision to remove a national monument situated at Lismullin in the path of the M3 motorway project near Tara in County Meath \u2014 leading to the Commission's decision to bring an action against Ireland before the Court of Justice on the grounds that Ireland's wider approach to the removal of national monuments in circumstances such as those at Lismullin does not fully respect the requirements of Directive 85/337/EEC ( 1 ), the problems faced by local communities in Limerick, and other issues raised in the report of the fact-finding visit to Ireland conducted by the Committee on Petitions in 2007; notes that some of these issues are the subject of ongoing infringement procedures; 27. Notes the report on the fact-finding visit to Poland which made recommendations concerning the protection of the Rospuda Valley and the last primeval forest in Europe; urges the Commission to continue to work with the Polish authorities on alternative routes for the Via Baltica road network and rail network as recommended by the report of the Committee on Petitions; also encourages the Commission to ensure that funding is made available to alleviate the pressure on the road system in Augustow in such a way as to protect the local population and preserve the environment of the area; 28. Notes the fact-finding visit to Cyprus in November 2007 by the Chairman and members of the Committee on Petitions; urges the parties concerned to continue with their efforts to reach a negotiated solution to the outstanding issues of concern to petitioners, notably as regards the sealed-off section of Famagusta which should be returned to its lawful owners, and welcomes the fact that the two sides in Cyprus are having talks within a framework of renewed efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem; stresses the importance, moreover, of the immediate implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 550 (1984), which sets out the commitment to return the town of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants; 29. Notes the growing number of petitions and letters received by the Committee on Petitions concerning the most sensitive matter of child custody, on which it is extremely difficult to take action, as for instance in the case of petitions concerning the German Jugendamt, because of the involvement of the courts in many cases, and because of the fact that \u2014 except in cases of parents from different EU countries \u2014 it is difficult to claim competence for the EU as such; EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/47 ( 1 ) Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (OJ L 175, 5.7.1985, p. 40).

        "30. Records that, in 2007, many British petitioners who had their property confiscated by the British Customs & Excise authorities were still without redress even though the Commission halted infringement proceedings against the UK for failure to respect the Treaty obligation allowing the free movement of goods; urges the British authorities to come up with an equitable solution including the payment of ex gratia payments to petitioners who suffered serious financial loss before the authorities reviewed their practice and, according to the Commission, began to act in conformity with the relevant directives; 31. Also records the fact that, in Greece, the customs authorities continue to confiscate, as an extra\u00ad ordinary measure only, the cars of Greek nationals provisionally abroad and who return to Greece with foreign number plates on their vehicles, many of whom have been accused of smuggling and have not had their case duly processed, as previously reported by the Committee on Petitions to Parliament; urges the Greek authorities to provide compensatory payments to those petitioners who have been victims of this practice; takes note of the ruling of the Court of Justice C-156/04 (7 June 2007) that deems satisfactory most of the explanations provided by the Greek authorities in this case; welcomes the implementation of new legislation adopted by the latter in the purpose of addressing the shortcomings highlighted in the aforementioned ruling; 32. Deplores the fact that, among the oldest outstanding petitions still being worked upon, the case of the \u2018Lettori\u2019, the foreign language teachers in Italy, continues to be unresolved despite two decisions by the Court of Justice and the support of the Commission and the Committee on Petitions for their case and their grievances; urges the Italian authorities and the individual universities involved, including inter alia those of Genoa, Padua and Naples, to act to apply a just solution to these legitimate claims; 33. Records that the petitions considered by the Committee on Petitions in 2007 included \u2014 although it was originally tabled in 2006 \u2014 the so-called \u2018One Seat\u2019 petition, which was supported by 1,25 million EU citizens and which called for a single seat for the European Parliament, to be located in Brussels; notes that in October 2007 the President referred the petition back to the committee, which subsequently called for Parliament to give its opinion on this question, bearing in mind that the seat of the institution is governed by the provisions of the Treaty and that the Member States have the responsibility for taking a decision on this matter; 34. Resolves to review the name of the Committee on Petitions, as translated into all EU official languages, for the next legislative term, so as to ensure that the name communicates the nature of the Committee in a comprehensible manner, as this is apparently not the case in certain languages at the moment, and so as to underline the element of participatory democracy in the right of petition; suggests that the term \u2018Committee on Citizens\u2019 Petitions\u2019 may be more easily understandable; 35. Is concerned by the number of petitions received which draw attention to the problems of electoral registration experienced by EU citizens who are expatriates or have minority status within a Member State; urges all Member States to pay particular attention to the facilities made available for all EU citizens and eligible EU residents in order to ensure their full participation in the next EU elections; 36. Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the report of the Committee on Petitions to the Council, the Commission, the European Ombudsman, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, their committees on petitions and their national ombudsmen or similar competent bodies.

Points out the vast differences in the actions taken by Member States in regard to mountain areas (particularly high mountains and highlands), which envisage purely sectoral rather than integrated devel\u00ad opment, and that there is no integrated EU framework (as is the case for maritime areas: COM(2007)0574); 2. Stresses that Article 158 of the EC Treaty, on cohesion policy, as amended by the Treaty of Lisbon, identifies mountain regions as suffering from severe and permanent handicaps, whilst acknowledging their diversity, and calls for particular attention to be paid to such areas; regrets, however, that the Commission has not yet been able to draw up a comprehensive strategy to support mountain areas and other regions suffering from permanent natural handicaps effectively, despite numerous requests to do so by Parliament; 3. Stresses the need for good coordination of the various Community policies aimed at ensuring harmonious development, particularly for regions such as mountain areas, which suffer from permanent natural handicaps; is concerned, in this connection, about the usefulness of separating the Community's cohesion policy from rural development in the current programming period 2007-2013, resulting from the integration of the European Agricultural Fund for Regional Development into the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP); considers that this new approach needs to be monitored closely in order to evaluate its impact on regional development; 4. Points out that mountain areas suffer handicaps which make it less easy for agriculture to adapt to competitive conditions and entail extra costs so that it cannot produce very competitive products at low prices; 5. Proposes that, in the context of the Green Paper on territorial cohesion to be adopted in autumn 2008, and in keeping with the objectives of the territorial agenda and the European Spatial Development Perspective, the Commission should, in cooperation with the Member States, adopt a territorial approach in order to address the problems in different types of mountain territories and make provision for such measures within the next legislative package on the Structural Funds; 6. Would like the Commission to develop a genuine integrated EU strategy for mountain areas and considers the publication of a Green Paper on mountains to be an important first step in that direction; calls on the Commission to launch a wide-ranging public consultation involving regional and local authorities, socio-economic and environmental actors, as well as national and European associations representing regional authorities in mountain areas, in order better to identify the situation in those regions; EN C 8 E/50 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",
        "7. Welcomes the Green Paper on territorial cohesion as a method for dealing with the different areas of the European Union and calls, in this connection, for a CAP with a first and second pillar so that in the European Union, with regard to the international challenges, the economic environment can be effectively influenced accordingly, with a view to making multifunctional mountain and hill farming viable, for which production-linked instruments, including as regards milk transport, are also necessary; 8. At the same time, urges the Commission to develop, within its remit, an integrated EU strategy for the sustainable development and use of resources in mountain areas (EU strategy for mountain areas) within six months of the adoption of this resolution; also calls for national action programmes containing specific implementation measures to be drawn up on this basis by arrangement with regional authorities and civil society representatives familiar with and defending local interests and needs on the spot (e.g. as regards the different types of mountain area), with account to be taken of existing regional initiatives, accordingly; 9. Emphasises the importance of demarcating mountain areas as a prerequisite for targeted measures, such as, in particular, for mountain and hill farming, and the need for those areas to be properly classified by degree of natural disadvantage, which should be monitored to a greater extent by Member States on the basis of the current eligible-area map; 10. Calls on the Commission to produce an overview of programmes and projects funded on topics of relevance to mountain areas for the purpose of transferring knowledge and promoting innovation; 11. Calls on the Commission, in the context of the European Spatial Planning Observation Network work programme, to pay special attention to the situation of regions that are beset by permanent natural handicaps, such as mountain areas; considers that a sound and thorough knowledge of the situation as regards mountain areas is essential in order to be able to draw up differentiated measures that better address the problems of those regions; 12. Emphasises the role played by hill and mountain farming in production, in the cross-sectoral main\u00ad tenance and utilisation of landscapes and as a multifunctional basis for other sectors of the economy and characteristic feature of traditional cultural landscapes and social fabrics; 13. Points out that many mountain areas have to tackle urban pressures caused by their attractiveness to tourists and, at the same time, to protect traditional landscapes that are becoming less agricultural and are losing their beauty as well as qualities of essential importance to the ecosystem; 14. Notes that farming in mountain areas (in particular in highland and high mountain areas) involves greater effort (inter alia because of high labour intensity and the need for manual labour) and higher costs (inter alia because of the need for special machinery and the high cost of transport) due to natural conditions and risks; 15. Calls for specific and greater account to be taken of the multifunctionality of mountain and hill farming in future CAP reforms by bringing the framework directives for rural development and national programmes into line with the role of mountain and hill farmers not only as producers but also as economic forerunners for other sectors and that scope be created for synergetic collaboration (inter alia, funding for ecotourism programmes and marketing for high-quality products); points, in particular, to the need for charges to be made for mountain farming's ecological benefits; EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/51 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",
        "16. Pays tribute to the work carried out by mountain farmers; notes that the conditions for mountain farming (above all as regards earning a supplementary income, the work life balance and the ability to start a family) should not be complicated by red tape but should be improved through the fusion of sectoral policies; calls on the Commission and the competent (comitology) committees to review existing and prospective rules (above all on compulsory registers) in keeping with the \u2018better regulation\u2019 initiative and/or to make them less complicated with a view to comprehensive simplification of administrative procedures; 17. Emphasises that compensatory payments for mountain areas (in particular in highland and high mountain areas) should continue and that they should, in future, be exclusively geared towards offsetting permanent natural disadvantages and additional costs stemming from farming difficulties, that such payments are justified in the long term due to the lack of alternative production and that full decoupling would lead to a systematic reduction in activity affecting all sectors; emphasises that the needs of mountain areas cannot be met by rural development funding alone; 18. Calls for more assistance for young farmers and equal opportunities for women and men (particularly through family-friendly measures, the regulation of full and part-time work, combined-wage models, supplementary-jobs models, the work life balance and the ability to start a family) as vital factors; calls on the Commission to devise approaches, with stakeholder involvement, as part of \u2018flexicurity\u2019 discussions and projects; 19. Calls for demographic balance to be maintained in those areas that often face problems arising from urban migration; 20. Is convinced that priority should be given to maintaining sufficient population density in mountain areas and of the need for measures to combat desertification and attract new people; 21. Stresses the importance of ensuring a high level of services of general economic interest, improving the accessibility and interconnection of mountain areas and providing the necessary infrastructure, in particular as regards passenger and freight transport, education, the knowledge-based economy and communication networks (including broadband access) in order to facilitate connections with upland markets and urban areas; calls on the competent authorities to promote public-private partnerships for these purposes; 22. Emphasises that producer associations, farming cooperatives, collective marketing initiatives driven by farmers and inter-sectoral partnerships that create added value within regions through an integrated development approach (e.g. Leader groups) and in line with sustainable farming strategies, make an important contribution to the stability of income positioning and security of agricultural production on markets and should be given greater support accordingly; 23. Calls for special financial assistance for the dairy sector (dairy farmers and processors) which plays a key role in mountain areas (in particular highland and high mountain areas) given the lack of alternative production; calls for a \u2018soft landing\u2019 strategy to be adopted for mountain areas during the milk quota reform, and for accompanying measures (special payments) to reduce any negative impact, that leaves room for introducing adjustment processes, which preserves the basis for farming; calls for additional funds to be made available from the first pillar, in particular in the form of a dairy cow premium; 24. Calls on the Member States to establish, with an emphasis on support for sustainable and adapted agriculture in mountain areas, additional per-hectare payments for organic farming and extensive grazing as well as support for investments in livestock facilities appropriate to the species; 25. Points out that undertakings in mountain areas produce high-quality products by making renewed use of traditional know-how and manufacturing procedures and play a key role in the field of employment and should thus be envisaged in EU aid systems; EN C 8 E/52 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",
        "26. Calls for special assistance measures as a result of increased costs and efforts needed, in particular for delivering milk and dairy products in valleys; repeats its call for the introduction of a dairy cow premium for mountain areas in this context; 27. Underlines the cross-sectoral importance of typical (high-quality) regional and traditional products; asks that the EU strategy for mountain areas to include measures to protect and promote those products or their manufacturing procedures and their certification (e.g. as laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 509/2006 of 20 March 2006 on agricultural products and foodstuffs as traditional specialities guaranteed ( 1 ) and Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs ( 2 )) and to safeguard them from imitations; calls for special provision to be made within the EU promotion programmes for high-quality foodstuffs (e.g. those from mountain pasture and farm cheese dairies as well as high-quality meat); 28. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to support farmer groups and local communities to establish regional quality labels as referred to in paragraph 27; suggests that support be given by improved information and appropriate training for farmers and local food processors as well as by financial support for setting up local processing facilities as well as first promotion campaigns; 29. Calls for the establishment of a fund for disadvantaged areas, including mountain areas, containing, for example, resources from the second pillar which have not been used due to the lack of national co- financing; 30. Calls for guaranteed targeted special financial assistance for mountain areas, in accordance with Article 69 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the CAP and establishing certain support schemes for farmers ( 3 ), specific access to this assistance with minimum red tape, and for the upper limit for resources under Article 69 to be raised to 20 %; 31. Points out that mountain areas can provide high-quality agricultural produce and can add to the diversity of agricultural products in the European market, preserve certain animal and vegetable species, uphold traditions and foster industrial and tourist activities and combat climate change by protecting biodiversity and capturing CO 2 through permanent grassland and forests and that sustainable forestry exploitation will make it possible to produce energy using wood residues; 32. Calls for the interests of breeders and farmers of livestock, in particular of indigenous breeds, in mountain areas and in view of the current risks and pressures to which they are subject, to be taken into account in animal health, animal protection and animal breeding provisions, such as breeding programmes, the retention of herd books and compliance checks; 33. Stresses that the Commission's actions in the fields of competition and international trade policy have consequences on the development of mountain areas; calls on the Commission, in this context, to address the needs of those areas in a more targeted way when future adjustments are made, in particular at World Trade Organisation negotiations and as regards the flexibility of State aid rules and factoring public services of general interest into competition law; 34. Calls for particular attention to be given to stock farmers in fire-stricken mountain areas, as the pastureland in those areas requires limited and cautious use over the next five-year period; EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/53 ( 1 ) OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 1.

        "35. Calls for the \u2018strategy\u2019 to cover the different types of landscape in mountain areas (mountain pastures, protected forests, high mountains, highlands, meadows, landscapes of particular beauty) and to make provision for ideas and incentives for the protection and the sustainable use of mountain pastures, grassland, forests and other less favoured, sensitive areas in order to regenerate and re-grass them, protect them from erosion, promote rational management of water resources and combat unwelcome developments such as ending grazing on land which then reverts to its wild state on the one hand or over-grazing on the other; 36. Points out, with regard to preserving species diversity, the need to establish repositories of indigenous genetic material from animal and plant species, particularly indigenous farm animals and mountain flora; calls on the Commission to examine whether and how to launch an international action plan initiative; 37. Stresses that in some mountain areas in the European Union, particularly in the newer Member States, there is a growing risk of depopulation and an impoverishment of the social life of local commu\u00ad nities and that those areas are also threatened by a curtailment or even a discontinuation of farming, which is likely to result in changes to the landscape and the ecosystem; 38. Stresses that grass premiums are essential for the continuation of farming in mountain areas and should therefore be maintained; 39. Emphasises the importance of a long-term forestry strategy that takes into account the effects of climate change, the natural life cycle and natural composition of the forest ecosystem, and creates prevention, response and compensatory mechanisms in crisis situations (e.g. storms and forest fires) and incentives for integrated forest management; points to the scope for sustainable transformation and exploi\u00ad tation of timber and timber products from mountain regions at local level (as high-quality products with low shipping costs and hence reductions in CO 2 emissions, construction materials and second-generation biofuels); 40. Stresses the importance of the issue of water management in mountain areas and calls on the Commission to encourage local and regional authorities to develop a sense of solidarity between down\u00ad stream and upstream users, including through appropriate funding to support the sustainable use of water resources in these areas; 41. Stresses that mountain areas are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change and calls on the Commission, the Member States and the competent regional and local authorities to promote the immediate implementation of measures to provide protection against natural disasters, in particular forest fires, in those regions; 42. Points out that mountain areas require new means of protecting their territory against flooding (with an emphasis on flood prevention), whilst farmers and foresters can support anti-flooding preventive measures by means of the direct area-related payments which they receive under the CAP; 43. Points out that thorough and comprehensive anti-erosion protection for soil, buildings and the conservation of aquifers must be provided as a constituent part of farming and forestry practice in order to minimise the risks of flooding and soil erosion and to prevent drought and forest fires and also for the purpose of increasing the supply of groundwater and surface water in the countryside; 44. Emphasises that deciduous and coniferous forests need particular care as a sector of the economy, as recreational areas and as a habitat, and that the unsustainable use of forests leads to ecological and safety risks (such as rock falls and mudslides), which require counteracting measures; 45. Recalls the suggestion in paragraph 15 of its resolution of 16 February 2006 that efforts be made to encourage the separation between forests and grazing land in mountain areas and to introduce the requirement to use paths (not least for safety reasons in general); EN C 8 E/54 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",
        "46. Points out that mountains form natural barriers, and in many instances are also national barriers, which makes cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation \u2014 and the promotion thereof \u2014 essential, given the problems they have in common (e.g. climate change, animal diseases, loss of biodi\u00ad versity); 47. Welcomes efforts in the field of sustainable tourism and those aimed at making efficient use of nature as an \u2018economic advantage\u2019 through sustainable and also traditional leisure and sports activities that take specific local characteristics into account; emphasises the role of people who \u2018use\u2019 nature for the benefit of their own health whilst respecting the natural environment; 48. Urges greater coordination of rural development and structural support and the development of common programmes; 49. Suggests that rural development and structural assistance be combined and that integrated programmes be developed; 50. Stresses the significance of introducing an integrated approach to decision-making and administrative procedures such as regional planning, the licensing of construction projects and the refurbishment of dwellings by means of environmental, heritage and urban-planning practices, with a view to ensuring sustainable development in mountain areas; recommends that the potential of mountain areas should be exploited in order to promote the comprehensive development of tourism and the use of innovation in land development and, to that end, encourages local, decentralised initiatives and cooperation between mountain areas; 51. Emphasises that land that is not suitable for cultivation and production must be used, inter alia, for the maintenance of forests, sustainable hunting and fishing and for the enhancement of those activities, in order to prevent it reverting to its wild state and to prevent fire hazards, erosion and a reduction in biodiversity; 52. Cites the importance of mountain areas (particularly high mountains and highlands) for conservation, biodiversity and habitat preservation but points in particular to the need to maintain farming and forestry in \u2018Natura 2000\u2019 areas and nature reserves and calls for the increased interlinking of those areas by introducing a minimum proportion of ecological offset land in farming areas (possibly 5 %); 53. Calls on the Commission to give its full backing to nominating mountain areas for inclusion on the world heritage list and to avail itself of all the international opportunities available to protect those regions; 54. Points to the unique water resources of mountain areas, which can be used sustainably for natural irrigation and as a source of drinking water and energy and for spa tourism; stresses the need for upstream and downstream solidarity in the management of these resources; highlights the need in this connection, and so as to prevent any conflicts, to devise solutions, collaboratively, for the use of water resources throughout the areas concerned; 55. Calls on the Commission to promote the implementation of the Mountain Farming Protocol to the Alpine Convention in close collaboration with the Alpine Convention institutions, to give optimum backing to interlinking mountain and hill farming with other policy areas and, in this connection, to take the necessary steps to ensure the ratification of the Alpine Convention protocols that are not yet part of the acquis communautaire and the accession of the European Union to the Carpathian Convention as a contracting party; 56. Highlights the importance of the voluntary sector (especially mountain rescue, civil protection and charities) with regard to services and the cultural and natural heritage in the mountains; EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/55 Tuesday 23 September 2008 ",

Applauds the work of organisations and research institutes dedicated to the cause of mountain areas and stresses that use must be made of their expertise and motivation in developing an EU strategy for mountain areas and similar measures; 58. Points to the role played by the promotion of part-time basic and further vocational training and \u2014 in the interests of diversifying vocational capacities and opportunities \u2014 of lifelong learning initiatives and projects; 59. Considers it to be necessary to invest in local, advanced training centres in agricultural economy for mountain areas, so as to train professionals with the ability to manage activities in a mountain environment, protect the land and develop agriculture; 60. Calls for particular attention to be given to preserving the landscape and strengthening and modernising the infrastructure in mountain areas which are difficult to access and for the information gap to be bridged and for the results of the research framework programmes (e.g. for e-Government) to be made accessible; 61. Points to the need for efficient local services in maintaining population levels and for competi\u00ad tiveness; calls for targeted support to be given to local entities working as services of general interest; 62. Emphasises the need to focus on sustainable mobility solutions and to adopt an integrated approach to trans-national (transit, long-distance corridors) and local requirements (such as access to areas at very different altitudes and urban mobility); 63. Calls for mountain areas to be given support in the areas of transport management, noise protection and landscape conservation through measures aimed at taking traffic off the roads (e.g. more \u2018sensitive areas\u2019 in the \u2018Infrastructure Charging Directive\u2019 ( 1 )), thus forming the basis for a better quality of life and sustainable tourism; 64. Stresses the importance of \u2018transition zones\u2019 between plains and mountain areas for providing high- value private and public infrastructure facilities and services (e.g. universities, airports, hospitals); calls for support to make such facilities more easily accessible, particularly by means of public transport; 65. Emphasises that, through the intelligent use of many different sources of energy, mountain areas are \u2018models\u2019 for a diversified energy mix, energy-efficient building solutions and second-generation biofuels, and that support should be given to research work in those fields; stresses, nonetheless, that the development of second-generation biofuels must not give rise to competition between feedstock production (fallow land, coppices, etc.) and grazing areas; 66. Advises Member States to improve the structure of and procedures for the provision of financial assistance intended to support the development of mountain areas and at the same time to simplify administrative procedures and access to resources intended to support the protection and sustainable use of territorial assets: the cultural heritage and natural and human resources; 67. Considers that sustainable, modernised and multifunctional agriculture is necessary in mountain areas for maintaining other activities, such as the exploitation of biomass and agri-tourism, thus increasing the incomes of local people and calls on the Commission and Council to take account specifically, in the CAP and in regional policy, of the needs of mountain areas: the arrival of new farmers, compensation of extra costs linked to the problem of inaccessibility, for example with regard to milk collection, the maintenance of services in rural areas and the development of transport infrastructure; EN C 8 E/56 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 ( 1 ) Directive 2006/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 8).

Points to the vulnerability of mountains and glaciers on climate change, because of their topo\u00ad graphical features and structural disadvantages, as well as to their potential as a \u2018test laboratory\u2019 for innovative technologies on climate protection that imitate Nature; calls on the Commission to devise a differentiated climate policy as regards mountain areas and, in the process, to draw on existing knowledge (such as the Alpine and Carpathian Conventions); calls for research activities to be undertaken and tran\u00ad sitional measures to be adopted in this area; 69. Calls for coordination arrangements for mountain areas and less favoured areas to be functionally linked with the CAP and the second pillar (rural development); 70. Stresses that sustainable agriculture and the development of mountain areas are of importance to the population not only in those particular areas, but also of adjoining areas (e.g. plains), and that the EU strategy for mountain areas should also influence sustainability in those adjoining areas as regards water supply, environmental stability, biodiversity, balanced population distribution and cultural diversity; calls on the Commission to examine, in formulating the EU strategy for mountain areas, how existing initiatives for the integration of mountain areas and adjoining areas can usefully be incorporated into the strategy; 71.

Emphasises that the digital dividend provides the European Union with unique opportunities to develop new services such as mobile television and wireless Internet access and to remain a world leader in mobile multimedia technologies whilst bridging the digital divide, providing new opportunities for citizens, services, media and cultural diversity throughout the European Union; 12. Calls on the Members States, whilst fully respecting their sovereignty in this regard, to analyse the impact of the digital switchover on the spectrum used in the past for military purposes, and, if appropriate, to reallocate part of that specific digital dividend to new civilian applications; 13. Acknowledges that coordination at EU level would encourage development, boost the digital economy and allow all citizens affordable and equal access to the information society; 14. Urges the Member States to release their digital dividends as quickly as possible, allowing citizens of the Union to benefit from the deployment of new, innovative and competitive services; emphasises that, for this purpose, the active cooperation between Member States to overcome obstacles existing at national level for the efficient (re)allocation of the digital dividend is required; 15. Stresses that broadcasters are essential actors in the defence of pluralistic and democratic principles and strongly believes that that the opportunities offered by the digital dividend will enable public and private broadcasters to provide a much larger number of programmes serving general interest objectives \u2014 set out in national legislation \u2014 such as the promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity; 16. Believes that the digital dividend should provide an opportunity for broadcasters to develop and expand their services and at the same time to take into account other potential social, cultural and economic applications, such as new and open broadband technologies and access services designed to overcome the digital divide, while not allowing interoperability barriers; 17. Underlines the potential benefits of a coordinated approach to the usage of spectrum in the European Union in terms of economies of scale, the development of interoperable wireless services, and avoiding fragmentation which leads to a suboptimal use of this scarce resource; considers that, while closer coor\u00ad dination and greater flexibility are necessary for efficient exploitation of spectrum, the Commission and the Member States need to strike an appropriate balance between flexibility and the degree of harmonisation, with a view to deriving maximum benefit from the digital dividend; EN C 8 E/62 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "18. Observes that efficient allocation of the digital dividend may be achieved without hampering any of the players that currently hold spectrum licences in the ultra-high frequency (UHF) band, and that the continuation and expansion of current broadcasting services can be effectively achieved, at the same time ensuring that new mobile multimedia and broadband wireless access technologies are allocated substantial spectrum resources in the UHF band to bring new interactive services to citizens of the Union; 19. Considers that where auctions are used to allocate frequencies, Member States should adopt a common approach as regards the conditions and methods of auction and the allocation of the generated resources; calls on the Commission to present guidelines along these lines; 20. Stresses that the main guiding principle in the allocation of the digital dividend should be to serve the general interest by ensuring the best social, cultural and economic value in terms of an enhanced and geographically wider offer of services and digital content to citizens, and not only to maximise public revenues, while also protecting the rights of current users of audiovisual media services and reflecting cultural and linguistic diversity; 21. Emphasises that the digital dividend provides a unique opportunity for the European Union to develop its role as a world leader in mobile multimedia technologies and at the same time to bridge the digital divide with an increased flow of information, knowledge and services connecting all citizens of the Union with each other and providing new opportunities for media, culture and diversity in all areas of the territory of the European Union; 22. Emphasises that a way in which the digital dividend could help to achieve the Lisbon goals is by increasing the availability of broadband access services to citizens and economic players throughout the European Union, addressing the digital divide by providing benefits in underprivileged, remote or rural areas and ensuring universal coverage in the Member States; 23. Deplores the uneven access of citizens of the Union to digital services, particularly in broadcasting; notes that rural and peripheral regions are especially disadvantaged (in terms of promptness, choice and quality) with regard to the roll-out of digital services; urges Member States and regional authorities to do everything in their power to ensure that the digital switchover is conducted quickly and fairly for all their citizens; 24. Stresses that the digital divide is not just a rural issue; highlights the difficulty in fitting some older high-rise buildings with the infrastructure for new networks; emphasises the benefit that spectrum can play in overcoming the digital divide in both urban and rural areas; 25. Emphasises the contribution that the digital dividend can make to the provision of enhanced inter \u00ad operable social services, such as e-government, e-health, e-vocational training and e-education to citizens, in particular those living in less favoured or isolated areas, such as rural and less developed areas and islands; 26. Urges the Member States to step up measures to enable disabled and elderly users and those with special social needs to make the most of the benefits provided by the digital dividend; 27. Confirms the societal value of public safety services and the need to include support for their operational requirements in the spectrum arrangements arising from the reorganisation of the UHF band resulting from the switch-off of analogue services; 28. Emphasises that the main priority of the policy on reaping the full benefits of the digital dividend in Europe is to ensure that consumers enjoy a very broad range of high quality services, while their rights are fully respected, taking account of the need to make effective use of the spectrum released by the digital switchover; EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/63 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "29. Stresses that the digital dividend provides new opportunities for audiovisual and media policy objectives; is therefore convinced that decisions on digital dividend management should promote and protect general interest objectives linked to audiovisual and media policies such as freedom of expression, media pluralism, cultural and linguistic diversity and the rights of minors; 30. Encourages Member States to recognise the social, cultural and economic value of allowing unlicensed users access to the dividend, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises and the not- for-profit sector, and thus increasing the efficiency of spectrum use by concentrating such unlicensed uses in the currently unused frequencies (white spaces); 31. Calls for a step-by-step approach in this field; is of the opinion that effects for smaller networks \u2014 especially local wireless networks \u2014 for which no licence requirements currently apply must be taken into account and that universal access to broadband, especially in rural areas, should be promoted; 32. Calls on Member States to support enhanced cooperation measures between spectrum management authorities to consider areas where unlicensed white space spectrum allocation would allow new tech\u00ad nologies and services to emerge so as to foster innovation; 33. Encourages Member States to consider, in the context of allocating white space, the need for unlicensed open access to spectrum for non-commercial and educational service providers and local communities with a public service mission; 34. Stresses that one of the key elements when seeking to provide access to the digital dividend to unlicensed users is the need to take account of the needs of social groups threatened with exclusion, particularly disabled and elderly users and users with special social needs; 35. Recognises the benefit of new technologies, such as WiFi and Bluetooth, that have emerged in the unlicensed 2,4 GHz band; recognises that particular frequencies are best suited to particular services; believes that allocating a small amount of unlicensed spectrum in other lower frequencies could encourage yet more innovation in new services; 36. Emphasises, therefore, that frequencies should be assigned in a transparent manner, taking into account all the potential uses for the new spectrum and their benefits to society; 37. Encourages the Member States to assess in detail the social and economic value of any spectrum freed up in the years to come by the switchover from analogue to digital broadcast; 38. Recognises the importance of the ITU Geneva-06 Agreement (Regional Radio Communication Conference 2006) and of the national frequency allocation plans as well as of the decisions of the World Radio Communication Conference 2007 (WRC-07) to the reorganisation of the UHF band; 39. Calls on the Member States to develop, following a common methodology, national digital dividend strategies by the end of 2009; urges the Commission to assist Member States in the development of their national digital dividend strategies and to promote best practice at EU level; 40. Emphasises that the immediacy of switchover in some Member States and the differences in national switchover plans require a response at Community level that cannot await the entry into force of the amending directives; 41. Acknowledges the right of Member States to determine their use of the digital dividend, but also affirms that a coordinated approach at Community level greatly enhances the value of the dividend and is the most efficient way to avoid harmful interference between Member States and between Member States and third countries; EN C 8 E/64 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "42. Reiterates that, in the interest of citizens of the Union, the digital dividend should be managed as efficiently and effectively as possible in order to avoid interference with the delivery of high quality digital TV programmes to an increasing number of citizens and to respect consumers\u2019 rights and interests and their investment in equipment; 43. Emphasises that Member States may consider technology-neutral auctions for the purpose of allo\u00ad cating frequencies that are liberated because of the digital dividend and making those frequencies tradable; considers, however, that this procedure should be in full compliance with ITU radio regulations, national frequency planning and national policy objectives in order to avoid harmful interference between services provided; warns of spectrum fragmentation which leads to the suboptimal use of scarce resources; calls on the Commission to ensure that a future coordinated spectrum plan will not create new barriers to future innovation; 44. Supports a common, balanced approach to the use of digital dividend, allowing both broadcasters to continue offering and expanding their services and electronic communications operators to use this resource to deploy new services addressing other important social and economic uses, but stresses that in any event the digital dividend should be allocated on a technology-neutral basis; 45. Stresses that spectrum policy must be dynamic and must enable broadcasters and communications operators to employ new technologies and develop new services, allowing them to continue to play a key role in achieving the objectives of cultural and media policy, while also providing new high-quality communications services; 46. Stresses the potential benefits in terms of economies of scale, innovation, interoperability and the provision of potential pan-European services of more coherent and integrated spectrum planning at Community level; encourages Member States to work together and with the Commission to identify common spectrum sub-bands of the digital dividend for different application clusters that could be harmonised on a technology-neutral basis; 47. Believes that clustering within the UHF band should be based on a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach according to the specifics of the national markets while ensuring that harmonisation at Community level takes places wherever this creates a clear added value; 48. In order to achieve a more efficient use of spectrum and to facilitate the emergence of innovative and successful national, cross-border and pan-European services, supports a coordinated approach at Community level, based on different clusters of the UHF spectrum for uni-directional and bi-directional services, taking into account the potential for harmful interference arising from the co-existence of different types of networks in the same band, the outcomes of the ITU Geneva RRC 06 and WRC 07 and the existing authorisations; 49. Considers that the part of the harmonised spectrum at Community level dedicated to emergency services should be capable of providing access to future broadband technologies for the retrieval and transmission of information needed for the protection of human life through a more efficient response on the part of the emergency services; 50. Urges the Commission to undertake, in cooperation with the Member States, the appropriate technical, socio-economic and cost-benefit studies to determine the size and characteristics of the sub- bands that could be coordinated or harmonised at Community level; recalls that such studies should take into account that the dividend is not static, but that technological development is ongoing and implementation of new technologies should allow the usage of the UHF band for new types of innovative social, cultural and economic services beyond broadcasting and wireless broadband; calls on the Commission to ensure that Member States contribute to such studies in order to identify common bands to be harmonised at European level for clearly defined and interoperable pan-European services, as well as for the allocation of these bands; EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/65 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",

Calls on the Commission to conduct a study on conflicts between users of open source software and certification authorities concerning software defined radios; 53. Calls on the Commission to propose steps to reduce legal liabilities in the context of wireless mesh network provision; 54. Calls on the Commission to submit, as soon as the abovementioned studies have been completed, and having consulted both the Radio Spectrum Policy Group and the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations, and taking due account of national specificities, a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council for better coordination measures at Community level on the use of the digital dividend, in accordance with internationally agreed frequency plans; 55.

Welcomes the conclusion of the ITTA, 2006 given that failure to reach agreement would have sent a damaging signal about the international community's commitment to promoting the protection and sustainable use of tropical forests; considers, nevertheless, that the outcome falls well short of what is required to address the loss of these forests; Need for more joined-up policies 2. Calls on the Commission and Member States to significantly increase the financial resources available to enhance the conservation and ecologically responsible use of tropical forests, to support actions aimed at strengthening environmental governance and capacity-building and to promote economically viable alter\u00ad natives to destructive logging, mining and agricultural practices; 3. Believes it is equally important to enhance the capacity of national parliaments and civil society, including local communities and indigenous people, to participate in decision-making regarding the conser\u00ad vation, use and management of natural resources, and to demarcate and defend their land rights; 4. Considers that public procurement policies should require timber and timber products to be derived from legal and sustainable sources so as to encourage public authorities\u2019 practical commitment to good governance in forestry and to combat corruption; 5. Insists that the Commission and Member States should also work to ensure that Export Credit Agencies, the Cotonou Investment Facility and other International Lending Institutions which fund projects with EU public money use the principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent before financially supporting any projects in forest areas and that environmental and social impact assessments and screening procedures for these projects are carried out to ensure that they do not encourage deforestation, forest degradation or illegal logging activity; 6. Regards labelling initiatives which enable consumers to be confident that the timber they are buying is not merely legal but originates from sustainably-managed forests as potentially usefully supplements to international agreements, provided the label is underpinned by independent verification; 7. Is concerned that voluntary agreements will be insufficient to verify that timber products placed on the EU market are from legal and sustainable sources and therefore believes that the European Union should begin to adopt legally binding standards internally accompanied by instruments for sanctioning non- compliance; 8. Emphasises that strict sustainability criteria, which take account of both direct and indirect environ\u00ad mental and social impacts, need to be applied to imports of agrofuels and biomass if the climatic benefits of replacing fossil fuels are not to be vastly outweighed by increased CO 2 emissions arising from deforestation; EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/67 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",

Regards the proposed trade agreement with the countries of South East Asia to be of particular importance in this respect and considers that any agreement must contain a meaningful sustainable devel\u00ad opment chapter which addresses the issues of forest preservation and the fight against illegal and unsus\u00ad tainable logging; Features of a stronger, more effective agreement 11. Considers that an effective agreement on tropical timber should have, as its primary objectives, the need to ensure the protection and sustainable management of tropical forests and the restoration of forest areas that have been degraded and that trade in tropical timber should only be encouraged to the extent that it is compatible with those prior objectives; 12. Invites the Commission to develop appropriate financing mechanisms for countries that decide to give priority to the longer-term objective of promoting sustainable forests rather than maximising short- term income and to investigate the possibility of reorganising the International Tropical Timber Organi\u00ad sation (ITTO) voting system so as to reward timber-producing countries that give priority to the conser\u00ad vation and sustainable use of forest resources; 13. Believes that a future agreement should ensure that parliamentarians and civil society are involved in policy formulation and that there are provisions for independent audits of the sustainability of members\u2019 forestry management policies and their impact on indigenous people; Conclusions 14. Considers that the agreement requires the assent of Parliament under Article 300(3), second subparagraph, of the EC Treaty and believes that the Council and Commission should welcome the enhanced legitimacy and public acceptability that would result from greater parliamentary involvement; 15. Asks the Commission to provide annual reports on the implementation of the ITTA, 2006 as well as on measures to minimise the negative impacts from trade on tropical forests, including the consequences of Free Trade Agreements and bilateral agreements under the FLEGT programme; 16.

Recognises that India provides a model for handling cultural and religious pluralism, despite inter\u00ad mittent and local difficulties among religions, including those between Hindus and Christians; expresses, however, deep concern at the current situation of Christian minorities, and regrets the impact that the anti- conversion laws that have spread among several Indian states may have on freedom of religion; 25.

Stresses that community media are an effective means of strengthening cultural and linguistic diversity, social inclusion and local identity, which explains the diversity of the sector; 2. Points out that community media help to strengthen the identities of specific interest groups, while at the same time enabling members of those groups to engage with other groups in society, and therefore play an important role in fostering tolerance and pluralism in society and contribute to intercultural dialogue; 3. Stresses also that community media promote intercultural dialogue by educating the general public, combating negative stereotypes and correcting the ideas put forward by the mass media regarding commu\u00ad nities within society threatened with exclusion, such as refugees, migrants, Roma and other ethnic and religious minorities; stresses that community media are one of the existing means of facilitating the inte\u00ad gration of immigrants and also enabling disadvantaged members of society to become active participants by engaging in debates that are important to them; 4.

Welcomes the fact that community media can make citizens more aware of existing public services and can help to foster civil participation in public discourse; 10. Considers that community media may serve as an effective means of bringing the Union closer to its citizens by addressing specially targeted audiences; and recommends also that the Member States collaborate more actively with community media in order to enter into a closer dialogue with citizens; 11. Points out that good quality community media are essential in order for the sector to fulfil its potential and stresses the fact that without proper financial resources there cannot be such quality; notes that the financial resources of community media vary greatly but are in general rather scarce, and acknowledges that additional funding and digital adaptation would enable the community media sector to extend its innovative profile and to provide new and vital services that bring added value to the existing analogue services; 12.

Calls on Member States to support community media more actively in order to ensure media pluralism, provided that such support is not to the detriment of public media; 18. Stresses the role that may be played by local, regional and national authorities in supporting and promoting community media by providing suitable infrastructure, together with support within the context of programmes encouraging exchanges of best practice, such as the Community \u2018Regions for Economic Change\u2019 (formerly Interreg) programme; EN C 8 E/78 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Thursday 25 September 2008 ",

Calls on Member States to make television and radio frequency spectrum available, both analogue and digital, bearing in mind that the service provided by community media is not to be assessed in terms of opportunity cost or justification of the cost of spectrum allocation but rather in the social value it represents; 20. Acknowledges that on the one hand only a small portion of the sector has the knowledge and experience to apply for and benefit from EU support, while on the other hand funding officers are not aware of community media's potential; 21. Recognises that the sector could make more use of Community funding schemes in so far as they contribute to the objectives of community media, through the implementation of a number of specific programmes, such as those of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund as well as the opportunities for educating and training journalists through the Lifelong Learning Programmes and others; stresses, however, that funding must come principally from national, local and other sources; 22.

        "C. whereas the comments made both at the preparatory meeting of 26 November 2007 with the national parliaments and during the most recent debate in plenary on 31 January 2008 underlined the importance of laying thorough groundwork for the transition to the new legal framework that will result from the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, signed on 13 December 2007, which will amend the EU Treaty and establish a Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), D. whereas, however, the establishment of a genuine AFSJ is far from having been completed and still faces major difficulties and obstacles, as confirmed in the Communication from the Commission of 2 July 2008 entitled \u2018Report on Implementation of the Hague Programme for 2007\u2019 (COM(2008)0373), E. whereas, as that Report stresses and notwithstanding the adoption of a number of major measures, the programme established by the Hague European Council in 2004 is seriously behind schedule and, in particular, \u2014 there is still a serious lack of mutual trust and, above all, solidarity between Member States, especially as regards policies on legal and illegal immigration and police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, \u2014 these problems also affect the phase of transposition of the few measures adopted since \u2018an insuf\u00ad ficient level of achievement was evident in the following areas: Visa Policy, Sharing of Information among Law Enforcement and Judicial Authorities, Prevention of and the Fight against Organised Crime, Management of Crises within the European Union, Police and Customs Cooperation and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters\u2019, F. whereas the Member States themselves mention these problems in the context of their preparatory work for the future AFSJ programme for the period 2010-2014, recognising that the acquis in the field of Home Affairs, which was developed step by step, is necessarily unstructured and therefore difficult to explain to citizens of the Union; whereas it is sometimes hard even for specialists to understand and some of the instruments overlap and the legal basis for some actions can be found in different acts; whereas, finally, it is becoming increasingly difficult and time-consuming to monitor the proper imple\u00ad mentation of EC directives by as many as 27 Member States, G. whereas Parliament is convinced, however, like the Council, that the Union has no other choice but to insist on implementing the AFSJ, which touches the core of the national constitutional orders, and that Member States have a special interest in maintaining a dialogue with each other as much as with the European institutions, H. whereas, in this transitional phase pending the conclusion of the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, it is necessary to adopt before the end of 2009 certain general measures which, while drawing their inspi\u00ad ration from the Treaty of Lisbon, could still be adopted under the existing Treaties in full compliance with Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and which could reduce the adverse effects of the problems mentioned above; whereas these would include measures to: \u2014 take account of the institutions\u2019 procedures, structures and decisions, and of the principles and objectives set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, proclaimed in Strasbourg on 12 December 2007 ( 1 ), \u2014 promote decision-making transparency at Union and national level, in particular in connection with the AFSJ, in accordance with the recent judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Commu\u00ad nities (ECJ) on legislative transparency (Turco case ( 2 )), \u2014 effectively involve national parliaments in the establishment and implementation of the AFSJ, including as regards assessment of these policies in the other Member States and by European Union agencies, EN C 8 E/80 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 ( 1 ) OJ C 303, 14.12.2007, p. 1.

Firmly believes that a pluralistic media system is an essential requirement for the continued existence of the democratic European social model; 3. Notes that the European media landscape is subject to continuing convergence, as regards both the media and markets; 4. Highlights that the concentration of ownership of the media system creates an environment favouring the monopolisation of the advertising market, introduces barriers to the entry of new market players and also leads to uniformity of media content; 5. Points out that the development of the media system is increasingly driven by profit-making and that, therefore, societal, political or economic processes, or values expressed in journalists\u2019 codes of conduct, are not adequately safeguarded; considers, therefore, that competition law must be interlinked with media law, in order to guarantee access, competition and quality and avoid conflicts of interests between media ownership concentration and political power, which are detrimental to free competition, a level playing field and pluralism; 6. Reminds the Member States that a balance must always be sought, in the decisions of the national regulatory authorities, between their duties and freedom of expression, the protection of which is ultimately the responsibility of the courts; 7. Calls on the Commission to commit itself to promoting a stable legal framework with a guaranteed high standard of protection of pluralism in all the Member States; 8. Calls, therefore, both for a balance between public and private broadcasters \u2014 in those Member States where public broadcasters presently exist \u2014 and for the interlinking of competition and media law to be guaranteed in order to strengthen the plurality of the media; EN C 8 E/90 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Thursday 25 September 2008 ",

Highlights the growing influence of third-country media investors in the EU, especially in the new Member States; 12. Calls for the consistent application of competition legislation at EU and national level in order to ensure a high level of competition and to enable new competitors to enter the market; 13. Takes the view that EU competition law has helped to restrict media concentration; nevertheless stresses the importance of independent, Member State supervision of the media and urges, to that end, that media regulation at a national level be effective, clear, transparent and of a high standard; 14. Welcomes the Commission's intention to develop specific indicators to evaluate media pluralism; 15. Calls for further indicators, in addition to media pluralism, to be drawn up as criteria for analysing the media, including its orientation as regards democracy, the rule of law, human and minority rights and professional codes of conduct for journalists; 16.

Stresses the need to institute monitoring and implementation systems for media pluralism based on reliable and impartial indicators; 22. Stresses the need for the EU and Member State authorities to ensure journalistic and editorial independence by appropriate and specific legal and social guarantees, and points out the importance of the creation and uniform application of editorial charters in Member States, and all markets where EU-based media companies operate, to prevent owners, shareholders, or outside bodies such as governments, from interfering with news content; 23.

Supports the protection of copyrights at the level of online media, with third parties having to mention the source when taking over declarations; 27. Recommends the inclusion of media literacy among the European key competences and supports the development of the European core curriculum for media literacy while underlining their role in overcoming any form of digital divide; 28. Maintains that the purpose of media education must be, as is laid down in the abovementioned Recommendation Rec 1466(2000), to provide citizens with the means of bringing critical interpretation to bear on, and utilising, the ever growing volume of information being imparted to them; considers that this learning process will thus enable citizens to formulate messages and select the most appropriate media for communicating them, and hence to exercise their rights to the full where freedom of information and expression is concerned; 29. Urges the Commission, in adopting a European approach to media literacy, to pay sufficient attention to standards of critical content assessment and exchanges of best practice in this connection; 30. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to consolidate an objective framework for granting broadcasting licences in the areas of cable and satellite TV and analogue and digital broadcasting markets, on the basis of transparent and fair criteria, in order to establish a system of pluralist competition and prevent abuses by companies enjoying monopolies or dominant positions; 31. Reminds the Commission that on several occasions, it has been asked to draw up a directive that would aim to ensure pluralism, encourage and preserve cultural diversity as defined in the Unesco Convention on cultural diversity, as well as to safeguard access for all media companies to the technical elements that can enable them to reach the public in its entirety; 32. Calls on the Member States to support high-quality public broadcasting services which can offer a real alternative to the programmes of commercial channels and can, without necessarily having to compete for ratings or advertising revenue, occupy a more high-profile place on the European scene as pillars of the preservation of media pluralism, democratic dialogue and access to quality content for all citizens; 33. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to support greater cooperation between European regulatory authorities and to intensify the formal and informal discussions and exchanges of views between regulatory authorities in the broadcasting field; 34. Recommends that, where appropriate, public service media in the Member States reflect the multi\u00ad cultural nature of regions; 35. Encourages the disclosure of ownership of all media outlets to help achieve greater transparency regarding the aims and background of the broadcaster and publisher; 36.

Asks the Commission, when making a decision about the necessity of a revision of the abovemen\u00ad tioned Commission Communication of 2001, to take due account of the Unesco Convention on cultural diversity and the abovementioned Recommendation Rec(2007)3; in the event that the Commission decides to revise the existing guidelines, asks that any measure or clarification proposed is assessed as far as its impact on media pluralism is concerned and duly respects Member States\u2019 competences; 39.

Considers that, in order to enable the public audiovisual media to fulfil their task in the era of digital technology, it is necessary for them to develop new information services and media over and above traditional programmes and to be able to interact with every digital network and platform; 41. Welcomes the implementation in certain Member States of provisions requiring cable television providers to include state-run channels and to allocate a section of the digital spectrum to public providers; 42. Urges the Commission to apply a broad understanding of the remit of public service broadcasters in line with a dynamic and future-proof interpretation of the Amsterdam Treaty protocol, in particular with regard to an unconstrained participation of public service broadcasting in technological developments and deriving forms of content production and presentation (in the form of both linear and non-linear services); whereas this should also include adequate funding for new services as part of the public service broadcasting remit; 43. Reiterates that the regulation of spectrum use must take account of public interest objectives such as media pluralism and thus cannot be subjected to a purely market based regime; considers in addition that Member States should remain responsible for deciding on frequency allocation to serve the specific needs of their societies in particular with respect to safeguarding and promoting media pluralism; 44. Recommends during the revision of the Telecom Package to retain and, where necessary, to extend must-carry rules; 45. Agrees with the abovementioned Recommendation Rec(2007)2 that fair access by content providers to electronic communication networks should be ensured; 46. Draws attention to its abovementioned resolution of 13 November 2007, as interoperability is of fundamental importance for media pluralism; 47. Calls for a balanced approach to the allocation of the digital dividend to ensure equitable access for all players, thereby safeguarding media pluralism; 48.

Emphasises, that unless there is a global concerted shift in energy policy and consumption, the energy demand will continue to grow in the coming decades; expresses its concern at the increase in energy prices, notably because of its negative effect on the world economy and consumers, which is also hampering the attainment of the Lisbon Strategy objectives; 2. Underlines the necessity to take measures that will enable the EU economy to maintain its competi\u00ad tiveness and to adapt to the new energy price environment; 3. Calls for strong political commitment to take concrete measures towards cutting energy demand, to promote renewables and energy efficiency, and to pursue diversification of energy supply and reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels; considers this shift to be the most appropriate response to higher energy prices, to increase stability in the energy markets, to deliver long-term cost benefits to consumers and to meet the objectives of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its related Kyoto Protocol; endorses the need for those strategic measures necessarily to be followed up by commensurate financial resources in R&D; 4. Considers that short-term and targeted measures should be taken by Member States to alleviate the negative impact on the poorest households; highlights the fact, however, that measures inducing more inflation should be avoided as they can be a detriment to public finance sustainability and neutralised by higher prices of oil; 5. Reiterates its first-reading position of 18 June 2008 on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/54/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity ( 1 ) and of 9 July 2008 on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/55/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas ( 2 ); considers that the Commission should bring forward a communication on tackling energy poverty in the European Union; calls on Member States to provide national definitions of energy poverty and to develop national action plans to eradicate energy poverty; calls on the Commission to monitor and coor\u00ad dinate the data provided by Member States, in addition to ensuring that universal and public service obligations are respected; 6.

Stresses that the present state of scientific knowledge shows us that an excessive consumption of trans-fatty acids (over 2 % of total energy intake) is linked to significantly higher cardiovascular risks; deeply regrets, therefore, that only a few European governments to date have acted to reduce European consumers\u2019 cumulative exposure to the artificial trans-fatty acids and saturated fatty acids that are present in numerous processed products of low nutritional value; 34. Underlines the fact that industrially processed trans-fatty acids pose a serious, well documented and unnecessary threat to the health of Europeans and should be addressed with an appropriate legislative initiative seeking to eliminate effectively industrially processed trans-fatty acids from food products; 35. Calls for an analysis of the role played by artificial flavour enhancers such as glutamates, guanylates and inosinates, particularly in ready meals and industrially produced foodstuffs, in order to determine their influence on consumption patterns; 36. Calls on industry to review single-serving portion sizes, providing a broader range of smaller portion options; 37.

Calls on all operators in the media sector, in cooperation with the Member States and sports organisations, to create additional incentives for more physical exercise and taking up a sport in all media; 40. Is aware of the importance of the media in informing, educating and persuading in relation to promoting a healthy and balanced diet as well as their role in the creation of stereotypes and body image; considers the voluntary approach adopted in the Audiovisual Media Services Directive ( 1 ) on the advertising of food of poor nutritional value directed at children to be a step in the right direction, to be specifically monitored, and asks the Commission to bring forward stricter proposals if the 2011 review of the Directive declares the voluntary approach to have failed in this field; calls on Member States and the Commission to encourage media service providers to develop codes of conduct regarding inappropriate audiovisual commercial communication relating to food and beverage products and urges operators to come forward with concrete actions at national level to implement or to strengthen this directive; 41. Calls for the industry to exercise particular care when advertising food products specifically targeted at children; asks for protected times and for restrictions on commercials for unhealthy food specifically targeted at children; any such restrictions should also cover new forms of media such as online games, pop- ups and text messaging; Health care and research 42. Acknowledges that health professionals, especially paediatricians and pharmacists, should be made aware of their essential role in the early identification of patients at risk of overweight and cardiovascular disease and considers that they should be major actors in the fight against the obesity epidemic and non- communicable diseases; calls, therefore, on the Commission to develop European anthropometric indicators and guidelines on cardiometabolic risk factors associated with obesity; emphasises the importance of carrying out systematic routine measurements in association with screening for other cardiometabolic risk factors, in order to evaluate overweight/obesity co-morbidities at primary care level; 43. Draws attention to the problem of malnutrition, a state in which a deficiency, excess or imbalance in the diet has a measurable adverse impact on tissue, body shape and body function; notes also that malnu\u00ad trition is a heavy burden both for individual wellbeing and for society, particularly the health care system, and that it results in increased mortality, longer hospital stays, greater complications and reduced quality of life for patients; recalls that extra days in hospital and treatment of complications due to malnutrition cost billions of euros in public funding every year; 44. Highlights estimates that show that 40 % of patients in hospitals and between 40 and 80 % of people in elderly care homes are malnourished; calls on Member States to improve the quantity and quality of food in hospitals and elderly care homes which will lead to a reduction in the time spent in hospitals; 45. Is convinced of the need for full regulation of the qualification of medical professionals as \u2018clinical dieticians\u2019 as well as \u2018nutritionists\u2019; 46. Calls on the Commission to promote best medical practices, for example through the EU Health Forum, as well as information campaigns on obesity-related risks and abdominal obesity in particular drawing attention to the cardiovascular risks; urges the Commission to provide information about the dangers of \u2018home diets\u2019, especially if they involve the use of anti-obesity drugs taken without medical prescription; calls on the Commission to devote greater attention to the problems of malnutrition, inad\u00ad equate nutrition and dehydration; EN C 8 E/104 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 ( 1 ) Directive 2007/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2007 (OJ L 332, 18.12.2007, p. 27).

Recalls that in the light of the territorial nature of copyright and despite the existence of Directive 2001/29/EC, the situation in the field of collective management of copyright and related rights for online services is genuinely complex, owing mainly to the lack of European licenses; 2. Considers that, owing to the refusal to legislate \u2014 despite various European Parliament resolutions \u2014 and the decision to try to regulate the sector through a recommendation, a climate of legal uncertainty has been created for right-holders and for users, especially broadcasters; 3. Emphasises that, on the other hand, following a complaint from users, the Commission's Directorate- General for Competition intervened by instituting a procedure against CISAC (International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers), which includes 24 European collecting societies amongst its members; points out that the effect of the decision taken in this regard will be to preclude all attempts by the parties concerned to act together in order to find appropriate solutions \u2014 such as, for instance, a system for the clearing of rights at the European level \u2014 and to leave the way open to an oligopoly of a number of large collecting societies linked by exclusive agreements to publishers belonging to the worldwide repertoire; believes that the result will be a restriction of choice and the extinction of small collecting societies to the detriment of minority cultures; 4. Considers that the report presenting the results of the monitoring of the 2005 Recommendation does not reflect accurately the existing situation and does not take account of the opinion given by Parliament in its resolution of 13 March 2007; 5. Considers that this situation reflects the fact that the Commission has chosen to ignore the warnings given by Parliament, in particular in its resolution of 13 March 2007, which includes concrete proposals for controlled competition, as well as protection and incentives for minority cultures within the European Union; 6.

        "P6_TC1-COD(2007)0233 Position of the European Parliament adopted at first reading on 23 September 2008 with a view to the adoption of Regulation (EC) No \u2026/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics relating to external trade with non-member countries and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1172/95 (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285 (1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having consulted the European Economic and Social Committee, Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank ( 1 ), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 2 ), Whereas: (1) The statistical information on Member States\u2019 trade flows with non-member countries is of essential importance for the Community\u2019s economic and trade policies and for analysing market developments for individual commodities. The transparency of the statistical system should be improved in order for it to be able to react to the changing administrative environment, and to satisfy new user requirements. Council Regulation (EC) No 1172/95 of 22 May 1995 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods by the Community and its Member States with non-member countries ( 3 ) should therefore be replaced by a new Regulation in conformity with the requirements set out in Article 285(2) of the Treaty. (2) External trade statistics are based on data obtained from customs declarations as provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code ( 4 ), hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Customs Code\u2019. Progress in European integration and the resulting changes in customs clearance, including single authorisations for the use of the simplified declaration or the local clearance procedure, as well as centralised clearance, which will emanate from the current process of modernisation of the Customs Code, make it necessary to adjust the way external trade statistics are compiled, to reconsider the concept of the importing or exporting Member State, and to define more precisely the data source for compiling Community statistics. (3) In order to record the physical trade flow of goods between Member States and non-member countries and to ensure that data on imports and exports is available in the Member State concerned, arrangements between Customs and statistical authorities are necessary and have to be specified. This includes rules on the exchange of data between Member States\u2019 administrations. (4) In order to allocate EU exports and imports to a given Member State, it is necessary to compile data on the \u2018Member State of final destination\u2019, for imports, and the \u2018Member State of actual export\u2019, for exports. In the medium term, those Member States should become the importing and the exporting Member State for external trade statistics purposes.

        "(5) For the purpose of this Regulation commodities for external trade purposes should be classified in accordance with the \u2018Combined Nomenclature\u2019 established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff ( 5 ), hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Combined Nomenclature\u2019. (6) To meet the European Central Bank\u2019s and the Commission\u2019s need for information on the share of the euro in international merchandise trade, the invoicing currency of exports and imports should be reported at an aggregated level. (7) For the purposes of trade negotiations and internal market management, the Commission should be provided with detailed information on the tariff treatment of goods imported into the European Union, including information on quotas. (8) External trade statistics provide data for the compilation of balance of payments and national accounts. The characteristics which make it possible to adapt them to Balance of Payments purposes should become part of the mandatory and standard data set. (9) Member States\u2019 statistics on customs warehouses and free zones are not subject to harmonised provisions. However, the compilation of these statistics for national purposes remains optional. (10) Member States should provide Eurostat with annual aggregated data on trade broken down by business characteristics, one of the uses of which is to facilitate analysis of how European companies operate in the context of globalisation. The link between business and trade statistics is established by merging data on the importer and the exporter available on the customs declaration with data requested by Regulation (EC) No 177/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 establishing a common framework for business registers for statistical purposes ( 6 ), hereinafter referred to as \u2018Business Register legislation\u2019. (11) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics ( 7 ) provides a reference framework for the provisions laid down in this Regulation. However, the very detailed level of information on trade in goods requires specific confidentiality rules if these statistics are to be relevant. (12) The transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality is governed by the rules set out in Regulation (EC) No 322/97 and in Council Regulation (Euratom, EEC) No 1588/90 of 11 June 1990 on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical Office of the European Communities ( 8 ). Measures which are taken in accordance with those Regulations ensure the physical and logical protection of confidential data and ensure that no unlawful disclosure and non-statistical use occurs when Community statistics are produced and disseminated. (13) In the production and dissemination of Community statistics under this Regulation, the national and Community statistical authorities should take account of the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice, which was adopted by the Statistical Programme Committee on 24 February 2005 and appended to the Commission Recommendation of 25 May 2005 on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities. (14) Specific provisions need to be formulated until such time as customs legislation changes yield addi\u00ad tional data on the customs declaration and until the electronic exchange of customs data is required by Community legislation.

        "(15) Since the objective of this Regulation cannot be achieved by the Member States and can be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is required to achieve this objective. (16) The measures necessary for implementing this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 ( 9 ) laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission. (17) In particular the Commission should be empowered to adapt the list of customs procedures or customs approved treatment or use which determine an export or import for external trade statistics; to adopt different or specific rules for goods or movements which, for methodological reasons, call for specific provisions; to adapt the list of goods and movements excluded from external trade statistics; to specify the data sources other than the customs declaration for records on the import and export of specific goods or movements; to specify the statistical data, including the codes to be used; to establish requirements for data related to specific goods or movements; to establish requirements on the compilation of statistics; to specify characteristics of samples; to establish the reporting period and the level of aggregation for partner countries, commodities and currencies as well as to adapt the deadline for transmitting statistics, content, coverage and revision conditions for statistics already transmitted; and to establish the deadline for transmitting statistics on detail trade by business characteristics and statistics on trade broken down by invoicing currency. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Subject matter This Regulation establishes a common framework for the systematic production of Community statistics relating to trade in goods with non-member countries (external trade statistics).

        "1. Approves the common position as amended; 2. Instructs its President to forward its position to the Council and Commission. P6_TC2-COD(2005)0239 Position of the European Parliament adopted at second reading on 24 September 2008 with a view to the adoption of Directive 2008/\u2026/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2002/59/EC establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 2 ), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 3 ), Whereas: (1) With the adoption of Directive 2002/59/EC ( 4 ), the European Union reinforced its capacity for preventing situations posing a threat to the safety of human life at sea and to the protection of the marine environment. (2) Since this Directive concerns the amendment of Directive 2002/59/EC, most of the obligations it contains will not be applicable to Member States without sea shores and sea ports. Consequently, the only obligations which will be applicable to Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg or Slovakia are those obligations concerning ships flying the flag of those Member States, without prejudice to Member States\u2019 duty of cooperation to ensure continuity between maritime and other modal traffic management services, in particular river information services. (3) Under this Directive Member States that are coastal States should be able to exchange information, which they gather in the course of maritime traffic monitoring missions, which they carry out in their areas of competence. The Community maritime information exchange system SafeSeaNet ( \u2551 \u2018Safe\u00ad SeaNet\u2019), developed by the Commission in agreement with the Member States, comprises, on the one hand, a data exchange network and, on the other hand, a standardisation of the main information available on ships and their cargo (advance notice and reporting). It thus makes it possible to locate at source and communicate to any authority accurate and up-to-date information on ships in European waters, their movements and their dangerous or polluting cargoes, as well as marine incidents. EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/153 ( 1 ) OJ C 318, 23.12.2006, p. 195. ( 2 ) OJ C 229, 22.9.2006, p. 38.

( 4 ) OJ L 208, 5.8.2002, p. 10. Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(4) Accordingly, in order to guarantee operational use of the information gathered in this way, it is essential that the infrastructure necessary for the data collection and exchange referred to in this Directive and implemented by the national administrations be integrated into the SafeSeaNet. (5) Of the information notified and exchanged pursuant to Directive 2002/59/EC, that concerning the precise characteristics of dangerous or polluting goods carried by sea is particularly important. Accordingly, and in the light of recent maritime accidents, coastal authorities should be allowed easier access to the characteristics of the hydrocarbons being carried by sea, an essential factor in choosing the most suitable control techniques, and, in an emergency, provided with a direct link with those operators who have the best knowledge of the goods being carried. (6) The automatic ship identification systems (AIS \u2014 Automatic Identification System) referred to in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1 November 1974 (the \u2018SOLAS Convention\u2019) make it possible not only to improve the possibilities of monitoring these ships but above all to make them safer in close navigation situations. AIS have accordingly been integrated into the enacting terms of Directive 2002/59/EC. Considering the large number of collisions involving fishing vessels that have clearly not been seen by merchant ships or which have not seen the merchant ships around them, extension of that measure to include fishing vessels with a length of more than 15 metres is very much to be desired. In the framework of the European Fisheries Fund, financial assistance may be provided for the fitting on board of fishing vessels of safety equipment such as AIS. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has recognised that the publication for commercial purposes on the Internet or elsewhere of AIS data transmitted by ships could be detrimental to the safety and security of ships and port facilities, and has urged its member governments, subject to the provisions of their national laws, to discourage those who make AIS data available to others for publication on the Internet or elsewhere from doing so. In addition, the availability of AIS information on ships\u2019 routes and cargoes should not be detrimental to fair competition between actors in the shipping industry. (7) The obligation to fit AIS should be understood also to require that AIS be maintained in operation at all times except where international rules or standards provide for the protection of navigational information. (8) From surveys carried out on behalf of the Commission, it clearly emerges that it is neither useful nor feasible to incorporate AIS in the positioning and communications systems used for the purposes of the common fisheries policy. (9) Under Directive 2002/59/EC, a Member State which so requests is entitled to seek information from another Member State regarding a ship and the hazardous or pollutant cargo carried by it. It should be pointed out that this does not refer to systematic requests by one Member State to another, but rather means that such information can only be requested for reasons of maritime safety or security or the protection of the maritime environment. (10) Directive 2002/59/EC provides that Member States are to adopt special measures in respect of ships posing a potential hazard due to their behaviour or condition. It therefore seems desirable to add to the list of these ships those which do not have satisfactory insurance cover or financial guarantees or which have been reported by pilots or port authorities as having apparent anomalies which may prejudice their safe navigation or create a risk for the environment. (11) In accordance with Directive 2002/59/EC, it seems necessary, in relation to the risks posed by exceptionally bad weather, to take into account the potential danger to shipping from ice formation. Therefore, where a competent authority designated by a Member State considers, on the basis of an ice forecast provided by a qualified meteorological information service, that the sailing conditions are creating a serious threat to the safety of human life or a serious threat of pollution, it should so inform EN C 8 E/154 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "the masters of the ships present in its area of competence or intending to enter or leave the port or ports in the area concerned. The authority concerned should be able to take any appropriate steps to ensure the safety of human life at sea and to protect the environment. In accordance with Regulation 3.1 of Part A-1 of Chapter II-1 of the SOLAS Convention, Member States are responsible for ensuring that ships flying their flag are designed, constructed and maintained in compliance with the structural, mechanical and electrical requirements of classification societies recognised by their administrations. Therefore, Member States should establish requirements for navigation on ice filled waters in accordance with those of organisations recognised under Council Directive 94/57/EC of 22 November 1994 on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organizations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations ( 1 ) or equivalent national standards. Member States should be able to verify that the necessary documentation on board provides evidence that the ship complies with strength and power requirements commensurate with the ice situation in the area concerned. (12) Directive 2002/59/EC provides that Member States are to draw up plans to accommodate, if the situation so requires, ships in distress in their ports or in any other protected place in the best possible conditions, in order to limit the consequences of accidents at sea. However, taking into account the Guidelines on Places of Refuge for Ships in Need of Assistance annexed to Resolution A.949(23) of the International Maritime Organisation of 13 December 2003 ( \u2551 \u2018IMO Resolution A.949(23)\u2019), which were adopted subsequently to Directive 2002/59/EC and refer to ships in need of assistance \u2590 , rather than to ships in distress, that Directive should be amended accordingly. This Directive does not depart from the rules applicable to rescue operations, such as those laid down by the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue of 1979, where the safety of human life is at stake. That Convention hence continues to apply in full. (13) On the basis of IMO Resolution A.949(23) and following the work carried out jointly by the Commission, the European Maritime Safety Agency ( \u2551 the \u2018Agency\u2019) and the Member States, it is necessary to lay down the basic provisions that plans for accommodating ships in need of assistance should contain in order to ensure a harmonised and effective implementation of this measure and clarify the scope of obligations incumbent on the Member States. (14) IMO Resolution A.949(23) is to form the basis of any plans prepared by Member States in order to respond effectively to threats posed by ships in need of assistance. However, when assessing the risks associated with such threats, Member States may, in view of their special circumstances, take into consideration other factors, such as the use of sea water for the production of potable water as well as the generation of electricity. (15) In order to obtain the full cooperation and trust of ships\u2019 masters and crew, it is necessary to ensure that masters and crew from a ship in need of assistance can rely on good and fair treatment from the competent authorities of the Member State concerned. To that end, it is desirable that Member States, in accordance with their national legislation, apply the relevant provisions of the IMO guidelines on fair treatment of seafarers in the event of a maritime accident . (16) When a ship is in need of assistance, a decision may have to be taken as regards the accommodation of that ship in a place of refuge. This is particularly important in the event of a situation of distress at sea, that is to say a situation that could give rise to the loss of a vessel or an environmental or navigational hazard. In all such cases, it is necessary to be able to call on an independent authority in each Member State or region, depending on the internal structure of the Member State, with the necessary powers and expertise to take any necessary decisions and to assist the ship in need of assistance with a view to protecting human life and the environment and minimising economic loss. It is desirable that the competent authorities should be permanent in nature. In particular, the authority should be empowered to take an independent decision as regards the accommodation of a ship in need of assistance in a place of refuge. To this end, it should make a preliminary evaluation of the situation on the basis of the information contained in the relevant plan for accommodation of ships in a place of refuge. EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/155 ( 1 ) OJ L 319, 12.12.1994, p. 20. Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(17) Plans for accommodating ships in need of assistance should describe precisely the decision-making chain with regard to alerting and dealing with the situations in question. The authorities concerned and their remits should be clearly described, as should the means of communication between the parties involved. The applicable procedures should ensure that an appropriate decision can be taken quickly on the basis of specific maritime expertise in handling incidents where serious harmful consequences can be expected and adequate information available to the competent authority. (18) When drawing up the plans, Member States should gather information on potential places of refuge on the coast so as to allow the competent authority, in the event of an accident or incident at sea, to identify clearly and quickly the most suitable areas for accommodating ships in need of assistance. This relevant information should contain a description of certain characteristics of the sites under consideration and the equipment and installations available to make it easier to accommodate ships in need of assistance or deal with the consequences of an accident or pollution. (19) It is important for the list of competent authorities responsible for deciding whether to accommodate a ship in a place of refuge, and the list of authorities responsible for receiving and handling alerts, to be published appropriately. It may also prove useful for the parties involved in a maritime assistance operation, including assistance and towing companies, and the authorities of neighbouring Member States likely to be affected by an emergency at sea, to have access to relevant information. (20) The absence of financial guarantees or insurance does not exonerate a Member State from its obligation to assist a ship in need of assistance and to accommodate it in a place of refuge if by doing so it can reduce risks to the crew and the environment. Though the competent authorities may verify whether the ship is covered by insurance or some other financial guarantee permitting appropriate compensation for costs and damages associated with its accommodation in a place of refuge, the act of requesting this information must not delay the rescue operation. (21) Ports which accommodate a ship in need of assistance must be able to rely on prompt compensation in respect of costs and any damage associated with the operation. To that end, it is important that not only Directive 2008/\u2026/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026 [on the civil liability and financial guarantees of ship-owners] ( 1 ) and regulations of the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, but also the 1996 International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea, the 2001 International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, and the 2007 Wreck Removal Convention, be applied. Member States should therefore ratify those Conventions as soon as possible. In exceptional cases, Member States should ensure the compen\u00ad sation of costs and economic loss suffered by a port as a result of accommodating a ship in a place of refuge, particularly if such costs and economic loss are not covered by the financial guarantees of the ship-owners and other existing compensation mechanisms. (22) The specific function of the vessel traffic monitoring and ship\u2019s routing measures is to allow Member States to obtain a true knowledge of the ships using the waters under their jurisdiction and thus enable them to take more effective action against potential risks if necessary. Sharing the information gathered helps to improve its quality and makes it easier to process. (23) In accordance with Directive 2002/59/EC, Member States and the Commission have made substantial progress towards harmonising electronic data exchange, in particular as regards the transport of dangerous or polluting goods. SafeSeaNet, in development since 2002, should now be established as the reference network at Community level. It is important to ensure that SafeSeaNet does not result in increased administrative burdens or costs for industry, that there is harmonisation with international rules and that confidentiality in relation to any possible commercial implication is taken into account. EN C 8 E/156 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 ( 1 ) OJ L \u2026 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(24) The progress made in the new technologies and in particular in their space applications, such as satellite-based ship monitoring systems, imaging systems or Galileo , now makes it possible to extend traffic monitoring further offshore and thereby to ensure better coverage of European waters. Furthermore, the IMO has amended the SOLAS Convention to take account of developments in maritime safety and security and the maritime environment with a view to developing a system for global long-range identification and tracking of ships (LRIT). In accordance with the architecture approved by the IMO and providing for the possibility of setting up regional LRIT Data Centres, and taking into account experience gained from SafeSeaNet, an LRIT European Data Centre should be set up for the collection and management of LRIT information. In order to retrieve LRIT data, Member States will need to be connected to the LRIT European Data Centre. (25) In order to enable cost savings and to avoid unnecessary fitting of equipment on board ships sailing in maritime areas within the coverage of AIS monitoring stations, AIS data should be integrated into the LRIT system. To this end, Member States and the Commission should take any appropriate initiatives, in particular within the IMO. (26) In order to guarantee the best possible use, harmonised at Community level, of information gathered under Directive 2002/59/EC concerning maritime safety, the Commission should be able, if necessary, to process and use these data and disseminate them to the authorities designated by Member States. (27) In this context, the development of the \u2018Equasis\u2019 system has shown how important it is to encourage a \u2018safe seas\u2019 culture, especially in maritime transport operators. The Commission should be able to contribute to the dissemination, particularly via this system, of any information in relation to maritime safety. (28) Information gathered pursuant to this Directive may only be disseminated and used to prevent situations which threaten the safety of human life at sea and the protection of the marine environment. It is therefore desirable that the Commission investigate how to tackle any network and information security problems. (29) Regulation (EC) No 2099/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 establishing a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) ( 1 ) centralises the tasks of the committees set up under the relevant Community legislation on maritime safety, prevention of pollution from ships and protection of living and working conditions on board. The existing committee should therefore be replaced by the COSS. (30) Amendments to the international instruments referred to should also be taken into account. (31) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred to the Commission ( 2 ). (32) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to amend Directive 2002/59/EC in order to apply subsequent amendments to the international conventions, protocols, codes and resolutions related thereto, to amend Annexes I, III and IV in the light of experience gained, to lay down requirements regarding the fitting of LRIT equipment on board ships sailing within the coverage of AIS fixed- based stations of Member States, to lay down policy rules and principles governing access to information held in the LRIT European Data Centre, and to amend the definitions, references or annexes so as to bring them into line with Community or international law . Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of that Directive, inter alia by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.

(2) The expeditious holding of technical investigations into marine casualties improves maritime safety, as it helps to prevent the recurrence of such casualties resulting in loss of life, loss of ships and pollution of the marine environment. (3) The European Parliament, in its resolution of 21 April 2004 on improving safety at sea ( 4 ), \u2551 urged the Commission to present a proposal for a directive on investigating shipping accidents. (4) Article 2 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 ( \u2551 \u2018Unclos\u2019) establishes the right of coastal States to investigate the cause of any marine casualty occurring within their territorial seas which might pose a risk to life or to the environment, involve the coastal State's search and rescue authorities, or otherwise affect the coastal State. (5) Article 94 of Unclos provides that flag States are to cause an inquiry to be held, by or before a suitably qualified person or persons, into certain casualties or incidents of navigation on the high seas. (6) Regulation I/21 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1 November 1974 ( \u2551 \u2018SOLAS 74\u2019), the International Convention of Load Lines of 5 April 1966 and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships of 2 November 1973 establish the responsibility of flag States to conduct casualty investigations and to provide the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) with the relevant findings. (7) The Code for the Implementation of Mandatory IMO Instruments annexed to Resolution A.973(24) of the IMO Assembly of 1 December 2005 recalls the obligation of flag States to ensure that marine safety investigations are conducted by suitably qualified investigators, competent in matters relating to marine casualties and incidents. That Code further requires flag States to be prepared to provide qualified investigators for that purpose, irrespective of the location of the casualty or incident. (8) Account should be taken of the Code for the Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents annexed to Resolution A.849(20) of the IMO Assembly of 27 November 1997 ( \u2551 the \u2018IMO Code for the Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents\u2019), which provides for implementation of a common approach to the safety investigation of marine casualties and incidents and for cooperation between States in identifying the contributing factors leading to marine casualties and incidents.

(10) Council Directive 1999/35/EC of 29 April 1999 on a system of mandatory surveys for the safe operation of regular ro-ro ferry and high-speed passenger craft services ( 1 ) requires Member States to define, in the framework of their respective legal systems, a legal status that will enable them and any other substantially interested Member State to participate, \u2551 cooperate in, or, where provided for under the IMO Code for the Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents, \u2551 conduct any marine casualty or incident investigation involving a ro-ro ferry or high-speed passenger craft. (11) Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system ( 2 ) requires Member States to comply with the IMO Code for the Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents and to ensure that the findings of an investigation are published as soon as possible after its conclusion. (12) Conducting \u2551 safety investigations into casualties and incidents involving seagoing vessels or other vessels in ports or other restricted maritime areas in an unbiased manner is of paramount importance in order to effectively establish the circumstances and causes of such casualties or incidents . Such \u2551 investigations should therefore be carried out by qualified investigators under the control of an inde\u00ad pendent body or entity endowed with permanent decision-making powers, in order to avoid any conflict of interest. (13) Member States should, in compliance with their legislation on the powers of the authorities responsible for the judicial inquiry and in collaboration with those authorities, where appropriate, ensure that those responsible for the technical inquiry are allowed to carry out their tasks under the best possible conditions. (14) Member States should ensure that their legal systems enable them and any other substantially interested Member States to participate or cooperate in, or to conduct, safety investigations on the basis of the provisions of the IMO Code for the Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents. (15) A Member State may delegate to another Member State the task of leading a marine casualty or incident safety investigation (a \u2018safety investigation\u2019), or specific tasks of such an investigation, if mutually agreed. (16) Member States should make every effort not to charge for costs for assistance requested in the framework of safety investigations involving two or more Member States. Where assistance is requested from a Member State that is not involved in the safety investigation, Member States should agree on the reimbursement of costs incurred. (17) Under Regulation V/20 of SOLAS 74, passenger ships and ships other than passenger ships of 3 000 gross tonnage and upwards constructed on or after 1 July 2002 must carry voyage data recorders to assist in accident investigations. Given its importance in the formulation of a policy to prevent shipping accidents, such equipment should be systematically required on board ships making national or international voyages which call at Community ports.

        "(18) The data provided by a voyage data recording system, as well as by other electronic devices, can be used both retrospectively after a marine casualty or incident to investigate its causes and preventively to gain experience of the circumstances capable of leading to such events. Member States should ensure that such data, when available, are properly used for both purposes. (19) Distress alerts from a ship or information from any source that a ship is, or persons on or from a ship are, imperilled, or that, as a result of an event in connection with the operation of a ship, there is a serious potential risk of damage to persons, the ship's structure or the environment, should be investigated or otherwise examined . (20) Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ) requires the European Maritime Safety Agency ( \u2551 \u2018the Agency\u2019) to work with the Member States to develop technical solutions and provide technical assistance related to the implementation of Community legislation. In the field of safety investigations , the Agency has the specific task of facilitating cooperation between the Member States and the Commission in the development, with due regard to the different legal systems in the Member States, of a common methodology for investigating maritime accidents according to agreed international principles. (21) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002, the Agency facilitates cooperation in the provision of support to the Member States in activities concerning investigations and in analysing existing accident investigation reports. (22) Any conclusions drawn from analyses of existing accident reports which may be of use in the prevention of future disasters and the improvement of maritime safety in the European Union should be taken into account in the development or modification of a common methodology for investigating maritime accidents . (23) The safety recommendations resulting from a safety investigation should be duly taken into account by the Member States and the Community . (24) Since the aim of a safety investigation is the prevention of marine casualties and incidents, its conclusions and \u2551 safety recommendations should in no circumstances determine liability or apportion blame. (25) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to improve marine safety in the Community and thereby reduce the risk of future marine casualties, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or the effects of this Directive , be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (26) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 2 ).

Safety investigations initiated under this Directive shall not be concerned with determining liability or apportioning blame. However, Member States shall ensure that the investigative body or entity ( \u2551 the \u2018investigative body\u2019) does not refrain from fully reporting the causes of the casualty or incident because fault or liability may be inferred from the findings.

In addition to investigating serious and very serious casualties, the investigative body referred to in Article 8 shall, having established the initial facts of the case, decide whether or not a safety investigation into a less serious casualty, a marine \u2590 incident or a distress alert will be undertaken. In its decision, the investigative body shall take into account the seriousness of the casualty or incident, the type of vessel and/or cargo involved in the distress alert , and any request from the search and rescue authorities . 3. The scope and practical arrangements for the conduct of safety investigations shall be determined by the investigative body of the lead investigating Member State in cooperation with the equivalent bodies of the other substantially interested States, in such manner as appears to that investigative body most conducive to achieving the objective of this Directive, and with a view to preventing future casualties and incidents. 4. Safety investigations shall follow \u2590 the common methodology for investigating marine casualties and incidents developed pursuant to Article 2(e) of Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002. The Commission shall adopt or modify this methodology for the purposes of this Directive.

Narrative This part reconstructs the marine casualty or incident through a sequence of events, in a chronological order leading up to, during and following the marine casualty or incident and the involvement of each actor (i.e. person, material, environment, equipment or external agent). The period covered by the narrative depends on the timing of those particular accidental events that directly contributed to the marine casualty or incident. This part also includes any relevant details of the safety investigation conducted, including the results of examinations or tests. 4. Analysis This part includes a number of discrete sections, providing an analysis of each accidental event, with comments relating to the results of any relevant examinations or tests conducted during the course of the safety investigation and to any safety action that might already have been taken to prevent marine casualties. These sections should cover issues such as: \u2014 accidental event context and environment, \u2014 human erroneous actions and omissions, events involving hazardous material, environmental effects, equipment failures, and external influences, \u2014 contributing factors involving person-related functions, shipboard operations, shore management or regulatory influence. The analysis and comment enable the report to reach logical conclusions, establishing all of the contributing factors, including those with risks for which existing defences aimed at preventing an accidental event, and/or those aimed at eliminating or reducing its consequences, are assessed to be either inadequate or missing. 5. Conclusions This part consolidates the established contributing factors and missing or inadequate defences (material, functional, symbolic or procedural) for which safety actions should be developed to prevent marine casualties. 6. Safety recommendations When appropriate, this part of the report contains safety recommendations derived from the analysis and conclusions and related to particular subject areas, such as legislation, design, procedures, inspection, management, health and safety at work, training, repair work, maintenance, shore assistance and emergency response. The safety recommendations are addressed to those that are best placed to implement them, such as ship owners, managers, recognised organisations, maritime authorities, vessel traffic services, emergency bodies, international maritime organisations and European institutions, with the aim of preventing marine casualties. This part also includes any interim safety recommendations that may have been made or any safety actions taken during the course of the safety investigation.

        "Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 2 ), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 3 ), Whereas: (1) Within the framework of the common transport policy, it is necessary to adopt further measures \u2551 to enhance safety in maritime transport. These measures include liability rules for damage caused to passengers, since it is important to ensure an appropriate level of compensation for passengers involved in maritime accidents. (2) The Protocol of 2002 to the Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea, 1974 was adopted on 1 November 2002 under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The Community and its Member States are in the process of deciding whether to accede to or ratify that Protocol. (3) The Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea , 1974, as amended by the Protocol of 2002 ( \u2551 \u2018the Athens Convention\u2019), applies to international transport only. The distinction between national and international transport has been eliminated within the internal market in maritime transport services , and it is therefore appropriate that the same level and nature of liability apply to both international and national transport within the Community. (4) The insurance arrangements required under the Athens Convention must be appropriate to the financial means of ship-owners and insurance companies. Ship-owners must be in a position to manage their insurance arrangements in an economically acceptable way and, particularly in the case of small shipping companies operating national transport services, account must be taken of the seasonal nature of their operations. The transitional period which is provided for in the application of this Regulation must be sufficiently long as to enable the compulsory insurance provided for by the Athens Convention to be arranged without affecting existing insurance schemes. (5) It is appropriate to oblige the carrier to make an advance payment in the event of the death of or personal injury to a passenger, whereby advance payment does not constitute recognition of liability. (6) Appropriate, full and comprehensible information on new rights being conferred on passengers should be provided to those passengers prior to their journey. (7) Any amendment to the Athens Convention will be incorporated into Community legislation, unless that amendment is excluded following the procedure under Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2099/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 establishing a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) ( 4 ). (8) The Legal Committee of the IMO adopted on 19 October 2006 the IMO Reservation and Guidelines for the Implementation of the Athens Convention ( \u2551 \u2018the IMO Guidelines\u2019) to address certain issues under the Athens Convention, such as, in particular, compensation for terrorism-related damage. \u2551 As such, the IMO Guidelines may be considered a lex specialis.

        "(9) This Regulation incorporates and makes binding parts of the IMO Guidelines. To achieve that result , where it occurs in the provisions of the IMO Guidelines, the verb \u2018should\u2019 should, in particular, be understood as \u2018shall\u2019. (10) The provisions of the Athens Convention (Annex I) and of the IMO Guidelines (Annex II) should be understood, mutatis mutandis, in the context of Community legislation. (11) The matters covered by Articles 17 and 17bis of the Athens Convention fall within the exclusive competence of the \u2551 Community insofar as those Articles affect the rules established by Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ( 1 ). To that extent, those Articles will form part of the Community legal order when the \u2551 Community accedes to the Athens Convention. (12) For the purposes of this Regulation , the expression \u2018or is registered in a Member State\u2019 should be interpreted to mean that the flag state for the purposes of bareboat charter-out registration is \u2551 either a Member State or a contracting party to the Athens Convention. Necessary steps should be taken by the Member States and the Commission to invite the IMO to develop guidelines on the concept of bareboat charter-out registration. (13) For the purposes of this Regulation , the expression \u2018mobility equipment\u2019 should be considered as covering neither \u2551 luggage nor vehicles within the meaning of Article 8 of the Athens Convention. (14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 2 ). (15) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to amend this Regulation in order to incorporate subsequent amendments to the international conventions, protocols, codes and resolutions related thereto. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC. (16) The European Maritime Safety Agency (\u2018the Agency\u2019) , established by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 ( 3 ), should assist the Commission in preparing and drafting a progress report on the functioning of the new rules. (17) Owing to the need for greater consultation among the Member States on matters of maritime safety, it is vital to reassess the Agency's competences and possibly to consider extending its powers. (18) The national authorities, particularly the port authorities, play a fundamental and vital role in identifying and managing the various risks in relation to maritime safety. \u2590 (19) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to create a single set of rules governing the rights of carriers by sea and their passengers in the event of an accident, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the need to ensure identical limits of liability for accidents in all Member States, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective, EN C 8 E/190 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 ( 1 ) OJ L 12, 16.1.2001, p. 1. \u2551 .

Article 7(2) of the Athens Convention shall not apply to the carriage of passengers falling within the scope of this Regulation, unless the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty, amend this Regulation to such effect. 2. The IMO Guidelines \u2551 set out in Annex II shall be binding. Article 4 Compensation in respect of mobility equipment or other specific equipment In the event of loss of, or damage to, mobility equipment or other specific equipment used by a passenger with reduced mobility, the carrier's liability shall be governed by Article 3(3) of the Athens Convention.

        "Article 5 Advance payment Where the death of, or personal injury to, a passenger is caused by a shipping incident \u2590 , the carrier who actually performed the whole or a part of the carriage when the shipping incident occurred shall make an advance payment sufficient to cover immediate economic needs on a basis proportionate to the damage suffered, within 15 days from the identification of the person entitled to damages. In the event of the death or absolute and permanent invalidity of a passenger, or injuries to 75 % or more of a passenger's body which are considered clinically very serious, this payment shall not be less than EUR 21 000. This Article shall also apply where the carrier is established within the Community. An advance payment shall not constitute recognition of liability. It may be offset against any subsequent sums paid on the basis of this Regulation and may not be returned , except in the cases described in Article 3(1) and Article 6 of the Athens Convention and Appendix A of the IMO Guidelines , or where the person who received it is not the person entitled to damages. Payment or receipt, as appropriate, of an advance payment shall entitle the carrier, the performing carrier or the passenger to initiate judicial proceedings to establish liability and fault. Article 6 Information to passengers The carrier and / or performing carrier shall ensure that passengers are provided with appropriate , full and comprehensible information regarding their rights under this Regulation prior to their departure. To the extent that such information has been provided by either the carrier or the performing carrier, the other shall not be obliged to provide it . The information shall be provided in an appropriate , full and comprehensible format and, in the case of information provided by tour operators, in accordance with Article 4 of Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours ( 1 ). In order to comply with this information requirement, the carrier and performing carrier may use a summary of the provisions of this Regulation prepared by the Commission and made public. Article 7 Report By \u2026 ( 2 ), the Commission shall draw up a report on the application of this Regulation, which shall, inter alia, take into account economic developments and developments in international fora .

An authority delegated shall not take effect prior to three months from the date on which notification to that effect was given to the Secretary-General. (c) The institution or organization authorised to issue certificates in accordance with this paragraph shall, as a minimum, be authorised to withdraw these certificates if the conditions under which they have been issued are not complied with. In all cases the institution or organisation shall report such withdrawal to the State on whose behalf the certificate was issued.

If the language used is not English, French or Spanish, the text shall include a translation into one of these languages, and, where the State so decides, the official language of the State may be omitted. 5. The certificate shall be carried on board the ship, and a copy shall be deposited with the authorities who keep the record of the ship's registry or, if the ship is not registered in a State Party, with the authority of the State issuing or certifying the certificate. 6. An insurance or other financial security shall not satisfy the requirements of this Article if it can cease, for reasons other than the expiry of the period of validity of the insurance or security specified in the certificate, before three months have elapsed from the date on which notice of its termination is given to the authorities referred to in paragraph 5, unless the certificate has been surrendered to these authorities or a new certificate has been issued within the said period. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to any modification which results in the insurance or other financial security no longer satisfying the requirements of this Article. 7. The State of the ship's registry shall, subject to the provisions of this Article, determine the conditions of issue and validity of the certificate. 8. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing a State Party from relying on information obtained from other States or the Organization or other international organizations relating to the financial standing of providers of insurance or other financial security for the purposes of this Convention. In such cases, the State Party relying on such information is not relieved of its responsibility as a State issuing the certificate. 9. Certificates issued or certified under the authority of a State Party shall be accepted by other States Parties for the purposes of this Convention and shall be regarded by other States Parties as having the same force as certificates issued or certified by them, even if issued or certified in respect of a ship not registered in a State Party. A State Party may at any time request consultation with the issuing or certifying State should it believe that the insurer or guarantor named in the insurance certificate is not financially capable of meeting the obligations imposed by this Convention. 10. Any claim for compensation covered by insurance or other financial security pursuant to this Article may be brought directly against the insurer or other person providing financial security. In such case, the amount set out in paragraph 1 applies as the limit of liability of the insurer or other person providing financial security, even if the carrier or the performing carrier is not entitled to limitation of liability. The defendant may further invoke the defences (other than the bankruptcy or winding up) which the carrier referred to in paragraph 1 would have been entitled to invoke in accordance with this Convention. Furthermore, the defendant may invoke the defence that the damage resulted from the wilful misconduct of the assured, but the defendant shall not invoke any other defence which the defendant might have been entitled to invoke in proceedings brought by the assured against the defendant. The defendant shall in any event have the right to require the carrier and the performing carrier to be joined in the proceedings. 11. Any sums provided by insurance or by other financial security maintained in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be available exclusively for the satisfaction of claims under this Convention, and any payments made of such sums shall discharge any liability arising under this Convention to the extent of the amounts paid. 12. A State Party shall not permit a ship under its flag to which this Article applies to operate at any time unless a certificate has been issued under paragraphs 2 or 15.

Subject to the provisions of this Article, each State Party shall ensure, under its national law, that insurance or other financial security, to the extent specified in paragraph 1, is in force in respect of any ship that is licensed to carry more than twelve passengers, wherever registered, entering or leaving a port in its territory in so far as this Convention applies. 14. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, a State Party may notify the Secretary-General that, for the purposes of paragraph 13, ships are not required to carry on board or to produce the certificate required by paragraph 2 when entering or leaving ports in its territory, provided that the State Party which issues the certificate has notified the Secretary-General that it maintains records in an electronic format, accessible to all States Parties, attesting the existence of the certificate and enabling States Parties to discharge their obligations under paragraph 13. 15. If insurance or other financial security is not maintained in respect of a ship owned by a State Party, the provisions of this Article relating thereto shall not be applicable to such ship, but the ship shall carry a certificate issued by the appropriate authorities of the State of the ship's registry, stating that the ship is owned by that State and that the liability is covered within the amount prescribed in accordance with paragraph 1. Such a certificate shall follow as closely as possible the model prescribed by paragraph 2. Article 5 Valuables The carrier shall not be liable for the loss of or damage to monies, negotiable securities, gold, silverware, jewellery, ornaments, works of art, or other valuables, except where such valuables have been deposited with the carrier for the agreed purpose of safe-keeping in which case the carrier shall be liable up to the limit provided for in paragraph 3 of Article 8 unless a higher limit is agreed upon in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 10. Article 6 Contributory fault If the carrier proves that the death of or personal injury to a passenger or the loss of or damage to his luggage was caused or contributed to by the fault or neglect of the passenger, the Court seized of the case may exonerate the carrier wholly or partly from his liability in accordance with the provisions of the law of that court. Article 7 Limit of liability for death and personal injury 1. The liability of the carrier for the death of or personal injury to a passenger under Article 3 shall in no case exceed 400 000 units of account per passenger on each distinct occasion. Where, in accordance with the law of the court seized of the case, damages are awarded in the form of periodical income payments, the equivalent capital value of those payments shall not exceed the said limit. 2. A State Party may regulate by specific provisions of national law the limit of liability prescribed in paragraph 1, provided that the national limit of liability, if any, is not lower than that prescribed in paragraph 1. A State Party, which makes use of the option provided for in this paragraph, shall inform the Secretary-General of the limit of liability adopted or of the fact that there is none.

The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect on the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State Party. 2.

The gold franc referred to in this paragraph corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrams of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The conversion of the gold franc into the national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned. 3.

Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity. (2) The Community is seriously concerned about shipping casualties and pollution of the seas and coastlines of Member States. (3) The Community is equally concerned about on-board living and working conditions. (4) Safety, pollution prevention and on-board living and working conditions may be effectively enhanced through a drastic reduction of substandard ships from Community waters, by strictly applying Conventions, international codes and resolutions. (5) To this end, Member States should endeavour to take the necessary steps to ratify the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, of the International Labour Organisation, which contains provisions related to port State obligations in regulation 5.2.1. (6) Member States should take the necessary measures to adapt their national law to the provisions on limitation of liability of the recapitulative text of the 1976 International Maritime Organisation Convention on Limitation of Responsibility for Maritime Claims, as amended by the 1996 protocol (the 1996 Convention). Regarding the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Commu\u00ad nities in Case C-188/07 ( 5 ), it appears that compensation to third parties in respect of damage caused by waste falls under the \u2018polluter pays\u2019 principle enunciated in Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste ( 6 ) and in Directive 2004/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage ( 7 ), opening up the right to be compensated for the totality of the damage caused, including where there is not complete coverage and beyond the national provisions on incorporation of conventions.

        "(7) Responsibility for monitoring the compliance of ships with the international standards for safety, pollution prevention and on-board living and working conditions lies primarily with the flag State. Relying, as appropriate, on recognised organisations, the flag State fully guarantees the completeness and efficiency of the inspections and surveys undertaken to issue the relevant certificates. Responsibility for maintenance of the condition of the ship and its equipment after survey to comply with the requirements of Conventions applicable to the ship lies with the ship company. However, there has been a serious failure on the part of a number of flag States to implement and enforce international standards. Henceforth, as a second line of defence against substandard shipping, the monitoring of compliance with the international standards for safety, pollution prevention and on-board living and working conditions should also be ensured by the port State, while recognising that port State control inspection is not a survey and the relevant inspection forms are not seaworthiness certificates. (8) A harmonised approach to the effective enforcement of these international standards by Member States in respect of ships sailing in the waters under their jurisdiction and using their ports should avoid distortions of competition. (9) The shipping industry is vulnerable to acts of terrorism. Transport security measures should be effectively implemented and Member States should vigorously monitor compliance with security rules by carrying out security checks. (10) Advantage should be taken of the experience gained during the operation of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MOU), signed in Paris on 26 January 1982. (11) The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) established by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 ( 1 ), should provide the necessary support to ensure the convergent and effective implementation of the port State control system. The EMSA should in particular contribute to the development and implementation of the inspection database set up in accordance with this Directive and to a harmonised Community scheme for the training and assessment of competences of port State control inspectors by Member States. (12) An efficient port State control regime should seek to ensure that all ships calling at a port within the European Union are regularly inspected. Inspection should concentrate on substandard ships, while quality ships, meaning those which have satisfactory inspection records or which fly the flag of a State complying with the Voluntary International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Member State Audit Scheme, should be rewarded by undergoing less frequent inspections. Such new inspection arrangements should be incorporated into the Community port State control regime as soon as its various aspects have been defined and on the basis of an inspection-sharing scheme whereby each Member State contributes fairly to the achievement of the Community objective of a comprehensive inspection scheme. Moreover, Member States should recruit and retain the requisite number of staff, including qualified inspectors, taking into account the volume and characteristics of shipping traffic at each port. (13) The inspection regime set up by this Directive takes into account the work carried out by the Paris MOU. Since any developments arising from the Paris MOU should be agreed at Community level before being made applicable within the EU, close coordination should be established and maintained between the Community and the Paris MOU in order to facilitate as much convergence as possible. EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/215 ( 1 ) OJ L 208, 5.8.2002, p. 1. \u2551 . Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(14) The Commission should manage and update the inspection database, in close collaboration with the Paris MOU. The inspection database should incorporate inspection data of the Member States and all States Parties to the Paris MOU. Until the Community maritime information system, SafeSeaNet, is fully operational and allows for an automatic record of the data concerning ships\u2019 calls in the inspection database, Member States should provide the Commission with the information needed to ensure \u2551 proper monitoring of the application of this Directive, in particular concerning the movements of ships. On the basis of the inspection data provided by Member States, the Commission should retrieve from the inspection database data on the risk profile of ships, on ships due for inspections and on the movement of ships and should calculate the inspection commitments for each Member State. The inspection database should also be capable of interfacing with other Community maritime safety databases. (15) Member States should endeavour to review the method of drawing the white, grey and black list of flag States in the framework of the Paris MOU, in order to ensure its fairness, in particular with respect to the way it treats flag States with small fleets. (16) The rules and procedures for port State control inspections, including criteria for the detention of ships, should be harmonised to ensure consistent effectiveness in all ports, which would also drastically reduce the selective use of certain ports of destination to avoid the net of proper control. (17) \u2590 Periodic and additional inspections should include an examination of pre-identified areas for each ship which, will vary according to the type of ship, the type of inspection and the findings of previous port State control inspections. The inspection database should indicate the elements to identify the risk areas to be checked at each inspection. (18) Certain categories of ships present a major accident or pollution hazard when they reach a certain age and should therefore be subject to an expanded inspection. The details of such expanded inspections should be specified . (19) Under the inspection regime set up by this Directive, the intervals between periodic inspections on ships depend on their risk profile which is determined by certain generic and historical parameters. For high-risk ships this interval should not exceed six months. \u2590 (20) Some ships pose a manifest risk to maritime safety and the marine environment because of their poor condition, flag \u2590 and history. They should therefore be refused access to Community ports and anchorages, unless it can be demonstrated that they can be operated safely in Community waters. Guidelines should be established setting out the procedures applicable in the event of the imposition of such an access ban and of the lifting of the ban. In the interests of transparency, the list of ships refused access to Community ports and anchorages should be made public. (21) With a view to reducing the burden placed on certain administrations and companies by repetitive inspections, surveys under Council Directive 1999/35/EC of 29 April 1999 on a system of mandatory surveys for the safe operation of regular ro-ro ferry and high-speed passenger craft services ( 1 ), carried out on ro-ro ferries or high-speed passenger craft by a host State which is not the flag State of the vessel, and which include at least all the items of an expanded inspection, should be taken into account when calculating the risk profile of a ship, the intervals between inspections and the fulfilment of the inspection commitment of each Member State. In addition, the Commission should examine whether it is appropriate that Directive 1999/35/EC be amended in the future with a view to enhancing the level of safety required for the operation of ro-ro ferries and high-speed passenger craft to and from ports of Member States. EN C 8 E/216 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 ( 1 ) OJ L 138, 1.6.1999, p. 1. \u2551 . Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(22) Non-compliance with the provisions of the relevant Conventions should be rectified. Ships which need to be the subject of corrective action should, where the observed deficiencies are clearly hazardous to safety, health or the environment, be detained until the shortcomings are rectified. (23) A right of appeal against detention orders by the competent authorities must be made available, in order to prevent unreasonable decisions which may cause undue detention and delay. (24) Authorities and inspectors involved in port State control activities should have no conflict of interests with the port of inspection or with the ships inspected, or of related interests. Inspectors should be adequately qualified and receive appropriate training to maintain and improve their competence in the conduct of inspections. Member States should cooperate in developing and promoting a harmonised Community scheme for the training and assessment of competences of inspectors. (25) Pilots and port authorities or bodies should be enabled to provide useful information on apparent anomalies found on board ships. (26) Complaints from persons with a legitimate interest regarding on-board living and working conditions should be investigated. Any person lodging a complaint should be informed of the follow-up action given to that complaint. (27) Cooperation between the competent authorities of Member States and other authorities or organi\u00ad sations is necessary in order to ensure an effective follow-up with regard to ships with deficiencies, which have been permitted to proceed, and for the exchange of information about ships in port. (28) Since the inspection database is an essential part of port State control, Member States should ensure that it is updated in the light of Community requirements. (29) Publication of information concerning ships and their operators or companies which do not comply with international standards on safety, health and protection of the marine environment may be an effective deterrent discouraging shippers from using such ships and an incentive to their owners to take corrective action. With regard to the information to be made available, the Commission should establish \u2551 close collaboration with the Paris MOU and take account of any information published in order to avoid unnecessary duplication. Member States should have to provide the relevant information only once. (30) All costs of inspecting, which warrant detention of ships, and those incurred in lifting a refusal of access, should be borne by the owner or the operator. (31) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 1 ). (32) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to amend this Directive in order to apply subsequent amendments to Conventions, international codes and resolutions related thereto and to establish the rules of implementation for the provisions of Articles 7 and 9. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, inter alia by supplementing it with new-non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC. EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/217 ( 1 ) OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23. \u2551 . Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(33) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to reduce substandard shipping in waters under Member States\u2019 jurisdiction through improvement of the Community\u2019s inspection system for seagoing ships and the development of the means of taking preventive action in the field of pollution of the seas, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and may, therefore, on account of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may take measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives. (34) The obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive change as compared with Directive 95/21/EC. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under that Directive. (35) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of Member States relating to the time- limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex XV, Part B. (36) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making ( 1 ), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public. (37) In order not to impose a disproportionate administrative burden on landlocked Member States, a de minimis rule should allow such Member States to derogate from the provisions of this Directive, which means that such Member States, as long as they meet certain criteria, are not obliged to transpose this Directive. (38) In order to take into account the fact that the French overseas departments belong to a different geographical area, are to a large extent Parties to regional port State control memoranda other than the Paris MOU and have very limited traffic flows with mainland Europe, the Member State concerned should be allowed to exclude those ports from the port State control system applied within the Community, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Purpose The purpose of this Directive is to help to drastically reduce substandard shipping in the waters under the jurisdiction of Member States by: (a) increasing compliance with international and relevant Community legislation on maritime safety, maritime security, protection of the marine environment and on-board living and working conditions of ships of all flags; (b) establishing common criteria for control of ships by the port State and harmonising procedures on inspection and detention, building upon the expertise and experience within the Paris MOU; (c) implementing within the Community a port State control regime based on the inspections performed within the Community and the Paris MOU region, aiming at the inspection of all ships with the frequency depending on their risk profile, whereby ships posing a higher risk shall be subject to a more thorough inspection carried out at more frequent intervals.

Article 13 Initial and more detailed inspections Member States shall ensure that ships which are selected for inspection in accordance with Article 12 are subject to an initial inspection or a more detailed inspection as follows: 1. On each initial inspection of a ship, the competent authority shall ensure that the inspector, as a minimum: (a) checks the certificates and documents listed in Annex IV required to be kept on board in accordance with Community maritime legislation and Conventions relating to safety and security; (b) verifies, where appropriate, whether outstanding deficiencies found during the previous inspection carried out by a Member State or by a State signatory to the Paris MOU, have been rectified; (c) satisfies himself of the overall condition of the ship, including the hygiene of the ship, and the engine room and accommodation. 2. When, after an inspection referred to in paragraph 1, deficiencies to be rectified at the next port of call have been recorded in the inspection database, the competent authority of that next port may decide not to carry out the verifications referred to in paragraph 1(a) and (c). 3. A more detailed inspection shall be carried out, including further checking of compliance with on-board operational requirements, whenever there are clear grounds for believing, after the inspection referred to in paragraph 1, that the condition of a ship or of its equipment or crew does not substantially meet the relevant requirements of one of the Conventions . \u2018Clear grounds\u2019 shall exist when the inspector finds evidence which in his professional judgement warrants a more detailed inspection of the ship, its equipment or its crew.

The ship\u2019s master shall be provided with a copy of the inspection report. Article 18 Complaints All complaints shall be subject to a rapid initial assessment by the competent authority. This assessment shall make it possible to determine whether a complaint is justified, concrete and manifestly grounded. Should that be the case, the competent authority shall take the necessary action on the complaint. It shall, in particular, ensure that the ship\u2019s master and owner, as well as anyone else directly concerned by the complaint, including the complainant, can make their views known. Where the competent authority deems the complaint to be manifestly unfounded, it shall inform the complainant of its decision and of the reasons therefor. The identity of the complainant shall not be revealed to the master or the shipowner of the ship concerned. The inspector shall ensure confidentiality during any interviews of crew members.

The competent authority shall be satisfied that any deficiencies confirmed or revealed by the inspection are, or will be, rectified in accordance with the Conventions. 2. In the case of deficiencies which are clearly hazardous to safety, health or the environment, the competent authority of the port State where the ship is being inspected shall ensure that the ship is detained or that the operation in the course of which the deficiencies are revealed is stopped. The detention order or stoppage of an operation shall not be lifted until the hazard is removed or until such authority establishes that the ship can, subject to any necessary conditions, proceed to sea or the operation be resumed without risk to the safety and health of passengers or crew, or risk to other ships, or without there being an unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment.

If the inspection reveals that the ship is not equipped with a functioning voyage data recorder, when use of such a recorder is compulsory in accordance with Directive 2002/59/EC, the competent authority shall ensure that the ship is detained. If that deficiency cannot be readily rectified in the port of detention, the competent authority may either allow the ship to proceed to the appropriate repair yard nearest to the port of detention where it may be readily rectified or require the deficiency to be rectified within a maximum period of 30 days, as provided for in the guidelines developed by the Paris MOU. For these purposes, the procedures laid down in Article 21 shall apply. 5. In exceptional circumstances, where the overall condition of a ship is obviously substandard, the competent authority may suspend the inspection of that ship until the parties responsible \u2551 take the steps necessary to ensure that it complies with the relevant requirements of the Conventions. 6. In the event of detention, the competent authority shall immediately inform, in writing and including the inspection report \u2551 , the flag State administration or, when this is not possible, the Consul or, in his absence, the nearest diplomatic representative of that State, of all the circumstances in which intervention was deemed necessary. In addition, nominated surveyors or recognised organisations responsible for the issue of classification certificates or statutory certificates in accordance with the Conventions shall also be notified where relevant. 7. This Directive shall be without prejudice to the additional requirements of the Conventions concerning notification and reporting procedures related to port State control. 8. When port State control is exercised under this Directive, all possible efforts shall be made to avoid a ship being unduly detained or delayed. If a ship is unduly detained or delayed, the owner or operator shall be entitled to compensation for any loss or damage suffered. In any instance of alleged undue detention or delay the burden of proof shall lie with the owner or operator of the ship. 9. In order to alleviate port congestion, a competent authority may allow a detained ship to be moved to another part of the port if it is safe to do so. However, the risk of port congestion shall not be a consideration when deciding on a detention or on a release from detention. The competent authority shall inform the port authorities or bodies at its earliest convenience when a detention order is issued. Port authorities or bodies shall cooperate with the competent authority with a view to facilitating the accommodation of detained ships. Article 20 Right of appeal 1. The owner or operator of a ship or his representative in the Member State shall have a right of appeal against detention or refusal of access by the competent authority.

Article 21 Follow-up to inspections and detentions 1. Where deficiencies referred to in Article 19(2) cannot be rectified in the port of inspection, the competent authority of that Member State may allow the ship concerned to proceed directly to the appropriate repair yard nearest to the port of detention where follow-up action can be taken, as chosen by the master and the authorities concerned, provided that the conditions determined by the competent authority of the flag State and agreed by that Member State are complied with. Such conditions shall ensure that the ship can proceed without risk to the safety and health of passengers or crew, or risk to other ships, or without there being an unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment. 2. Where the decision to send a ship to a repair yard is due to a lack of compliance with IMO Resolution A. 744(18), on Guidelines on the Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers , either with respect to a ship\u2019s documentation or with respect to a ship\u2019s structural failures and deficiencies, the competent authority may require that the necessary thickness measurements be ensured in the port of detention before the ship is allowed to sail. 3. In the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authority of the Member State in the port of inspection shall notify the competent authority of the State where the repair yard is situated, the parties mentioned in Article 19(6) and any other authority as appropriate of all the conditions for the voyage.

Done at \u2026, on \u2026 For the European Parliament The President For the Council The President ANNEX I ELEMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY PORT STATE INSPECTION REGIME (referred to in Article 6 ) The following elements shall be included in the Community Port State Inspection Regime: I. Ship risk profile The risk profile of a ship shall be determined by a combination of the following generic and historical parameters: 1. Generic parameters (a) Type of ship Passenger ships, oil and chemical tankers, gas carriers and bulk carriers shall be considered as posing a higher risk. (b) Age of ship Ships of more than 12 years old shall be considered as posing a higher risk. (c) Flag State performance (i) Ships flying the flag of a State with a high detention rate within the EU and Paris MOU region shall be considered as posing a higher risk. (ii) Ships flying the flag of a State with a low detention rate within the EU and Paris MOU region shall be considered as posing a lower risk. (iii) Ships flying the flag of a State for which an audit has been completed and, where relevant, a corrective action plan submitted, both in accordance with the Framework and procedures for the Voluntary IMO Member State Audit Scheme shall be considered as posing a lower risk. As soon as the measures referred to in Article 10 (3) are adopted, the flag State of such a ship shall demonstrate compliance with the Code for the implementation of mandatory IMO instruments. (d) Recognised organisations (i) Ships which have been issued with certificates by recognised organisations having a low or very low performance level in relation to their detention rates within the EU and the Paris MOU region shall be considered as posing a higher risk. (ii) Ships which have been issued with certificates by recognised organisations having a high performance level in relation to their detention rates within the EU and the Paris MOU region shall be considered as posing a lower risk. (iii) Ships with certificates issued by organisations recognised under the terms of Directive 94/57/EC shall be considered as posing a lower risk. EN C 8 E/236 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(e) Company performance (i) Ships of a company with a low or very low performance as determined by its ships\u2019 deficiency and detention rates within the EU and the Paris MOU region shall be considered as posing a higher risk. (ii) Ships of a company with a high performance as determined by its ships\u2019 deficiency and detention rates within the EU and the Paris MOU region shall be considered as posing a lower risk. 2. Historical parameters (i) Ships which have been detained more than once shall be considered as posing a higher risk. (ii) Ships which, during inspection(s) carried out within the period referred to in Annex II have had less than the number of deficiencies referred to in Annex II, shall be considered as posing a lower risk. (iii) Ships which have not been detained during the period referred to in Annex II, shall be considered as posing a lower risk. The risk parameters shall be combined by using a weighting which reflects the relative influence of each parameter on the overall risk of the ship in order to determine the following ship risk profiles: \u2014 high risk, \u2014 standard risk, \u2014 low risk. In determining these risk profiles greater emphasis shall be given to the parameters for type of ship, flag State performance, recognised organisations and company performance. II. Inspection of ships 1. Periodic inspections Periodic inspections shall be carried out at predetermined intervals. Their frequency shall be determined by the ship risk profile. The interval between periodic inspections of high risk ships shall not exceed six months. The interval between periodic inspections of ships of other risk profiles shall increase as the risk decreases. Member States shall carry out a periodic inspection on: \u2014 Any ship with a high risk profile which has not been inspected in a port of the EU or of the Paris MOU region during the last six months. High risk ships become eligible for inspection as from the fifth month. \u2014 Any ship with a standard risk profile which has not been inspected in a port of the EU or of the Paris MOU region during the last 12 months. Standard risk ships become eligible for inspection as from the 10th month. \u2014 Any ship with a low risk profile which has not been inspected in a port of the EU or of the Paris MOU region during the last 30 months . Low risk ships become eligible for inspection as from the 24th month. 2. Additional inspections Ships, to which the following overriding or unexpected factors apply, are subject to an inspection regardless of the period since their last periodic inspection. However, the need to undertake an additional inspection on the basis of unexpected factors is left to the professional judgement of the inspector. 2A. Overriding factors Ships to which the following overriding factors apply shall be inspected regardless of the period since their last periodic inspection: \u2014 Ships which have been suspended or withdrawn from their class for safety reasons since the last inspection in the European Union or in the Paris MOU region.

The oil record book has not been properly kept. 3. During examination of the certificates and other documentation, inaccuracies have been revealed. 4. Indications that the crew members are unable to comply with the requirements related to on- board communication set out in Article 17 of Directive 2001/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 on the minimum level of training of seafarers ( 1 ). 5. A certificate has been fraudulently obtained or the holder of a certificate is not the person to whom that certificate was originally issued. 6. The ship has a master, officer or rating holding a certificate issued by a country which has not ratified the STCW Convention. 7. Evidence of cargo and other operations not being conducted safely, or in accordance with IMO guidelines, e.g. the content of oxygen in the inert-gas main supply to the cargo tanks is above the prescribed maximum level. 8. Failure of the master on an oil tanker to produce the record of the oil discharge monitoring and control system for the last ballast voyage. 9. Absence of an up-to-date muster list, or crew members not aware of their duties in the event of fire or an order to abandon the ship. 10. The emission of false distress alerts not followed by proper cancellation procedures. 11. The absence of principal equipment or arrangements required by the Conventions. 12. Excessively unsanitary conditions on board the ship. 13. Evidence from the inspector's general impression and observations that serious hull or structural deterioration or deficiencies exist that may place at risk the structural, watertight or weathertight integrity of the ship. 14. Information or evidence that the master or crew is not familiar with essential shipboard operations relating to the safety of ships or the prevention of pollution, or that such operations have not been carried out. 15. The absence of a table of shipboard working arrangements or of records of hours of work or rest of seafarers. B. Examples of clear grounds for the control of ships on security aspects 1. The inspector may establish clear grounds for further control measures on security during the initial PSC inspection as follows: 1.1. ISSC is not valid or it has expired. 1.2. The ship is at a lower security level than the port. EN C 8 E/244 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 ( 1 ) OJ L 136, 18.5.2001, p. 17. \u2551 . Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "1.3. Drills related to the security of the ship have not been carried out. 1.4. Records for the last 10 ship/port or ship/ship interfaces are incomplete. 1.5. Evidence or observation that key members of ship's personnel cannot communicate with each other. 1.6. Evidence from observations that serious deficiencies exist in security arrangements. 1.7. Information from third parties such as a report or a complaint concerning security-related information. 1.8. The ship holds a subsequent, consecutively issued Interim \u2551 ISSC \u2551 and in the professional judgement of the inspector one of the purposes of the ship or company in requesting such a certificate is to avoid full compliance with SOLAS 74 Chapter XI-2 and part A of the ISPS Code, beyond the period of the initial Interim Certificate.

        "ANNEX VIII PROVISIONS CONCERNING REFUSAL OF ACCESS TO PORTS AND ANCHORAGES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY (referred to in Article 16 ) 1. If the conditions described in Article 16 (1) are met, the competent authority of the port in which the ship is detained for the third time shall inform the master of the ship in writing that a refusal of access order will be issued which will become applicable immediately after the ship has left the port. The refusal of access order shall become applicable immediately after the ship has left the port after the deficiencies leading to the detention have been remedied. 2. The competent authority shall send a copy of the order of refusal of access to the flag State adminis\u00ad tration, the recognised organisation concerned, the other Member States, and the other signatories to the MOU, the Commission and the Paris MOU Secretariat. The competent authority shall also update the inspection database with information on the refusal of access without delay. 3. In order to have the access refusal order lifted, the owner or the operator must address a formal request to the competent authority of the Member State that imposed the access refusal order. This request must be accompanied by a document from the flag State administration issued following an on-board visit by a surveyor duly authorised by the flag State administration, showing that the ship fully conforms to the applicable provisions of the Conventions. The flag State administration shall provide evidence to the competent authority that a visit on board has taken place. 4. The request for the lifting of the access refusal order must also be accompanied, where appropriate, by a document from the classification society which has the ship in class following an on-board visit by a surveyor from the classification society, showing that the ship conforms to the class standards stipulated by that society. The classification society shall provide evidence to the competent authority that a visit on board has taken place. 5. The access refusal order may be lifted only, after the period referred to Article 16 of this Directive has elapsed and following a re-inspection of the ship at an agreed port. If the agreed port is located in a Member State, the competent authority of that State may, at the request of the competent authority which issued the access refusal order, authorise the ship to enter the agreed port in order to carry out the re-inspection. In such cases, no cargo operations shall take place at the port until the refusal of access order has been lifted. 6. If the detention which led to the issue of a refusal of access order included deficiencies in the ship's structure, the competent authority which issued the refusal of access order may require that certain spaces, including cargo spaces and tanks, are made available for examination during the re-inspection. 7. The re-inspection shall be carried out by the competent authority of the Member State that imposed the refusal of access order, or by the competent authority of the port of destination with the agreement of the competent authority of the Member State that imposed the refusal of access order. The competent authority may require up to 14 days notice for the re-inspection. Evidence shall be provided to the satis\u00ad faction of this Member State that the ship fully complies with the applicable requirements of the Conventions. 8. The re-inspection shall consist of an expanded inspection that must cover at least the relevant items of Annex VII.

Measures taken. ANNEX X CRITERIA FOR DETENTION OF A SHIP (referred to in Article 19(3) ) INTRODUCTION Before determining whether deficiencies found during an inspection warrant detention of the ship involved, the inspector must apply the criteria mentioned below in points 1 and 2. Point 3 includes examples of deficiencies that may of themselves warrant detention of the ship involved (see Article 19(4)) . Where the ground for detention is the result of accidental damage suffered on the ship\u2019s voyage to a port, no detention order shall be issued, provided that: (a) due account has been given to the requirements contained in Regulation I/11(c) of SOLAS 74 regarding notification to the flag State administration, the nominated surveyor or the recognised organisation responsible for issuing the relevant certificate; (b) prior to entering a port, the master or shipowner has submitted to the port State control authority details on the circumstances of the accident and the damage suffered and information about the required notification of the flag State administration; EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/249 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(c) appropriate remedial action, to the satisfaction of the authority , is being taken by the ship; and (d) the authority has ensured, having been notified of the completion of the remedial action, that defi\u00ad ciencies which were clearly hazardous to safety, health or the environment have been rectified. 1. MAIN CRITERIA When exercising \u2551 professional judgement as to whether or not a ship should be detained the inspector must apply the following criteria: Timing: Ships which are unsafe to proceed to sea must be detained upon the first inspection irrespective of how much time the ship will stay in port. Criterion: The ship is detained if its deficiencies are sufficiently serious to merit an inspector returning to satisfy himself that they have been rectified before the ship sails. The need for the inspector to return to the ship is a measure of the seriousness of the deficiencies. However, it does not impose such an obligation in every case. It implies that the authority must verify one way or another, preferably by a further visit, that the deficiencies have been rectified before departure. 2. APPLICATION OF MAIN CRITERIA When deciding whether the deficiencies found in a ship are sufficiently serious to merit detention the inspector must assess whether: 1. the ship has relevant, valid documentation; 2. the ship has the crew required in the Minimum Safe Manning Document. During inspection the inspector must further assess whether the ship and/or crew is able to: 3. navigate safely throughout the forthcoming voyage; 4. safely handle, carry and monitor the condition of the cargo throughout the forthcoming voyage; 5. operate the engine room safely throughout the forthcoming voyage; 6. maintain proper propulsion and steering throughout the forthcoming voyage; 7. fight fires effectively in any part of the ship if necessary during the forthcoming voyage; 8. abandon ship speedily and safely and effect rescue if necessary during the forthcoming voyage; 9. prevent pollution of the environment throughout the forthcoming voyage; 10. maintain adequate stability throughout the forthcoming voyage; 11. maintain adequate watertight integrity throughout the forthcoming voyage; 12. communicate in distress situations if necessary during the forthcoming voyage; EN C 8 E/250 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "13. provide safe and healthy conditions on board throughout the forthcoming voyage; 14. provide the maximum amount of information in case of accident. If the answer to any of these assessments is negative, taking into account all deficiencies found, the ship must be seriously considered for detention. A combination of deficiencies of a less serious nature may also warrant the detention of the ship. 3. To assist the inspector in the use of these guidelines, there follows a list of deficiencies, grouped under relevant Conventions and/or codes, which are considered of such a serious nature that they may warrant the detention of the ship involved. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. 3.1. General The lack of valid certificates and documents as required by the relevant instruments. However, ships flying the flag of States not party to a relevant Convention or not having implemented another relevant instrument, are not entitled to carry the certificates provided for by the Convention or other relevant instrument. Therefore, absence of the required certificates should not by itself constitute reason to detain these ships; however, in applying the \u2018no more favourable treatment\u2019 clause, substantial compliance with the provisions is required before the ship sails. 3.2. Areas under SOLAS 74 1. Failure of the proper operation of propulsion and other essential machinery, as well as electrical installations. 2. Insufficient cleanliness of engine room, excessive amount of oily-water mixtures in bilges, insu\u00ad lation of piping including exhaust pipes in engine room contaminated by oil, improper operation of bilge pumping arrangements. 3. Failure of the proper operation of emergency generator, lighting, batteries and switches. 4. Failure of the proper operation of the main and auxiliary steering gear. 5.

Absence, substantial deterioration or failure of proper operation of the cargo deck area fire protection on tankers. 8. Absence, non-compliance or serious deterioration of lights, shapes or sound signals. 9. Absence or failure of the proper operation of the radio equipment for distress and safety communication. 10. Absence or failure of the proper operation of navigation equipment, taking the provisions of SOLAS 74, Regulation V/16.2 into account. 11. Absence of corrected navigational charts, and/or all other relevant nautical publications necessary for the intended voyage, taking into account that a type approved electronic chart display and information system (ECDIS) operating on official data may be used as a substitute for the charts. 12.

Significant areas of damage or corrosion, or pitting of plating and associated stiffening in decks and hull affecting seaworthiness or strength to take local loads, unless proper temporary repairs for a voyage to a port for permanent repairs have been carried out. 2. A recognised case of insufficient stability. 3. The absence of sufficient and reliable information, in an approved form, which by rapid and simple means, enables the master to arrange for the loading and ballasting of his ship in such a way that a safe margin of stability is maintained at all stages and at varying conditions of the voyage, and that the creation of any unacceptable stresses in the ship\u2019s structure are avoided.

Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 1 ), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 2 ), Whereas: (1) Council Directive 94/57/EC of 22 November 1994 on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations ( 3 ) has been significantly amended on several occasions. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity. (2) In view of the nature of the provisions of Directive 94/57/EC it seems appropriate that its provisions be recast in two different Community legal instruments, namely a Directive and a Regulation. (3) In its Resolution of 8 June 1993 on a common policy on safe seas ( 4 ), the Council set the objective of removing all substandard vessels from Community waters and gave priority to Community action designed to secure the effective and uniform implementation of international rules by drawing up common standards for classification societies , defined as ship inspection and survey organisations (hereinafter \u2018recognised organisations\u2019) . (4) Safety and pollution prevention at sea may be effectively enhanced by strictly applying international conventions, codes and resolutions while furthering the objective of freedom to provide services. (5) The control of compliance of ships with the uniform international standards for safety and prevention of pollution of the seas is the responsibility of flag and port States. (6) Member States are responsible for the issuing of international certificates for safety and the prevention of pollution provided for under conventions such as the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1 November 1974 (SOLAS 74), the International Convention on Load Lines of 5 April 1966 and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships of 2 November 1973 (Marpol), and for the implementation of those conventions. (7) In compliance with such conventions all Member States may authorise to a varying extent recognised organisations for the certification of such compliance and may delegate the issue of the relevant certificates for safety and the prevention of pollution. (8) Worldwide a large number of the existing recognised organisations do not ensure either adequate implementation of the rules or the necessary reliability when acting on behalf of national adminis\u00ad trations as they do not have \u2590 adequate structures and experience to enable them to carry out their tasks in a highly professional manner. (9) In addition, these recognised organisations produce and implement rules for the design, construction, maintenance and inspection of ships and they are responsible for inspecting ships on behalf of the flag States and certifying that those ships meet the requirements of the international conventions for the issue of the relevant certificates. To enable them to carry out that duty in a satisfactory manner they need to have strict independence, highly specialised technical competence and rigorous quality management. (10) Recognised organisations should be able to offer their services throughout the Community and compete with each other while providing equal levels of safety and of environmental protection. The necessary professional standards for their activities should therefore be uniformly established and applied across the Community.

        "(11) The issue of the cargo ship safety radio certificate may be entrusted to private bodies having sufficient expertise and qualified personnel. (12) A Member State may restrict the number of recognised organisations it authorises in accordance with its needs, based on objective and transparent grounds, subject to control exercised by the Commission in accordance with a committee procedure. (13) This Directive should ensure freedom to provide services in the Community ; accordingly the Commission should be entitled to negotiate, with those third countries where some of the recognised organisations are located, \u2590 equal treatment for the recognised organisations domiciled in the Community. (14) A tight involvement of the national administrations in ship surveys and in the issue of the related certificates is necessary to ensure full compliance with the international safety rules even if the Member States rely upon recognised organisations, which are not part of their administration for carrying out statutory duties. It is appropriate, therefore, to establish a close working relationship between the administrations and the recognised organisations authorised by them, which may require that the recognised organisations have a local representation on the territory of the Member State on behalf of which they perform their duties. (15) Divergence in terms of financial liability regimes among the recognised organisations working on behalf of the Member States would impede the proper implementation of this Directive. In order to contribute to solving this problem it is appropriate to bring about a degree of harmonisation at Community level of the liability arising out of any marine casualty caused by a recognised organi\u00ad sation, as decided by a court of law, including settlement of a dispute through arbitration procedures. (16) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 1 ). (17) In particular the Commission should be empowered to amend this Directive in order to incorporate subsequent amendments to the international conventions, protocols, codes and resolutions related thereto. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, inter alia by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC. (18) Member States should nevertheless be left with the possibility of suspending \u2590 their authorisation of a recognised organisation for reasons of serious danger to safety or the environment. The Commission should decide without delay, in accordance with a committee procedure, whether any national measure to the above effect should be overruled . (19) Member States should periodically assess the performance of the recognised organisations working on their behalf and provide the Commission and all the other Member States with precise information related to such performance. (20) As port authorities, Member States are required to enhance safety and prevention of pollution in Community waters through priority inspection of ships carrying certificates of organisations which do not fulfil the common criteria, thereby ensuring that ships flying the flag of a third State do not receive more favourable treatment.

        "(21) At present there are no uniform international standards to which all ships must conform either at the building stage or during their entire lifetime, as regards hull, machinery and electrical and control installations. Such standards may be fixed according to the rules of recognised organisations or to equivalent standards to be decided by the national administrations in accordance with the procedure laid down in Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services ( 1 ). (22) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to establish measures to be followed by the Member States in their relationship with organisations entrusted with the inspection, survey and certification of ships, operating in the Community, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (23) The obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive change as compared with the Directive 94/57/EC. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under that Directive. (24) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex I, Part B. (25) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making ( 2 ), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables, illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public. (26) Measures to be followed by recognised organisations are laid down in Regulation (EC) No \u2026/\u2026 of the European Parliament and the Council of \u2026 ( 3 ) [ on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations ] ( 4 ) \u2551 , HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 The purpose of this Directive is: (a) to ensure that Member States effectively and consistently discharge their obligations as flag States in accordance with international conventions; (b) to establish measures to be followed by the Member States in their relationship with recognised organisations which they have entrusted with the inspection, survey and certification of ships for compliance with the international conventions on safety at sea and prevention of marine pollution, while furthering the objective of freedom to provide services. This process includes the development and implementation of safety requirements for hull, machinery and electrical , radiotelephone, and control installations of ships falling under the scope of those international conventions.

The competent administration shall in all cases approve the first issue of the exemption certificates. However, for the cargo ship safety radio certificate these duties may be entrusted to a private body recognised by a competent administration and having sufficient expertise and qualified personnel to carry out specified safety assessment work on radio-communication on its behalf. 6. This Article does not concern the certification of specific items of marine equipment. Article 4 Flag State requirements 1. Prior to allowing the operation of a ship, which has been granted the right to fly its flag, the Member State concerned shall take the appropriate measures to ensure that the ship in question complies with the applicable international rules and regulations. In particular, it shall verify the safety records of the ship by all reasonable means. It shall, if necessary, consult with the administration of the losing flag State in order to establish whether any outstanding deficiencies or safety issues identified by that administration remain unresolved. 2. Whenever a flag State requests information concerning a ship which was previously flying the flag of a Member State, the requested Member State shall promptly provide details of outstanding deficiencies and any other relevant safety-related information to the requesting flag State. 3. When the administration is informed that a ship flying the flag of the Member State concerned has been detained by a port State, it shall oversee the appropriate corrective measures to bring the ship into compliance with the applicable regulations and IMO Conventions.

Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity. (2) In view of the nature of the provisions of Directive 94/57/EC it seems appropriate that its provisions be recast in two different Community legal instruments, namely a Directive and a Regulation. \u2590 (3) Ship inspection and survey organisations should be able to offer their services throughout the Community and compete with each other while providing equal levels of safety and of environmental protection. The necessary professional standards for their activities should therefore be uniformly established and applied across the Community. (4) This objective should be pursued through measures that adequately tie in with the work and activities of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and, where appropriate, build on and complement them . (5) Minimum criteria for recognition of organisations should be laid down with a view to enhancing the safety of, and preventing pollution from, ships. The minimum criteria laid down in Directive 94/57/EC should therefore be strengthened. (6) In order to grant initial recognition to the organisations wishing to be authorised to work on behalf of the Member States, compliance with the minimum criteria laid down in this Regulation could be assessed more effectively in a harmonised and centralised manner by the Commission together with the Member States requesting the recognition.

        "(7) Recognition should be granted only on the basis of the quality and safety performance of the organisation in question . It should be ensured that the extent of that recognition be at all times in keeping with the actual capacity of the organisation concerned. Recognition should furthermore take into account the differences in legal status and corporate structure of recognised organisations while continuing to ensure uniform application of the minimum criteria mentioned previously and the effectiveness of the Community controls. \u2590 (8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 1 ). (9) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to amend this Regulation in order to incorporate subsequent amendments to the international conventions, protocols, codes and resolutions related thereto, to update the minimum criteria in Annex I and to adopt the criteria to measure the effec\u00ad tiveness of the rules and procedures as well as the performance of the recognised organisations as regards the safety of, and the prevention of pollution from, their classed ships. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC. (10) It is of the utmost importance that failure by a recognised organisation to fulfil its obligations can be addressed in a prompt, effective and proportionate manner. The primary objective should be to correct any deficiencies with a view to removing any potential threat to safety or the environment at an early stage. The Commission should therefore be given the necessary powers to require that the recognised organisation undertake the necessary preventive and remedial action, and to impose fines and periodic penalty payments as coercive measures. When exercising these powers, the Commission should do so in a manner that complies with fundamental rights and should ensure that the organisation can make its views known throughout the procedure. (11) In accordance with the Community-wide approach, the decision to withdraw the recognition of an organisation which fails to fulfil the obligations set out in this Regulation if the above measures prove ineffective or the organisation otherwise presents an unacceptable threat to safety or the environment, has to be taken at Community level, and therefore by the Commission, on the basis of a committee procedure. (12) The continuous a posteriori monitoring of the recognised organisations to assess their compliance with this Regulation can be carried out more effectively in a harmonised and centralised manner. Therefore, it is appropriate that the Commission, together with the Member State requesting the recognition, be entrusted with this task on behalf of the Community. (13) As part of the monitoring of the operations of recognised organisations, it is crucial that Commission inspectors have access to ships and ship files regardless of the ship's flag in order to ascertain whether the recognised organisations are complying with the minimum criteria laid down in this Regulation in respect of all ships in their respective classes. (14) The ability of recognised organisations to identify rapidly and correct weaknesses in their rules, processes and internal controls is critical for the safety of the ships they inspect and certify. That ability should be enhanced by means of an independent assessment committee which can propose \u2590 action for the sustained improvement of all recognised organisations and ensure fruitful interaction with the Commission.

        "(15) The rules and procedures of recognised organisations are a key factor for increasing safety and preventing accidents and pollution. Accordingly the recognised organisations have initiated a process that should lead to harmonisation of their rules and procedures. That process should be encouraged and supported by Community legislation, as it should have a positive impact on maritime safety as well as on the competitiveness of the European shipbuilding industry. \u2590 (16) Recognised organisations should be obliged to update their technical standards and enforce them consistently in order to harmonise safety rules and ensure uniform implementation of international rules within the Community. Where the technical standards of recognised organisations are identical or very similar, mutual recognition of certificates for materials, equipment and components should be considered in appropriate cases, taking the most demanding and rigorous standard as the reference. \u2590 (17) Since transparency and exchange of information between interested parties, as well as public right of access to information, are fundamental tools for preventing accidents at sea, recognised organisations should provide all relevant statutory information concerning the conditions of the ships in their class to the port State control authorities and make it available to the general public. (18) In order to prevent ships from changing class to avoid carrying out \u2590 repairs called for by a recognised organisation in its inspection, prior arrangements should be made for the exchange of all relevant information by recognised organisations among themselves concerning the conditions of ships for which a change of class is sought and involve the flag State when necessary. \u2590 (19) The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) established by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 ( 1 ) should provide the necessary support to ensure the application of this Regulation. (20) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of measures to be followed by organisations entrusted with the inspection, survey and certification of ships, operating in the Community, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (21) Measures to be followed by the Member States in their relationship with ship inspection and survey organisations are laid down in Directive \u2026/\u2026/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of \u2026 ( 2 ) [on compliance with flag State requirements and on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations ] ( 3 ) \u2551 , HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 This Regulation establishes measures to be followed by organisations entrusted with the inspection, survey and certification of ships for compliance with the international conventions on safety at sea and prevention of marine pollution, while furthering the objective of freedom to provide services.

        "(2) A revision of Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (Audiovisual Media Services Directive) ( 1 ) was carried out in 2007 with the intention of ensuring optimal conditions of competitiveness and legal certainty for information technologies and media industries and services in the European Union, as well as respect for cultural and linguistic diversity. In this context, a fair and balanced regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services constitutes an essential pillar of the EU audiovisual sector. (3) In that regard, the Commission presented its initial findings in its Communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 29 June 2006 on the review of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communi\u00ad cations networks and services. On the basis of these initial findings, a public consultation was held, which identified the continued lack of an internal market for electronic communications as the most important aspect needing to be addressed. In particular, regulatory fragmentation and inconsistencies between the activities of the national regulatory authorities were found to jeopardise not only the competitiveness of the sector, but also the substantial consumer benefits from cross-border competition. (4) The EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services should therefore be reformed in order to complete the internal market for electronic communications by strengthening the Community mechanism for regulating operators with significant market power in the key markets. \u2590 The reform also includes the definition of an efficient and coordinated spectrum management strategy in order to achieve a Single European Information Space and the reinforcement of provisions for users with disabilities in order to obtain an inclusive information society. (5) A primary objective of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services is to create a sustainable ecosystem for electronic communications based on supply and demand, the former through effective and competitive infrastructure and service markets and the latter through information society developments. (6) A further objective of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services is to progressively reduce ex ante sector specific-rules as competition in markets in elec\u00ad tronic communications develops and, ultimately, for electronic communications to be governed by competition law only. While electronic communications markets have shown strong competitive dynamics in recent years, it is essential that ex ante regulatory obligations only be imposed where there is no effective and sustainable competition. The necessity of the continuation of ex ante regulation should be reviewed no later than three years from the date of transposition of this Directive. (7) In order to ensure a proportionate and suitable approach to varying competitive conditions, national regulatory authorities should be able to define markets on a sub-national basis and to lift regu\u00ad latory obligations in markets or geographic areas where there is effective infrastructure competition. This should apply even where geographic areas are not defined as separate markets. (8) In order to achieve the goals of the Lisbon Agenda it is necessary to give appropriate incentives for investment in high-speed networks that support innovation in content-rich Internet services and strengthen the international competitiveness of the European Union. Such networks have enormous potential to deliver benefits to consumers and businesses across the European Union. It is therefore vital to promote sustainable investment in the development of such networks, while safeguarding competition and boosting consumer choice through regulatory predictability and consistency. EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/293 ( 1 ) OJ L 298, 17.10.1989, p. 23 . Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(9) In its Communication of 20 March 2006 entitled \u2018Bridging the Broadband Gap\u2019 ( 1 ), the Commission acknowledged that there is a territorial divide in the European Union regarding access to high-speed broadband services. Despite the general increase in broadband connectivity, access in various regions is limited on account of high costs resulting from low population densities and remoteness. Commercial incentives to invest in broadband deployment in these areas often turn out to be insufficient. However, technological innovation reduces deployment costs. In order to ensure investment in new technologies in underdeveloped regions, electronic communications regu\u00ad lation should be consistent with other policies, such as state aid policy, structural funds or the aims of wider industrial policy. (10) Investment in research and development is of vital importance for the development of next generation fibre optics networks and for achieving flexible and efficient radio access, which enhances competition and innovation in applications and services for the benefit of consumers. The challenge is to deliver the next generation of ubiquitous and converged network and service infrastructures for electronic communications, information technology and media. (11) Public policy should play a role in complementing the effective functioning of electronic communi\u00ad cations markets, addressing both the supply and demand sides so as to stimulate a virtuous circle where development of better content and services follows from infrastructure deployment, and vice versa. Public intervention should be proportionate, should neither distort competition nor inhibit private investment, should increase incentives to invest and should lower entry barriers. In this respect, public authorities may support the roll-out of future-proof high-capacity infrastructure. In so doing, public support should be given by means of open, transparent and competitive procedures, should not favour any given technology a priori and should provide access to infrastructure on a non-discriminatory basis. (12) The EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services should also promote consumer protection in the electronic communications sector by providing for accurate and comprehensive information by all possible means, by providing for transparency in fees and charges and by providing for high standards in the delivery of services. It should also fully recognise the role of consumer associations in public consultations and ensure that the competent authorities are provided with the powers necessary to prevent bid-rigging and act with the necessary effec\u00ad tiveness to stamp out any instances of fraud. (13) The views of national regulatory authorities and industry stakeholders should be taken into account by the Commission when adopting measures pursuant to this Directive through the use of effective consultation ensuring transparency and proportionality. The Commission should issue detailed consultation documents which explain the different courses of action being considered, and stake\u00ad holders should be given a reasonable time in which to respond. Following the consultation, and after having considered the responses, the Commission should give reasons for the decision it takes in a statement which should include a description of how the views of respondents were taken into account. (14) In order to allow national regulatory authorities to meet the objectives set out in the Framework Directive and the Specific Directives, in particular concerning end-to-end interoperability, the scope of the Framework Directive should be extended to cover radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment as defined in Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity ( 2 ) as well as consumer equipment used for digital television. (15) Without prejudice to Directive 1999/5/EC, it is necessary to clarify the application of aspects of terminal equipment which concern access for disabled end-users so as to ensure interoperability between terminal equipment and electronic communications networks and services. EN C 8 E/294 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 ( 1 ) OJ C 151, 29.6.2006, p. 15. ( 2 ) OJ L 91, 7.4.1999, p. 10. Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(16) Certain definitions should be clarified or changed to take account of market and technological devel\u00ad opments and to eliminate ambiguities identified in implementing the regulatory framework. (17) The activities of national regulatory authorities and of the Commission in the context of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services contribute to the fulfilment of broader public policy objectives in the areas of culture, employment, the environment, social cohesion, regional development and town and country planning. (18) National electronic communications markets will continue to differ within the European Union. It is therefore essential that national regulatory authorities and the Body of European Regulators in Telecom (BERT) possess the powers and knowledge necessary to build a competitive EU ecosystem in electronic communications markets and services while at the same time understanding national and regional differences and complying with the principle of subsidiarity. (19) The independence of the national regulatory authorities should be strengthened in order to ensure a more effective application of the regulatory framework and increase their authority and the predicta\u00ad bility of their decisions. To this end, express provision should be made in national law to ensure that, in the exercise of its tasks, a national regulatory authority is protected against external intervention or political pressure liable to jeopardise its independent assessment of matters coming before it. Such outside influence makes a national legislative body unsuited to act as a national regulatory authority under the regulatory framework. For that purpose rules should be laid down in advance regarding the grounds for the dismissal of the head of the national regulatory authority in order to remove any reasonable doubt as to the neutrality of that body and its imperviousness to external factors. It is important that national regulatory authorities should have their own budget allowing them, in particular, to recruit a sufficient number of qualified staff. In order to ensure transparency, this should be published annually. (20) There has been a wide divergence in the manner in which appeal bodies have applied interim measures to suspend the decisions of the national regulatory authorities. In order to achieve greater consistency of approach common standard s should be applied in line with Community jurisprudence. Given the importance of appeals for the overall working of the regulatory framework, a mechanism should be set up for collecting information on appeals and decisions to suspend decisions taken by the regulatory authorities in all the Member States and for the reporting of that information to the Commission. (21) In order to ensure that national regulatory authorities carry out their regulatory tasks in an effective manner, the data which they gather should include accounting data on the retail markets that are associated with wholesale markets where an operator has significant market power and as such are regulated by the national regulatory authority, and should also include data to enable the national regulatory authority to assess the possible impact of planned upgrades or changes to network topology on the development of competition or on wholesale products made available to other parties. (22) The national consultation provided for under Article 6 of the Framework Directive should be conducted prior to the Community consultation provided for under Article 7 of that Directive, in order to allow the views of interested parties to be reflected in the Community consultation. This would also avoid the need for a second Community consultation in the event of changes to a planned measure as a result of the national consultation. (23) The discretion of national regulatory authorities needs to be reconciled with the development of consistent regulatory practices and the consistent application of the regulatory framework in order to contribute effectively to the development and completion of the internal market. National regulatory authorities should therefore support the internal market activities of the Commission and those of BERT , which should serve as the exclusive forum for cooperation between national regulatory authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities under the regulatory framework. EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/295 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(24) The Community mechanism allowing the Commission to require national regulatory authorities to withdraw planned measures concerning market definition and the designation of operators having significant market power, has contributed significantly to a consistent approach in identifying the circumstances in which ex-ante regulation may be applied and operators are subject to such regulation. However, there is no equivalent mechanism for the remedies to be applied. Monitoring of the market by the Commission and, in particular, the experience of the procedure under Article 7 of the Framework Directive, has shown that inconsistencies in the national regulatory authorities\u2019 application of remedies, even under similar market conditions, undermine the internal market in electronic communications, do not ensure a level playing field between operators established in different Member States, and prevent the realisation of consumer benefits from cross-border competition and services. The Commission should be given powers to require national regulatory authorities to withdraw draft measures on the remedies chosen by national regulatory authorities. In order to ensure the consistent application of the regulatory framework in the Community, the Commission should consult BERT prior to its decision. (25) It is important that the regulatory framework is implemented in a timely manner. When the Commission has taken a decision requiring a national regulatory authority to withdraw a planned measure, national regulatory authorities should submit a revised measure to the Commission. A deadline should be laid down for the notification of the revised measure to the Commission under Article 7 of the Framework Directive so that market players know the duration of the market review and \u2551 to increase legal certainty. (26) Likewise, in view of the need to avoid a regulatory vacuum in a sector characterised by its fast-moving nature, if adoption of the re-notified draft measure would still create a barrier to the single market or be incompatible with Community law, the Commission, after having consulted BERT , should be able to require the national regulatory authority concerned to impose a specific remedy within a specified time. (27) Having regard to the short time limits in the Community consultation mechanism, powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing measures to simplify the procedures for exchanging information between the Commission and national regulatory authorities \u2014 for example in cases concerning stable markets, or involving only minor changes to previously notified measures \u2014 or to allow for the introduction of a notification exemption in order to streamline procedures in certain cases. (28) In line with the objectives of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of \u2551 Persons with Disabilities, the regulatory framework should ensure that all users, including disabled end-users, the elderly, and users with special social needs, have easy access to affordable high quality services. Declaration 22 annexed to the final Act of Amsterdam provides that the institutions of the Community shall take account of the needs of persons with a disability in drawing up measures under Article 95 of the Treaty. (29) Radio frequencies should be considered a scarce public resource that has an important public and market value. It is in the public interest that spectrum is managed as efficiently and effectively as possible from an economic, social and environmental perspective, taking account of the objectives of cultural diversity and media pluralism , and that obstacles to its efficient use are gradually withdrawn. (30) Although spectrum management remains the competence of the Member States, only coordination and, where appropriate, harmonisation at Community level can ensure that spectrum users derive the full benefits of the internal market and that EU interests can be effectively defended world-wide. EN C 8 E/296 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(31) The provisions of this Directive relating to spectrum management should be consistent with the work of international and regional organisations dealing with radio spectrum management, such as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), so as to ensure the efficient management and harmonisation of the use of spectrum across the Community and globally. (32) In order to contribute to the fulfilment of the objectives laid down in Article 8a of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive), a spectrum summit should be convened in 2010, driven by Member States and including the European Parliament, the Commission and all stakeholders. The summit should in particular contribute to ensuring greater consistency in EU spectrum policies, providing guidance regarding the switchover from analogue to digital terrestrial television, and freeing spectrum for new electronic communications services once the digital switchover has taken place. (33) The switchover from analogue to digital terrestrial television should, as a result of the superior transmission efficiency of digital technology, free up a significant amount of spectrum in the European Union, the so-called \u2018digital dividend\u2019. Member States should release their digital dividends as quickly as possible, allowing citizens to benefit from the deployment of new, innovative and competitive services. To this end, obstacles existing at national level for the efficient allocation or reallocation of the digital dividend should be removed, and a more coherent and integrated approach to the allocation of the digital dividend in the Community should be pursued. (34) Radio frequencies should be managed so as to ensure that harmful interference is avoided. The basic concept of harmful interference should therefore be properly defined by reference to existing inter\u00ad nationally agreed frequency plans to ensure that regulatory intervention is limited to the extent necessary to prevent such interference. (35) The current spectrum management and distribution system is generally based on administrative decisions that are insufficiently flexible to cope with technological and economic evolution, in particular with the rapid development of wireless technology and the increasing demand for bandwidth. The undue fragmentation amongst national policies results in increased costs and lost market opportunities for spectrum users, and slows down innovation, to the detriment of the internal market, consumers and the economy as a whole. Moreover, the conditions for access to, and use of, radio frequencies may vary according to the type of operator, while electronic services provided by these operators increasingly overlap, thereby creating tensions between rights holders, discrepancies in the cost of access to spectrum, and potential distortions in the functioning of the internal market. (36) National borders are increasingly irrelevant in determining optimal radio spectrum use. Fragmentation of the management of access to spectrum rights limits investment and innovation and does not allow operators and equipment manufacturers to realise economies of scale, thereby hindering the devel\u00ad opment of an internal market for electronic communications networks and services using radio spectrum. (37) Flexibility in spectrum management and access to spectrum should be increased through technology- and service-neutral authorisations to enable spectrum users to choose the best technologies and services to apply in \u2590 frequency bands available for electronic communications services as identified in national frequency allocation plans and the ITU Radio Regulations (the \u2018principles of technology and service neutrality\u2019). The administrative determination of technologies and services should apply whenever general interest objectives are at stake . EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/297 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(38) Restrictions on the principle of technology neutrality should be appropriate and justified by the need to avoid harmful interference, for example by imposing emission masks and power levels, to ensure the protection of public health by limiting public exposure to electromagnetic fields, to ensure proper sharing of spectrum, in particular where its use is only subject to general authorisations, or \u2590 to comply with a general interest objective in conformity with Community law . (39) Spectrum users should also be able to choose freely the services they wish to offer over the spectrum subject to transitional measures designed to deal with previously acquired rights and the provisions of national frequency allocation plans and the ITU Radio Regulations . Exceptions to the principle of service neutrality which require the provision of a specific service in order to take account of national public policy considerations or to meet clearly defined general interest objectives such as safety of life, the need to promote social, regional and territorial cohesion or the efficient use of radio frequencies and the effective management of spectrum should be permitted where necessary . Those objectives should include the promotion of national audiovisual and media policies , cultural and linguistic diversity and media pluralism as defined in national legislation in conformity with Community law. Except where necessary to protect safety of life, or to ensure that these objectives are fulfilled , exceptions should not result in exclusive use for certain services, but rather should give them priority so that other services or technologies may coexist in the same band insofar as possible. In order that the holder of the authorisation may choose freely the most efficient means to carry the content of services provided over radio frequencies, the content should not be regulated in the authorisation to use radio frequencies. (40) It lies within the competence of the Member States to define the scope and nature of any exception regarding the promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity , national audiovisual and media policies and media pluralism in accordance with their own national law. (41) As the allocation of spectrum to specific technologies or services is an exception to the principles of technology and service neutrality and reduces the freedom to choose the service provided or tech\u00ad nology used, any proposal for such allocation should be transparent and subject to public consultation. (42) In the interests of flexibility and efficiency, national regulatory authorities should, in bands which will be identified on a harmonised basis, also allow spectrum users to freely transfer or lease their usage rights to third parties, which would allow spectrum valuation by the market. In view of their power to ensure effective use of spectrum, national regulatory authorities should take action so as to ensure that trading does not lead to a distortion of competition where spectrum is left unused. \u2590 (43) For internal market purposes it may also be necessary to harmonise at Community level the identi\u00ad fication of tradable frequency bands, the conditions for tradability or the transition to tradable rights in specific bands, a minimum format for tradable rights, requirements to ensure the central availability, accessibility, and reliability of information necessary for spectrum trading, and requirements to protect competition and to prevent spectrum hoarding. The Commission should therefore be given powers to adopt implementing measure s for that harmonisation. Such implementing measures should take due account of whether individual rights of use have been granted on a commercial or non-commercial basis. (44) The introduction of technology and service neutrality and trading for existing spectrum usage rights may require transitional rules, including measures to ensure fair competition, as the new system may entitle certain spectrum users to start competing with spectrum users having acquired their spectrum rights under more onerous terms and conditions. Conversely, where rights have been granted as a derogation from the general rules or according to criteria other than those which are objective, trans\u00ad parent, proportionate and non-discriminatory with a view to achieving general interest objectives, the situation of the holders of such rights should not be improved to the detriment of their new competitors beyond what is necessary to achieve such general interest objectives. Any spectrum that has become unnecessary for the achievement of public interest objectives should be recovered and re-assigned in accordance with the Authorisation Directive. EN C 8 E/298 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(45) In order to promote the functioning of the internal market, and to support the development of cross- border services, the Commission should be able to consult BERT regarding numbering. Furthermore, to enable citizens of the Member States, including travellers and disabled users, \u2551 to reach certain services by using the same recognisable numbers at similar prices in all Member States, the powers of the Commission to adopt technical implementing measures should also cover, where necessary, the applicable tariff principle or mechanism, as well as the establishment of a single EU front-up call number ensuring user-friendly access to those services . (46) Permits issued to undertakings providing electronic communications networks and services allowing them to gain access to public or private property are essential factors for the establishment of electronic communications networks or new network elements. Unnecessary complexity and delay in the procedures for granting rights of way may therefore represent important obstacles to the development of competition. Consequently, the acquisition of rights of way by authorised undertakings should be simplified. National regulatory authorities should be able to coordinate the acquisition of rights of way, making relevant information accessible on their websites. (47) It is necessary to strengthen the powers of the Member States vis-\u00e0-vis holders of rights of way to ensure the entry or roll out of new network in a fair, efficient and environmentally responsible way and independently of any obligation on an operator with significant market power to grant access to its electronic communications network. National regulatory authorities should be able to impose, on a case-by-case basis, the sharing of network elements and associated facilities such as ducts, masts and antennas, entry into buildings and better coordination of civil works. Improving facility sharing can significantly improve competition and lower the overall financial and environmental cost for under\u00ad takings of deploying electronic communications infrastructure, in particular new fibre optic access networks. National regulatory authorities should be able to impose on operators with significant market power obligations to provide a reference offer for granting fair and non-discriminatory access to their ducts. (48) Reliable and secure communication of information over electronic communications networks is increasingly central to the whole economy and society in general. System complexity, technical failure or human error , accidents or attacks may all have consequences for the functioning and availability of the physical infrastructures that deliver important services to EU citizens, including e- Government services. National regulatory authorities should therefore ensure that the integrity and security of public communications networks are maintained. The European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) ( 1 ) should contribute to an enhanced level of security of electronic communications by, among other things, providing expertise and advice, and promoting the exchange of best practice. Both ENISA and the national regulatory authorities should have the necessary means to perform their duties, including powers to obtain sufficient information to be able to assess the level of security of networks or services as well as comprehensive and reliable data about actual security incidents that have had a significant impact on the operation of networks or services. Bearing in mind that the successful application of adequate security is not a one-off exercise but a continuous process of implementation, review and updating, the providers of electronic communications networks and services should be required to take measures to safeguard their integrity and security in accordance with the assessed risks, taking into account the state of the art of such measures. (49) Where there is a need to agree on a common set of security requirements, power should be conferred on the Commission to adopt technical implementing measures to achieve an adequate level of security of electronic communications networks and services in the internal market. ENISA should contribute to the harmonisation of appropriate technical and organisational security measures by providing expert advice. National regulatory authorities should have the power to issue binding instructions relating to the technical implementing measures adopted pursuant to the Framework Directive. In order to perform their duties, they should have the power to investigate and to impose penalties in cases of non-compliance. EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/299 ( 1 ) Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 77, 13.3.2004, p. 1).

        "(50) Experience in the implementation of the regulatory framework indicates that the market into which significant market power is being leveraged is not the source of the problem but rather the object of its effect. Therefore, the significant market power enjoyed on one market should be addressed by national regulatory authorities at source and not on adjacent markets where its effects are felt. (51) In the case of markets that are identified as trans-national, the market review procedure should be simplified and rendered more effective by enabling the Commission, taking into account the opinion of BERT , to designate the undertaking(s) with significant market power and to impose one or more specific obligations, thereby allowing regulatory issues with trans-national characteristics to be addressed directly at Community level. (52) In order to provide market players with certainty as to regulatory conditions, a time limit for market reviews is necessary. It is important to conduct a market analysis on a regular basis and within a reasonable and appropriate timeframe. The timeframe should take account of whether the particular market has previously been subject to market analysis and duly notified. Failure of a national regu\u00ad latory authority to analyse a market within the time limit may jeopardise the internal market, and normal infringement proceedings may not produce their desired effect in time. The Commission should therefore be able to ask BERT to assist in the tasks of the national regulatory authority concerned, in particular to issue an opinion including a draft measure, the analysis of the relevant market and the appropriate obligations that the Commission could then impose. (53) Due to \u2551 a high level of technological innovation and highly dynamic markets in the electronic communications sector there is a need to be able to adapt regulation rapidly in a coordinated and harmonised way at European level, as experience shows that divergence among the national regulatory authorities in the implementation of the regulatory framework may create a barrier to the development of the internal market. Therefore, power should be conferred on the Commission to adopt imple\u00ad menting measures in areas such as the regulatory treatment of new services, numbering, naming and addressing, consumer issues including e-Accessibility, and regulatory accounting measures. (54) One important task assigned to BERT is to issue opinions in relation to cross-border disputes where appropriate. National regulatory authorities should therefore take account of any opinions of BERT in such cases. (55) Experience in the implementation of the regulatory framework indicates that existing provisions empowering national regulatory authorities to impose fines have failed to provide an adequate incentive to comply with regulatory requirements. Adequate enforcement powers can contribute to the timely implementation of the regulatory framework and therefore foster regulatory certainty, which is an important driver for investment. The lack of effective powers in the event of non-compliance applies across the regulatory framework. The introduction of a new provision in the Framework Directive to deal with breaches of obligations under the Framework and Specific Directives should therefore ensure the application of consistent and coherent principles to enforcement and penalties for the whole regulatory framework. (56) Both investment and competition should be encouraged in order to safeguard consumer choice. (57) The existing regulatory framework included certain provisions to facilitate the transition from the old regulatory framework of 1998 to the new 2002 framework. This transition has been completed in all Member States and these measures should be repealed as they are now redundant. EN C 8 E/300 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(58) Annex I to the Framework Directive identified the list of markets to be included in the Recommen\u00ad dation on relevant product and service markets which may warrant ex ante regulation. This Annex should be repealed since its purpose of serving as a basis for drawing up the initial version of the Recommendation ( 1 ) has been fulfilled. (59) Annex II to the Framework Directive listed the criteria to be used by the national regulatory authorities when assessing joint dominance in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 14(2) of that Directive. That Annex may be misleading for national regulatory authorities conducting market analysis. Furthermore, the concept of joint dominance also depends on the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities . Annex II should therefore be amended . (60) The purpose of functional separation, whereby the vertically integrated operator is required to establish operationally separate business entities, is to ensure the provision of fully equivalent access products to all downstream operators, including the vertically integrated operator\u2019s own downstream divisions. Functional separation may have the capacity to improve competition in several relevant markets by significantly reducing the incentive for discrimination and by making it easier for compliance with non-discrimination obligations to be verified and enforced. \u2590 In order to avoid distortions of competition in the internal market, proposals for functional separation should be approved in advance by the Commission. (61) The implementation of functional separation should not prevent appropriate coordination mechanisms between \u2551 different separate business entities in order to ensure that the economic and management supervision rights of the parent company are protected. (62) Continuing integration of the internal market in electronic communications networks and services requires better coordination in the application of the ex ante regulation provided for by the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services. (63) Where a vertically integrated undertaking chooses to transfer a substantial part or all of its local access network assets to a separate legal entity under different ownership or by establishing a separate business entity for dealing with access products, the national regulatory authority should assess the effect of the intended transaction on all existing regulatory obligations imposed on the vertically integrated operator in order to ensure the compatibility of any new arrangements with Directive 2002/19/EC (Access Directive) and Directive 2002/22/EC (Universal Service Directive). The national regulatory authority concerned should undertake a new analysis of the markets in which the segregated entity operates, and impose, maintain, amend or withdraw obligations accordingly. To this end, the national regulatory authority should be able to request information from the undertaking. (64) While it is appropriate in some circumstances for a national regulatory authority to impose obligations on operators that do not have significant market power in order to achieve goals such as end-to-end connectivity or interoperability of services, or in order to promote efficiency and sustainable competition and to ensure the maximum benefit for end-users , it is however necessary to ensure that such obligations are imposed in conformity with the regulatory framework and in particular its notification procedures. (65) The Commission has the power to adopt implementing measures with a view to adapting the conditions for access to digital television and radio services set out in Annex I to market and tech\u00ad nological developments. This is also the case for the minimum list of items in Annex II that must be made public to meet the obligation of transparency. (66) The Commission should submit a proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council for the adoption of those harmonisation measures for the implementation of Community electronic communications policy which go beyond technical implementing measures. EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/301 ( 1 ) Commission Recommendation of 11 February 2003 on Relevant Product and Service Markets within the electronic communications sector susceptible to ex ante regulation in accordance with Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on a common regulatory framework for electronic communication networks and services (OJ L 114, 8.5.2003, p. 45) . Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(67) Facilitating access to radio frequencies resources for market players will contribute to removing the barriers to market entry. Moreover, technological progress is reducing the risk of harmful interference in certain frequency bands and therefore reducing the need for individual rights of use. Conditions for using spectrum to provide electronic communication services should therefore normally be laid down in general authorisations unless individual rights are necessary, considering the use of the spectrum, to protect against harmful interference or to meet a specific general interest objective. Decisions on the need for individual rights should be made in a transparent and proportionate manner. (68) The introduction of the requirements of service and technology neutrality in assignment and allocation decisions, together with the increased possibility to transfer rights between undertakings, should increase the freedom and means to deliver electronic communications and audiovisual media services to the public, thereby also facilitating the achievement of general interest objectives. However , certain general interest obligations imposed on broadcasters for the delivery of audiovisual media services may require the use of specific criteria for spectrum allocation where this appears essential in order to meet a specific general interest objective set out in national law. Procedures associated with the pursuit of general interest objectives should in all circumstances be transparent, objective, proportionate and non-discriminatory. (69) Any exemption, full or partial , from the obligation to pay the fees or charges set for the use of \u2551 spectrum should be objective and transparent and based on other general interest obligations set out in national law . (70) Considering its restrictive impact on free access to radio frequencies, the validity of an individual right of use that is not tradable should be limited in time. Where rights of use contain provision for renewing their validity, Member States should first carry out a review, including a public consultation, taking into account market, coverage and technological developments. In view of spectrum scarcity, individual rights granted to undertakings should be regularly reviewed. In carrying out this review, Member States should balance the interests of the rights holders with the need to foster the intro\u00ad duction of spectrum trading as well as the more flexible use of spectrum through general authori\u00ad sations where possible. (71) National regulatory authorities should have the power to ensure effective use of spectrum and numbers and, where spectrum or numbering resources are left unused, to take action to prevent anti- competitive hoarding, which can hinder new market entry. (72) Removing legal and administrative barriers to a general authorisation or rights of use for spectrum or numbers with European implications should favour technology and service development and contribute to improving competition. While the coordination of technical conditions for the avail \u00ad ability and efficient use of radio frequencies is organised pursuant to the Decision No 676/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision) ( 1 ), it may also be necessary, in order to achieve internal market objectives, to coordinate or harmonise the selection procedures and conditions applicable to rights and authorisations in certain bands, to rights of use for numbers and to general authorisations. This applies in particular to electronic communications services that by their nature have an internal market dimension or cross-border potential, such as satellite services, the development of which would be hampered by discrepancies in spectrum assignment between Member States or between the European Union and third countries, taking into account the decisions of the ITU and the CEPT . The Commission, assisted by the Communications Committee and taking the utmost account of the opinion of BERT , should therefore be able to adopt technical implementing measures to achieve such objectives. Implementing measures adopted by the Commission may require Member States to make available rights of use for spectrum and/or numbers throughout their territory and where necessary to withdraw any other existing national rights of use. In such cases, Member States should not grant any new right of use for the relevant spectrum band or number range under national procedures.

        "(73) Technological and market developments have made it possible to deploy electronic communications services extending across the geographical frontiers of Member States. Article 16 of the Authorisation Directive required the Commission to review the functioning of the national authorisation systems and the development of cross-border service provision within the Community. The provisions of Article 8 of the Authorisation Directive concerning the harmonised assignment of radio frequencies have proved to be ineffective in coping with the needs of an undertaking wishing to provide services on a cross- Community basis and should therefore be amended. (74) While the granting of authorisations and the monitoring of compliance with usage conditions should remain the responsibility of each Member State, Member States should refrain from imposing any further conditions, criteria or procedures that would restrict, alter or delay the correct implementation of a harmonised or coordinated selection or authorisation procedure. Where justified to facilitate their implementation, such coordination or harmonisation measures could include transitional derogations or, in the case of spectrum, transitional spectrum sharing mechanisms that would exempt a Member State from the application of such measures, provided that this would not create undue differences in the competitive or regulatory situations between Member States. (75) National regulatory authorities should be able to take effective action to monitor and secure compliance with the terms and conditions of the general authorisation or of rights of use, including the power to impose effective financial penalties and/or administrative sanctions in the event of breaches of those terms and conditions. (76) The conditions that may be attached to authorisations should cover specific conditions governing accessibility for users with disabilities and the need of public authorities and emergency services to communicate between themselves and with the general public before, during and after major disasters. Also, considering the importance of technical innovation, Member States should be able to issue authorisations to use spectrum for experimental purposes, subject to specific restrictions and conditions strictly justified by the experimental nature of such rights. (77) Regulation (EC) No 2887/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on unbundled access to the local loop ( 1 ) has proved to be effective in the initial stage of market opening. The Framework Directive calls upon the Commission to monitor the transition from the regulatory framework of 1998 to the 2002 framework and to bring forward proposals to repeal that Regulation at an appropriate time. Under the 2002 framework, national regulatory authorities have a duty to analyse the market for wholesale unbundled access to metallic loops and sub-loops for the purpose of providing broadband and voice services as defined in the Recommendation on Relevant Product and Service Markets. Since all Member States have analysed this market at least once and the appropriate obligations based on the 2002 framework are in place, Regulation (EC) No 2887/2000 has become unnecessary and should therefore be repealed. (78) Measures necessary for the implementation of the Framework, Access and Authorisation Directives should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 2 ). EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/303 ( 1 ) OJ L 336, 30.12.2000, p. 4. ( 2 ) OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23. \u2551 . Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(79) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing measures in relation to notifications under Article 7 of the Framework Directive; harmonisation in the fields of spectrum and numbering as well as in matters related to security of networks and services; the identification of transnational markets; the implementation of \u2551 standards; and the harmonised application of the provisions of the regulatory framework. Power should also be conferred to adopt implementing measures to update Annexes I and II to the Access Directive to market and technological developments and for adopting implementing measures to harmonise the authorisation rules, procedures and conditions for the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of those Directives by supplementing them with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.

(2) The 2002 regulatory framework for electronic communications establishes a system of regulation undertaken by national regulatory authorities (\u2018NRAs\u2019) and provides for those authorities to cooperate with each other and with the Commission in order to ensure the development of consistent regulatory practice and the consistent application across the Community of the regulatory framework but leaving room for regulatory competition between the NRAs in light of specific national market conditions . \u2590 (3) NRAs exercise considerable discretion in implementing the regulatory framework reflecting their expert knowledge of local market conditions, but this discretion has to be reconciled with the need to ensure the development of coherent regulatory practice and the consistent application of the regulatory framework in order to contribute effectively to the development and completion of the internal market. (4) The Body of European Regulators in Telecom (\u2018BERT\u2019) should be established to accomplish coor\u00ad dination between NRAs of Members States without harmonising existing regulatory approaches to a degree which undermines regulatory competition. (5) In view of th e need to apply the relevant rules consistently in all Member States, the Commission established the European Regulators Group (ERG) by Commission Decision 2002/627/EC ( 8 ) to advise and assist the Commission in consolidating the internal market and, more generally, to provide an interface between NRAs and the Commission. (6) The ERG has made a positive contribution by facilitating moves towards consistent regulatory practice, in so far as this has proved possible. By its nature, however, the ERG is an informal grouping relying essentially on voluntary cooperation whose existing institutional status does not reflect the important responsibilities exercised by the NRAs in implementing the regulatory framework.

        "(7) A more substantial institutional basis is necessary for the establishment of a body with a clearly defined set of competencies, to bring together the expertise and experience of the NRAs , taking account of the need for this body to exercise \u2590 authority in the eyes of its members and for the sector to be regulated through the quality of its output. (8) The need to enhance the mechanisms for ensuring consistent regulatory practice in order to complete the internal market in electronic communications and services has been underlined by the findings of the Commission\u2019s reports of 20 February 2006 and of 29 March 2007 on the implementation of the 2002 regulatory framework ( 1 ) and by the public consultation on the Communication of the Commission of 29 June 2006 to the Council, the European Parliament the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the Review of the EU Regulatory Framework for electronic communications networks and services. These identified the continuing lack of an internal market for electronic communications as the most important issue that needed to be addressed by the reform of the regulatory framework. Regulatory fragmentation and inconsistencies resulting from the loosely coordinated activities of the NRAs risk jeopardising the competitiveness of the sector as well as the substantial consumer benefits resulting from cross-border competition and trans-national and even cross-Community services. (9) In particular, delays in carrying out market analyses pursuant to Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive), divergent approaches by NRAs towards the imposition of obligations designed to remedy a lack of effective competition found by the market analysis, the heterogeneous conditions attached to rights of use, the varying selection procedures for cross-Community services, different numbers within the Community for cross-Community services, and problems faced by NRAs in dealing with cross- border disputes lead to inefficient solutions and create obstacles to the internal market. (10) The current approach to developing greater consistency among NRAs by exchanging information and knowledge on practical experience has proved to be successful in the short term following its deployment. However, more intense coordination between all regulatory authorities at national and European level will be required to understand and further develop the internal market in electronic communication services in order to enhance regulatory consistency. (11) This calls for the establishment of a new \u2590 body, BERT. BERT would make an effective contribution to furthering the completion of the internal market through the assistance it provides to the Commission and NRAs . It would operate as a point of reference and would establish confidence by virtue of its independence, the quality of the advice it delivers and the information it disseminates, the transparency of its procedures and methods of operation, and its diligence in performing the tasks assigned to it. (12) BERT should, through the pooling of expertise, reinforce the capacities of the NRAs without replacing their existing functions or duplicating work already being undertaken, for the further benefit of assisting the Commission in the execution of its responsibilities. (13) BERT is to replace the ERG and act as an exclusive forum for cooperation among NRAs and between those authorities and the Commission, in the exercise of the full range of their responsibilities under the regulatory framework. (14) BERT should be established within the Community\u2019s existing institutional structure and balance of powers. It should be independent in relation to technical matters and have legal, administrative and financial autonomy. To that end, it is necessary \u2590 that it should be a Community body having legal personality and exercising the tasks conferred on it by this Regulation. (15) BERT should build on national and Community efforts and therefore perform its tasks in full cooperation with NRAs and the Commission, and be open to contacts with industry, consumer groups, cultural interest groups and other relevant stakeholders. EN C 8 E/340 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 ( 1 ) OJ C 104, 3.5.2006, p. 19 and OJ C 191, 17.8.2007, p. 17. Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(16) BERT has \u2590 an important role to play in the mechanisms envisaged for consolidating the internal market for electronic communications and for carrying out market analyses in certain circumstances. (17) BERT should accordingly advise the Commission and the NRAs, as well as the European Parliament, at its request , in accordance with the Community regulatory framework for electronic communi\u00ad cations and thereby assist in the effective implementation of that framework . \u2590 18) BERT\u2019s annual review would identify best practice and remaining bottlenecks and would contribute to improving the level of benefits to citizens travelling in the European Union. (19) In the context of pursuing the aims of Decision No 676/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision) ( 1 ), the Commission may seek the independent expert advice of BERT, where appropriate , on the use of \u2551 radio frequencies in the Community. This advice could involve specific technical investigations, as well as economic or social impact assessment and analysis of frequencies polic ies . It could also include matters relating to the implementation of Article 4 of Decision No 676/2002/EC, where BERT may be asked to provide advice to the Commission on the results obtained under Commission mandates to the European Conference of Postal and Telecom\u00ad munications Administrations (CEPT). (20) While the electronic communications sector is a key sector in the move towards a more advanced European knowledge-based economy, and technological and market developments have increased the potential for the deployment of electronic communications services beyond the geographical boundaries of individual Member States, there is a risk that the existence of differing legal and regulatory conditions for the deployment of those services under national laws will increasingly hold back the provision of such cross-border services. \u2590 (21) The Commission has recognised the global and trans-border nature of the global telecommuni\u00ad cations market, noting that this market is different from telecommunications services provided merely on a national basis and that a single market for all global telecommunications services (GTSs) is assumed which has to be distinguished from merely national telecommunications services. GTSs are a particular case where harmonising conditions of authorisation might be necessary. It is generally recognised that these services, consisting of managed business data and voice services for multinational companies with locations in different countries, and often different continents, are inherently cross-border and, within Europe, pan-European. BERT should develop a common regu\u00ad latory approach so that the economic benefits of integrated, seamless services can accrue to all parts of Europe. (22) Where disputes with a cross-border nature arise between undertakings in respect of rights or obli\u00ad gations under the regulatory framework for electronic communications, BERT should be able to investigate those dispute s and to advise the NRAs concerned on the most appropriate means of resolving them , in accordance with the provisions of the regulatory framework. (23) Investment and innovation are strongly linked in the electronic communications sector. BERT should contribute to the development of best regulatory practice and consistency in the application of regulation in the electronic communications sector by fostering the exchange of information between national authorities and by making appropriate information available to the public in an easily accessible manner. BERT should be able to address economic and technical matters and to access the most up-to-date information available in order to be able to respond to the economic and technical challenges posed by the developing information society \u2590 . \u2590 EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/341 ( 1 ) OJ L 108, 24.4.2002, p. 1. Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(24) \u2590 In order to improve the transparency of retail prices for making and receiving regulated roaming calls within the Community and to help roaming customers make decisions on the use of their mobile telephones while abroad, BERT should ensure that up-to-date information on the application of Regulation (EC) No 717/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2007 on roaming on public mobile telephone networks within the Community ( 1 ) \u2551 is made available to interested parties and should publish the results of such monitoring on an annual basis. (25) BERT should also be able to commission studies necessary for the accomplishment of its tasks, while ensuring its links with the Commission and the Member States prevent duplication of effort. \u2590 (26) The structure of BERT should be lean and suitable for the tasks it is to perform. It should be adapted to meet the specific needs of the Community system for the regulation of electronic communications. In particular, the specific role of NRAs and their independent nature , both at national and at European level, should be fully respected . (27) BERT should have the necessary powers to perform its functions in an efficient and, above all, independent manner. Reflecting the situation on a national level, the Board of Regulators should therefore act independently from any market interest and should not seek or take instructions from any government or other public or private entity. (28) The smooth functioning of BERT requires its Managing Director to be appointed on the grounds of merit and documented administrative and managerial skills, as well as competence and experience relevant to electronic communications networks, services and markets and that he/she performs his/her duties with complete independence and flexibility as to the organisation of the internal functioning of BERT . The Managing Director should ensure the efficient execution of BERT\u2019s tasks in an inde\u00ad pendent manner. (29) In order to ensure that the tasks of BERT are carried out effectively, its Managing Director should be entrusted with the necessary powers to adopt all opinions, subject to the assent of the Board of Regulators, and to ensure that BERT works in accordance with the general principles laid down to this end. \u2590 (30) In addition to its operating principles based on independence and transparency, BERT should be \u2590 open to contacts with, inter alia , industry, consumers, trade unions, public sector bodies, research centres and other interested stakeholders. Where appropriate, BERT should assist the Commission in the dissemination and exchange of best practice among undertakings. (31) BERT\u2019s procedures should therefore ensure that it has access to specialist expertise and experience in the electronic communications sector, particularly in areas of technical complexity and rapid change \u2590 . \u2590 (32) In order to guarantee the full autonomy and independence of BERT , it should receive an autonomous budget. Whilst one third of its funding should come from the general budget of the European Union, the other two thirds should be provided by NRAs. Member States should ensure that NRAs have adequate and unconditional funding for this purpose. This method of financing should be without prejudice to BERT\u2019s independence of both the Member States and the Commission. (33) BERT should, where appropriate, consult interested parties and provide them with an opportunity to comment on draft measures within a reasonable period. EN C 8 E/342 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 ( 1 ) OJ L 171, 29.6.2007, p. 32. Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(34) The Commission should be able to take the necessary measures in case undertakings fail to provide the information that is necessary for BERT to achieve its tasks effectively. Also, Member States should ensure that they have an appropriate framework for imposing on undertakings effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for non-compliance with obligations arising from this Regulation. (35) Within its scope, in pursuing its objectives and in the performance of its tasks, NRAs should ensure that BERT complies in particular with the provisions applicable to the Community institutions regarding the treatment of sensitive documents. Where relevant, it is appropriate to ensure a coherent and secure information exchange in the framework of this Regulation. (36) NRAs should ensure that BERT applies the relevant Community legislation concerning public access to documents as set out in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents ( 1 ) and the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data as set out in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data ( 2 ). (37) By 1 January 2014, a review should take place to evaluate whether there is a need to extend the mandate of BERT. In case an extension is justified, budgetary and procedural regulations, as well as human resources, should be reviewed, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: CHAPTER I SUBJECT-MATTER, SCOPE, DEFINITIONS AND TASKS Article 1 Subject-matter and scope 1.

        "Whereas: (1) The functioning of Directives 2002/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (Access Directive) ( 1 ), 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authori\u00ad sation Directive) ( 2 ), 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) ( 3 ), 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users\u2019 rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) ( 4 ) and 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) ( 5 ) , which constitute the existing regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services , is subject to periodic review by the Commission, with a view in particular to determining the need for modification in the light of technological and market developments. (2) In that regard, the Commission presented its findings in its Communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 29 June 2006 on the Review of the EU Regulatory Framework for electronic communi\u00ad cations networks and services. (3) The reform of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and service, including the reinforcement of provisions for users with disabilities, represents a key step towards achieving a Single European Information Space and at the same time an inclusive information society. These objectives are included in the strategic framework for the development of the information society as described in the \u2551 Communication of the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 1 June 2005 entitled \u2018i2010 \u2013 A European Information Society for growth and employment\u2019. (4) The universal service is a protective network for people whose financial resources, geographical location or special social needs do not permit them to access the basic services available to the majority of citizens. The basic universal service obligation laid down in Directive 2002/22/EC is to provide users who so request with a connection to the public telephone network from a fixed location and at an affordable price. As a result, it addresses neither mobile services nor broadband access to the Internet. This basic obligation is now confronted by technological and market developments in which mobile communications may be the primary form of access in many areas and networks are increasingly adopting the technology associated with mobile and broadband communications. These developments raise a need to assess whether the technical, social and economic conditions justifying the inclusion of mobile communications and broadband access in the universal service obligation are fulfilled, as well as related financing aspects. To this end, the Commission will present, no later than autumn 2008, a review of the scope of the universal service obligation and proposals for reform of Directive 2002/22/EC to meet the appropriate public interest objectives. That review will take account of economic competitiveness and include an analysis of social, commercial and technological conditions and of the risk of social exclusion. It will also address the technical and economic viability, estimated cost, cost allocation and funding models for any redefined universal service obligation. As questions relating to the scope of the universal service obligation will therefore be fully dealt with in that separate procedure, this Directive only deals with other aspects of Directive 2002/22/EC.

( 5 ) OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37. Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(5) For the sake of clarity and simplicity, the present act only deals with the amendments to Directives 2002/22/EC and 2002/58/EC. (6) Without prejudice to Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity ( 1 ) , and in particular the disability requirements laid down in Article 3(3)(f) thereof, certain aspects of terminal equipment, including equipment intended for disabled users, should be brought within the scope of Directive 2002/22/EC in order to facilitate access to networks and the use of services. Such equipment currently includes receive-only radio and television terminal equipment as well as special terminal devices for hearing-impaired users. (7) Member States should introduce measures to promote the creation of a market for widely available products and services incorporating facilities for disabled users. This can be achieved inter alia by referring to European standards, by introducing electronic accessibility (eAccessibility) requirements for public procurement procedures and the provision of services relating to calls for tender, and by implementing legislation upholding the rights of the disabled. (8) Definitions need to be adjusted so as to conform to the principle of technology neutrality and to keep pace with technological development. In particular, conditions for the provision of a service should be separated from the actual definitional elements of a publicly available telephone service, i.e. an elec\u00ad tronic communications service available to the public for originating and receiving, directly or indirectly via carrier selection or pre-selection or resale, national and/or international calls and means of communication specifically intended for disabled users using text relay or total conver\u00ad sation services through a number or numbers in a national or international telephone numbering plan , whether such a service is based on circuit switching or packet switching technology. It is the nature of such a service that it is bidirectional, enabling both parties to communicate . A service which does not fulfil all these conditions , such as for example a \u2018click-through\u2019 application on a customer service website, is not a publicly available telephone service. (9) It is necessary to clarify the application of certain provisions to take account of situations where a service provider resells or re-brands publicly available telephone services provided by another under\u00ad taking. (10) As a result of technological and market evolutions, networks are increasingly moving to the \u2018Internet Protocol\u2019 (IP) technology and consumers are increasingly able to choose between a range of competing voice service providers. Therefore, Member States should be able to separate universal service obli\u00ad gations concerning the provision of a connection to the public communications network at a fixed location from the provision of a publicly available telephone service (including calls to emergency services via the number \u2018112\u2019). Such separation should not affect the scope of universal service obligations defined and reviewed at Community level. Member States that use other national emergency numbers besides \u2018112\u2019 may impose on undertakings similar obligations for access to those national emergency numbers. (11) National regulatory authorities should be able to monitor the evolution and the level of retail tariffs for services that fall under the scope of universal service obligations even when a Member State has not yet designated an undertaking to provide universal service. (12) Redundant obligations designed to facilitate the transition from the old regulatory framework of 1998 to the one of 2002 should be deleted, together with other provisions that overlap with and duplicate those laid down in Directive 2002/21/EC. EN C 8 E/362 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 ( 1 ) OJ L 91, 7.4.1999, p. 10. Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(13) The requirement to provide a minimum set of leased lines at retail level, which was necessary to ensure the continued application of provisions of the regulatory framework of 1998 in the field of leased lines, which was not yet sufficiently competitive at the time the 2002 framework entered into force, is no longer necessary and should be repealed. (14) Continuing to impose carrier selection and carrier pre-selection directly by Community legislation could hamper technological progress. These remedies should rather be imposed by national regulatory authorities as a result of market analysis in accordance with the procedures in Directive 2002/21/EC. (15) The provisions on contracts should apply not only to consumers but also to other end-users, primarily micro enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which may prefer a contract adapted to consumer needs. To avoid unnecessary administrative burdens on providers and complexity related to the definition of SMEs, the provisions on contracts should not apply auto\u00ad matically to those other end-users, but only where they so request. Member States should take appropriate measures to promote awareness amongst SMEs of this possibility. (16) Providers of electronic communications services should ensure that their customers are adequately informed as to whether or not access to emergency services and caller location information is provided, and are given clear and transparent information in the initial customer contract and at regular intervals thereafter, for example in customer billing information. This information should include any limitations as to territorial coverage, on the basis of the planned technical operating parameters of the service and the available infrastructure. Where the service is not provided over a switched telephony network, the information should also include the level of reliability of the access and of caller location information compared to a service that is provided over a switched telephony network, taking into account current technology and quality standards, as well as any quality of service parameters specified under Directive 2002/22/EC. Voice calls remain the most robust and reliable form of access to emergency services. Other means of contact, such as text messaging, may be less reliable and may suffer from lack of immediacy. Member States should however, if they deem it appropriate, be free to promote the development and implementation of other means of access to emergency services which are capable of ensuring access equivalent to voice calls. Customers should also be kept well informed of possible types of action that the provider of electronic communications service may take to address security threats or in response to a security or integrity incident, since such actions could have a direct or indirect impact on the customer's data, privacy or other aspects of the service provided. (17) With respect to terminal equipment, the customer contract should specify any restrictions imposed by the provider on the customer's use of such equipment, such as by way of \u2018SIM-locking\u2019 mobile devices, and any charges due on termination of the contract, whether before or on the agreed expiry date, including any cost imposed in order to retain the equipment. (18) Without imposing any obligation on the provider to take action over and above what is required under Community law, the customer contract should also specify the type of action, if any, the provider might take in case of security or integrity incidents, threats or vulnerabilities, as well as any arrangements implemented by the provider to provide compensation if such events occur. (19) In order to address public interest issues with respect to the use of communications services, and to encourage protection of the rights and freedoms of others, the relevant national authorities should be able to produce and have disseminated, with the aid of providers, public interest information related to the use of communications services. This information should include public interest warnings regarding copyright infringement, other unlawful uses and dissemination of harmful content, and advice and means of protection against risks to personal security, which may for example arise from disclosure of personal information in certain circumstances, privacy and personal data. The information could be coordinated by way of the cooperation procedure estab\u00ad lished by Article 33(2a) of Directive 2002/22/EC. Such public interest information should be EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/363 Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "updated whenever necessary and should be presented in easily comprehensible printed and electronic formats, as determined by each Member State, and on the websites of the national public authorities. National regulatory authorities should be able to oblige providers to disseminate this standardised information to all their customers in a manner deemed appropriate by the national regulatory authorities. Significant additional costs incurred by service providers for dissemination of such information should be agreed between the providers and the relevant authorities and met by those authorities. The information should also be included in contracts. (20) The right of subscribers to withdraw from their contracts without penalty refers to modifications in contractual conditions which are imposed by the providers of electronic communications networks and/or services. (21) Community rules on consumer protection and national rules in conformity with Community law should apply to Directive 2002/22/EC without exception. (22) End-users should decide what lawful content they want to be able to send and receive, and which services, applications, hardware and software they want to use for such purposes, without prejudice to the need to preserve the integrity and security of networks and services. A competitive market with transparent offerings as provided for in Directive 2002/22/EC should ensure that end-users are able to access and distribute any lawful content and to use any lawful applications and/or services of their choice, as stated in Article 8 of Directive 2002/21/EC. Given the increasing importance of electronic communications for consumers and businesses, users should in any case be fully informed of any restrictions and/or limitations imposed on the use of electronic communications services by the service and/or network provider. Such information should, at the option of the provider, specify the type of content, application or service concerned, individual applications or services, or both. Depending on the technology used and the type of restriction and/or limitation, such restrictions and/or limitations may require user consent under Directive 2002/58/EC. (23) A competitive market should also ensure that users are able to have the quality of service they require, but in particular cases it may be necessary to ensure that public communications networks attain minimum quality levels so as to prevent degradation of service, usage restrictions and/or limitations and the slowing of traffic. Where there is a lack of effective competition, national regulatory authorities should use the remedies available to them under the directives establishing the regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services to ensure that users\u2019 access to particular types of content or applications is not unreasonably restricted. It should also be possible for national regulatory authorities to issue guidelines setting minimum quality of service requirements under Directive 2002/22/EC and to take other measures where such other remedies have, in their judgement, not been effective with regard to the interests of users and all other relevant circumstances. Such guidelines or measures could include the provision of a basic tier of unrestricted services. (24) In the absence of relevant rules of Community law, content, applications and services should be deemed lawful or harmful in accordance with national substantive and procedural law. It is the task of the relevant authorities of the Member States, not of providers of electronic communications networks or services, to decide, in accordance with due process, whether or not content, applications and services are lawful or harmful. Directive 2002/22/EC is without prejudice to Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (Directive on electronic commerce) ( 1 ) , which inter alia contains a \u2018mere conduit\u2019 rule for inter\u00ad mediary service providers. Directive 2002/22/EC does not require providers to monitor information transmitted over their networks or to bring legal proceedings against their customers on grounds of such information, nor does it make providers liable for that information. Responsibility for punitive action or criminal prosecution remains with the relevant law enforcement authorities. (25) Directive 2002/22/EC is without prejudice to reasonable and non-discriminatory network management by providers. EN C 8 E/364 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 ( 1 ) OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1. Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(26) Since inconsistent remedies will significantly impair the achievement of the internal market, the Commission should assess any guidelines or other measures adopted by national regulatory authorities for possible regulatory intervention across the Community and, if necessary, adopt technical implementing measures in order to achieve consistent application throughout the Community. (27) The availability of transparent, up-to-date and comparable tariffs is a key element for consumers in competitive markets with several providers offering services. Consumers of electronic communications services should be able to easily compare prices of various services offered on the market based on tariff information published in an easily accessible form. In order to allow them to make price comparisons easily, national regulatory authorities should have powers to require from operators better tariff transparency and to ensure that third parties have the right to use without charge publicly available tariffs published by undertakings providing electronic communications services. They should also , themselves or through third parties, make price guides available where the market has not provided them free of charge or at a reasonable price . Operators should not be entitled to any remuneration for such use of tariffs where they have already been published and thus belong to the public domain. In addition, users should be adequately informed of the price involved or the type of service offered before they purchase a service, in particular if a freephone number is subject to any additional charges. National regulatory authorities should be able to require that such information is provided generally, and, for certain categories of services determined by them, prior to connecting the call. When determining the categories of call requiring pricing information prior to connection, national regulatory authorities should take due account of the nature of the service, the pricing conditions which apply to it and whether it is offered by a provider who is not a provider of electronic communications services. (28) Customers should be informed of their rights with respect to the use of their personal information in directories of subscribers, and in particular of the purpose or purposes of such directories, as well as their right, free of charge, not to be included in a public subscriber directory, as provided for in Directive 2002/58/EC. Where systems exist allowing information to be included in the directory database but not disclosed to users of directory services customers should also be informed of that possibility. (29) The Member States should introduce single information points for all user queries. These information points, which could be administered by the national regulatory authorities together with consumer associations, should also be able to provide legal assistance in case of disputes with operators. Access to these information points should be free of charge and users should be informed of their existence by regular information campaigns. (30) In future IP networks where provision of a service may be separated from provision of the network, Member States should determine the most appropriate steps to be taken to ensure the availability of publicly available telephone services provided using public communications networks and uninter\u00ad rupted access to emergency services in the event of catastrophic network breakdown or in cases of force majeure. (31) Operator assistance services cover a range of different services for end-users. The provision of such services should be left to commercial negotiations between providers of public communications networks and operator assistance services, as is the case for any other customer support service, and there is no need to continue to mandate their provision. Therefore, the corresponding obligation should be repealed. (32) Directory enquiry services should be, and frequently are, provided in competition, pursuant to Article 5 of Commission Directive 2002/77/EC of 16 September 2002 on competition in the markets for electronic communications networks and services ( 1 ) . Wholesale measures ensuring the inclusion of end-user data (both fixed and mobile) in databases, the cost-oriented supply of that data to service providers and the provision of network access in cost-oriented, reasonable and transparent conditions should be in place in order to ensure that end users benefit fully from competition with the ultimate aim of enabling the removal of retail regulation from these services. EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/365 ( 1 ) OJ L 249, 17.9.2002, p. 21. Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(33) End-users should be able to call and access the emergency services provided using any telephone service capable of originating voice calls through a number or numbers in the national or international telephone numbering plans. Emergency authorities should be able to handle and answer calls to the number \u2018112\u2019 at least as expeditiously and effectively as calls to other national emergency numbers. It is important to increase awareness of \u2018112\u2019 in order to improve the level of protection and security of citizens travelling in the European Union. To this end, citizens should be made fully aware that \u2018112\u2019 can be used as a single emergency number when travelling in any Member State , in particular through information provided in international bus terminals, train stations, ports or airports and in telephone directories, payphone kiosks, subscriber and billing material. This is primarily the responsibility of the Member States, but the Commission should continue both to support and to supplement initiatives undertaken by the Member States to further awareness of \u2018112\u2019 and periodically to assess knowledge of \u2018112\u2019 by the public. The obligation to provide caller location information should be strengthened so as to increase the protection of citizens of the European Union. In particular, operators should provide caller location information to emergency services in a \u2018push\u2019 mode. In order to respond to technological developments, including those leading to increasingly precise accuracy of location information, the Commission should be able to adopt technical implementing measures in order to ensure the effective implementation of \u2018112\u2019 in the Community for the benefit of citizens of the European Union. (34) Member States should take specific measures to ensure that emergency services, including \u2018112\u2019, are equally accessible to disabled persons, in particular deaf, hearing-impaired, speech-impaired and deaf- blind users. This could involve the provision of special terminal devices to hearing-impaired users, text relay services, or other specific equipment. (35) Development of the international code \u20183883\u2019 \u2590 ( the European Telephony Numbering Space (ETNS) ) \u2590 is currently hindered by lack of demand, overly bureaucratic procedural requirements and insufficient awareness . In order to foster the development of ETNS, the Commission should delegate responsi\u00ad bility for its management, number assignment and promotion either to the Body of European Regulators in Telecom (BERT) or, following the example of the implementation of the \u2018.eu\u2019 top level domain, to a separate organisation, designated by the Commission on the basis of an open, transparent and non-discriminatory selection procedure, and with operating rules which form part of Community law . (36) Pursuant to its Decision 2007/116/EC of 15 February 2007 on reserving the national numbering range beginning with \u2018116\u2019 for harmonised numbers for harmonised services of social value, ( 1 ) the Commission has reserved numbers in the \u2018116\u2019 numbering range for certain services of social value. The numbers identified in that Decision cannot be used for purposes other than those set out therein, but there is no obligation for Member States to ensure that services associated with the reserved numbers are actually provided. The appropriate provisions of Decision 2007/116/EC should be reflected in Directive 2002/22/EC in order to integrate them more firmly into the regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services and to ensure accessi\u00ad bility by disabled end-users as well. Considering the particular aspects related to reporting missing children and the currently limited availability of that service, Member States should not only reserve a number, but also ensure that a service for reporting missing children is actually available in their territories under the number 116000. (37) A single market implies that end-users are able to access all numbers included in the national numbering plans of other Member States, and to access services, including Information Society services, using non-geographic numbers within the Community, including among others freephone and premium rate numbers. End-users should also be able to access numbers from \u2551 ETNS \u2551 and universal international freephone numbers (UIFN). Cross-border access to numbering resources and to the associated service should not be prevented except in objectively justified cases, such as when this is necessary to combat fraud, and abuse e.g. in connection with certain premium-rate services, or when the number is defined as having a national scope only (e.g. national short code). Users should be fully informed in advance in a clear manner of any charges applicable to freephone numbers, such as international call charges for numbers accessible through standard international dialling codes. In order to ensure that end-users have effective access to numbers and services in the Community, the Commission should be able to adopt implementing measures. End-users should also be able to connect to other end-users (especially via IP numbers) in order to exchange data, regardless of the operator they choose. EN C 8 E/366 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 ( 1 ) OJ L 49, 17.2.2007, p. 30. Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(38) In order to take full advantage of the competitive environment, consumers should be able to make informed choices and to change providers when it is in their interest. It is essential to ensure that they can do so without being hindered by legal, technical or practical obstacles, including contractual conditions, procedures, charges etc. This does not preclude imposing reasonable minimum contractual periods in consumer contracts. Number portability is a key facilitator of consumer choice and effective competition in competitive markets for electronic communications, and should be implemented with the minimum of delay , ordinarily within no more than one day of the request of the consumer. However, experience in certain Member States has shown that there is a risk of consumers being switched without consent. While that is a matter that should primarily be addressed by law- enforcement authorities, Member States should be able to impose such minimum proportionate measures regarding the switching process as are necessary to minimise such risks, without making the process less attractive for consumers . In order to be able to adapt number portability to market and technological evolution, including the possible porting of subscriber's personal direc\u00ad tories and profile information stored within the network, the Commission should be able to take technical implementing measures in this area. Assessment of whether technology and market conditions are such as to allow for porting of numbers between networks providing services at a fixed location and mobile networks should in particular take into account prices for users and switching costs for undertakings providing services at fixed locations and mobile networks. (39) \u2590 Legal \u2018must-carry\u2019 obligations may be applied \u2590 to specified radio and audiovisual media services and complementary services supplied by a specified media service provider. Audiovisual media services are defined in Directive 2007/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2007 amending Council Directive 89/552/EEC on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities ( 1 ). Member States should provide a clear justification for the \u2018must carry\u2019 obligations \u2590 so as to ensure that such obligations are transparent, proportionate and properly defined. In that regard, \u2018must carry\u2019 rules should be designed in a way which provides sufficient incentives for efficient investment in infrastructure. \u2018Must carry\u2019 rules should be periodically reviewed in order to keep them up-to-date with technological and market evolution in order to ensure that they continue to be proportionate to the objectives to be achieved. Complementary services include, but are not limited to, services to improve accessibility for users with disabilities, such as a videotext service, subtitling service, an audio description or sign language. (40) In order to overcome existing shortcomings in terms of consumer consultation and appropriately address the interests of citizens, Member States should put in place \u2590 appropriate consultation mechanisms . Such mechanisms could take the form of a body which would, independently from the national regulatory authority as well as from service providers, carry out research on consumer- related issues, such as consumer behaviour and mechanisms for changing suppliers, and which would operate in a transparent manner and contribute to the existing mechanisms for stakeholders\u2019 consul\u00ad tation. Furthermore, a mechanism should be established for the purpose of enabling appropriate cooperation on issues relating to the promotion of lawful content. Any cooperation procedures agreed pursuant to such a mechanism should however not allow for systematic surveillance of Internet usage. Where there is a need to address the facilitation of the access to and use of electronic communications services and terminal equipment for disabled users, and without prejudice to Directive 1999/5/EC \u2551 and in particular the disability requirements pursuant to \u2551 Article 3(3)(f) thereof , the Commission should be able to adopt implementing measures. (41) The procedure for out-of-court dispute resolution should be strengthened by ensuring that inde\u00ad pendent dispute resolution bodies are used, and that the procedure conforms at least to the minimum principles established by Commission Recommendation 98/257/EC of 30 March 1998 on the principles applicable to the bodies responsible for out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes ( 2 ) . Member States may either use existing dispute resolution bodies for that purpose, provided those bodies meet the applicable requirements, or establish new bodies. EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/367 ( 1 ) OJ L 332, 18.12.2007, p. 27. ( 2 ) OJ L 115, 17.4.1998, p. 31. Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(42) Obligations imposed on an undertaking designated as having universal service obligations should be notified to the Commission. (43) Directive 2002/58/EC provides for the harmonisation of the provisions of the Member States required to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, and in particular the right to privacy and the right to confidentiality and security of information tech\u00ad nology systems, with respect to the processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector, and to ensure the free movement of such data and of electronic communications equipment and services in the Community. (44) The processing of traffic data for network and information security purposes, ensuring the avail\u00ad ability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted data, will enable the processing of such data in the legitimate interest of the data controller for the purpose of preventing unauthorized access and malicious code distribution and stopping denial-of-service attacks and damage to computer and electronic communication systems. The European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) should publish regular studies with the purpose of illus\u00ad trating the types of processing allowed under Article 6 of Directive 2002/58/EC . (45) When defining the implementing measures on the security of processing, in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, the Commission should consult all relevant European authorities and organisations (ENISA, the European Data Protection Supervisor and the Article 29 Working Party) as well as all other relevant stakeholders, particularly in order to be informed of the best available technical and economic methods for improving the implementation of Directive 2002/58/EC. (46) The provisions of Directive 2002/58/EC particularise and complement Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ( 1 ) and provide for the legitimate interests of subscribers who are natural or legal persons. (47) Liberalisation of electronic communications networks and services markets and rapid technological development have combined to boost competition and economic growth and have resulted in a rich diversity of end-user services accessible via public and private electronic communications networks and publicly accessible private networks . (48) IP addresses are essential to the working of the Internet. They identify network participating devices, such as computers or mobile smart devices, by a number. Given the variety of scenarios in which IP addresses are used, and the related technologies which are rapidly evolving, questions have arisen about the use of such addresses as personal data in certain circumstances. The Commission should therefore, on the basis of a study regarding IP addresses and their uses, present such proposals as may be appropriate . (49) Technological progress allows the development of new applications based on devices for data collection and identification, which may be contactless devices using radio frequencies. For example, Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID) use radio frequencies to capture data from uniquely identified tags, which can then be transferred over existing communications networks. The wide use of such technologies can bring considerable economic and social benefits and thus make a powerful contribution to the internal market if their use is acceptable to citizens. To achieve that, it is necessary to ensure that all fundamental rights of individuals, including the right to privacy and the right to data protection, are safeguarded. When such devices are connected to publicly available electronic communications networks or make use of electronic communications services as a basic infrastructure, the relevant provisions of Directive 2002/58/EC, including those on security, traffic and location data and \u2551 confidentiality, should apply. EN C 8 E/368 Official Journal of the European Union 14.1.2010 ( 1 ) OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31. Wednesday 24 September 2008 ",
        "(50) The provider of a publicly available electronic communications service should take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of its services. Without prejudice to Directive 95/46/EC and Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks ( 1 ) , such measures should ensure that personal data can be accessed only by authorised personnel for legally authorised purposes and that the personal data stored or transmitted as well as the network and services are protected. Moreover, a security policy with respect to the processing of personal data should be established in order to identify vulnerabilities in the system and regular monitoring and preventive, corrective and mitigating action should be carried out. (51) National regulatory authorities should monitor measures taken and disseminate best practices among providers of publicly available electronic communications services. (52) A breach of security resulting in the loss or compromising personal data of a subscriber or individual may, if not addressed in an adequate and timely manner, result in substantial \u2590 harm to users . Therefore, the national regulatory authority or other competent national authority should be notified by the relevant service provider of any security breach without delay. The competent authority should determine the seriousness of the breach and should require the relevant service provider to give appropriate notification without undue delay to users affected by the breach. Furthermore, and in cases where there is an imminent and direct danger to consumers\u2019 rights and interests (such as in cases of unauthorized access to the content of e-mails, access to credit card records and so on), the relevant service provider should, in addition to the competent national authority, immediately notify affected users directly. Finally, providers should annually notify affected users of all breaches of security under Directive 2002/58/EC that occurred during the relevant time period. The notifications to the national authorities and to users should include information about measures taken by the provider to address the breach, as well as recommendations for the protection of affected users \u2551 . (53) National regulatory authorities should promote the interests of the citizens of the European Union by inter alia contributing to ensuring a high level of protection of personal data and privacy. To this end, they must have the necessary means to perform their duties, including comprehensive and reliable data about actual security incidents that have led to the personal data of individuals being compromised. (54) When implementing measures transposing Directive 2002/58/EC, the authorities and courts of the Member States should not only interpret their national law in a manner consistent with that Directive, but should also ensure that they do not rely on an interpretation of that Directive which would be in conflict with other fundamental rights or general principles of Community law, such as the principle of proportionality. (55) Provision should be made for implementing measures to establish a common set of requirements to achieve an adequate level of privacy protection and security of personal data transmitted or processed in connection with the use of electronic communications networks in the internal market. (56) In setting detailed rules concerning the format and procedures applicable to the notification of security breaches, due consideration should be given to the circumstances of the breach, including whether or not the personal data had been protected by encryption or other means, effectively limiting the likelihood of identity fraud or other forms of misuse. Moreover, such rules and procedures should take into account the legitimate interests of law enforcement authorities in cases where early disclosure could unnecessarily hamper the investigation of the circumstances of a breach. \u2590 EN 14.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 8 E/369 ( 1 ) OJ L 105, 13.4.2006, p. 54.

        "(57) Software that surreptitiously monitors actions of the user and/or subverts operation of the user's terminal equipment for the benefit of a third party (so-called \u2018spyware\u2019) poses a serious threat to users\u2019 privacy. A high and equal level of protection of the private sphere of users needs to be ensured, regardless of whether unwanted spying programmes are inadvertently downloaded via electronic communications networks or are delivered and installed hidden in software distributed on other external data storage media, such as CDs, CD-ROMs and USB keys. Member States should encourage end-users to take the necessary steps to protect their terminal equipment against viruses and spyware. (58) Electronic communications service providers have to make substantial investments in order to combat unsolicited commercial communications (\u2018spam\u2019). They are also in a better position than end-users in possessing the knowledge and resources necessary to detect and identify spammers. Email service providers and other service providers should therefore have the possibility to initiate legal action against spammers for such infringements and thus defend the interests of their customers, as well as their own legitimate business interests. (59) Where location data other than traffic data can be processed, such data should be processed only when they are made anonymous or with the prior consent of the users or subscribers concerned, who should be given clear and comprehensive information concerning the possibility of withdrawing their consent at any time. (60) The need to ensure an adequate level of protection of privacy and personal data transmitted and processed in connection with the use of electronic communications networks in the Community calls for effective implementation and enforcement powers in order to provide adequate incentives for compliance. National regulatory authorities should have sufficient powers and resources to investigate cases of non-compliance effectively, including the possibility to obtain any relevant information they might need, to decide on complaints and to impose sanctions in cases of non-compliance. (61) Cross border cooperation and enforcement should be reinforced in line with existing Community cross border enforcement mechanisms such as that laid down by the Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for enforcement of consumer protection laws (Regulation on consumer protection cooperation) ( 1 ) by way of an amendment to that Regulation . (62) The measures necessary for the implementation of \u2551 Directives 2002/22/EC and \u2551 2002/58/EC should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 2 ). (63) The Commission should, provided that the Treaty of Lisbon amending the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community ( 3 ) enters into force, present to the European Parliament and to the Council a new legislative proposal on privacy and data security in electronic communications, with a new legal basis. (64) In particular , the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing measures on tariff trans\u00ad parency, minimum quality of service requirements, effective implementation of \u2018112\u2019 services, effective access to numbers and services, and improvement of accessibility by disabled end-users , as well as amendments to adapt the Annexes to technical progress or changes in market demand. It should also be empowered to adopt implementing measures concerning information and notification requirements as well as cross-border cooperation.
