        "OPINION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 5 July 2007 at the request of the Council of the European Union on the opening of an Intergovernmental Conference to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties (CON/2007/20) (2007/C 160/02) 1. On 27 June 2007, the European Central Bank (ECB) received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on the opening of a conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States (Intergovernmental Conference or IGC) to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties (Reform Treaty). 2. The ECB's competence to deliver an opinion is based on Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the first sentence of Article 17(5) of the Rules of Procedure of the ECB, the Governing Council of the ECB has adopted this Opinion. 3. The mandate of the IGC was agreed by the Brussels European Council of 21-23 June 2007 and is attached as an Annex to the Presidency Conclusions (IGC Mandate). The IGC Mandate states that it is the exclusive basis and framework for the IGC ( 1 ). The IGC is mandated to draw-up a Reform Treaty which will introduce the innovations resulting from the 2004 IGC into the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and into the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC) which is to be renamed the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union (TFU) ( 2 ). 4. The ECB welcomes the opening of the IGC. The ECB understands that, except as indicated in the IGC Mandate, the text of the TEU will remain unchanged ( 3 ). In particular, the ECB welcomes the confirma- tion in the IGC Mandate that price stability is one of the Union's objectives ( 4 ) and that monetary policy is expressly listed as one of the Union's exclusive competences. The ECB also welcomes the revision of the article on the Union's objectives so as to include the establishment of an economic and monetary union whose currency is the euro ( 5 ). 5. The IGC Mandate specifically refers to improvements to the governance of the euro, stating that innova- tions, as agreed at the 2004 IGC, will be inserted into the TFU \u2018 by way of specific modifications in the usual manner \u2019 ( 6 ). The ECB is specifically mentioned, and the IGC is mandated ( 7 ) to insert the provisions on the ECB in Section 4bis of Part Five of the TFU. The IGC is also mandated to annex a Protocol to the Reform Treaty to amend existing Protocols in line with the changes agreed at the 2004 IGC ( 8 ). This includes, inter alia, changes to the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank. 6. The ECB understands that, as regards the status, mandate, tasks and legal regime of the ECB, the Euro- system and the European System of Central Banks, the changes to the current Treaties to be introduced by the IGC will be limited to and will comprise all the innovations agreed at the 2004 IGC ( 9 ). 7. With regard to the innovations agreed at the 2004 IGC on the governance of the euro, the Annex to this Opinion refers to some that are of particular relevance to the ECB and, where appropriate, sets out the ECB's understanding of how these could be introduced into the TFU without going beyond the scope of the IGC Mandate. 13.7.2007 C 160/2 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) Preamble of the IGC Mandate.

( 9 ) In connection with the 2004 IGC, the ECB issued ECB Opinion CON/2003/20 of 19 September 2003 at the request of the Council of the European Union on the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (OJ C 229, 25.9.2003, p. 7). ",
        "8. The ECB stands ready to contribute to the IGC at any time during its work and, once a text has been drawn up, to provide an opinion on the matters which are within its fields of competence. Done at Frankfurt am Main, 5 July 2007. The President of the ECB Jean-Claude TRICHET 13.7.2007 C 160/3 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "ANNEX A. Provisions on the ECB 1. The IGC is mandated ( 1 ) to insert the innovations agreed at the 2004 IGC concerning the ECB into the TFU, together with the articles on the Court of Auditors and the Union's advisory bodies. In the TFU, the text of the provisions on the ECB will be identical to those agreed at the 2004 IGC, except for the necessary amendments to cross-references. This means, inter alia, that the 2004 IGC innovation of defining the ECB as an (other) institution will be incorporated into the Treaties, along with the introduction of the term \u2018 Eurosystem \u2019 and the express confirmation of the ECB's financial independence. 2. While the article on the ECB will appear in the TFU ( 2 ), the IGC Mandate states that the TEU and the TFU will have the same legal value ( 3 ). This means that the new Article 1 of the TFU, which should set out the relationship between the TFU and the TEU ( 4 ), will neither establish a hierarchy between the two Treaties nor introduce differences between the amending procedures for the core provisions dealing with the ECB/ESCB and those dealing with the EU institu- tions. On this basis, the ECB understands that, even if the article on the ECB will appear in the TFU, the ECB will benefit from the same legal standing as the EU institutions which are referred to in the TEU. B. Updating of the terminology used in the Treaties with respect to the single currency 3. Further to the IGC Mandate ( 5 ), the Reform Treaty will replace the term \u2018 Community \u2019 with \u2018 Union \u2019 and \u2018 ECU \u2019 with \u2018 euro \u2019 throughout the Treaties, and introduce a series of changes to outdated references to the \u2018 stages \u2019 of economic and monetary union. Necessary changes will be made to the Protocols on Denmark and the UK. 4. Following the agreement of the Reform Treaty, the name of the single currency will appear in the primary law of the Union. The ECB considers that, for reasons of legal certainty and clarity, the uniform spelling of the term \u2018 euro \u2019 should be respected in all the linguistic and alphabetical versions of the Reform Treaty and, therefore in the TEU and the TFU, and this requires the spelling to be euro in the Latin alphabet, \u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03ce in the Greek alphabet and \u0435\u0443\u0440\u043e in the Cyrillic alphabet. C. Abrogation of the EMI Protocol 5. The text agreed at the 2004 IGC abrogated the Protocol on the Statute of the European Monetary Institute ( \u2018 the EMI Protocol \u2019 ), and thus the EMI Protocol will be deleted. While the ECB welcomes such deletion, some of the functions carried out under its provisions are still relevant for the Member States with a derogation. Under Articles 44 and 47(1) of the Statute of the ESCB, such functions are currently performed by the General Council of the ECB. The ECB understands that the deletion of the EMI Protocol will be complemented by an amendment to Article 117(2) of the TEC ( 6 ) so that such functions will continue to be performed by the ECB. 13.7.2007 C 160/4 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) Annex 2(B), point 16of the IGCMandate.

Name: \u2018 Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria \u2019 4.2. Description: The protected geographical indication (PGI) \u2018 Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria \u2019 denotes bulbs of the species Allium Cepa exclusively from the local ecotypes listed below, which have a charac- teristic shape and are produced early, owing to the effect of the photoperiod: \u2014 \u2018 Tondo Piatta \u2019 , an early crop; \u2014 \u2018 mezza campana \u2019 , a mid to early crop; \u2014 \u2018 Allungata \u2019 , a late crop. There are three types of product: \u2014 \u2018 Cipollotto \u2019 : \u2014 Colour: white to pink or purple. \u2014 Taste: sweet and mild. \u2014 Diameter size: see the standards applicable under EU rules. \u2014 \u2018 Cipolla da consumo fresco \u2019 (for consumption fresh): \u2014 Colour: white to pink or purple. \u2014 Taste: sweet and mild. \u2014 Diameter size: see the standards applicable under EU rules. \u2014 \u2018 Cipolla da serbo \u2019 (for storage): \u2014 Colour: white to purple. \u2014 Taste: sweet and crunchy. \u2014 Diameter size: see the standards applicable under EU rules. 4.3. Geographical area: The production area of \u2018 Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria \u2019 PGI covers suitable land in all or part of the following municipalities in the region of Calabria: \u2014 Province of Cosenza: part of the municipalities of Fiumefreddo, Longobardi, Serra d'Aiello, Belmonte and Amantea. \u2014 Province of Catanzaro: part of the municipalities of Nocera Terinese, Falerna, Gizzeria, Lamezia Terme and Curinga. \u2014 Province of Vibo Valentia: part of the municipalities of Pizzo, Vibo Valentia, Briatico, Parghelia, Zambrone, Zaccanopoli, Zungri, Drapia, Tropea, Ricadi, Spilinga, Joppolo and Nicotera. 4.4. Proof of origin: A certification scheme was set up to protect the geographic indication and also serves the purpose of ensuring the traceability of all stages in the production process. Producers and processors of \u2018 Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria \u2019 and the land parcels on which it is grown are entered in registers managed by the inspection body. 13.7.2007 C 160/16 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "4.5. Method of production: The production process can be summarised as follows: the seeds of \u2018 Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria \u2019 are sown from August onwards. The planting distances vary according to the land and the method used, ranging from 4-20 cm in rows to 10-22 cm in between rows, with a density of between 250 000 plants/hectare and 900 000 plants/hectare, the latter where there are four bulbs per hole for final radication. One of the regular operations is to provide irrigation, varying according to precipitation levels. After the cipollotto bulbs have been harvested, the earth-covered outer layer is removed, the foliage is cut at 40 cm and the bulbs are then placed in trays in bundles. In the case of cipolla da consumo fresco , the outer layer of the bulbs is also removed and foliage is cut if it is longer than 60 cm. The onions are then tied in bundles of 5-8 kg and placed in trays or crates. For cipolla da serbo , the bulbs are placed on the ground in windrows covered with their own foliage and left for 8 to 15 days to dry, become more compact and resistant and develop a bright red colour. Once dried, the bulbs may be topped or the foliage left for plaiting. Persons intending to produce the protected geographical indication \u2018 Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria \u2019 must fully comply with the specification submitted to the EU. The product must be packaged in the area defined in point 4.3 in order to ensure product traceability and control and to maintain product quality. 4.6. Link: The application to register the PGI \u2018 Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria \u2019 is justified by the product's reputation and recognition thanks partly to a number of advertising campaigns, as shown in historical and bibliographical references. \u2018 Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria \u2019 is known for its qualitative and organoleptic characteristics including its mildness, sweetness, high digestibility and very low level of sulphates in the bulbs, which make them less sharp and sour and more easily digestible. These characteristics enable \u2018 Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria \u2019 also to be consumed raw, in greater quantities than for normal onions. Historical and bibliographical references credit the arrival of onions in the Mediterranean basin and Calabria first to the Greeks and then to the Phoenicians. Highly appreciated in the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance, it was considered a staple food and key to the local economy where it was bartered for, sold, and exported by sea to Tunisia, Algeria and Greece. The many travellers who went to Calabria between 1700 and 1800 and visited the Tyrrhenian coast between Pizzo and Tropea frequently refer to the red onions commonly found there. Onions have always been a feature of the rural diet and of local production. Dr Albert, who travelled to Calabria in 1905 and visited Tropea, was struck by the poverty of the local people who ate only onions. In the early 1900s, onion growing in Tropea moved from the family garden and vegetable patch and became a major crop. In 1929, the Valle Ruffa aqueduct paved the way for irrigation and, as a result, better yields and quality. The product became more widespread during the Bourbon period, reaching north European markets and swiftly becoming sought after and prized, as described in Studi sulla Calabria \u2014 1901 , which refers to the shape of the bulb, the red oblong onions from Calabria. The first organised statistical information on onion-growing in Calabria is contained in the Reda agricultural encyclopaedia (1936-39). Because of its unique characteristics, which have helped forge a nationwide reputation and, above all, its historical and cultural significance in the area concerned, a significance that is still reflected today in farming practices, cooking, in everyday language and folkloric events, attempts have been made to imitate the product and make unauthorised use of the designation. \u2018 Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria \u2019 is grown in medium, sand-rich loam or in heavy loam rich in clay or lime, in the coastal area or around alluvial rivers and streams which, despite the gravel, does not restrict the growth and development of the bulbs. Coastal land is ideal for growing early onions for fresh consumption. Inland areas with heavier, clay-rich soil are ideal for growing late onions for storage. Today as in the past, red onions are grown in family vegetable patches and in large crops and form part of the rural landscape, local food and dishes and traditional recipes. 13.7.2007 C 160/17 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",

        "4.2. Description: The \u2018 Marrone di Roccadaspide \u2019 PGI denotes fruit obtained from the Anserta, Abate and Castagna Rossa ecotypes, which are linked to the Marrone variety. When released for consumption in the fresh state, it should have the following characteristics: Fruit shape: basically hemi- spherical, in some cases slightly ellipsoidal; Pericarp: dark chestnut brown, tending towards a reddish colour, with darker stripes that are generally not too noticeable; Episperm: thin, tending to adhere to the meat and intruding only slightly into the seed; Size: maximum 85 nuts per kg of selected and/or graded product; Seed: milky-white in colour, with a firm texture and sweet flavour, and a maximum of 5 % of septate nuts. When marketed dry (peeled or otherwise), it must have the following characteris- tics: (a) Dry unpeeled chestnuts: moisture content of whole nuts: not exceeding 15 %. The product must be sound (absence of larvae, mould, etc.). Dry chestnut yield (with shell): not exceeding 50 % by weight; (b) Peeled dry chestnuts: must be sound and pale-straw coloured; defects (worm damage, defor- mations, etc.) may not be present in more than 20 % of the nuts. The \u2018 Marrone di Roccadaspide \u2019 PGI is characterised by a markedly sweet flavour and a high sugar content. Other organoleptic characteristics include a crunchy and not very floury texture. The organoleptic characteristics are checked by a panel of tasters selected by the inspection body. 4.3. Geographical area: The \u2018 Marrone di Roccadaspide \u2019 PGI production area comprises the land situated more than 250 metres above sea level in the municipalities of the province of Salerno listed in the product specification . 4.4. Proof of origin: Every phase of the production process must be monitored and a record kept of incoming and outgoing products at each stage. This, together with the drawing up, by the inspection body, of lists of the producers, land parcels and packing stations concerned, ensures the product's traceability throughout the production chain. Any natural or legal person whose name appears on those lists may be subject to checks by the inspection body, in accordance with the terms of the speci- fication and the corresponding monitoring plan. If the inspection body becomes aware of any instance of non-compliance, even if this is limited to a single stage of the production process, the product may not be marketed under the \u2018 Marrone di Roccadaspide \u2019 protected geographical indication. 4.5. Method of production: The product specification stipulates, inter alia, that the density should not exceed 130 plants in full production per hectare. Training of the trees: for volume, with a semi-open vase. Branching begins at 2 metres from the ground. The trees are trained using early branches in the summer/autumn. Pruning must be carried out at least every five years. Given its high permeability, the soil does not require specific work aimed at preventing rainwater stagnation and does not, therefore, need to be tilled, etc. The grass cover must be cut when it is 30-40 cm high. Harvesting, which must be performed in the autumn \u2014 in no case after the first ten days in November \u2014 and for not more than two weeks at a time, is carried out manually or, using harvesting machines which do not damage the product, mechanically. All the production work and every process with the exception of packing are performed in the terri- tory of the municipalities listed in Article 4. This ensures product traceability. 4.6. Link: The soil in the Cilento is of volcanic origin, deep, cool, neither conducive to stagnation nor asphyctic, has an acid or neutral reaction (pH between 4,5 and 6,5) and a high mineral content, and is thus well-suited to chestnut cultivation. The average temperature all year round the year ranges between + 8 \u00b0C and + 15 \u00b0C. The annual precipitation exceeds 600-800 mm. The area is thus charac- terised by a typically Mediterranean climate, with rather mild winters and summers which include dry spells, in some cases protracted ones. This is an environment in which large quantities of high-quality fruit can be produced, even amid fairly low temperatures. The Codex diplomaticus cavensis , a document kept in the archives of the Benedictine Abbey at Cava de' Tirreni and referring to a series of agreements between farmers and landowners, shows that chestnut-growing was being practised in the province of Salerno in Medieval times. Basilian monks also contributed to the spread of chestnut-growing in some Cilento areas. The knowledge and skills concerned have been passed on from generation to generation, so much so that Man, through his expertise and patient work, constitutes a powerful link between the product and its environment. Since the 1800s, as well as constituting one the staple local foods, chest- nuts have played a fundamental role in the local economy, being used for bartering with neighbouring areas. Over the centuries festivals, written documents and recipes have served to strengthen the links between chestnut-growing and the area. Human skill and knowledge, combined with optimal character- istics in terms of soil and climate characteristics, make this a unique product with an unquestioned reputation. 13.7.2007 C 160/20 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
