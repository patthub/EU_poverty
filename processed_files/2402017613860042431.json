        "At a time when the European Parliament has just started a new term and the European Commission has a new team in place, the European Economic and Social Committee is continuing to move forwards as a committed partner of the Latvian Presidency. As the representative of European civil society, our committee has recently seen confirmation of its key role in building a more democratic European Union in the European Parliament report that has recognised its work as being critical to the success of the European citizens\u2019 initiative. And this is the path on which we wish to continue. Note from the President | 2 | EESC priorities during the Latvian Presidency ",
        "EESC priorities during the Latvian Presidency | 3 | Our committee stands shoulder to shoulder with the Latvian Presidency to help Europe meet the challenges ahead on behalf of its citizens. These challenges include: \u2022 growth \u2013 the source of job creation: industrial policy and energy policy must lie at the heart of EU action for the coming five years if we want not only to ensure that job creation takes root in our regions, but also to take control of our destiny, in the light of recent events; \u2022 the digital era: in terms of current and future opportunities for growth, and also of its impact on other sectors, Europe must remain in the vanguard and ensure it does not leave any of its regions behind; \u2022 globalisation: if it aspires to be a global player, Europe must be involved in the major meetings that will take place, in order to make its voice heard and defend its economic interests within the draft transatlantic treaty, boosting a genuine African policy (which has become weakened over time) and strengthening its partnership with the Mediterranean countries \u2013 immigration in the Mediterranean and the daily tragedies taking place there urgently require a collective and comprehensive response by the European Union. At the same time, Europe is currently paying the price for its lack of a common immigration policy and a truly common asylum system; Note from the President \u2022 climate change: Europe should be at the forefront of the major meetings and, in particular, play a leading role in the preparations for COP21 in Paris in 2015. To achieve these goals, the EU must move forward with all Europeans, as part of a stronger democratic process that enables European action to meet people's expectations on the ground. This is the purpose of our committee and its commitment. In recent months, we have gone even further, by reviewing our working procedures and introducing new mechanisms, such as studies carried out by our observatories to measure the real impact of directives, all with a view to strengthening the voice of European civil society. The next six months, which will be steered by the Latvian Presidency, are extremely important as they offer an opportunity to demonstrate that Europe has gained a new momentum, which will bring it closer to the people of Europe. Henri Malosse EESC President European Economic and Social Committee ",
        "| 4 | EESC priorities during the Latvian Presidency European Economic and Social Committee The EESC \u2013 a committed partner of Latvian civil society emphasis was also placed on the importance of dialogue with civil society and the increasing need for participatory democracy in Europe. President Malosse noted furthermore that all Latvian civil society organisations \u2013 trade unions, employers\u2019 organisations, NGOs, etc. supported the EESC, in order both to have a greater voice in Brussels, and to be kept better informed about EU developments. More directly, links have also been forged with local politicians such as the Mayor of Jelgava \u2013 a city of 63 000 inhabitants \u2013 who has been awarded the title of most business- friendly politician, and also with students from Riga Technical University, with whom Mr Malosse held discussions on the vital importance of matching training to labour market needs in the fields of science and the new technologies. The European Economic and Social Committee started to develop special relations with Latvian civil society well before the country\u2019s accession to the European Union in 2004. It was thus actively involved in preparing Latvia throughout its accession process, particularly through extensive and ongoing dialogue with the country\u2019s economic and social representatives. In November 2014, EESC President Henri Malosse held in-depth discussions in Riga with the Latvian President Andris B\u0113rzi\u0146\u0161, on preparations for Latvia\u2019s presidency and on the opinions that Latvia would be asking the Committee to draw up in line with the presidency\u2019s priorities.

        "EESC priorities during the Latvian Presidency | 7 | European Economic and Social Committee \u2022 The EESC will continue its work on the urban areas to create a common European urban development practice which contributes to the stimulation of economic growth in a sustainable manner. At the same time, it will be actively involved in promoting existing and future macroregional strategies , such as EUSAIR (Adriatic and Ionian) and EUSALP (Alpine region). \u2022 Consumer issues will also be very high on the Committee\u2019s agenda, with special attention paid to new forms of consumption such as collaborative consumption and the sharing economy. Building on previous work on planned obsolescence , the Committee will launch a study on how better information about the expected life of products could influence consumer behaviour, allowing manufacturers to adapt their production to consumers\u2019 requests. The annual European Consumer Day will take place as usual during this semester. \u2022 The Committee will also continue its priority work on transport policy and civil aviation , in particular airport capacity and integrated skies. In relation to energy issues, the Committee will be promoting a European Energy Dialogue (EED) and organising a macro-regional conference involving several neighbouring Member States. In the digital agenda domain, special attention will be paid to big data and user protection , as well as the greening of IT growth . \u2022 On climate change , the important links with agriculture and forestry will be examined in an exploratory opinion requested by the Latvian Presidency, and the Committee\u2019s position for the COP21 in Paris will be defined, bringing on board civil society from outside the EU. Work on the Post-2015 Agenda of Sustainable Development Goals will continue, and the EESC will also play an active role in the Milan 2015 Expo on Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life . \u2022 During the next semester the EESC will maintain its focus on neighbourhood policy , with migration, youth employment and a more integrated civil society in southern countries remaining a priority in the Euromed \u2019s activities. The Committee will also deliver an opinion on the EU-Central Asia Strategy at the request of the Latvian Presidency, and will continue its priority work on the post-2015 Development Goals and the follow-up to the EU trade negotiations including the TTIP negotiations and in particular the topical discussion on Investor to State Dispute Settlement (ISDS).

        "| 8 | EESC priorities during the Latvian Presidency A matter of collective responsibility during the Latvian Presidency of the Council of the European Union European Economic and Social Committee On 1 January 2015 Latvia assumes the Presi- dency of the Council of the European Union for the first time in its history. Our country is honoured to take up this task of moderating the work done by Member States and coor- dinating it with other EU institutions to reach the best possible agreements. The challenges that the European Union currently is facing are complex: people are worried about jobs and growth and we are facing a difficult geo- political situation with additional pressure on EU action. We will use our Presidency to try to address the internal and external concerns, to help strengthen economic recovery and growth. Latvia has defined three Presidency priorities: \u201ccompetitive Europe\u201d to promote growth and jobs, \u201cdigital Europe\u201d to seize the opportunities provided by information and communication technologies and \u201cengaged Europe\u201d to tackle global issues. The Latvian Presidency will seek to work in close cooperation with the European Economic and Social Committee not only on matters concerning a competitive and digital Europe. It also considers it essential to collaborate on the issues of engaging civil society in the decision-making processes, on bridging gaps, and on bringing the EU institutions closer to EU citizens. In order to do so, we plan to revitalise the Europe 2020 Strategy. We want to engage with citizens also outside the EU, making people-to-people contacts a centrepiece of our cooperation with the Eastern Partnership and Central Asia countries. In order to improve the competitiveness of the European Union, it is essential to facilitate investment and to strengthen the Single Market. A competitive Europe can be achieved through targeted investment and continued economic policy reform. We must also create an inclusive and sustainable labour market, so that economic growth is resulting in more jobs and higher wages. Our Presidency\u2019s focus is therefore on jobs and economic growth, whilst working on reducing energy dependency, on moving towards a stable climate policy, and on taking clear action to boost industrial competitiveness.

        "EESC priorities during the Latvian Presidency | 9 | The Digital Europe priority is another avenue to the creation of new jobs and growth in the European Union. The first step is to develop trust between service providers and consumers and the removal of barriers to cross- border trade and services. The Presidency will work on the data protection package and on unlocking the digital opportunities offered by the existing infrastructure in the EU. It is equally important to boost digital skills, providing as many people as possible with access to modern information and communication technologies. The Latvian Presidency will encourage dialogue on e-government for more inclusiveness and transparency in public administrations. We live in a time when prosperity and growth cannot be taken for granted. The EU needs to dare to change and to transform itself, always involving citizens. We will work hand in hand with the European Economic and Social Committee in delivering a better Europe to our people.
