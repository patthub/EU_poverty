        "SEpTEMBEr 2016 | 03 First, and unbearably, there are 70 million Europeans who are unskilled or with low skills. An estimated four million are early leavers from education and training. Some regions in Europe have a youth unemployment rate of above 50%; 21% of our youth in the EU-28 are without a job. Second, the politics. A New Skills Agenda for Europe was launched by Commissioner Thyssen in June. The agenda is ambitious but realistic. It is meant especially for countries requiring more support to change the image of vocational education and training (VET) and to attract more citizens to skills for life and skills for jobs. At the heart of its implementation lie priorities that repair the damage created by one- size-fits-all education systems. This edition of Skillset and match focuses on the skills agenda and Cedefop\u2019s position as key support to Member States and social partners. Europe\u2019s competitiveness and economic growth will largely depend on the success of education and training systems that prevent people from being left behind. \u2018Think European, act local\u2019 reflects Cedefop's view that European data, analysis, monitoring and evaluations are of no use without implementation. Low-skilled adults, mismatched jobs and VET system reform are challenges which must be met with adequate resources in places where people learn, live and work. Detlef Eckert calls on all actors to \u2018increase the levels, relevance and use of skills in the EU\u2019 (pp. 10-11). The agenda provides the right platform for what Steve Bainbridge believes is \u2018a rethink about many aspects of VET: how skills are developed; how they are made visible on the labour market; how the labour market uses people\u2019s skills; and how to help people make informed career choices\u2019 (pp. 14-15) . The New skills agenda for Europe is everyone\u2019s challenge. Countries faced with unemployment require more structured responses through better VET systems and increased European and national resources. \u25a0 EDIT oriAL Countries faced with unemployment require more structured responses through better VET systems and increased European and national resources \u201c offering to the right responce skills agenda JAMES CALLEJA CEDEfop DirECTor the ",
        "iNTEr VIEW 04 | SKILL SET AND MATCH A new skills anticipation mechanism has been put in place by the Greek government to help identify skill needs in the crisis-stricken economy and focus resources on training people for the jobs on offer. Alternate Minister for Labour Rania Antonopoulou took part in a seminar on making learning work in Greece, jointly organised by Thomas H\u00e4ndel MEP, Chair of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, and Cedefop. She talked to Skillset and match about the strategy behind this initiative. Continuing vocational education and training is extraordinarily important, both for those currently employed and, even more so, for the unemployed. What we have done is to try to use much more effectively and efficiently the European social funds dedicated to skill enhancement and other programmes for the unemployed. Now we have completed the mechanism for diagnosing labour market needs, which was an obligation for the country. There was a self-imposed suspension that has now been lifted so we are on time with this project, which took many years to plan for; we managed to do it in eight months. The benefit of this is that we are already producing skill enhancement that corresponds to the stated needs of the private sector; we have an excellent opportunity for programmes to improve employability through IT and increase the digital knowledge of the general population, where there is a huge gap. Apprenticeship has not yet been developed in Greece. Do you believe that the new quality framework for apprenticeships will manage to give it momentum, and how? We hope that it will; we are working very closely with the Minister for Education on that. Programmes that deal with vocational education and training have had a component of on-the- job learning: the public employment service (OAED) has managed several programmes, not only those for two to three years\u2019 duration but also much shorter ones supporting the unemployed. We hope to provide momentum and scope for further development, but it remains to be seen. a p p r o a c h \u201c R A N I A A N T O N O P O U L O U G r EE k A L T E r N A T E M i N i S T E r f o r L A B o U r b y r o S Y V o UD o U r i skills for jobs: the Watch the full interview with Rania Antonopoulou G r e e k I can assure you that the type of skill enhancement programming being implemented now \u2013 and for the future \u2013 will definitely reflect the needs of the market ",
        "SEpTEMBEr 2016 | 05 iNTEr VIEW Traditionally in Greece, cooperation between different institutions, such as individual ministries, or between ministries and local authorities, has been poor. How will your approach address the problem when it comes to education and the labour market? Judging by the dynamics and the mechanism that we have already developed for diagnosing labour market needs, I am optimistic: for this mechanism we have secured cooperation among different departments of the Ministry of Labour and of regional authorities, for four different systems providing data and information; this is also in cooperation with the Ministry of Education. This experience with social partners and representatives of employers and employees has been terrific and we hope to replicate the results in other areas of our work. Unemployment remains exceptionally high in Greece: what skills do young people and the unemployed need to acquire to have a chance of getting a job? We have a paradox in Greece. We have highly educated people, and those that migrate abroad because of distressed labour market conditions here are very well equipped, they are skilled. Many of them are aged 40 and over, so they also have a lot of work experience. At the same time, we have a rapidly changing labour market with globalisation and with the new targets this government has set in terms of the development strategy for the country. It is only through cooperation and close links with the private sector, and with organisations like Cedefop, that we will manage optimum transition during these difficult times. We have to say that the diagnostic mechanism has been extremely useful and helpful; I can assure you that the type of skill enhancement programming being implemented now \u2013 and for the future \u2013 will definitely reflect the needs of the market. \u25a0 Making learning work in Greece event ",
        "The Netherlands is one of Europe\u2019s leaders in fighting early school leaving. The country is on course to beat easily the target set by the European Commission for the average percentage of dropouts in the EU to be less than 10% by 2020. A report by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science published this year shows that dropout rates for the 2014/15 school year have fallen to under 25 000 compared to 71 000 in 2001. And the new ambitious target is for a maximum of 20 000 early school leavers a year by 2021, i.e. young people between 12 and 23 who do not go to school and have not achieved a basic qualification. Preventing pupils leaving school early has been a policy priority in the Netherlands since 2007. The policy has been partly the reason why there was only a slight increase in youth unemployment during the recent economic crisis. The report states that for long-term success, preventing pupils dropping out will need to become a key activity at schools and within municipalities. COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORT Success has resulted from various coordinated initiatives: a compulsory school attendance and qualification obligation; a personal education number which makes it possible to track pupils; a digital absence portal for schools to register truants and help guide them back to education; career orientation and guidance to direct young people into the appropriate programme or occupation; an improved care structure at school and local levels; and transfer to a follow-up education programme. Dennis van Gessel, senior adviser at the Ministry of Education, has told Skillset and match that, to get to the most difficult cases, the policy will now focus on engaging more actors in regional cooperation, on giving special attention to young people in a vulnerable position and on catering for the \u2018total group\u2019 of early school leavers compared to the new leavers who were previously the primary focus. THE VOCATIONAL CONUNDRUM According to the report, the highest dropout rate in the Netherlands is among pupils in the first year after transferring to a secondary vocational school. Mr van Gessel explains what is being done to address this problem: \u2018 Sometimes students are not being guided in the right way and select a school that does not fit their interests. Now that several experiments have had success in the past, considera tion will be given to implementation of initiatives with more far-reaching cooperation between prevocational secon dary schools and secondary vocational schools. A few recent policy initiatives have been directed at this target group. The most important is a system where students making the transition can be monitored and helped throughout the summer and first year within vocational education and training (VET), so that they 06 | SKILL SET AND MATCH FEA TUrE For long-term success, preventing pupils dropping out will need to become a key activity at schools and within municipalities b y r o S Y V o UD o U r i a n d J ASp E r V A N L oo how the DUTCH are beating s ch oo l l e a v i n g e a r l y \u201c ",

Other than that, by introducing an admission law and a coherent package of measures, the study support is reinforced during the intake for every VET student, and admission policy of secondary vocational institutions provides a clear framework preventing improper selection in the beginning of the school year.\u2019 A SUCCESS STORY Timo van Wieringen, who has just completed a VET course on social care at the Horizon College in Hoorn, told Skillset and match that the support he received to keep him from leaving school early has really made a difference. Conversations with his mentor made him realise that he had to start putting more effort into his education. His teacher, Ria Bank, explained that the support was a well-designed package. Weekly meetings helped Timo plan his work using a calendar and gave him an overview of what had been achieved and what was still on the to-do list. Internship coordinators supported him in the work-based learning part of his education. Timo also benefited from an information and advice service for learners that helped him continue when he got stuck with something. Asked what was so good about the support, Timo highlighted the positive approach: \u2018It made me realise that I am capable of doing more, and as a result I have decided to continue learning at the next level and want to become a youth worker.\u2019 \u25a0 Cedefop briefing note: Mainstreaming VET policies addressing early leaving from education and training Approach to early school leaving in the Netherlands report (2016) p h o t o : \u00a9 S h u t t e r s t o c k _ L i s a F .

        "Cedefop communicates regularly with ReferNet, its network of institutions providing information on vocational education and training (VET) in EU Member States plus Iceland and Norway. All partners come to the plenary meeting, usually in November or December, and every spring two ReferNet partners organise meetings gathering about half of the network each. In previous years, these regional meetings proved their unique value by providing a space for knowledge exchange on VET issues. In 2016 the set- up changed. Now called partnership forums, they aim to complement sharing knowledge with more direct support to partners to help them provide different types of information. The first forums were held in Rome and Athens in May, organised by ISFOL (ReferNet Italy) and Eoppep (ReferNet Greece) respectively. They were greatly appreciated by participants. High-level VET policy-makers and stakeholders opened the forums and outlined important VET and skills trends and challenges. The events were also an opportunity to learn more about recent reforms (see boxes). What made the forums a success were hands-on workshops and interactive formats. Cedefop also gave ReferNet partners the opportunity to see what the agency does with their information, showcasing the network\u2019s value added for EU VET policies. \u25a0 p a r t n e r s h i p 08 | SKILL SET AND MATCH NEWS working in and Find out more about ReferNet More on the ReferNet partnership forums a n i t a l i a n w a y t o t h e D U A L SYS T E M I t a l y i s und e r t ak i ng t h e c h a ll e ng e o f p r o m o t i ng w o r k - b a s e d l ea r n i ng a s a w a y t o b r i dg e e du c a t i o n a nd t r a i n i ng a nd t h e w o r l d o f w o r k .

Following its evaluation, the apprenticeship year is planned to be expanded to about 10 000 learners. To make this happen, the Ministry of Education is cooperating with public employment services (OAED). Cedefop supports the process through its apprenticeship review and cooperates with national authorities and partners. ",
        "SEpTEMBEr 2016 | 09 T he importance of Europe\u2019s human capital for its future has been singled out in many studies and by most policy-makers. To make the most of that capital, and boost employability, competitiveness and growth, the European Commission has launched the New skills agenda for Europe. It is a wide-ranging project to ensure people develop a broad set of skills from an early age. The agenda calls on Member States and stakeholders to improve the quality of skills and their relevance for the labour market, so that no-one is left behind. And work has already started.

        "10 | SKILL SET AND MATCH The European Commission\u2019s Director of Skills Policy Detlef Eckert dissects the skills agenda for Skillset and match . What made a New skills agenda for Europe necessary? Despite the good progress achieved in recent decades in broadening access to education, some 70 million Europeans still lack sufficient reading, writing and numeracy skills, and 40% of the EU population lack a sufficient level of digital skills. At the other end of the skills spectrum, many highly-qualified young people work in jobs that do not match their skills and talent. Historically, growth in the EU has been fuelled by employment increases and productivity. As the EU workforce ages, the need to activate the unemployed and upskill our human capital will be of paramount importance in remaining competitive. The economy\u2019s digital transformation is reshaping the way people work and do business. Technological change and new ways of working are affecting the types of skills needed across most sectors of the economy and so digital skills are increasingly sought after. Adapting to the requirements of the new economy, while ensuring that all citizens have skills necessary to a modern digitised society, is imperative and affects all European countries. The New Skills Agenda for Europe is a call for all actors to engage in common action to increase the levels, relevance and use of skills in the EU. To make the skills agenda work, Member States, social partners, businesses and education and training authorities, who are called on to act on it, need to buy into its usefulness and feasibility. How can you ensure their commitment? A series of targeted stakeholder consultations were organised to discuss the scope and priorities of the agenda ahead of its launch. Social partners, European civil society organisations, national public employment services, European social fund managing authorities, policy networks (European qualifications framework, Europass, Euroguidance), European cities, education and training providers, national education and training policy- makers all had their say. Among these actors is a shared understanding that skills are the foundation of Europe\u2019s future prosperity. Our current task is to ensure that this common understanding of the problem is turned into concrete action. The first reactions to the agenda are very positive and make us believe that the actions being proposed by the Commission are already inspiring further engagement by different actors.

        "SEpTEMBEr 2016 | 11 will steer implementation while closely involving, consulting, encouraging and brokering agreements between all those concerned to ensure everyone remains committed and on-board. What skills would you say are the most important for the European labour market of tomorrow? Evidence from international and European surveys shows that employers are no longer exclusively recruiting on the basis of an academic title or diploma. The so called socio-behavioural or transversal skills and competences, such as critical thinking, problem solving, learnability, communication, cooperation or creativity, are gaining in importance. Early acquisition of these is the foundation for the development of higher, more complex skills which will drive Europe\u2019s capacity to innovate. Having said this, everyone should be equipped with solid basic skills in terms of literacy, numeracy and digital skills, since these are the foundations from which to develop a broader and more complementary skillset. One of the action points seeks to make vocational education and training (VET) a first choice by increasing opportunities for work-based learning and promoting greater visibility of good labour market outcomes. Will that be enough to win the hearts and minds of parents and young people? Few things are more important for young people\u2019s future than to have a job. And VET, particularly when combined with apprenticeships or work-based learning, strongly supports employability. Data on labour market outcomes of VET graduates show that vocational programmes lead to better employment chances than general programmes in almost all Member States. We need to tell young people and their families about these opportunities. In December this year we will organise the first European vocational skills week, where we will be able to showcase the excellent opportunities provided through VET across Europe. Hopefully this will kick-start a wave of communication activities that can turn around some of the misconceptions about VET and help it get the recognition it deserves. Cedefop\u2019s expertise will support the skills agenda. How important will the agency\u2019s role be in making it work? Cedefop\u2019s activities already cover many of the action points presented in the New skills agenda for Europe . Here we count on your commitment to support the modernisation agenda in VET, as defined in Riga in 2015, particularly in expanding work-based learning and making VET a first choice. On the new fronts, we need Cedefop\u2019s technical expertise to support implementation of the Skills guarantee at national level and contribute to the development of the new integrated Skills Panorama which \u2013 using the big data techniques \u2013 should tell us more about the diversity of skills needs and supply across Europe. \u25a0 SKILLS AGENDA ",
        "12 | SKILL SET AND MATCH Europe has a skills problem. Unemployment, poverty and social exclusion threaten about 70 million Europeans who lack sufficient literacy and numeracy skills. Lack of digital skills is also a concern, affecting 40% of the EU population. Romania has the highest percentage (74%) of individuals aged 16-74 without basic digital skills, followed by Bulgaria (69%), Poland (60%), Italy and Cyprus (57%), and Ireland and Greece (56%). Finland and Denmark are below the EU average at 25%, while Luxembourg has the lowest percentage of people without basic digital skills (14%). More than half of the 12 million long-term unemployed across Europe are considered as low- skilled. At the same time, many highly qualified young people work in jobs that do not match their talents and aspirations, and 40% of European employers have difficulties in finding employees with the right skills. Few people have the entrepreneurial mindset and competences to start their own business and adapt to evolving labour market requirements, with only 11% of adults in Europe being involved in lifelong learning. VET CHAMPIONS The Czech Republic has the highest percentage (73%) of students in vocational education and training (VET), followed by Croatia with 71%, Austria and Finland (70%) and Slovakia (69%). On the other side of the spectrum, Malta (13%) and Cyprus (15%) have the lowest percentages of VET students. WIND OF CHANGE The global economy changes fast. To tackle skills challenges and help Europe\u2019s future prosperity, the skills agenda will make skills more visible, improving their recognition at local, national and EU levels.

        "14 | SKILL SET AND MATCH Europe\u2019s ageing labour force (people aged over 55 will become a large part of the labour force by 2025) has to cope with advances in technology, which, some studies suggest, could automate around 47% of jobs in the European Union (EU) out of existence over the next 20 years. But, despite fears of job losses, employment in the EU is expected to pass its 2008 pre-crisis peak in 2020 and continue to rise. Many in work are busier than ever, as technology makes it increasingly possible to work from wherever and whenever, challenging traditional work patterns. Technology and demography are changing both the skills the labour market wants and how people acquire them. In response, European and national vocational education and training (VET) policies and systems are slowly being transformed. Efforts are being made to increase access to training for all age groups. Emphasis is being placed on developing core competences such as organisation and communications, to help people adapt to change. Work-based learning and apprenticeships for adults and young people are being extended to match training more closely to labour market needs. Quality of VET is also being improved, including better training for VET teachers and trainers. The European Commission, Member States and social partners agreed a European VET policy framework for 2015-20, in June 2015, in Riga. But technical support through research, analyses and other expertise is provided by Cedefop, which is involved in many initiatives to improve VET across the EU. Cedefop has helped develop common European tools such as the European qualifications framework (EQF), which compares all types of national qualifications with each other and those from other countries. Countries increasingly see the EQF and the national qualifications frameworks linked to it as tools for education and training reform.

        "SEpTEMBEr 2016 | 15 New European guidelines for validating informal and non-formal learning, published by Cedefop and the European Commission in 2015, aim to speed up labour market integration and improve career prospects. Cedefop also helped devise Europass, a portfolio of documents that show an individual\u2019s knowledge, skills and competences in a standard European format, available in 27 languages. Since its launch in 2005, more than 65 million Europass CVs have been generated online. Other initiatives Cedefop is working on include a scoreboard to encourage mobility for VET (see pp. 18-19). As part of the European alliance for apprenticeships Cedefop is reviewing apprenticeship arrangements in several Member States. The agency\u2019s skill supply and demand forecasts for the EU and each Member State, along with its European skills and jobs survey on skill mismatch, have brought new insights into how the labour market is changing, revealing differences across sectors and countries in terms of jobs and qualifications. New challenges are on the horizon. The New skills agenda for Europe is prompting a rethink about many aspects of VET: how skills are developed; how they can be made visible on the labour market; how the labour market uses people\u2019s skills; and how to help people make informed career choices. To support the debate on the direction of VET, with the European Commission, Cedefop operates the Skills Panorama, a dynamic, interactive web platform giving access to data on trends in skills and jobs across Europe. It also remains to be seen how the influx of refugees and asylum seekers into the EU will affect VET. More than 80% of arrivals are younger than 35. Ready access to education and training or the labour market is essential to their integration. After helping devise European tools and principles, Cedefop is now supporting national implementation. It monitors progress of VET reform across Europe and investigates new demands being made on VET and learning for work; its findings are widely cited in policy documents from the EU and international organisations such as OECD, the IMF, the World Economic Forum and UNESCO. As well as providing new insights and information, Cedefop aims to be a knowledge broker and, through its policy learning forums, to stimulate action to improve VET. Cedefop plans to produce more country-based evidence to support policy learning and implementation in Member States. By encouraging Member States to \u2018think European, act local\u2019, Cedefop is continuing to help policy-makers, including social partners, at European and, increasingly, national level to adapt VET systems to new demands and support people for whom VET offers the first route to employment. \u25a0 SKILLS AGENDA p h o t o : \u00a9 S h u t t e r s t o c k _ D i e g o C e r v o ",

        "Education reform is a hot topic in Slovakia. In international surveys such as PISA and PIAAC, the performance of young people is seen as insufficient, the responsiveness of secondary initial vocational education and training (VET) to labour market needs is often criticised, and there is dissatisfaction with higher education providing too many graduates from humanities and social sciences. The government body accrediting higher education demands an increase in university graduates from mathematics, science and technology programmes but mismatches are also visible elsewhere. To replace older specialists leaving the labour market, industry urgently needs more graduates from secondary mechanical and electrical engineering programmes. The booming IT sector needs more medium- and high-skilled technicians. These labour market challenges require crucial changes in the education system. The new government has drawn up a 2016-20 manifesto setting explicit objectives for all types and levels of education and training. For 2016, the Education Ministry has adopted a range of tasks such as increasing funding, improving school equipment, and more participative governance. Specific measures for initial VET include: \u2022 evaluating the first year of implementing Slovakia\u2019s version of dual VET; this will focus on helping SMEs participate effectively; \u2022 creating a funding scheme for employer representatives responsible for jointly managing dual VET; \u2022 identifying occupations and programmes suitable for post-secondary VET, in cooperation with employer representatives; \u2022 piloting in-service training in enterprises for initial VET teachers and trainers; \u2022 removing a legislative barrier that prevents experienced practitioners from assessing the quality of continuing development programmes for initial VET teachers and trainers. Slovakia\u2019s experience with its recently introduced dual VET will be discussed at the meeting of European Directors General for VET and the event on apprenticeships that the country will host in October during its EU Presidency. The government has announced a comprehensive education and training reform strategy, the National programme for development of education . Priorities for the next decade are to be presented for public consultation by the end of 2016. \u25a0 MEMBER STATES by rEfErNET SLoVAkiA www.refernet.sk p h o t o : \u00a9 S h u t t e r s t o c k _ T T s t u d i o S L O V A K VE T 2016 list of specific tasks (Education Ministry, in Slovak) 2016-20 government manifesto (in English) TIMES OF CHANGE for SEpTEMBEr 2016 | 17 ",
        "The mobility scoreboard for initial vocational education and training (IVET) is a new tool on learning mobility. It was developed for policy-makers by Cedefop, in close cooperation with the European Commission, and presented in Thessaloniki in June. A prototype with information on 28 countries (26 EU Member States, Iceland and Norway) is available on the Cedefop website, while the interactive online tool is being finalised and will be launched during the vocational education and training (VET) week in December. Cedefop expert Guy Tchibozo, the project leader, explains how it will be used. Who is the mobility scoreboard for? The scoreboard is intended for all those who \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 contribute to designing and setting up policies for learning mobility in IVET in Europe. This includes not only EU/national policy-makers but also a range of stakeholders. For policy-makers, the scoreboard provides tools to carry out checks on IVET mobility systems, as well as improvement suggestions and examples of good practice for inspiration. The other main stakeholders targeted are learners\u2019 unions and mobility organisers, including Erasmus+ national agencies and other mobility schemes, IVET institutions, companies involved in mobility, Euroguidance and other guidance institutions, and unions of teachers, trainers, guidance counsellors and other staff involved in organising mobility activities. All these are well placed to offer policy-makers improvement suggestions drawn from their mobility-related experience. The scoreboard can inform and shape policy reform proposals. How can it boost learning mobility in Europe? Through pointing out areas of concern, highlighting examples of good practices, and formulating suggestions for reform, the scoreboard will help improve policies and structures, leading to more favourable, and incentivising, conditions for learning mobility. s c o r e b o a r d 18 | SKILL SET AND MATCH iNTEr VIEW MoViNG To LEArN: for EUROPE a new The scoreboard will help improve policies and structures, leading to more favourable, and incentivising, conditions for learning mobility \u201c GUY TCHIBOZO CEDEfop ExpErT m o b ili t y ",
        "Young people in vocational education and training don\u2019t move as much as those in higher education. Is this because of a lack of opportunities or is there a different mentality as well? Several reasons may explain a weaker tendency to mobility in VET. First, European mobility programmes in higher education started as early as the mid-1980s, whereas similar initiatives in VET started only a decade later. Not only was the policy impulse delayed in VET, it was also weaker, developing \u2013 until recently \u2013 on a smaller scale. Next, learning mobility is not a tradition in VET; vocational training has been most often targeted at meeting the needs of local labour markets. Another reason is that mobility may have not been strongly encouraged in VET in the past, due to attempts to ensure return on training investment. There have been concerns that the mobility scoreboard can be used to make comparisons that are favourable for some countries and not so favourable for others. Can this be avoided? The methodology used for the scoreboard is neutral in the sense that it does not contain features targeted at introducing biases favourable/detrimental to this or that (type of) country. Yet, using the same neutral tool to assess the performance of different countries unsurprisingly reveals differences in performance across countries. However, showcasing these differences or comparing countries is neither the raison d\u2019\u00eatre nor the objective of the scoreboard. Using the scoreboard for comparing countries may also not be so relevant given the diversity of VET structures and approaches, which limits the scope for comparisons. Instead, what the scoreboard aims to do is propose ways ahead for areas of concern, to help countries boost future mobility. But recalling this goal and warning users against the \u2018beauty contest\u2019 inclination is certainly a constant preoccupation when presenting the scoreboard to users and stakeholders. When it comes to the bigger picture of VET reform how does the mobility scoreboard fare? VET reforms have been under way for a long time nationally, including in the broad area of learning mobility. What the scoreboard will bring to national policy-makers is complementary support in identifying mobility areas in need of change from a European standpoint, along with systematic overviews of related good practices, structures and policies in other European countries. \u25a0 SEpTEMBEr 2016 | 19 iNTEr VIEW Mobility scoreboard prototype with information on 28 countries ",

        "Commissioner Thyssen opens #CedefopPhotoAward exhibition in Strasbourg Thessaloniki International Film Festival and contribute to initiatives that promote young people\u2019s talents. Tell us about the festival\u2019s educational programmes and the opportunities they offer youth. TIFF\u2019s educational programmes are essential for the festival and it is our aim to expand them as much as possible. The feedback we receive from the 27 000 school students who participate in them every year proves that they are becoming more and more successful. These programmes address young people aged 7 to 17 and take place at the Thessaloniki Cinema Museum located at the city\u2019s port, as well as at TIFF\u2019s historical Olympion building at Aristotelous Square. The Cinema Museum encourages various educational activities aiming to familiarise schoolchildren with the concept of cinema, to help them discover its history and language, and to cultivate a critical way of viewing and creative expression. The programme Schools go to the cinema held at the Olympion complex involves the screening of films which are selected according to the age of the audience, content suitability and artistic qualities, providing young people with the opportunity to know and appreciate cinema. A new Euforia action plan for film literacy will be launched by Euforia\u2019s leader partner, the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, in October 2016. The programme will run a series of educational projects in collaboration with Spoleczna Akademia Nauk (Poland) and Laterna Magica (Hungary). What can this experience bring to the winners of the #CedefopPhotoAward? The #CedefopPhotoAward winners will have the opportunity to experience first-hand the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, the leading film festival in South Eastern Europe, which promotes and encourages new artists and cutting-edge filmmaking. Through this experience, they will become part of an important event that provides a space for innovation, communication and participation for people of all ages to share their love of cinema. The film screenings, festival guests, and parallel activities (masterclasses, open discussions, exhibitions, concerts and parties) create a unique atmosphere in this 10-day event that takes place each November. Let\u2019s not forget that Thessaloniki is the place to be for young people, a location bustling with youth energy thanks also to the students of the city\u2019s Aristotle University. \u25a0 Left to right: Cedefop\u2019s Gerd-Oskar Bausewein, Commissioner Thyssen, Vasiliki Kalopita and Ant\u00eda Varela Torres (both winners of the #CedefopPhotoAward first phase) at the opening of the exhibition in Strasbourg SEpTEMBEr 2016 | 21 #CEDEFOP phoToAWArD ",
