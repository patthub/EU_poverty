        "I (Legislative acts) REGULATIONS REGULATION (EU) No 1257/2012 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 17 December 2012 implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and in particular the first paragraph of Article 118 thereof, Having regard to Council Decision 2011/167/EU of 10 March 2011 authorising enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection ( 1 ), Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure ( 2 ), Whereas: (1) The creation of the legal conditions enabling under\u00ad takings to adapt their activities in manufacturing and distributing products across national borders and providing them with greater choice and more oppor\u00ad tunities contributes to the attainment of the objectives of the Union set out in Article 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union. Uniform patent protection within the internal market, or at least a significant part thereof, should feature amongst the legal instruments which undertakings have at their disposal. (2) Pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 118 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), measures to be taken in the context of the estab\u00ad lishment and functioning of the internal market include the creation of uniform patent protection throughout the Union and the establishment of centralised Union-wide authorisation, coordination and supervision arrange\u00ad ments. (3) On 10 March 2011, the Council adopted Decision 2011/167/EU authorising enhanced cooperation between Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, France, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom (hereinafter \u2018participating Member States\u2019) in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection. (4) Unitary patent protection will foster scientific and tech\u00ad nological advances and the functioning of the internal market by making access to the patent system easier, less costly and legally secure. It will also improve the level of patent protection by making it possible to obtain uniform patent protection in the participating Member States and eliminate costs and complexity for undertakings throughout the Union. It should be available to proprietors of a European patent from both the participating Member States and from other States, regardless of their nationality, residence or place of establishment. (5) The Convention on the Grant of European Patents of 5 October 1973, as revised on 17 December 1991 and on 29 November 2000 (hereinafter \u2018EPC\u2019), estab\u00ad lished the European Patent Organisation and entrusted it with the task of granting European patents. This task is carried out by the European Patent Office (hereinafter \u2018EPO\u2019). A European patent granted by the EPO should, at the request of the patent proprietor, benefit from unitary effect by virtue of this Regulation in the participating Member States. Such a patent is hereinafter referred to as a \u2018European patent with unitary effect\u2019. EN 31.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 361/1 ( 1 ) OJ L 76, 22.3.2011, p. 53. ( 2 ) Position of the European Parliament of 11 December 2012 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and decision of the Council of 17 December 2012. ",
        "(6) In accordance with Part IX of the EPC a group of Contracting States to the EPC may provide that European patents granted for those States have a unitary character. This Regulation constitutes a special agreement within the meaning of Article 142 of the EPC, a regional patent treaty within the meaning of Article 45(1) of the Patent Cooperation Treaty of 19 June 1970 as last modified on 3 February 2001 and a special agreement within the meaning of Article 19 of the Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, signed in Paris on 20 March 1883 and last amended on 28 September 1979. (7) Unitary patent protection should be achieved by attributing unitary effect to European patents in the post-grant phase by virtue of this Regulation and in respect of all the participating Member States. The main feature of a European patent with unitary effect should be its unitary character, i.e. providing uniform protection and having equal effect in all the participating Member States. Consequently, a European patent with unitary effect should only be limited, transferred or revoked, or lapse, in respect of all the participating Member States. It should be possible for a European patent with unitary effect to be licensed in respect of the whole or part of the territories of the participating Member States. To ensure the uniform substantive scope of protection conferred by unitary patent protection, only European patents that have been granted for all the participating Member States with the same set of claims should benefit from unitary effect. Finally, the unitary effect attributed to a European patent should have an accessory nature and should be deemed not to have arisen to the extent that the basic European patent has been revoked or limited. (8) In accordance with the general principles of patent law and Article 64(1) of the EPC, unitary patent protection should take effect retroactively in the participating Member States as from the date of publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent in the European Patent Bulletin. Where unitary patent protection takes effect, the participating Member States should ensure that the European patent is deemed not to have taken effect on their territory as a national patent, so as to avoid any duplication of patent protection. (9) The European patent with unitary effect should confer on its proprietor the right to prevent any third party from committing acts against which the patent provides protection. This should be ensured through the estab\u00ad lishment of a Unified Patent Court. In matters not covered by this Regulation or by Council Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012 of 17 December 2012 imple\u00ad menting enhanced cooperation in the area of unitary patent protection with regard to the applicable trans\u00ad lation arrangements ( 1 ), the provisions of the EPC, the Agreement on a Unified Patent Court, including its provisions defining the scope of that right and its limi\u00ad tations, and national law, including rules of private inter\u00ad national law, should apply. (10) Compulsory licences for European patents with unitary effect should be governed by the laws of the participating Member States as regards their respective territories. (11) In its report on the operation of this Regulation, the Commission should evaluate the functioning of the applicable limitations and, where necessary, make appro\u00ad priate proposals, taking account of the contribution of the patent system to innovation and technological progress, the legitimate interests of third parties and overriding interests of society. The Agreement on a Unified Patent Court does not preclude the European Union from exercising its powers in this field. (12) In accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the principle of the exhaustion of rights should also be applied to European patents with unitary effect. Therefore, rights conferred by a European patent with unitary effect should not extend to acts concerning the product covered by that patent which are carried out within the participating Member States after that product has been placed on the market in the Union by the patent proprietor. (13) The regime applicable to damages should be governed by the laws of the participating Member States, in particular the provisions implementing Article 13 of Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intel\u00ad lectual property rights ( 2 ). (14) As an object of property, a European patent with unitary effect should be dealt with in its entirety, and in all the participating Member States, as a national patent of the participating Member State determined in accordance with specific criteria such as the applicant\u2019s residence, principal place of business or place of business. (15) In order to promote and facilitate the economic exploi\u00ad tation of an invention protected by a European patent with unitary effect, the proprietor of that patent should be able to offer it to be licensed in return for appropriate consideration. To that end, the patent proprietor should be able to file a statement with the EPO that he is prepared to grant a license in return for appropriate consideration. In that case, the patent proprietor should benefit from a reduction of the renewal fees as from the EPO\u2019s receipt of such statement. EN L 361/2 Official Journal of the European Union 31.12.2012 ( 1 ) See page 89 of this Official Journal. ( 2 ) OJ L 157, 30.4.2004, p. 45. ",
        "(16) The group of Member States making use of the provisions of Part IX of the EPC may give tasks to the EPO and set up a select committee of the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation (hereinafter \u2018Select Committee\u2019). (17) The participating Member States should give certain administrative tasks relating to European patents with unitary effect to the EPO, in particular as regards the administration of requests for unitary effect, the regis\u00ad tration of unitary effect and of any limitation, licence, transfer, revocation or lapse of European patents with unitary effect, the collection and distribution of renewal fees, the publication of translations for information purposes during a transitional period and the adminis\u00ad tration of a compensation scheme for the reimbursement of translation costs incurred by applicants filing European patent applications in a language other than one of the official languages of the EPO. (18) In the framework of the Select Committee, the partici\u00ad pating Member States should ensure the governance and supervision of the activities related to the tasks entrusted to the EPO by the participating Member States, ensure that requests for unitary effect are filed with the EPO within one month of the date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin and ensure that such requests are submitted in the language of the proceedings before the EPO together with the translation prescribed, during a transitional period, by Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012. The partici\u00ad pating Member States should also ensure the setting, in accordance with the voting rules laid down in Article 35(2) of the EPC, of the level of the renewal fees and the share of the distribution of the renewal fees in accordance with the criteria set out in this Regu\u00ad lation. (19) Patent proprietors should pay a single annual renewal fee for a European patent with unitary effect. Renewal fees should be progressive throughout the term of the patent protection and, together with the fees to be paid to the European Patent Organisation during the pre-grant stage, should cover all costs associated with the grant of the European patent and the administration of the unitary patent protection. The level of the renewal fees should be set with the aim of facilitating innovation and fostering the competitiveness of European businesses, taking into account the situation of specific entities such as small and medium-sized enterprises, for example in the form of lower fees. It should also reflect the size of the market covered by the patent and be similar to the level of the national renewal fees for an average European patent taking effect in the participating Member States at the time when the level of the renewal fees is first set. (20) The appropriate level and distribution of renewal fees should be determined in order to ensure that, in relation to the unitary patent protection, all costs of the tasks entrusted to the EPO are fully covered by the resources generated by the European patents with unitary effect and that, together with the fees to be paid to the European Patent Organisation during the pre-grant stage, the revenues from the renewal fees ensure a balanced budget of the European Patent Organisation. (21) Renewal fees should be paid to the European Patent Organisation. The EPO should retain an amount to cover the expenses generated at the EPO in carrying out tasks in relation to the unitary patent protection in accordance with Article 146 of the EPC. The remaining amount should be distributed among the participating Member States and should be used for patent-related purposes. The share of distribution should be set on the basis of fair, equitable and relevant criteria, namely the level of patent activity and the size of the market, and should guarantee a minimum amount to be distributed to each participating Member State in order to maintain a balanced and sustainable functioning of the system. The distribution should provide compensation for having an official language other than one of the official languages of the EPO, having a disproportionately low level of patenting activity established on the basis of the European Innovation Scoreboard, and/or having acquired membership of the European Patent Organi\u00ad sation relatively recently. (22) An enhanced partnership between the EPO and central industrial property offices of the Member States should enable the EPO to make regular use, where appropriate, of the result of any search carried out by central industrial property offices on a national patent appli\u00ad cation the priority of which is claimed in a subsequent European patent application. All central industrial property offices, including those which do not perform searches in the course of a national patent-granting procedure, can play an essential role under the enhanced partnership, inter alia, by giving advice and support to potential patent applicants, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, by receiving appli\u00ad cations, by forwarding applications to the EPO and by disseminating patent information. (23) This Regulation is complemented by Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012, adopted by the Council in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 118 of the TFEU. (24) Jurisdiction in respect of European patents with unitary effect should be established and governed by an instrument setting up a unified patent litigation system for European patents and European patents with unitary effect. (25) Establishing a Unified Patent Court to hear cases concerning the European patent with unitary effect is essential in order to ensure the proper functioning of that patent, consistency of case-law and hence legal EN 31.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 361/3 ",
        "certainty, and cost-effectiveness for patent proprietors. It is therefore of paramount importance that the partici\u00ad pating Member States ratify the Agreement on a Unified Patent Court in accordance with their national constitutional and parliamentary procedures and take the necessary steps for that Court to become operational as soon as possible. (26) This Regulation should be without prejudice to the right of the participating Member States to grant national patents and should not replace the participating Member States\u2019 laws on patents. Patent applicants should remain free to obtain either a national patent, a European patent with unitary effect, a European patent taking effect in one or more of the Contracting States to the EPC or a European patent with unitary effect validated in addition in one or more other Contracting States to the EPC which are not among the participating Member States. (27) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the creation of unitary patent protection, cannot be suffi\u00ad ciently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of this Regulation, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, where appropriate by means of enhanced cooperation, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 Subject matter 1.

CHAPTER V FINANCIAL PROVISIONS Article 10 Principle on expenses The expenses incurred by the EPO in carrying out the additional tasks given to it, within the meaning of Article 143 of the EPC, by the participating Member States shall be covered by the fees generated by the European patents with unitary effect. Article 11 Renewal fees 1. Renewal fees for European patents with unitary effect and additional fees for their late payment shall be paid to the European Patent Organisation by the patent proprietor. Those fees shall be due in respect of the years following the year in which the mention of the grant of the European patent which benefits from unitary effect is published in the European Patent Bulletin.

Renewal fees which fall due after receipt of the statement referred to in Article 8(1) shall be reduced. Article 12 Level of renewal fees 1. Renewal fees for European patents with unitary effect shall be: (a) progressive throughout the term of the unitary patent protection; (b) sufficient to cover all costs associated with the grant of the European patent and the administration of the unitary patent protection; and (c) sufficient, together with the fees to be paid to the European Patent Organisation during the pre-grant stage, to ensure a balanced budget of the European Patent Organisation. 2. The level of the renewal fees shall be set, taking into account, among others, the situation of specific entities such as small and medium-sized enterprises, with the aim of: (a) facilitating innovation and fostering the competitiveness of European businesses; (b) reflecting the size of the market covered by the patent; and (c) being similar to the level of the national renewal fees for an average European patent taking effect in the participating Member States at the time the level of the renewal fees is first set. 3. In order to attain the objectives set out in this Chapter, the level of renewal fees shall be set at a level that: (a) is equivalent to the level of the renewal fee to be paid for the average geographical coverage of current European patents; (b) reflects the renewal rate of current European patents; and (c) reflects the number of requests for unitary effect. Article 13 Distribution 1. The EPO shall retain 50 per cent of the renewal fees referred to in Article 11 paid for European patents with unitary effect. The remaining amount shall be distributed to the participating Member States in accordance with the share of distribution of the renewal fees set pursuant to Article 9(2). 2. In order to attain the objectives set out in this Chapter, the share of distribution of renewal fees among the participating Member States shall be based on the following fair, equitable and relevant criteria: (a) the number of patent applications; (b) the size of the market, while ensuring a minimum amount to be distributed to each participating Member State; (c) compensation to the participating Member States which have: (i) an official language other than one of the official languages of the EPO; (ii) a disproportionately low level of patenting activity; and/or (iii) acquired membership of the European Patent Organi\u00ad sation relatively recently.

CHAPTER III TECHNICAL MEASURES Technical measures applicable to the vessels holding a fishing authorisation, relating to the zone, fishing gears and by- catches, shall be defined for each fishing category in the technical sheets attached as Appendix 2. The vessels shall comply with the fisheries legislation of Madagascar and all the resolutions adopted by the IOTC. EN 31.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 361/19 ",
        "CHAPTER IV CATCH REPORTING 1. Definition of the fishing trip For the purposes of this Annex, the duration of a fishing trip by an EU vessel shall be defined as follows: (a) the period elapsing between entering and leaving Madagascar's fishing zone, or (b) the period elapsing between entering Madagascar's fishing zone and a transhipment in port and/or a landing in Madagascar. 2. Fishing logbook The captain of an EU vessel fishing under the Agreement shall keep an IOTC fishing logbook, for which the model for each category of fishing is included in Appendices 6 and 7. The fishing logbook must comply with IOTC resolution 08/04 for longliners and resolution 10/03 for purse seiners. The fishing logbook shall be completed by the captain for each day the vessel is present in the fishing zone of Madagascar. Each day the captain shall record in the fishing logbook the quantity of each species, identified by its 3-alpha code of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), caught and kept on board, expressed in kilograms of live weight or, where necessary, the number of individual fish. For each main species, the captain shall also mention the by-catches and discards. The fishing logbook shall be filled in legibly, in block capitals, and signed by the captain. The captain shall be responsible for the accuracy of the data recorded in the fishing logbook. 3. Catch reporting The captain shall notify the vessel's catch by submitting its fishing logbooks to Madagascar for the period of its presence in Madagascar's fishing zone. The fishing logbooks shall be transmitted in one of the following ways: (a) when passing through a Malagasy port, the original of each fishing logbook shall be submitted to the local representative of Madagascar, who shall confirm receipt thereof in writing; a copy of the logbook shall be handed over to the inspection team in Madagascar; (b) when leaving Madagascar's fishing zone without first passing through a Malagasy port, the original of each fishing logbook shall be sent within a period of seven working days after arrival in any other port, and in any case within a period of fifteen working days after leaving Madagascar's fishing zone: (i) by e-mail, to the e-mail address given by the national body supervising fishing activities; or (ii) by fax, to the number given by the national body supervising fishing activities; or (iii) by letter sent to the national body supervising fishing activities. The return of the vessel into Madagascar's fishing zone within the period of validity of its fishing authorisation shall give rise to further catch reporting. The two parties shall establish, as from 1 July 2013, a protocol for the electronic exchange of all catch and reporting data based on an electronic logbook; the two parties shall then plan the implementation of the protocol and the replacement of the paper version of the catch reporting with an electronic version by 1 January 2014 at the latest. EN L 361/20 Official Journal of the European Union 31.12.2012 ",
        "The captain shall send a copy of all the fishing logbooks to the EU and the competent flag State authority. For tuna- fishing vessels and surface longliners, the captain shall also send a copy of all the fishing logbooks to the competent national scientific institutes: USTA (Antsiranana Tuna Statistical Unit) and FMC (Fisheries Monitoring Centre) and to one of the following scientific institutes: (a) Institut de recherche pour le d\u00e9veloppement (IRD); (b) Instituto Espa\u00f1ol de Oceanograf\u00eda (IEO); (c) Instituto Portugu\u00eas de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Mar\u00edtima (IPIMAR). Where the provisions concerning catch reporting are not complied with, Madagascar may suspend the fishing auth\u00ad orisation of the vessel concerned until the missing catch report is obtained and penalise the ship-owner in accordance with the relevant provisions under the national legislation in force. If the offence is repeated, Madagascar may refuse to renew the fishing authorisation. Madagascar shall inform the EU immediately of any penalty applied in this context. 4. Final statement of fees for tuna-fishing vessels and surface longliners For each tuna seiner and surface longliner, the EU shall draw up, on the basis of its catch reporting confirmed by the aforementioned scientific institutes, a final statement of the fees owed by the vessel in respect of its annual season for the previous calendar year. The EU shall send this final statement to Madagascar and to the ship-owner before 31 July of the year in progress. Madagascar may contest the final statement, on the basis of documentary proof, within 30 working days of its being sent. In the case of disagreement, the parties shall consult each other in the Joint Committee. If Madagascar does not object within 30 working days, the final statement shall be considered to be adopted. Where the final statement is greater than the anticipated flat-rate fee paid to obtain the fishing authorisation, the ship- owner shall pay the outstanding balance to Madagascar by 30 September of the year in progress at the latest. Where the final statement is less than the expected flat-rate fee, the remaining amount may not be reclaimed by the ship- owner. CHAPTER V LANDINGS AND TRANSHIPMENTS Transhipment at sea is prohibited. All transhipment operations in port shall be monitored in the presence of fishing inspectors from Madagascar. The captain of an EU vessel wishing to land or to tranship must notify the FMC and, at the same time, the Malagasy port authority, at least 48 hours before the landing or transhipment, of the following: (a) the name of the fishing vessel wishing to land or tranship and its registration number as recorded in the IOTC register of fishing vessels; (b) the port of landing or transhipment; (c) the date and time scheduled for the landing or transhipment; (d) the quantity (expressed in kilograms of live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish) of each species to be landed or transhipped (as identified by its FAO 3-alpha code). The transhipment operation shall be subject to a prior authorisation issued by the FMC in Madagascar to the captain or their local agent within 24 hours after the aforementioned notification. The transhipment operation must be carried out in a Malagasy port authorised for this purpose. In the event of transhipment, in addition to the information contained in points (a) to (d), the captain will also notify the name of the receiving vessel. EN 31.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 361/21 ",
        "The captain of the transporting ship shall, upon receipt, notify the Malagasy authorities (the FMC and the port authority) of the quantities of tuna and tuna-like species transhipped onto the vessel and complete and send the transhipment declaration to the FMC and the port authority in Madagascar within 24 hours. The fishing ports where transhipment operations are authorised in Madagascar are Antsiranana for seiners and Toliara, Ehoala and Toamasina for longliners. Non-compliance with these provisions will lead to the application of the relevant penalties provided for under the legislation of Madagascar. EU vessels landing in a Malagasy port shall endeavour to make their by-catches available to the local processing companies at the local market price. Upon request from the EU fishing companies the Regional Directorates for Fisheries of Madagascar shall provide a list and contact details for the local processing companies. EU tuna vessels choosing to land their catches in a Malagasy port shall benefit from a reduction of EUR 5 per tonne fished in Madagascar's fishing zone in the fee indicated in Appendix 2 for the fishing category of vessels concerned. An additional reduction of EUR 5 will be granted where fisheries products are sold in a processing factory in Madagascar. CHAPTER VI CHECKS 1. Entering and leaving the fishing zone Any entry into or departure from Madagascar's fishing zone by an EU vessel holding a fishing authorisation must be notified to Madagascar within three hours of entry or departure. When notifying its entry or departure, the vessel shall notify in particular: (a) the date, time and point of passage scheduled; (b) the quantity of each target species held on board, as identified by its FAO 3-alpha code and expressed in kilograms of live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish; (c) the quantity of each by-catch species retained on board as identified by its FAO 3-alpha code and expressed in kilograms of live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish. Notification shall be given preferably by e-mail or, failing that, by fax, to an e-mail address or a telephone number or fax number communicated by the FMC, using the form attached as Appendix 8. The FMC shall confirm receipt thereof immediately by return e-mail or fax. The FMC shall immediately inform the vessels concerned and the EU of any change to the e-mail address, telephone number or transmission frequency. Any vessel found to be fishing in Madagascar's fishing zone without having previously notified its presence shall be considered to be an unauthorised fishing vessel. Any person infringing this provision shall be liable to the fines and penalties provided for by the Malagasy fisheries legislation in force. The entry/exit catch reports must be kept on board at least for one year from the date of the report transmission. EU fishing vessels not authorised to fish shall be the subject of an innocent passage declaration. The content of this declaration shall be the same as that stated in this point. 2. Cooperation as regards combating IUU fishing In order to strengthen fisheries monitoring and to combat IUU fishing, EU fishing vessels shall be encouraged to inform the FMC of the presence of any other fishing vessels in their surroundings. EN L 361/22 Official Journal of the European Union 31.12.2012 ",
        "3. Periodic catch report When an EU vessel is operating in the waters of Madagascar, the captain of an EU vessel holding a fishing auth\u00ad orisation must notify the FMC, every three days, of catches made in Madagascar's fishing zone. The first catch declaration shall start three days after the date of entry into Madagascar's fishing zone. Every three days, when notifying its periodic catch report, the vessel shall notify in particular: (a) the date, time and position on reporting; (b) the quantity of each target species caught and held on board during the three-day period, as identified by its FAO 3-alpha code and expressed in kilograms of live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish; (c) the quantity of each by-catch species retained on board during the three-day period, as identified by its FAO 3-alpha code and expressed in kilograms of live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish; (d) the quantity of each by-catch species discarded at sea during the three-day period, as identified by its FAO 3-alpha code and expressed in kilograms of live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish; (e) product presentation; (f) for tuna purse seiners: \u2014 number of successful sets using fish aggregating devices since the last report; \u2014 number of successful sets on free school since the last report; \u2014 number of unsuccessful sets.

Notification shall be given preferably by e-mail or, failing that, by fax, to an e-mail address or a telephone number communicated by the FMC, using the form attached as Appendix 8. The FMC shall immediately inform the vessels concerned and the EU of any change to the e-mail address, telephone number or transmission frequency. Any vessel found to be fishing in Madagascar's fishing zone without having notified its three-day periodic catch report shall be considered to be an unauthorised fishing vessel. Any person infringing this provision shall be liable to the fines and penalties provided for by the Malagasy legislation in force. The periodic catch reports must be kept on board at least during 1 year from the date of the transmission of the report. 4. Inspection at sea Inspection at sea in Madagascar's fishing zone of EU vessels holding a fishing authorisation shall be carried out by inspectors from Madagascar who are clearly identifiable as being responsible for carrying out fisheries checks. Before going on board, the authorised inspectors shall inform the EU vessel on VHF channel 16 of their decision to carry out an inspection. The inspection shall be carried out by fisheries inspectors, who must provide proof of their inspection warrant and identity and rank as inspectors before carrying out the inspection. The authorised inspectors shall stay on board the EU vessel only for the time necessary to carry out the tasks related to the inspection. They shall carry out the inspection in such a way as to minimise the impact on the vessel, its fishing activity and cargo. EN 31.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 361/23 ",
        "At the end of each inspection, the authorised inspectors shall draw up an inspection report. The captain of the EU vessel has the right to include his comments in the inspection report. The inspection report shall be signed by the inspector drawing up the report and the captain of the EU vessel. The authorised inspectors shall give a copy of the inspection report to the captain of the EU vessel before leaving the vessel. In cases of infringement, a copy of the notification of the infringement shall also be sent to the EU in accordance with the provisions of chapter VIII. 5. Inspection in port in cases of landing and transhipment The inspection of EU fishing vessels which land or tranship their catch in a Malagasy port shall be carried out by Malagasy inspectors who are clearly identifiable as being responsible for carrying out fishing checks. Inspectors must provide proof of their inspection warrant and identity and rank as inspectors before carrying out the inspection. The Malagasy inspectors shall only stay on board the EU vessel for the time necessary to carry out the tasks related to the inspection and shall conduct the inspection in such a way as to minimise the impact on the vessel, the landing or transhipment operation and the cargo. At the end of each inspection, the Malagasy inspectors shall draw up an inspection report. The captain of the EU vessel has the right to include his comments in the inspection report. The inspection report shall be signed by the inspector drawing up the report and the captain of the EU vessel. The Malagasy inspectors shall provide a copy of the inspection report to the captain of the EU vessel at the end of the inspection. In cases of infringement, a copy of the notification of the infringement shall also be sent to the EU in accordance with the provisions of chapter VIII. CHAPTER VII SATELLITE-BASED VESSEL MONITORING SYSTEM (VMS) 1. Vessel position messages \u2013 VMS system EU vessels holding a fishing authorisation must be equipped with a satellite monitoring system (Vessel Monitoring System \u2013 VMS) to enable automatic and continuous communication of their position, at all times, to the FMC of their flag state. Each position message must contain: (a) vessel identification; (b) the most recent geographical position of the vessel (longitude, latitude), with a margin of error of less than 500 metres, and with a confidence interval of 99 %; (c) the date and time the position is recorded; (d) the speed and the course of the vessel. Each position message must be configured in accordance with the format appearing as Appendix 9. The first position recorded after entry into Madagascar's zone shall be identified by the code ' ENT ' . All subsequent positions shall be identified by the code ' POS ' , with the exception of the first position recorded after departure from the Madagascar zone, which shall be identified by the code ' EXI ' . The FMC of the Flag State shall ensure the automatic processing and, if necessary, the electronic transmission of the position messages. The position messages shall be recorded in a secure manner and kept for a period of three years. 2. Transmission by the vessel in the event of breakdown of the VMS system The captain shall ensure at all times that the VMS system of their vessel is fully operational and that the position messages are correctly transmitted to the FMC of the flag state. EN L 361/24 Official Journal of the European Union 31.12.2012 ",
        "EU vessels fishing with defective VMS systems are not authorised to enter the fishing zone of Madagascar. If the vessel is already operating in Madagascar's fishing zone, in the event of breakdown, the VMS system of the vessel shall be repaired or replaced as soon as possible and within fifteen days at the latest. After that time limit, the vessel shall no longer be authorised to fish in Madagascar's zone. Vessels fishing in Madagascar's zone with a defective VMS system must communicate their position messages by e- mail or fax to the FMC of the flag state and of Madagascar, at least every six hours, and must provide all the compulsory information. 3. Secure communication of the position messages to Madagascar The FMC of the flag state shall automatically send the position messages of the vessels concerned to the FMC in Madagascar. The FMC of the flag state and of Madagascar shall exchange their contact e-mail addresses and inform each other without delay of any change to these addresses. The transmission of position messages between the FMCs of the flag state and of Madagascar shall be carried out electronically using a secure communication system. The FMC in Madagascar shall inform the flag state FMC and the EU of any interruption in the reception of consecutive position messages from a vessel holding a fishing authorisation, where the vessel concerned has not notified its departure from the zone. 4. Malfunction of the communication system Madagascar shall ensure the compatibility of its electronic equipment with that of the flag state FMC and inform the EU immediately of any malfunction as regards the communication and reception of position messages with a view to finding a technical solution as soon as possible. The Joint Committee shall deal with any disputes which may arise. The captain shall be considered to be responsible for any proven manipulation of the vessel's VMS system aimed at disturbing its operation or falsifying its position messages. Any infringements shall be subject to the penalties provided for by the Malagasy legislation in force. 5. Revision of the frequency of position messages On the basis of documentary evidence proving an infringement, the FMC in Madagascar may ask the flag state FMC, copying the EU into such correspondence, to reduce the interval for sending position messages from a vessel to every thirty minutes for a set period of investigation. That documentary evidence must be sent by the FMC in Madagascar to the flag state FMC and the EU. The flag state FMC shall immediately send the position messages to Madagascar at the new frequency. The FMC in Madagascar shall immediately notify the flag State Control Centre and the European Commission of the end of the inspection procedure. At the end of the set investigation period, the FMC in Madagascar shall inform the flag state FMC and the EU of the possible follow up, if any. CHAPTER VIII INFRINGEMENTS Failure to comply with any of the rules and provisions of the Protocol, measures to ensure the management and conservation of living resources or fisheries legislation in force in Madagascar may be subject to penalties in the form of fines, suspension, cancellation or non-renewal of the vessel's fishing authorisation. 1. Handling of infringements Any infringement committed in Madagascar's fishing zone by an EU vessel holding a fishing authorisation in accordance with the provisions of this Annex must be referred to in an inspection report. In the case of an on-board inspection, the signature of the inspection report by the captain shall be without prejudice to the ship-owner's right of defence in respect of an established infringement. Should the captain refuse to sign the inspection report, they will write the reasons for their refusal in the inspection report with the statement ' refusal to sign ' . EN 31.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 361/25 ",
        "In cases of any infringement in Madagascar's fishing zone by an EU vessel holding a fishing authorisation, notification of the infringement in question and the additional penalties imposed on the captain or the fishing company shall be sent directly to the ship-owners in line with the procedures set out in Madagascar's fisheries legislation. A copy of the notification shall be sent to the vessel's flag state and to the EU within 72 hours. 2. Detention of a vessel Should an infringement be established, any EU vessel having committed an infringement may be forced to cease its fishing activity and, where the vessel is at sea, to return to a Malagasy port, in accordance with the Malagasy legislation in force. Madagascar shall provide electronic notification to the EU, within 24 hours, of any detentions of an EU vessel holding a fishing authorisation. The notification shall provide the reasons for the detention and/or retention. Before taking any measure against the vessel, the captain, the crew or the cargo, with the exception of measures aimed at protecting evidence, the FMC in Madagascar shall organise, within one working day following notification of the detention of the vessel, an information meeting to clarify the events which have resulted in the vessel's detention and to explain any possible further action. Representatives of the vessel's flag state and ship-owner shall attend this information meeting. 3. Penalties for infringements - Compromise procedure The penalty for an established infringement shall be established by Madagascar according to the provisions of the national legislation in force. A compromise procedure shall be launched prior to legal proceedings between the authorities of Madagascar and the EU vessel in order to settle the issue amicably. A representative of the vessel's flag state may be involved in this compromise procedure. The compromise procedure shall finish at the latest 72 hours after notification of the vessel's detention. 4. Legal proceedings \u2013 Bank guarantee If the above-mentioned compromise procedure is unsuccessful and the infringement is brought before the competent judicial body, the owner of the vessel which committed the infringement shall deposit a bank guarantee with the Public Treasury of Madagascar, the amount of which, as established by Madagascar, shall cover the costs linked to the detention of the vessel, the estimated fine and any compensation. The bank guarantee may not be recovered until the legal proceedings have been concluded. The bank guarantee shall be released and returned to the ship-owner as soon as possible after the judgment has been delivered: (a) in full, if no penalty has been imposed; (b) for the amount of the remaining balance, if the penalty is a fine which is lower than the amount of the bank guarantee. Madagascar shall inform the EU of the outcome of the legal proceedings within eight days of the judgment being delivered. 5. Release of the vessel and the crew The vessel and its crew shall be authorised to leave the port once the penalty resulting from a compromise procedure, or once the bank guarantee has been deposited with the Public Treasury of Madagascar. The vessel shall be released and its crew authorised to leave the port: (a) once the obligations arising under the compromise settlement have been fulfilled, or (b) when the aforementioned bank guarantee has been lodged and accepted by the Ministry responsible for Fisheries, pending the conclusion of the legal proceedings. CHAPTER IX SIGNING-ON OF SEAMEN 1. Number of seamen to be signed on Owners of tuna seiners and surface longliners shall employ ACP nationals, subject to the following conditions and limits: (a) for the fleet of tuna seiners, at least 20 % of the seamen signed on during the tuna-fishing season in the fishing zone of the third country shall be of ACP origin, EN L 361/26 Official Journal of the European Union 31.12.2012 ",
        "(b) for the fleet of surface longliners, at least 20 % of the seamen signed on during the fishing season in the fishing zone of the third country shall be of ACP origin. Ship-owners shall endeavour to take on board additional seamen of Malagasy origin. 2. Seamen's contracts The International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work shall apply as of right to seamen signed on by EU vessels. This concerns in particular the freedom of association, the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. The employment contracts of ACP seamen shall be drawn up between the ship-owners' representative(s) and the seamen and/or their trade unions or representatives; a copy of these contracts shall be given to the signatories. These contracts shall guarantee the seamen the social security cover applicable to them, including life assurance and sickness and accident insurance. 3. Seamen's wages The wages of the ACP seamen shall be paid by the ship-owners. They shall be set by mutual agreement between the ship-owners or their representatives and the seamen and/or their trade unions or representatives. However, the wage conditions granted to ACP seamen shall not be lower than those applied to crews from their respective countries and shall under no circumstances be below ILO standards. 4. Seaman's obligations All seamen employed aboard EU vessels shall report to the captain of the vessel designated on the day before their proposed embarkation date. Where a seaman fails to report at the date and time agreed for embarkation, ship-owners shall be automatically absolved of their obligation to take the seaman on board. CHAPTER X OBSERVERS 1. Observation of fishing activities Both parties recognise the importance of fulfilling the obligations under IOTC Resolutions with regards to the Scientific Observer Programme. For the purposes of compliance with these obligations, the provisions applicable to observers are as follows, except in cases of space limitations due to safety requirements. Vessels authorised to fish in the waters of Madagascar under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement shall take on board observers appointed by the authorities of Madagascar to ensure that these obligations have been complied with on the terms set out below. EU fishing vessels shall, at the request of the authorities of Madagascar, take on board one observer in order to reach the cover rate of 10 % of licensed vessels. Nevertheless, vessels less than 100 GT are not subject to this measure. 2. Designated vessels and observers The authorities of Madagascar shall draw up a list of vessels designated to take an observer on board. This list shall be kept up to date. It shall be forwarded to the European Commission as soon as it has been drawn up. The authorities of Madagascar shall inform the ship-owners concerned of the name of the observers appointed to be taken on board their vessel no later than fifteen days before the observer's planned embarkation date. The observers shall not spend more time on board the vessel than is necessary to carry out their duties. 3. Observer's salary The cost of taking the observer aboard and putting them ashore outside Madagascar shall be borne by the ship-owner. The salary and social contributions of the observer shall be borne by the authorities of Madagascar. With regard to any vessel taking aboard an observer, the ship-owner shall be asked to pay a contribution of EUR 20 for each day on board. This sum shall be paid to the observers programme administered by the FMC. EN 31.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 361/27 ",
        "4. Embarkation conditions The embarkation conditions for the observer, in particular the duration of presence on board, shall be defined by mutual agreement between the ship-owner or its local agent and Madagascar. Observers shall be treated as officers. However, receiving the observer on board shall take into account the technical structure of the vessel. The ship-owner shall bear the costs of providing accommodation and food for the observer on board. Captains shall take all the measures for which they are responsible to guarantee the physical safety and general wellbeing of the observer. Observers shall be offered every facility needed to carry out their duties. They shall have access to means of communication and any documents on board, and to documents relating to the fishing activities of the vessel, in particular the fishing logbook, freeze log and navigation log, and the parts of the vessel directly linked to their duties. 5. Embarkation and landing of observers The observer shall embark in a port chosen by the ship-owner. The ship-owner or its representative shall notify Madagascar, with a notice period of ten days before embarkation, of the date, time and port of embarkation of the observer. If the observer is embarked in a foreign country, their travel costs to the port of embarkation shall be borne by the ship-owner. If the observer does not arrive to embark within twelve hours of the date and time set, the ship-owner shall be automatically absolved of its obligation to take the observer on board. It shall be free to leave the port and start fishing operations. If the observer is not disembarked in a Malagasy port, the ship-owner shall bear the observer's accommodation and food costs incurred while waiting for a repatriation flight. If the vessel does not arrive at the agreed time at a previously agreed port to receive an observer, the ship-owner shall pay the costs relating to the observer's inability to board while waiting at the port (accommodation, food, etc.). If the vessel fails to appear, without having provided the FMC with prior notification, Madagascar may suspend the fishing authorisation for the vessel in question. 6. Observer's obligations Whilst they are on board, observers shall: (a) take all appropriate measures so as not to interrupt or hinder fishing operations; (b) respect on-board property and equipment; (c) respect the confidential nature of any document belonging to the vessel. The observers shall communicate observations by radio, fax or e-mail at least once a week while the vessel is operating in Madagascar's fishing zone, including the quantity of catches and by-catches on board and any other duties as required by the authority. 7. Observer's report Before leaving the vessel, the observer shall submit a report of his observations to the captain of the vessel. The captain of the vessel shall have the right to make comments in the observer's report. The report shall be signed by the observer and the captain. The captain shall receive a copy of the observer's report.

        "ANNEX 1 CONDITIONS GOVERNING FISHING ACTIVITIES BY EU VESSELS IN MAURITANIAN FISHING ZONES CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS 1. Designation of competent authority For the purposes of this Annex and unless otherwise specified, any reference to the European Union or to Mauritania as a competent authority shall mean: \u2014 For the European Union: the European Commission, via the European Union Delegation in Nouakchott (focal point); \u2014 For Mauritania: the Ministry of Fisheries, via the Planning and Cooperation Directorate (focal point), hereinafter referred to as the \" Ministry \" . 2. Mauritanian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) Mauritania shall inform the European Union before the entry into force of the Protocol of the latitude and longitude co-ordinates of its EEZ and its baseline, which shall be the low-water mark. 3. Vessel identification 3.1. The identification marks of all European Union vessels must conform to the relevant European Union legislation. The Ministry must be notified of such legislation before the Protocol enters into force. The Ministry must be notified of any amendment to this legislation at least one month before its entry into force. 3.2. Any vessel which conceals its markings, name or registration shall be liable to the penalties provided for by Mauritanian law in force. 4. Bank accounts Mauritania shall notify the European Union before the entry into force of the Protocol of the details of the bank account(s) (BIC and IBAN codes) into which the financial sums payable by European Union vessels under the Protocol shall be paid. The associated bank transfer charges shall be borne by the shipowners. 5. Methods of payment 5.1. Payments shall be made in euro as follows: \u2014 fees: by transfer to one of the foreign accounts of the Central Bank of Mauritania, payable to the Mauritanian Public Treasury; \u2014 fees relating to the parafiscal charge: by transfer to one of the foreign accounts of the Central Bank of Mauritania, payable to the fisheries surveillance authority; \u2014 fines: by transfer to one of the foreign accounts of the Central Bank of Mauritania, payable to the Mauritanian Public Treasury. 5.2. The amounts referred to in point 1 above shall be considered as actually received on receipt of confirmation from the Treasury or the Ministry, on the basis of notification by the Central Bank of Mauritania. CHAPTER II LICENCES This Chapter shall apply without prejudice to the specific provisions set out in Chapter XI regarding vessels targeting highly migratory species. For the purposes of this Annex, the licence issued by Mauritania to European Union vessels shall be equivalent to the fishing authorisation provided for by the European Union legislation in force. 1. Documents required for licence applications On each vessel\u2019s first licence application, the European Union shall submit to the Ministry a licence application form duly completed in respect of each vessel for which a licence is requested in accordance with the model in Appendix 1 to this Annex. EN 31.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 361/49 ",
        "1.1. On a first licence application, the shipowner shall include with the application: \u2014 a copy, certified by the flag State, of the international tonnage certificate specifying the tonnage of the vessel in GT, as certified by recognised international bodies; \u2014 a recent colour photograph certified by the competent authorities of the flag State showing a side view of the vessel in its current state. The photograph shall be at least 15 cm by 10 cm; \u2014 the documents required for registration in the Mauritanian National Ship Register. Such registration shall not entail any registration fee. The inspection provided for in connection with registration in the National Ship Register is of a purely administrative nature. 1.2. Any alteration to the tonnage of a vessel shall oblige the shipowner concerned to submit a copy, certified by the flag State, of the new GT tonnage certificate and any relevant supporting documents, in particular the copy of the application lodged by the shipowner with the competent authorities, the agreement of those authorities and the details of the changes made. Where the structure or external appearance of the vessel is modified, a new photograph certified by the competent authorities of the flag State must also be submitted. 1.3. Applications for fishing licences shall be lodged only for those vessels for which the documents required under points 1.1 and 1.2 above have been sent. 2. Eligibility to fish 2.1. Each vessel wishing to engage in fishing activities under this Protocol must be entered in the European Union fishing vessels register and be eligible for fishing in Mauritanian fishing zones. 2.2. For a vessel to be eligible, neither the owner, the master nor the vessel itself must be prohibited from fishing in Mauritania. They must be in order vis-\u00e0-vis the Mauritanian authorities insofar as they must have met all prior obligations arising from their fishing activities in Mauritania. 3. Licence applications 3.1. For all licences the European Union shall submit every quarter to the Ministry lists of the vessels, broken down by fishing category, wishing to engage in fishing activities within the limits specified in the fishing datasheets included in the Protocol, one (1) month before the start of the period of validity of the licences requested. Such lists shall be accompanied by proof of payment. Licence applications failing to arrive within these deadlines need not be processed. 3.2. These lists shall specify, by fishing category: \u2014 the number of vessels; \u2014 for each vessel, its main technical characteristics as they appear in the fishing vessel register of the European Union; \u2014 fishing gears; \u2014 the amount of payments due, broken down by heading; \u2014 the number of Mauritanian seamen. 4. Issue of licences 4.1. The Ministry shall issue vessel licences following submission, by the shipowner\u2019s agent, of individual proofs of payment for each vessel (receipt of payment issued by the Public Treasury), as specified in Chapter I, at least ten (10) days before the start of their period of validity. The licences may be obtained from the offices of the Ministry in Nouadhibou or Nouakchott. 4.2. The licences shall also indicate the period of validity, the vessel\u2019s technical characteristics, the number of Mauritanian seamen and the payment references of the fees, and the conditions relating to the fishing activities as laid down in the relevant Fishing Datasheets. EN L 361/50 Official Journal of the European Union 31.12.2012 ",
        "4.3. Vessels receiving a licence shall be entered on the list of vessels authorised to fish which shall be sent simultaneously to the surveillance authority and to the European Union. 4.4. The European Union shall be notified of licence applications refused by the Ministry. Where appropriate, the Ministry shall provide a credit note against payments relating to such applications, after deduction of the balance of any outstanding unpaid fines. 5. Validity and utilisation of licences 5.1. A licence shall be valid only for the period covered by the fee paid under the terms laid down in the Fishing Datasheet. Licences shall be issued for periods of two months for shrimp fishing and for three, six or twelve months for other categories. They shall be renewable. The validity of the licences shall start to run on the first day of the period requested. The period of validity of licences shall be determined on the basis of calendar year periods, the first period beginning on the date of entry into force of this Protocol and ending on 31 December of the same year. The last period shall end at the end of the period of application of the Protocol. Licences may not start to run during one annual period and expire during the next. 5.2. Licences are issued for a given vessel. They shall be non-transferable. However, in the event of the loss or prolonged immobilisation of a vessel due to a serious technical failure, the licence of the initial vessel shall be replaced by a licence for another vessel of the same fishing category, on condition that the tonnage authorised for that category is not exceeded. 5.3. Additional adjustments in the amounts paid as a result of the replacement of the licence shall be effected before the replacement licence is issued. 6. Technical inspection 6.1. Once a year, and after any alterations in tonnage or changes to the fishing category necessitating the use of a different type of gear, all European Union vessels shall report to the port of Nouadhibou to undergo the inspections required by the legislation in force. Such inspections shall take place within 48 hours of the vessel\u2019s arrival in port. The technical inspection procedures applying to tuna vessels and surface longliners shall be as laid down in Chapter XI of this Annex. 6.2. Once the technical inspection has been completed, the master of the vessel shall be issued with a certificate of conformity having the same period of validity as the licence which shall be automatically extended, free of charge, in the case of vessels renewing their licence in the course of the year. This certificate must be kept on board at all times. It must also specify the transhipment capacity of pelagic vessels. 6.3. The purpose of the technical inspection is to check the conformity of the vessel\u2019s technical characteristics and gear and to ensure that the provisions relating to its Mauritanian crew have been complied with. 6.4. The cost of the inspection, at the rates laid down by Mauritanian law and communicated to the European Union via the EU Delegation, shall be borne by the shipowner. It may not be greater than the amount normally paid by other vessels for the same services. 6.5. Failure to comply with the provisions of points 1 or 2 above shall entail automatic suspension of the fishing licence until the shipowner has met such obligations. CHAPTER III FEES 1. Fees Fees shall be calculated for each vessel on the basis of the annual rates laid down in the Fishing Datasheets included in the Protocol. The amounts of such fees shall include all related fees and taxes, with the exception of the parafiscal charge, port taxes and service charges.

A quarter shall consist of one of the three-month periods beginning 1 October, 1 January, 1 April or 1 July, except for the first and the last period of the Protocol. 3. Fees in kind Shipowners of European Union pelagic vessels operating under this Protocol shall contribute to the policy of fish distribution to people in need, at the rate of 2 % of their transhipped pelagic catches. This provision specifically excludes any other form of imposed contribution. 4. Final statement of fees for tuna-fishing vessels and surface longliners For each tuna-fishing vessel and surface longliner, the European Union shall draw up, on the basis of its electronic catch reporting confirmed by the above scientific institutes, a final statement of the fees owed by the vessel in respect of its annual season for the previous calendar year, or for the current year in the last year of application of the Protocol. The European Union shall notify this final statement to Mauritania and to the shipowner before 15 July of the year following the year in which the catches were made. If the final statement concerns the current year, it shall be notified to Mauritania no later than one (1) month after the date of expiry of the Protocol. Mauritania may contest the final statement, on the basis of documentary proof, within 30 working days of its being sent. In the case of disagreement, the parties shall consult each other in the Joint Committee. If Mauritania does not object within 30 days, the final statement shall be considered to be adopted. Where the final statement is greater than the advance payment fee paid to obtain the fishing licence, the shipowner shall pay the outstanding balance within 45 days of the approval of the statement by Mauritania. Where the final statement is less than the advance payment fee, the remaining amount may not be reclaimed by the shipowner. EN L 361/52 Official Journal of the European Union 31.12.2012 ",

Any pelagic freezer trawler with the capacity to tranship, as attested by the certificate of conformity, is under the obligation to tranship at buoy 10 within the Autonomous Port of Nouadhibou, with the exception of the last trip. 2.2. European Union vessels transhipping at the Autonomous Port of Nouadhibou shall be exempt from all taxes or charges having an equivalent effect other than port fees and charges which apply on the same terms to Mauritanian vessels. 2.3. The last trip (the trip preceding the vessel\u2019s departure from Mauritanian fishing zones for a period lasting not less than three months) shall not be subject to the transhipment obligation. 2.4. Mauritania reserves the right to refuse transhipment if the carrier vessel has carried out illegal, undeclared or unregulated fishing inside or outside Mauritanian fishing zones. CHAPTER VI MONITORING 1. Entering and leaving the Mauritanian fishing zone 1.1. Except for tuna vessels, surface longliners and pelagic fishing vessels (for which the deadlines shall be as laid down in Chapter XI of this Annex), European Union vessels operating under this Agreement must report: (a) entry: notice must be given at least 36 hours beforehand and contain the following particulars: \u2014 the position of the vessel at the time of notification, \u2014 the day, date and approximate time of entering Mauritanian fishing zones, \u2014 the amount and species of catch held on board at that time, where vessels have previously stated that they hold a fishing licence for a neighbouring fishing zone; in this case, the surveillance authority shall have access to the fishing log concerning that zone and any checks may not last longer than the period laid down in point 4 of this Chapter; (b) exit: notice must be given at least 48 hours beforehand and contain the following particulars: \u2014 the position of the vessel at the time of notification, \u2014 the day, date and time of leaving Mauritanian fishing zones, \u2014 the amount and species of catch held on board at the time of notification. 1.2.

On receipt of messages notifying exit from the fishing zone, the Mauritanian authorities reserve the right to decide whether to carry out a check prior to the departure of vessels, on the basis of sampling within Nouadhibou or Nouakchott port. Those monitoring operations should not last for more than six hours for pelagics (categories 7 and 8) or more than three hours for other categories. 1.5. Failure to comply with the provisions of the preceding points shall result in the following sanctions: (a) the first time: \u2014 the vessel shall be diverted, if possible, \u2014 the catch on board shall be landed and confiscated on behalf of the Public Treasury, \u2014 the vessel shall pay the minimum fine provided for under Mauritanian legislation; (b) the second time: \u2014 the vessel shall be diverted, if possible, \u2014 the catch on board shall be landed and confiscated on behalf of the Public Treasury, \u2014 the vessel shall pay the maximum fine provided for under Mauritanian legislation, \u2014 the licence shall be revoked for the remainder of its period of validity; (c) the third time: \u2014 the vessel shall be diverted, if possible, \u2014 the catch on board shall be landed and confiscated on behalf of the Public Treasury, \u2014 the licence shall be definitively revoked, \u2014 the master and the vessel shall be prohibited from fishing in Mauritania. 1.6. Should the offending vessel escape, the Ministry shall inform the Commission and the flag Member State so that the penalties laid down in point 1.5 above may be applied. 2. Inspection at sea Inspection at sea in the Mauritanian zone of European Union vessels holding a licence shall be carried out by vessels and inspectors of Mauritania who are clearly identifiable as being assigned to carry out fishing checks. Before boarding, the Mauritanian inspectors shall inform the European Union vessel of their decision to carry out an inspection. The inspection shall be carried out by a maximum of two inspectors, who must provide proof of their identity and official position as an inspector before carrying out the inspection. The Mauritanian inspectors shall only stay on board the European Union vessel for the time necessary to carry out tasks linked to the inspection. They shall carry out the inspection in a way which minimises the impact on the vessel, its fishing activity and cargo. The inspection should not last longer than three hours for pelagic vessels and one-and-a-half hours for the other categories. During inspections at sea, transhipments and landings, the master of a European Union vessel shall facilitate boarding by and the work of the Mauritanian inspectors, in particular by making any manoeuvres deemed necessary by the inspectors. EN L 361/56 Official Journal of the European Union 31.12.2012 ",
        "At the end of each inspection, the Mauritanian inspectors shall draw up an inspection report. The master of the European Union vessel has the right to include his comments in the inspection report. The inspection report shall be signed by the inspector drawing up the report and the master of the European Union vessel. The Mauritanian inspectors shall issue a copy of the inspection report to the master of the European Union vessel before leaving the vessel. Mauritania shall send a copy of the inspection report to the European Union within a period of four days after the inspection. 3. Inspection in port Inspection in port of European Union vessels landing or transhipping catches from Mauritanian fishing zones shall be carried out by Mauritanian inspectors who are clearly identifiable as being assigned to carry out fishing checks. The inspection shall be carried out by a maximum of two inspectors, who must provide proof of their identity and official position as an inspector before carrying out the inspection. The Mauritanian inspectors shall only stay on board the European Union vessel for the time necessary to carry out the tasks related to the inspection and shall conduct the inspection in such a way as to minimise the impact on the vessel, the landing or transhipment operation and the cargo. The inspection must not last longer than the landing or transhipment operation. At the end of each inspection, the Mauritanian inspector shall draw up an inspection report. The master of the European Union vessel has the right to include his comments in the inspection report. The inspection report shall be signed by the inspector drawing up the report and the master of the European Union vessel. The Mauritanian inspector shall provide a copy of the inspection report to the master of the European Union vessel at the end of the inspection. Mauritania shall send a copy of the inspection report to the European Union within a period of 24 hours days after the inspection. 4. Mutual observation system for shore-based controls The parties shall set up a mutual observation system for shore-based controls. To this end, they shall designate representatives who shall attend monitoring operations and inspections carried out by the respective national inspection authorities and may make observations on the implementation of this Protocol. These representatives must possess: \u2014 a professional qualification, \u2014 appropriate experience in the fisheries field, and \u2014 thorough knowledge of the provisions of the Agreement and of this Protocol. Inspections shall be carried out by the national inspection authorities and the representatives in attendance may not, on their own initiative, exercise the powers of inspection conferred on national officials. When the representatives accompany national inspection officials, they shall have access to the vessels, premises and documents subject to inspection by those officials, in order to collect data (not containing named references) necessary for the accomplishment of their task. The representatives shall accompany the national inspection authorities on their visits to the ports, on board ships in dock, to public auction houses, fish wholesalers\u2019 shops, cold stores and other premises for landing and stocking fish before it is placed on the market. The representatives shall draw up and submit a report every four months detailing the inspections attended. This report shall be addressed to the competent authorities. A copy shall be supplied by those authorities to the other contracting party. The parties hereby decide to carry out at least two inspections each year, alternately in Mauritania and in Europe. 4.1. Confidentiality The representative on joint monitoring operations shall respect the plant and equipment on board the vessel, and any other installations, and also the confidentiality of all documents to which access is provided. The parties agree to maintain the highest standards of confidentiality during such operations. The representative shall disclose information on the results of such operations solely to the competent authorities. EN 31.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 361/57 ",
        "4.2. Location This programme shall be implemented in European Union ports of landing and in Mauritanian ports. 4.3. Funding Each party shall bear the costs of its representative on monitoring operations, including travel and lodging costs. CHAPTER VII SATELLITE MONITORING SYSTEM (VMS) The satellite monitoring of European Union vessels shall be ensured by dual transmission based on a triangular system introduced on an experimental basis for the entire period covered by this Protocol, as follows: (1) EU vessel \u2013 flag State FMC \u2013 Mauritanian FMC (2) EU vessel \u2013 Mauritanian FMC \u2013 Flag State FMC 1. Modalities of transmissions Each position message must contain the following information: (a) vessel identification; (b) the most recent geographical position of the vessel (longitude, latitude), with a margin of error of less than 500 metres, and with a confidence interval of 99 %; (c) the date and time the position is recorded; (d) the speed and the course of the vessel. The FMC of the flag State and the FMC of Mauritania shall ensure the automatic processing and, if necessary, the electronic transmission of the position messages. The position messages shall be recorded in a secure manner and kept for a period of three years. 2. Transmission by the vessel in the event of breakdown of the VMS system The master shall ensure at all times that the VMS system of his vessel is fully operational and that the position messages are correctly transmitted to the FMC of the flag State. Where the continuous satellite monitoring equipment installed on board a fishing vessel develops a technical fault or breaks down, the master of the vessel shall transmit the information specified in point 5 by fax to the Control Centre of the flag State and the Mauritanian FMC in good time. In those circumstances, a global position report shall be sent every four hours. This global position report shall include the position reports as recorded by the master of the vessel on an hourly basis in accordance with the requirements laid down in point 5. The Control Centre of the flag State shall send these messages immediately to the Mauritanian FMC. The faulty equipment shall be repaired or replaced within a period of not more than five days. Where this deadline is not met, the vessel in question must leave the Mauritanian fishing zones or return to a Mauritanian port. Where there is a serious technical problem requiring an additional period, an exception may be granted at the request of the master for a maximum of 15 days. In that situation, the requirements laid down in point 7 shall continue to apply to all vessels, with the exception of tuna vessels, which shall return to port in order to take on board a Mauritanian scientific observer. 3. Secure communication of position messages between the FMC of the flag State and Mauritania The FMC of the flag State shall automatically send the position messages of the vessels concerned to the FMC of Mauritania, and vice versa. The FMC of the flag State and the FMC of Mauritania shall exchange their contact e-mail addresses and inform each other immediately of any change to these addresses. The transmission of position messages between the FMCs of the flag State and Mauritania shall be carried out electronically using a secure communication system. The FMC of Mauritania shall without delay inform the FMC of the flag State and the European Union of any interruption in receiving consecutive position messages from a vessel holding a fishing authorisation, where the vessel concerned has not notified its departure from Mauritanian fishing zones. EN L 361/58 Official Journal of the European Union 31.12.2012 ",
        "4. Malfunction of the communication system Mauritania shall ensure the compatibility of its electronic equipment with that of the FMC of the flag State and inform the European Union without delay of any malfunction as regards the communication and receiving of position messages with a view to finding a technical solution as soon as possible. The Joint Committee shall deal with any dispute arising. The master shall be considered to be responsible for any proven manipulation of a vessel\u2019s VMS system aimed at disturbing its operation or falsifying its position messages. Any infringement shall be subject to the penalties provided for by the Protocol. CHAPTER VIII INFRINGEMENTS 1. Inspection report and statement of infringement The inspection report, which shall specify the circumstances and reasons leading to the infringement, must be signed by the master of the vessel, who may note any reservations therein and a copy of which shall be given to him by the surveillance authority. This signature shall not prejudice the master\u2019s rights or any defence which he may invoke in response to the alleged infringement. The statement of infringement shall be drawn up faithfully by the surveillance authority on the basis of any infringements found and entered into the inspection report drawn up following checks on the vessel. The conformity of the vessel\u2019s characteristics ascertained during the technical inspection (chapter II) shall be taken into account during such checks. 2. Notification of the infringement In the event of infringement, the surveillance authority shall serve by letter on the vessel\u2019s agent the statement relating to the infringement, together with the inspection report. The surveillance authority shall inform the European Union thereof without delay. In the event of an infringement which cannot be brought to an end at sea, the master, at the request of the surveillance authority, shall take the vessel to the port of Nouadhibou. In the event of an infringement acknowledged by the master which can be brought to an end at sea, the vessel shall continue fishing. In both cases, the vessel shall continue fishing once the infringement is brought to an end. 3. Settlement of infringements In accordance with this Protocol, infringements may be settled either out of court or by legal proceedings. Before taking any measure against the vessel, the master, the crew or the cargo, with the exception of measures aimed at protecting evidence, Mauritania shall organise, at the request of the European Union if necessary, within three working days of notification of the detention of the vessel, an information meeting to clarify the facts which have led to the vessel being detained and to explain what further action may be taken. A representative of the flag State and a representative of the owner of the vessel must be allowed to attend this information meeting. The Settlement Committee shall then be convened by the surveillance authority. All information concerning out-of- court settlements or legal proceedings relating to infringements committed by European Union vessels shall be sent to the European Union without delay. If necessary and by derogation granted by the Chairman of the Settlement Committee, the shipowner may be represented in the Settlement Committee by two persons. Any fine must be paid by transfer no later than 30 days after the settlement. Where a vessel wishes to leave the Mauritanian fishing zones, it may only do so once the payment has become effective. A Public Treasury receipt or, failing this, a SWIFT bank transfer certified by the Central Bank of Mauritania on non-working days, shall serve as proof of payment of the fine allowing the vessel to be released. If the settlement procedure has not reached a successful conclusion, the Ministry shall refer the matter to the public prosecutor of Mauritania without delay. Under the legislation in force, a bank security shall be lodged by the shipowner to cover any fines. The vessel shall be released 72 hours from the time when the security is lodged. The bank security shall be irrevocable until the legal proceedings have been concluded. It shall be released by the Ministry once legal proceedings end without a conviction. Similarly, in the event of a conviction leading to a fine, this fine shall be paid in accordance with the legislation in force, which lays down that the bank security will be released if payment is made within 30 days of the judgment. EN 31.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 361/59 ",
        "The vessel shall be released and its crew authorised to leave the port when: \u2014 the obligations arising under the amicable settlement have been fulfilled, or \u2014 the bank security referred to in paragraph 5 above has been lodged and accepted by the Ministry, pending completion of the legal proceedings. CHAPTER IX SIGNING-ON OF MAURITANIAN SEAMEN 1. Apart from tuna seiners which must sign on one (1) Mauritanian seaman per vessel and pole-and-line tuna vessels which must sign on three (3) Mauritanian seamen per vessel, each European Union vessel shall sign on 60 % of Mauritanian seamen for the duration of its presence in Mauritanian fishing zones, freely selected from a list established by the Ministry; this calculation shall not include officers. However, where Mauritanian trainee officers are signed on, the number of such officers shall be deducted from that of Mauritanian seamen. 2. The shipowner or his agent shall inform the Ministry of the names of the Mauritanian seamen signed on the vessel concerned, mentioning their position in the crew. 3. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work shall apply as of right to seamen signed on by European Union vessels. This concerns in particular the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 4. Mauritanian seamen\u2019s employment contracts, a copy of which shall be given to the signatories, shall be drawn up between the shipowners\u2019 agent(s) and the seamen and/or their trade unions or representatives in consultation with the competent Mauritanian authority. The contracts shall guarantee the seamen the social security cover applicable to them, including life assurance and sickness and accident insurance. 5. The shipowner or his agent shall send, within two months of the issue of the licence, a copy of that contract duly signed by the competent authorities of the Member State concerned direct to the Ministry. 6. The salary of Mauritanian seamen shall be paid by the shipowners. It shall be set before the issuance of licences and by mutual agreement between the shipowners or their representatives and the Mauritanian seamen concerned or their representatives. However, the salary conditions applicable to Mauritanian seamen cannot be inferior to those applicable to Mauritanian crew and must respect, or exceed, the ILO standards. 7. If one or more seamen employed on board do not turn up at the vessel\u2019s planned departure time, the vessel may commence the planned trip after having informed the competent authorities of the port of embarkation of the insufficient number of required seamen and after having updated its crew. The competent authorities shall inform the surveillance authority. 8. The shipowner shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the number of seamen required by this Agreement are signed on by the vessel, by the next trip at the latest. 9. Where no Mauritanian seamen are taken on board for reasons other than that specified in the previous point, owners of European Union vessels shall be obliged to pay as soon as possible a flat-rate amount of EUR 20 per day of fishing in the Mauritanian fishing zone per seaman, within a maximum of three months. 10. Payment for failure to sign on seamen shall be based on the actual number of fishing days and not on the period of the licence. 11. This sum shall be used for training Mauritanian fishermen and shall be paid into the account specified in Chapter I, General Provisions, of this Annex. 12. Twice a year the European Union shall send the Ministry a list of Mauritanian seamen on board European Union vessels on 1 January and 1 July of each year, showing their registration in the seamen\u2019s register and the vessels on which they were signed on. 13. Without prejudice to point 7 above, recurring failure by shipowners to sign on the requisite number of Mauritanian seamen shall result in automatic suspension of the vessels\u2019 fishing licence until this obligation has been met. EN L 361/60 Official Journal of the European Union 31.12.2012 ",
        "CHAPTER X SCIENTIFIC OBSERVERS A system for scientific observation on board European Union vessels is hereby established. 1. For each fishing category, the parties shall designate at least two vessels per year which shall take on board a Mauritanian scientific observer, with the exception of tuna seiners, which shall board observers at the request of the Ministry. In all cases, there shall be only one scientific observer at a time per vessel. The period a scientific observer shall spend on board a vessel shall be the length of a trip. However, at the express request of one of the parties, this embarkation may be spread over several trips depending on the average duration of the trips planned for a particular vessel. 2. The Ministry shall inform the European Union of the names of designated scientific observers, having the requisite documents, at least seven working days before the scheduled date of their embarkation. 3. All costs arising out of the activities of scientific observers, including their salary, emoluments and allowances, shall be borne by the Ministry. 4. The Ministry shall make all necessary arrangements for the embarkation and landing of the scientific observer. Scientific observers shall enjoy the same treatment on board as the vessel\u2019s officers. Scientific observers shall be offered every facility needed to carry out their duties. The master shall give them access to the means of communication needed for the discharge of their duties, to documents directly concerned with the vessel\u2019s fishing activities, i.e. the fishing log, the supplementary fishing log and the navigation log, and to those parts of the vessel necessary to facilitate the exercise of their tasks as observer. 5. Scientific observers must report to the master of the designated vessel the day before the selected date of embar\u00ad kation. Should the scientific observer not appear, the master of the vessel shall inform the Ministry and the European Union. In this case, the vessel shall be authorised to leave the port. However, the Ministry may subsequently, without delay and at its own expense, arrange the boarding of a new scientific observer, without disrupting fishing by the vessel. 6. Scientific observers must have: \u2014 a professional qualification, \u2014 adequate fisheries experience, and thorough knowledge of the provisions of this Protocol. 7. Scientific observers shall ensure that European Union vessels operating in Mauritanian fishing zone comply with the terms of this Protocol. They shall compile a report on this subject. In particular, they shall: \u2014 observe the fishing activities of the vessels; \u2014 check the position of vessels engaged in fishing operations; \u2014 perform biological sampling in the context of scientific programmes; \u2014 record particulars of the fishing gear and the mesh sizes of the nets used. 8. Observation shall be confined to fishing activities and related activities governed by this Protocol. 9. The scientific observer shall: \u2014 take all appropriate steps to ensure that the conditions of their boarding and presence on the vessel neither interrupt nor hamper fishing operations, \u2014 use the instruments and procedures approved for measuring the mesh size of nets used under this Protocol; and \u2014 respect the material and equipment on board and the confidentiality of all documents belonging to the vessel. EN 31.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 361/61 ",
        "10. At the end of the observation period and before leaving the vessel, the scientific observer shall draw up a report in accordance with the model in Appendix 9 to this Annex. They shall sign it in the presence of the skipper, who may add or cause to be added to it any observations considered relevant, followed by the skipper\u2019s signature. A copy of the report shall be handed to the master of the vessel when the observer is put ashore as well as to the Ministry and the European Union. CHAPTER XI VESSELS TARGETING HIGHLY MIGRATORY SPECIES 1. Licences for tuna seiners, pole-and-line tuna vessels and surface longliners shall be issued for periods which coincide with calendar years except for the first and last year of this Protocol. On presentation of the proof of payment of the advance, the Ministry shall draw up the licence and enter the vessel concerned on the list of vessels authorised to fish which shall be sent to the surveillance authority and to the European Union. 2. Before receiving its licence, each vessel operating under the Agreement for the first time must be presented for the inspections required by the legislation in force. Such inspections may be carried out in a foreign port to be agreed. All expenses linked to such inspection shall be borne by the shipowner. 3. Vessels holding fishing licences for neighbouring countries may indicate in their licence applications the country and species concerned and the period of validity of such licences to facilitate their multiple entries into and exits from the fishing zone. 4. Licences shall be issued following payment, by transfer to the account indicated in Chapter I, of a lump sum corresponding to the advance specified in the Fishing datasheets included in the Protocol. This lump sum shall be established pro rata temporis to the validity of the licence for the first and last year of the Protocol. The parafiscal charge shall be paid in proportion to the time spent in the Mauritanian fishery zone. Monthly payments are deemed to cover periods of 30 days\u2019 actual fishing. This provision preserves the indivisible nature of the charge and, consequently, the monthly payment shall be due in respect of any period begun. A vessel which has fished for 1 to 30 days over the year shall pay the charge in respect of one month. The second monthly payment of this charge shall be due after the first period of 30 days and so on. Additional monthly payments shall be made no later than 10 days after the first day of each additional period. 5. Vessels shall keep a log-book, in accordance with the model in Appendix 3 to this Annex, for each fishing period spent in Mauritanian waters. It shall be filled in even when no catches are made. 6. Subject to any checks Mauritania may wish to carry out, the European Union shall submit to the Ministry, by 15 June each year, a statement of fees due for the previous fishing year, on the basis of the catch declarations made by each shipowner and confirmed by the scientific institutes responsible for verifying catch data in the Member States, such as the IRD (Institut de recherche pour le d\u00e9veloppement), IEO (Instituto Espa\u00f1ol de Oceanograf\u00eda), INIAP (Instituto Nacional de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Agr\u00e1ria e das Pescas) and IMROP (Institut mauritanien de recherches oc\u00e9anographiques et des p\u00eaches). 7. Tuna vessels and surface longliners shall comply with all the recommendations adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). 8. For the last year of application of the Protocol, the statement of the fees due for the previous fishing year shall be notified within four months of expiry of the Protocol. 9. The final statement shall be sent to the shipowners concerned, who shall have 30 days from the notification and the approval of the amounts by the Ministry, within which to discharge their financial obligations to the competent national authorities. Payment in euro, payable to the Public Treasury, shall be made into the account mentioned in Chapter I no later than one-and-a-half months after that notification. However, if the amount of the final statement is lower than the advance referred to in point 3 above, the resulting balance shall not be reimbursable to the shipowner. 10. Vessels shall be obliged, within the three hours before entering or leaving the zone, to communicate their position and the volume of the catch on board direct to the Mauritanian authorities by electronic means or, failing that, by radio. The addresses and radio frequency shall be notified by the surveillance authority. EN L 361/62 Official Journal of the European Union 31.12.2012 ",

(2) Under Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2012 implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection ( 2 ), certain European patents granted by the European Patent Office (here\u00ad inafter \u2018EPO\u2019) under the rules and procedures of the Convention on the Grant of European Patents of 5 October 1973, as revised on 17 December 1991 and on 29 November 2000 (hereinafter \u2018EPC\u2019) should, at the request of the patent proprietor, benefit from unitary effect in the participating Member States. (3) Translation arrangements for European patents benefiting from unitary effect in the participating Member States (hereinafter \u2018European patent with unitary effect\u2019) should be established by means of a separate Regulation, in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 118 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). (4) In accordance with Decision 2011/167/EU the trans\u00ad lation arrangements for European patents with unitary effect should be simple and cost-effective. They should correspond to those provided for in the proposal for a Council Regulation on the translation arrangements for the European Union patent, presented by the Commission on 30 June 2010, combined with the elements of compromise proposed by the Presidency in November 2010 that had wide support in the Council. (5) Such translation arrangements should ensure legal certainty and stimulate innovation and should, in particular, benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). They should make access to the European patent with unitary effect and to the patent system as a whole easier, less costly and legally secure. (6) Since the EPO is responsible for the grant of European patents, the translation arrangements for the European patent with unitary effect should be built on the current procedure in the EPO. Those arrangements should aim to achieve the necessary balance between the interests of economic operators and the public interest, in terms of the cost of proceedings and the availability of technical information. (7) Without prejudice to the transitional arrangements, where the specification of a European patent with unitary effect has been published in accordance with Article 14(6) of the EPC, no further translations should be required. Article 14(6) of the EPC provides that the specification of a European patent is published in the language of the proceedings before the EPO and includes a translation of the claims into the other two official languages of the EPO. EN 31.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 361/89 ( 1 ) OJ L 76, 22.3.2011, p. 53. ( 2 ) See page 1 of this Official Journal. ",
        "(8) In the event of a dispute concerning a European patent with unitary effect, it is a legitimate requirement that the patent proprietor at the request of the alleged infringer should provide a full translation of the patent into an official language of either the participating Member State in which the alleged infringement took place or the Member State in which the alleged infringer is domiciled. The patent proprietor should also be required to provide, at the request of a court competent in the participating Member States for disputes concerning the European patent with unitary effect, a full translation of the patent into the language used in the proceedings of that court. Such translations should not be carried out by automated means and should be provided at the expense of the patent proprietor. (9) In the event of a dispute concerning a claim for damages, the court hearing the dispute should take into consideration the fact that, before having been provided with a translation in his own language, the alleged infringer may have acted in good faith and may have not known or had reasonable grounds to know that he was infringing the patent. The competent court should assess the circumstances of the individual case and, inter alia, should take into account whether the alleged infringer is a SME operating only at local level, the language of the proceedings before the EPO and, during the transitional period, the translation submitted together with the request for unitary effect. (10) In order to facilitate access to European patents with unitary effect, in particular for SMEs, applicants should be able to file their patent applications at the EPO in any official language of the Union. As a complementary measure, certain applicants obtaining European patents with unitary effect, having filed a European patent appli\u00ad cation in one of the official languages of the Union, which is not an official language of the EPO, and having their residence or principal place of business within a Member State, should receive additional reimbursements of the costs of translating from the language of the patent application into the language of the proceedings of the EPO, beyond what is currently in place at the EPO. Such reimbursements should be admin\u00ad istered by the EPO in accordance with Article 9 of Regu\u00ad lation (EU) No 1257/2012. (11) In order to promote the availability of patent information and the dissemination of technological knowledge, machine translations of patent applications and specifi\u00ad cations into all official languages of the Union should be available as soon as possible. Machine translations are being developed by the EPO and are a very important tool in seeking to improve access to patent information and to widely disseminate technological knowledge. The timely availability of high quality machine translations of European patent applications and specifications into all official languages of the Union would benefit all users of the European patent system. Machine translations are a key feature of European Union policy. Such machine translations should serve for information purposes only and should not have any legal effect. (12) During the transitional period, before a system of high quality machine translations into all official languages of the Union becomes available, a request for unitary effect as referred to in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 should be accompanied by a full translation of the specification of the patent into English where the language of the proceedings before the EPO is French or German, or into any official language of the Member States that is an official language of the Union where the language of the proceedings before the EPO is English. Those arrangements would ensure that during a transitional period all European patents with unitary effect are made available in English which is the language customarily used in the field of international technological research and publications. Furthermore, such arrangements would ensure that with respect to European patents with unitary effect, translations would be published in other official languages of the partici\u00ad pating Member States. Such translations should not be carried out by automated means and their high quality should contribute to the training of translation engines by the EPO. They would also enhance the dissemination of patent information. (13) The transitional period should terminate as soon as high quality machine translations into all official languages of the Union are available, subject to a regular and objective evaluation of the quality by an independent expert committee established by the participating Member States in the framework of the European Patent Organi\u00ad sation and composed of the representatives of the EPO and the users of the European patent system. Given the state of technological development, the maximum period for the development of high quality machine translations cannot be considered to exceed 12 years. Consequently, the transitional period should lapse 12 years from the date of application of this Regulation, unless it has been decided to terminate that period earlier. (14) Since the substantive provisions applicable to a European patent with unitary effect are governed by Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 and are completed by the trans\u00ad lation arrangements provided for in this Regulation, this Regulation should apply from the same date as Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012. (15) This Regulation is without prejudice to the rules governing the languages of the Institutions of the Union established in accordance with Article 342 of the TFEU and to Council Regulation No 1 of 15 April 1958 determining the languages to be used by the European Economic Community ( 1 ). This Regulation is based on the linguistic regime of the EPO and should EN L 361/90 Official Journal of the European Union 31.12.2012 ( 1 ) OJ 17, 6.10.1958, p. 385/58. ",
        "not be considered as creating a specific linguistic regime for the Union, or as creating a precedent for a limited language regime in any future legal instrument of the Union. (16) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the creation of a uniform and simple translation regime for European patents with unitary effect, cannot be suffi\u00ad ciently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reasons of the scale and effects of this Regulation, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, where appropriate by means of enhanced cooperation, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Subject matter This Regulation implements enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection authorised by Decision No 2011/167/EU with regard to the applicable trans\u00ad lation arrangements. Article 2 Definitions For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply: (a) \u2018European patent with unitary effect\u2019 means a European patent which benefits from unitary effect in the participating Member States by virtue of Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012; (b) \u2018Language of the proceedings\u2019 means the language used in the proceedings before the EPO as defined in Article 14(3) of the Convention on the Grant of European Patents of 5 October 1973, as revised on 17 December 1991 and on 29 November 2000 (hereinafter \u2018EPC\u2019). Article 3 Translation arrangements for the European patent with unitary effect 1.

A request for unitary effect as referred to in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 shall be submitted in the language of the proceedings. Article 4 Translation in the event of a dispute 1. In the event of a dispute relating to an alleged infringement of a European patent with unitary effect, the patent proprietor shall provide at the request and the choice of an alleged infringer, a full translation of the European patent with unitary effect into an official language of either the partici\u00ad pating Member State in which the alleged infringement took place or the Member State in which the alleged infringer is domiciled. 2.
