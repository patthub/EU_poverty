        "- 2 - EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL The accession of Croatia to the EU is scheduled for 1 July 2013. Although the Act of Accession 1 has not yet been ratified by all Member States, the Commission has recently updated its Multi-Annual Financial Framework proposals 2 in view of Croatia's accession. A similar adjustment exercise should be prepared for the CAP reform proposals to ensure that once they are adopted, Croatia will be fully covered as a new Member State. The adoption of Regulation (EU) No 671/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 amending Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013 3 provides for voluntary adjustment for the United Kingdom whereby funds for direct payments for calendar year 2013 would be made available for the next rural development programming period. As a consequence a relevant provision to allow transfer of the funds to the EAFRD should be made in the CAP reform proposal for rural development. 2. RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS There was no need for consultation of interested parties or an impact assessment since these adjustments follow, in relation to Croatia, from the Act of Accession and, in relation to the voluntary adjustment for the United Kingdom, from the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 671/2012. 3. LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL The adjustment will take the form of an amendment to the proposal COM(2011) 627 final/3 for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) in order to: - introduce a temporary additional measure on financing complementary national direct payments, - provide for specific conditions applicable to Croatia in relation to LEADER (minimum EAFRD contribution reserved for LEADER of 2.5% instead 5%) and investments for the implementation of Council Directive 91/676/EEC 4 for a maximum period of four years (provision of a support rate of 75%), - introduction of an empowerment to the Commission to adopt transitional rules for the transition of Croatia from support under IPARD to support under the new Rural Development regime, also covering the ex-post evaluation. In relation to voluntary adjustment for the UK the adjustment consists in introducing a reference to the amounts to be transferred in application of the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. 5 1 OJ L 112 of 24 April 2012. 2 COM(2012)388 of 6 July 2012. 3 OJ L 204, 31.7.2012, p.11. 4 OJ L 375, 31.12.1991, p. 1. 5 OJ L 52, 31.1.2009, p.1.

Expected result(s) and impact It is not possible to set quantitative targets for impact indicators at this stage. Although the policy can steer in a certain direction, the broad economic, environmental and social outcomes measured by such indicators would ultimately also depend on the impact from a range of external factors, which recent experience indicates have become significant and unpredictable. Further analysis is on-going, to be ready for the period post-2013. As regards the direct payments, Member States will have the possibility to decide, to a limited degree, on the implementation of certain components of the direct payment schemes. For rural development, the expected results and impact will depend on the rural development programmes that Member States will submit to the Commission. Member States will be asked to set targets in their programmes. 1.4.4. Indicators of results and impact The proposals provide for the establishment of a common monitoring and evaluation framework with a view to measuring the performance of the Common Agricultural Policy. That framework shall include all instruments related to the monitoring and evaluation of CAP measures and in particular of the direct payments, market measures, rural development measures and of the application of cross compliance. The impact of these CAP measures shall be measured in relation to the following objectives: (a) viable food production, with a focus on agricultural income, agricultural productivity and price stability; (b) sustainable management of natural resources and climate action, with a focus on greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity, soil and water; (c) balanced territorial development, with a focus on rural employment, growth and poverty in rural areas. By means of implementing acts, the Commission shall define the set of indicators specific to these objectives and areas. Moreover, as regards rural development, a reinforced common monitoring and evaluation system is proposed. That system aims (a) to demonstrate the progress and achievements of rural development policy and assess the impact, effectiveness, efficiency and relevance of rural development policy interventions, (b) to contribute to better targeted support for rural development, and (c) to support a common learning process related to monitoring and evaluation. The Commission will establish, by means of implementing act, a list of common indicators linked to the policy priorities. ",
        "- 10 - 1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative 1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term In order to meet the multi-annual strategic objectives of the CAP which are a direct translation of the Europe 2020 strategy for European rural areas and to fulfil the relevant requirements of the Treaty, the proposals, as amended to take account of the Accession of Croatia, aim to lay down the legislative framework for the Common Agricultural Policy for the period after 2013. 1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement The future CAP will not only be a policy that caters for a small, albeit essential, part of the EU economy, but also a policy of strategic importance for food security, the environment and territorial balance. Thus, the CAP, as a truly common policy, makes the most efficient use of limited budgetary resources in maintaining a sustainable agriculture throughout the EU, addressing important cross-border issues such as climate change and reinforcing solidarity among Member States. As mentioned in the Commission communication \"A Budget for Europe 2020\" 8 , the CAP is a genuinely European policy. Instead of operating 28 separate agricultural policies and budgets, Member States pool resources to operate a single European policy with a single European budget. This naturally means that the CAP accounts for a significant proportion of the EU budget. However, this approach is both more efficient and economical than an uncoordinated national approach. 1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past On the basis of the evaluation of the current policy framework, an extensive consultation with stakeholders as well as an analysis of future challenges and needs, a comprehensive impact assessment has been carried out. More details can be found in the impact assessment and the explanatory memorandum that are accompanying the legal proposals. 1.5.4. Coherence and possible synergy with other relevant instruments The legislative proposals concerned by this financial statement should be seen in the broader context of the proposal for a single framework regulation with common rules for the common strategic framework funds (EAFRD, ERDF, ESF, Cohesion Fund and EMFF). That framework regulation will make an important contribution to reducing administrative burden, to spending EU funds in an effective way, and to put simplification into practice. This also underpins the new concepts of the common strategic framework for all these funds and the upcoming Partnership Contracts which will also cover these funds. The common strategic framework, which will be established, will translate the objectives and priorities of the Europe 2020 Strategy into priorities for the EAFRD together with the ERDF, ESF, Cohesion Fund and EMFF, which will ensure an integrated use of the funds to deliver common objectives. 8 COM(2011)500 final of 29 June 2011. ",
        "- 11 - The common strategic framework will also set out coordination mechanisms with other relevant Union policies and instruments. Moreover, as regards the CAP, significant synergies and simplification effects will be obtained by harmonising and aligning the management and control rules for the first (EAGF) and second (EAFRD) pillar of the CAP. The strong link between the EAGF and the EAFRD should be maintained and the structures already in place in the Member States be sustained. 1.6.

",
        "- 12 - Comments No substantive change compared to the present situation, i.e. the bulk of expenditure concerned by the legislative proposals on the CAP reform will be managed by shared management with the Member States. However, a very minor part will continue to fall under centralised direct management by the Commission. 2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES 2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules In terms of monitoring and evaluation of the CAP, the Commission will present a report to the European Parliament and the Council every 4 years, with the first report to be presented not later than end 2017. This is complemented by specific provisions in all areas of the CAP, with various comprehensive reporting and notifications requirements to be specified in the implementing rules. As regards rural development, rules are also provided for monitoring at programme level, which will be aligned with the other funds, and which will be coupled with ex ante, on-going and ex post evaluations. 2.2. Management and control system 2.2.1. Risk(s) identified There are more than seven million beneficiaries of the CAP, receiving support under a large variety of different aid schemes, each of which having detailed and sometimes complex eligibility criteria. The reduction in the error rate in the domain of the common agricultural policy can already be considered as a trend. Thus, most recently an error rate close to 2% confirms the overall positive assessment of previous years. It is the intention to continue the efforts in order to achieve an error rate below 2%. 2.2.2. Control method(s) envisaged The legislative package, in particular the proposal for the regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy, envisages maintaining and reinforcing the current system established by Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. It provides for a compulsory administrative structure at Member State level, centred around accredited paying agencies, which are responsible for carrying out controls at final beneficiary level in accordance with the principles set out under point 2.3. Every year, the head of each paying agency is required to provide a statement of assurance which covers the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts, the proper functioning of the internal control systems and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. An independent audit body is required to provide an opinion on all these three elements. The Commission will continue to audit agricultural expenditure, using a risk-based approach in order to ensure that its audits are targeted to the areas of highest risk. Where these audits ",
        "- 13 - reveal that expenditure has been incurred in breach of Union rules, it will exclude the amounts concerned from Union financing under the conformity clearance system. As regards the cost of controls, a detailed analysis is provided in annex 8 to the impact assessment accompanying the legislative proposals. Furthermore the publication of information on the beneficiaries of the EAGF and EAFRD will reinforce the public control of the use of the money and contribute to the visibility and better understanding of the CAP. 2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities The legislative package, in particular the proposal for the regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy, envisages maintaining and reinforcing the current detailed systems for controls and penalties to be applied by the paying agencies, with common basis features and special rules tailored to the specificities of each aid regime. The systems generally provide for exhaustive administrative controls of 100% of the aid applications, cross-checks with other databases where this is considered appropriate as well as pre-payment on-the-spot checks of a minimum number of transactions, depending on the risk associated with the regime in question. If these on-the-spot checks reveal a high number of irregularities, additional checks must be carried out. In this context, the by far most important system is the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), which in financial year 2010 covered around 80% of total expenditure under the EAGF and the EAFRD. For Member States with properly functioning control systems and low error rates, the Commission will be empowered to allow for a reduction of the number of on-the-spot checks. The package further envisages that Member States shall prevent, detect and correct irregularities and fraud, impose effective, dissuasive and proportionate penalties as laid down in Union legislation or national law, and recover any irregular payments plus interests. It includes an automatic clearance mechanism for irregularity cases, which provides that if recovery has not taken place within four years of the date of the recovery request, or within eight years in the case of legal proceedings, the amounts not recovered shall be borne by the Member State concerned. This mechanism will be a strong incentive for Member States to recover irregular payments as quickly as possible. 3. ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE The amounts indicated in this financial statement are expressed in current prices and in commitments. In addition to the changes resulting from the legislative proposals as listed in the accompanying tables below, the legislative proposals imply further changes which have no financial impact. ",
        "- 14 - For any of the years in the period 2014-2020, the application of financial discipline cannot be excluded at this stage. However, this will not depend on the reform proposals as such, but on other factors, such as the execution of direct aids or future developments in the agricultural markets. As concerns direct aids, the extended net ceilings for 2014 (calendar year 2013) included in the Commission proposal regarding the application of direct payments in the transitional year 2013 (COM(2011)630) 11 are higher than the amounts allocated to direct aids indicated in the accompanying tables. The purpose of this extension is to ensure a continuation of the existing legislation in a scenario in which all the other elements would remain unchanged, without prejudice to the possible need for applying the financial discipline mechanism. The reform proposals contain provisions giving Member States a set degree of flexibility in relation to their allocation of direct aids respectively rural development. In case Member States decide to use that flexibility, this will have financial consequences within the given financial amounts, which cannot be quantified at this stage. The reform proposal for direct payments contains a provision on progressive reduction and capping of direct payments. The product of capping, to be transferred to rural development, has been estimated in order to determine the net ceilings of direct payments (Annex III of the proposal). This estimation was based on assumptions as concerns the implementation of direct payments by Member States and will therefore be revised once Member States have notified their decisions on the implementation. Moreover, for Croatia, it is not possible to estimate the product of capping at this stage due to unavailability of data. A first rough estimate, based on preliminary information, showed that the product of capping would be null for Croatia. It will be revised once data are available. This financial statement does not take into account the possible use of the crises reserve. It should be underlined that the amounts taken into account for market-related expenditure are based on no public intervention buying-in and other measures related to a crisis situation in any sectors. 3.1.

(2) The amounts relate to the proposed annual ceiling for the first pillar. However, it should also be noted that it is proposed to move negative expenditure from accounting clearance (currently under budget item 05 07 01 06) to assigned revenue (under item 67 03). For details, see estimated revenue table on the page below. (3) The 2013 figures include the amounts for veterinary and phytosanitary measures as well as market measures for the fisheries sector. (4) The amounts in the table above are in line with those in the Commission communication \"A Budget for Europe 2020\" (COM(2011)500 of 29 June 2011) and the Commission's amended proposal for the MFF 2014-2020 (COM(2012)388 of 6 July 2012). However, it remains to be decided if the MFF will reflect the transfer that is proposed for the envelope of one Member State of the cotton national restructuring programme to rural development as from 2014, implying an adjustment (4 million EUR per year) of the amounts for respectively the EAGF sub- ceiling and for pillar 2. In the tables in the sections below, the amounts have been transferred, irrespective of them being reflected in the MFF.

In the table above, the breakdown by year in current prices is only indicative . The proposal for the inter-institutional agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management (COM(2011)403 final of 29 June 2011) sets out, for the EGF, an overall maximum annual amount of 429 million EUR in 2011 prices.
