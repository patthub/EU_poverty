        "4 INTRODUCTION This report presents the results of work carried out by the OECD in response to a request by the European Commission to provide an overview of OECD experience and evidence pertaining to the thematic and general ex ante conditionalities proposed for implementation under the next (2014 to 2020) multi-annual financial framework for European regional development funds. The information presented herein focuses on existing work carried out by the OECD in the thematic areas addressed by the European Commission proposal. This entails, inter alia , concrete recommendations and/or declarations issued by the OECD Council as so called \u201csoft laws\u201d. It also summarises the policy guidance and recommendations of the OECD published in official reports in each thematic area. When applicable, supplementary evidence and information is provided following the summaries of the OECD work. The information in this report therefore does not contain an analysis of the proposed conditionalities, in terms of either their relevance or the modalities for their implementation, but rather offers a stock-taking of soft law and evidence relevant to the proposed conditionalities, based mostly on OECD experience. The report is structured as follows: The report consists of two major parts, following the distinction made by the European Commission in the proposed conditionalities. The first part addresses the thematic conditionalities, the second part the cross- cutting ex ante conditionalities proposed. Within each part the suggested conditionalities are first listed by theme, thematic objective and criteria for fulfilment, as set out in the proposed regulations. This is then followed by providing the major OECD references that relate to the proposed set of criteria as closely as possible. Where applicable, additional references to works not summarised are included at the end of each section. These include both OECD and non-OECD sources. ",
        "5 I. THEMATIC CONDITIONALITIES 1. R&D Thematic Objective: \u201cStrengthening research, technological development and innovation (R&D target) (referred to in Article 14(1) )\u201d 1.1. Research and innovation: Ex ante conditionality: \u201cThe existence of a national and/or regional innovation strategy for smart specialisation in line with the National Reform Programme, to leverage private R&I expenditure, which complies with the features of well performing national or regional research and innovation systems.\u201d Criteria for Fulfilment: - A national and/or regional innovation strategy for smart specialisation is in place that: is based on a SWOT analysis to concentrate resources on a limited set of R&I priorities; outlines measures to stimulate private RTD investment; contains a monitoring and review system. \u2013 A Member State has adopted a framework outlining available budgetary resources for R&D; \u2013 A Member State has adopted a multi-annual plan for budgeting and prioritisation of investments linked to EU priorities (ESFRI). Instruments/Guidance from the OECD The OECD (OECD, 2010 1 ) acknowledges that policies for innovation need to be prioritised first of all to achieve scale and capacities and secondly to address global challenges and fiscal constraints. Priority setting is a challenge that requires political vision and clear goals. In addition tools and a feasible methodology for identification and selection of priorities are needed. National priorities for innovation can not only be found in innovation strategies, but also in government white papers, or national innovation plans. To prioritise innovation, the OECD proposes to: - take into consideration foreign priorities for innovation that could affect national priority setting exercises as well as create regional priorities that require international co-operation; - include stakeholders (private sector, civil society, NGO\u2019s, etc.) in the prioritisation process for science and innovation. The OECD report on Regions and Innovation Policy (OECD, 2011 2 ) states that the right policy mix for fostering innovation is at the end dependent on the strategic capacity of policy makers. This capacity 1 OECD, 2010. \u201cThe OECD Innovation Strategy \u2013 Getting A Headstart for Tomorrow\u201d, OECD, Paris. http://www.oecd.org/document/15/0,3746,en_2649_34273_45154895_1_1_1_1,00.html 2 OECD, 2011. \u201cChapter 2: Road maps and smart policy mixes for regional innovation\u201d, in\u201d: OECD, 2011: Regions and Innovation Policy , OECD Reviews of Regional Innovation, OECD, Paris. http://www.oecd.org/document/2/0,3746,en_2649_37429_47721730_1_1_1_37429,00.html ",
        "6 depends on the availability of appropriate information, monitoring, evaluation and analytical tools and policy commitment to innovation at the highest policy levels. Thus, there is a need to support policy learning, leave room for policy experimentation, and to encourage full policy-making cycles that integrate analysis, co-operation with stakeholders and evaluation into the design of smart innovation policy. The OECD sees a key role of governments to foster private investment in innovation . To stimulate private RTD investment the OECD recommends in its latest Innovation Strategy: - to foster well-functioning financial markets and ease access to finance for new firms, in particular for early stages of innovation. Ease of access to finance can include: establishment of venture capital markets and securitisation of innovation-related assets (e.g. intellectual property); financial markets should provide room for healthy risk taking, long-term investment and entrepreneurship; policy makers should facilitate steps to ease new and small innovative firms\u2019 access both to debt and equity finance, which can involve risk-sharing schemes with the private sector. - governments have to ensure that their support for private R&D does not unduly distort competition and international trade. - to foster new and young firms as they exploit technological or commercial opportunities that have been neglected by more established companies. This can be achieved by creating a favourable policy environment, allowing new firms to expand and flourish. Such policies should also include ease of entry and exit to the market, creating bankruptcy regulations that facilitate the restructuring of ailing businesses, with due regard to risk management and the need to avoid moral hazard. The OECD\u2019s Governance of Innovation report (OECD, 2005 3 ) emphasises the fact that without monitoring and reporting systems innovation policy cannot be properly implemented. Precise targets and intelligent follow-up is needed. Furthermore, governments should increase their learning and evaluation practices that allow them to be part of the policy-making process. This includes evaluation of broader reforms, as knowledge about their impact on innovation is useful for feedback and policy formulation. In the latest publication on Measuring Innovation (OECD, 2010 4 ) the OECD underlines the importance of monitoring national innovation policies and outcomes, and proposes a range of instruments/indicators to implement a monitoring system. Some of the key recommendations for implementing monitoring systems are: - the development of innovation metrics that can be linked to aggregate measures of economic performance - the investment in a high-quality and comprehensive statistical infrastructure to analyse innovation at the firm-level - the promotion of metrics of innovation in the public sector and the public policy evaluation Further references OECD, 2005a. \u201cInnovation in the business sector\u201d, Economics Department Working Papers No. 459, OECD, Paris. 3 OECD, 2005. \u201cGovernance of Innovation Systems: Volume 1: Synthesis Report\u201d, OECD, Paris. http://www.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/display.asp?K=5LGTWM240KR3&LANG=FR 4 OECD, 2010. \u201cMeasuring Innovation: A New Perspective\u201d, OECD, Paris. http://www.oecd.org/document/22/0,3746,en_41462537_41454856_44979734_1_1_1_1,00.html ",

Digital Growth Ex ante Conditionality: \u201cThe existence within the national and/or regional innovation strategy for smart specialisation of an explicit chapter for Digital Growth to stimulate demand for affordable, good quality and interoperable ICT-enabled private and public services and increase uptake by citizens, businesses and public administrations including cross border initiatives.\u201d Criteria for Fulfilment: A chapter for Digital Growth within the national and/or regional innovation strategy for smart specialisation is in place that contains: \u2013 budgeting and prioritisation of actions through a SWOT analysis carried out in alignment with the Scoreboard of the Digital Agenda for Europe; \u2013 an analysis of balancing support for demand and supply of ICT should have been conducted; \u2013 measurable targets for outcomes of interventions in the field of digital literacy, skills, e-inclusion, e- accessibility, and health; \u2013 assessment of needs to reinforce ICT capacity-building. 2.2. Next Generation Access Networks Infrastructure The existence of national NGA Plans which take account of regional actions in order to reach the EU high-speed Internet access targets, focusing on areas where the market fails to provide an open infrastructure at an affordable cost and to an adequate quality. Criteria for Fulfilment: A national NGA Plan is in place that contains: \u2013 a plan of infrastructure investments through demand aggregation and a mapping of infrastructure and services, regularly updated; \u2013 sustainable investment models that enhance competition and provide access to open, affordable, quality and future proof infrastructure and services; \u2013 measures to stimulate private investment.

        "9 Instruments/Guidance from the OECD Ad. 2.1 Digital Growth The information outlook report of the OECD (OECD, 2008 5 ) highlights: - better co-ordination of ICT policies and clear priority setting can help improve internal government efficiency as well as the effectiveness and coherence of policies - centralised ICT procurement could be a way to increase organisational efficiency and to reduce ICT investment costs, avoiding redundant or incompatible purchases - ICT should be prioritised along with other innovation activities, whereby the government should take leadership and coordination function between relevant stakeholders in the legislation process - the need to assess and evaluate ICT policies to more effectively measure and subsequently improve the efficiency of ICT policies and their coordination. - the need for countries to evaluate the balance between public and private ICT R&D and the appropriate mix of short and long-term incentives and support for ICT research and innovation in the context of internationalisation and location of ICT firms, their R&D activities and high skill requirements - policies should aim at addressing the digital use and access divide linked to social and economic divides as well as location factors - policies should address the need to educate and train people to decrease the divide and ensure wider benefits for all - governments\u2019 role needs to be ensuring the maximisation of the economic benefits of ICTs \u2013 encouraging investment, innovation and competition in the development of infrastructures and the delivery of services aiming at full diffusion and mainstreaming of ICTs and broadband where this has not taken place yet - a competitive business environment is necessary to stimulate productivity gains, innovation, and the development and delivery of improved products and services in flexible and efficient markets In its recommendation on Information, Computer and Communications Policy (OECD, 2008 6 ) the OECD recommends: - Openness. Maximising the availability of public sector information for use and re-use based upon presumption of openness as the default rule to facilitate access and re-use - Access and transparent conditions for re-use - Asset lists. Strengthening awareness of what public sector information is available for access and re-use 5 OECD, 2008. \u201cInformation Technology Outlook\u201d, OECD, Paris. http://www.oecd.org/document/63/0,3746,fr_33873108_33844437_46492479_1_1_1_1,00.html 6 OECD, 2008. \u201cInformation, Computer and Communications Policy \u2013 Recommendation of the Council for Enhanced Access and More Effective Use of Public Sector Information\u201d, (30 APRIL 2008 \u2013 C(2008)38), OECD, Paris. http://webnet.oecd.org/oecdacts/Instruments/ShowInstrumentView.aspx?InstrumentID=122&InstrumentPID=118&L ang=en&Book=False ",

Ensuring methodical data collection and curation practices to enhance quality and reliability including through co-operation of various government bodies involved in the creation, collection, processing, storing and distribution of public sector information - Integrity. Maximising the integrity and availability of information through the use of best practices in information management - New technologies and long-term preservation. Improving interoperable archiving, search and retrieval technologies and related research including research on improving access and availability of public sector information in multiple languages, and ensuring development of the necessary related skills - Copyright. Intellectual property rights should be respected - Pricing. When public sector information is not provided free of charge, pricing public sector information transparently and consistently within and, as far as possible, across different public sector organisations so that it facilitates access and re-use and ensures competition - Competition. Ensuring that pricing strategies take into account considerations of unfair competition in situations where both public and business users provide value added services - Redress mechanisms. Providing appropriate transparent complaints and appeals processes - Public private partnerships. Facilitating public-private partnerships where appropriate and feasible in making public sector information available, for example by finding creative ways to finance the costs of digitisation, while increasing access and re-use rights of third parties - International access and use. Seeking greater consistency in access regimes and administration to facilitate cross-border use and implementing other measures to improve cross-border interoperability, including in situations where there have been restrictions on non-public users - Best practices. Encouraging the wide sharing of best practices and exchange of information on enhanced implementation, educating users and re-users, building institutional capacity and practical measures for promoting re-use, cost and pricing models, copyright handling, monitoring performance and compliance, and their wider impacts on innovation, entrepreneurship, economic growth and social effects Ad. 2.2 NGA Infrastructure (Next Generation Access Networks) An OECD report of 2008 7 that supported the ministerial meeting leading to the Seoul Declaration (see below) addressed a number of objectives to support the future of internet development: - making internet access available to everyone and everywhere - promoting internet-based innovation, competition and user choice 7 OECD, 2008. \u201cShaping Policies for the Future of the Internet Economy\u201d, OECD, Paris. http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/1/29/40821707.pdf ",
        "11 - securing critical information infrastructures and responding to new threats - ensuring the protection of personal information, respect for intellectual property rights, and more generally a trusted Internet-based environment - promoting secure and responsible use of the internet - creating an environment that encourages infrastructure investment, higher levels of connectivity and innovative services and applications In terms of future policy actions that support the outlined objectives the report recommends: - ensuring that market structures allow for developing broadband infrastructures that deliver high-quality services at competitive prices with a broad range of user choice - addressing current and future access divides that place some users or localities at a relative disadvantage. - ensuring that policies promote innovation in new broadband networks, applications and services through support for research and development. - encouraging policy co-ordination among agencies, ministries and the private sector for the deployment of advanced broadband applications in vital sectors such as health, education, the environment and transport. - continuing monitoring of broadband developments in the context of the Recommendation of the OECD Council on Broadband Development and considering a review of the Recommendation to take account of new issues and developments - policy objectives for better integrating the Internet economy in the broader economy include: \u2022 ensuring that policies and practices favourable to the deployment and use of the Internet are systematically factored into public policy development, in all areas including trade, competition, tax policy, social policy and regulatory reform as well as those listed below. In particular, indicators and analysis are needed to: \u2022 improve our ability to identify the drivers of Internet access and applications and measure its use by citizens, businesses and institutions. \u2022 enable the evaluation of the impact of the Internet on economic performance, notably on productivity and innovation, and social well-being, particularly through improved access to education, health and government services. \u2022 enhance our understanding of differences and barriers to its use, including issues of confidence. \u2022 enable a better understanding and quantifying of various aspects of the Internet, such as its size, areas and patterns of growth, or potential vulnerabilities, through the measurement of Internet traffic flows ",

        "14 The first declaration that was issued with regard to SME policy was the Bologna Declaration 11 . It was followed by the more recent Istanbul Declaration issued in 2004 12 : REAFFIRM the need to support the development of the best set of public policies that will foster the creation and rapid growth of innovative SMEs. This requires: a) Policies and an institutional framework that contribute to a business environment that is conducive to entrepreneurship and facilitates entry, growth, transfer of ownership and smooth exit of enterprises. These should be coherent at international, national, regional and local levels and should include: \u2022 Stable macroeconomic policies and well-designed structural policies in areas that impinge on SMEs, such as competition, international trade and investment, financial markets, labour markets and education; and, as regards to developing economies, embedding private sector SME strategies in broader development strategies and poverty reduction programmes; \u2022 Enabling regulatory frameworks, which are developed taking into account the needs of SMEs and facilitating their integration into the formal sector; tax systems that entail low compliance costs; the transparent and equitable application of rules and legislation; simple and transparent licence and permit systems; efficient bankruptcy laws and procedures; understandable and coherent product standards in world markets; clearly defined property rights; fair and reasonably priced dispute settlement procedures; and light, predictable administrative procedures; \u2022 Laws and systems of governance that support the development and diffusion of new technologies in ways that enable and encourage SMEs to take full advantage of them, notably by strengthening the science- innovation interface; ensuring that intellectual property rights systems are coherent, easy to understand and used effectively; and promoting access to and use of quality information and communication infrastructure and promoting enhanced security and trust in the digital economy; b) SME assistance and development programmes which are clear in terms of their rationale, objectives and beneficiaries. These policies and programmes should be: \u2022 Based on sound research, empirical evidence, public-private dialogue and partnerships, and evaluated regularly for effectiveness and efficiency; \u2022 Cost-effective and designed to encourage activity that would otherwise not have taken place and help SMEs overcome the effects of market failures, without unduly distorting market structures or creating barriers to competition; \u2022 Designed to provide support to large groups of SMEs, including micro-enterprises, for example by helping them to: improve their management skills; obtain finance on reasonable terms; increase their capacity to compete for government procurement; have access to timely advice and information; enhance their ability to take full advantage of information and communication technologies; and improve linkages with other SMEs and large firms to encourage the emergence and development of innovative clusters; 11 OECD, 2000. \u201cDeclaration: The Bologna Charter on SME Policies\u201d, Declaration of 15 June 2000, OECD, Paris. http://webnet.oecd.org/oecdacts/Instruments/ShowInstrumentView.aspx?InstrumentID=153&InstrumentPID=149&L ang=en&Book=False 12 OECD, 2004. \u201cIstanbul Ministerial Declaration on Fostering T ",
        "15 c) Policies that contribute to mobilising human resources in order to promote entrepreneurship. This involves: \u2022 Developing a culture that encourages entrepreneurship and recognises entrepreneurial success. The integration of entrepreneurship at all levels of the formal education system can facilitate this. Formal education should be complemented by learning-by-doing activities and other practical workshops. This objective requires paying particular attention to teacher training programmes; \u2022 Promoting the diffusion of training programmes and lifelong learning opportunities by stimulating market provision of such services and, where the need exists, providing hands-on focused courses funded by the public sector; \u2022 Promoting women's entrepreneurship through the elimination of barriers to enterprise creation and growth, such as impediments to the right to hold property or to sign contracts, where such impediments exist, and by taking into account at the design stage the impact of SME-related policies on women's entrepreneurship; \u2022 Mobilising disadvantaged groups. One way to pursue this objective is to develop policies and programmes which provide business support services targeted to these groups and disseminate information to those wanting to start and grow a business; RECOGNISE that, while priorities in terms of specific elements of SME policies vary greatly among participants due to their differing stages of development, political contexts and institutional arrangements, several key themes stand out as being of particular importance: a) The need to reduce barriers to SME access to global markets. Policies should aim to encourage the smooth, cross-border growth of SMEs including in some instances through the promotion of business linkages between large enterprises and SMEs. This can be achieved by reducing administrative and legal burdens, by facilitating compliance by internationally active SMEs with multiple sets of rules and requirements (in areas such as intellectual property rights, product standards, financial market regulations and customs procedures), by promoting harmonisation -- as appropriate -- of rules and requirements in order to reduce the cost of such compliance, and by fostering -- to the fullest possible extent -- the development of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms; b) The need to improve access to financing for SMEs on reasonable terms. While SMEs' financing requirements differ at each stage of their development, policies should aim to ensure that markets can provide financing for credit-worthy SMEs and that innovative SMEs with good growth prospects have access to appropriately structured risk capital at all stages of their development. Policies should also contribute to increasing the managerial and technical expertise of those intermediaries whose role is to evaluate and monitor companies with a view to matching expanding small firms with investors; c) The need to develop a strong \"evaluation culture\" in ministries and agencies responsible for SME policies and programmes. Evaluation provides a means of ensuring that SME programmes remain cost- effective and adapt to changing conditions in a dynamic world. Ideally, evaluation would be mandated and budgeted for when programmes are designed, would be carried out by independent but informed evaluators, and would generate recommendations for improving and strengthening those programmes that should be retained; d) The need to strengthen the factual and analytical basis for policy making so that policy makers can make decisions in an informed manner based on empirical evidence. This requires both reliable and internationally comparable data and statistics on which analytical work can be based as well as cross- country comparative studies and longitudinal analyses which can assess the impact of economic forces and ",

Policies should set measurable and meaningful targets, such as CO2 emissions reductions, or ensure that programme effectiveness is verified regularly. - Governments should implement systems to collect comprehensive and timely data on energy consumption by end-use in the buildings sector, as well as data on building characteristics, technology deployment, market breakdown, costs and efficiency. This will help improve policy development and allow the monitoring of progress towards roadmap goals. - A wide variety of standardised information packages, tailored to individual decision makers\u2019 needs, should be developed to allow decision makers to compare the potential of technology alternatives, identify performance targets and energy and CO2 savings at the time of design or purchase. - Governments should improve standard education of key professionals, such as architects, designers, engineers, builders, building owners and operators/users in the potential of existing and soon to be commercialised heating and cooling equipment. - Policies such as minimum energy performance standards, labelling, utility programmes and financial incentives are needed over the next 10 years to address market barriers \u2013 such as high initial costs and low priority of energy efficiency in decision-making \u2013 and market failures (e.g. principal-agent problems, transaction costs, search costs, compliance issues). Governments need to highlight the role of technologies in reducing financial risks, such as energy and carbon price volatility. 14 OECD/IEA, 2011. \u201cTechnology Roadmap: Energy-efficient Buildings: Heating and Cooling Equipment\u201d, OECD/IEA, Paris. http://www.iea.org/papers/2011/buildings_roadmap.pdf ",
        "20 - Over the next 10 years governments should expand and/or implement mandatory quality assurance and certification schemes for equipment and installers (including training). These should be harmonised across the heating and cooling technology industry, so that decision makers are faced with a simplified decision process. - Industry and governments need to work together and share information on an international level to help lower costs, accelerate technology deployment, and provide quality and performance assurance for installed systems. Key areas for collaboration include research, market deployment, performance and test procedures, setting of energy and CO2 emissions reduction targets/standards, harmonisation/comparability of heating and cooling system tests, and policy development. Additional policy conclusions can be drawn from an earlier publication of the IEA conducted in support of the G8 Plan of Action 15 : Ad 4.2 Renewable Energy To sustain the momentum in renewable energy development, the IEA, in its latest progress report on renewable energy (IEA/OECD, 2011 16 ) lists a number of recommendations (p.20, IEA/OECD, 2011 for energy ministers in support of clean energy development: - Remove non \u2010 economic barriers, such as administrative hurdles, obstacles to grid access, poor electricity market design, lack of information and training, and social acceptance issues. - Develop adaptive, predictable and transparent support frameworks to attract investment. - Develop and implement transitional incentives guaranteeing specific \u2013 but decreasing \u2013 levels of support as different technologies advance in their degree maturity and move towards market competitiveness. - Give due consideration to the impact of large \u2010 scale penetration of renewable energy technologies on the overall energy system, especially in liberalised energy markets, with regard to overall cost efficiency and system reliability. - Expand the use of renewable energy for off \u2010 grid and mini \u2010 grid applications. 15 OECD/IEA, 2008. \u201cEnergy Efficiency Requirements in Building Codes, Energy Efficiency Policies for New Buildings\u201d, IEA Information Paper, OECD/IEA, Paris. 16 IEA/OECD, (2011). \u201cClean energy: Progress Report: IEA input to the Clean Energy Ministerial\u201d, IEA/OECD, Paris. http://www.iea.org/papers/2011/CEM_Progress_Report.pdf ",

Key pillars of the recommendations are confined around risk awareness and education, risk assessment and disaster risk reduction and management tools. Risk assessments are recommended as the basis for disaster risk management, requiring an understanding of physical and economic exposure and vulnerability to natural hazards as well as their geographical distribution. Advanced disaster risk modelling techniques are recommended to improve policy makers\u2019 understanding for disaster risk management interventions. The publication of hazard maps is recommended so to increase not only policy makers\u2019 but also the larger public\u2019s awareness of existing hazards. An official recommendation was issued in 2005 18 on the School Seismic Safety Programmes.

        "25 Instruments/Guidance from the OECD Ad 6.1 Water sector In the beginning of the 21 st century the OECD reported (OECD, 2000 19 ) an increased conscience among OECD countries to achieve full cost recovery in the provision of water services. The report stated that the introduction of such an approach (as opposed to a subsidy-based approach) has led households and industrial water users to change their water consumption patterns. In further developing policies for water the OECD in 2009 20 recommended achieving tariff levels for water that allow for long-term sustainability in water usage. The cost sharing of users is crucial to achieve financial sustainability and efficient water use in the long run. Tariffs should however cover the full costs of water provision, including replacement costs or infrastructure expansion, and environmental and opportunity costs of using the resource. The most recent OECD report (OECD, 2010 21 ) concludes that the first best choice for water pricing in OECD countries can\u2019t be achieved because water metering that would allow for marginal cost pricing is not installed throughout countries. A second observation notes that most OECD countries recover operation and maintenance costs in water pricing, for domestic and industrial uses. However, when it comes to pricing abstraction and pollution instruments tend to be used as sources of revenues instead of prices that reflect the scarcity value of the resource. A potential reason for this shortcoming could be the administrative costs of building and administering the information base and computing capacity to calculate this value. The report concludes that revenues rarely cover full economic or sustainability costs.

Domestic policies and/or programmes implemented under this Recommendation shall not lead to or create unnecessary obstacles to international trade of waste destined for recovery operations. For the purpose of this Recommendation, taking into account the size of the enterprise, especially the situation of small and medium size enterprises (SMEs), the type and amount of waste, the nature of the operation and their domestic legislation, Member countries should: 1. Have an adequate regulatory and enforcement infrastructure at an appropriate governmental level, consisting of legal requirements such as authorisations/licences/permits, or standards; 2. Develop and implement practices and instruments that facilitate the efforts of competent authorities to monitor the implementation of the CPEs listed in Annex I to this Recommendation and control compliance of waste management activities with applicable national and international rules and regulations. In case of non-compliance with existing rules, prompt, adequate and effective actions should be undertaken; 3. Ensure that waste management facilities are operating according to best available techniques while taking into consideration the technical, operational and economic feasibility of doing so, and work towards continually improving environmental performance; 4. Encourage, through appropriate measures, information exchange between producers, waste generators, waste managers and authorities, including participation in sectoral trade or industry association activities addressing these issues, in order to foster waste prevention, optimise recovery operations and minimise quantities as well as potential risk of waste destined for disposal or recovery; 5. Integrate into national policies and/or programmes the core performance elements listed in Annex I to this Recommendation, which constitute the basic requirements to ensure environmentally sound management of waste; 22 http://webnet.oecd.org/oecdacts/Instruments/ShowInstrumentView.aspx?InstrumentID=51&InstrumentPID=48&La ng=en&Book=False ",
        "27 6. Consider incentives and/or relief measures for facilities that fulfil the core performance elements listed in Annex I to this Recommendation; 7. Implement the technical guidance for environmentally sound management of waste that has been developed by the OECD and, where appropriate, work towards the implementation of other ESM guidance referred to in Annex III to this Recommendation; 8. Move towards internalisation of environmental and human health costs in waste management, taking into account the differences between hazardous and non-hazardous waste; 9. Provide incentives to take part in environmentally sound recycling schemes; 10. Encourage the development and implementation of an environmental liability regime for facilities that carry out risky or potentially risky activities to ensure adequate measures upon definite cessation of activities and to prevent environmental damage; 11. Ensure that the implementation of the core performance elements listed in Annex I to this Recommendation does not discourage recycling in Member countries, recognising, in particular, the flexibility appropriate for each Member country to increase the rates of environmentally sound recovery of low risk waste.

        "30 In 2004 the OECD issued a Recommendation of the Council 24 that stipulates: - That good economic, environmental and health assessments of transport policy and project proposals are essential to ensuring efficient and robust decision making and cost effective use of resources - That systematic evaluation of economic, social and environmental effects should underpin all transport plans and programmes and all major transport sector investments - Evaluations of infrastructure investments should be undertaken with equal rigor whatever the mode of transport concerned A guidance report has been published in 2010 that outlines methods to decide on priorities for transport investments. Among the methods discussed are Cost-Benefit and Multi-criteria Analyses that present a tool for bringing structure, rationality and transparency to infrastructure decisions and strategic policy choices. The report states that CBA remains a valuable tool for infrastructure decisions and strategic policy choices. However, the tool is not in itself sufficient to make decisions, and current decision-making processes show that decisions do not always follow the recommendations of CBA. Nevertheless, more consistent use of CBA-type appraisal would lead to better decisions overall. In order to maximise its potential value, CBA needs to be sufficiently broad. Excluding impacts on the grounds they are poorly understood becomes problematic when these impacts are essential to the project. The better approach is to account explicitly for uncertainty. This imposes rigour on how trade-offs between various objectives are handled. It also highlights the need for more research to improve knowledge of the impacts of investments in relation to strategic objectives. CBA is evolving, with a gradual expansion of the scope of the analysis. Coupled with the use of transparent summary tables to present results alongside distributional effects and other indicators critical to political priorities, CBA is well suited to addressing changing strategic policy priorities and emerging demands for project programming. see: OECD, 2010. \u201cImproving the Practice of Transport Project Appraisal\u201d, OECD, Paris. http://www.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/display.asp?k=5KGHRJMTNMLR&lang=fr Further references See the application of strategic environmental assessment by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development: Kennedy, W. and Haumer, A.

Ad 8.2 Self-employment, entrepreneurship and business creation - The OECD\u2019s work on SME\u2019s and entrepreneurship keeps emphasizing the need to foster SME and entrepreneurship framework conditions, i.e. unnecessary obstacles to SME\u2019s and entrepreneurship including access to finance and intellectual property protection should be avoided (OECD, 2010 29 ); - access to finance represents a serious barrier and policy responses such as grants, loans, loan guarantees, venture capital etc should be explored (OECD 2006b, 2007 30 ) (see similar information provided on condition no.3) Ad 8.4.

On the employer\u2019s side it has been found that making the judicial procedures more predictable decreases the risk resulting from laying off employees. Another policy provision to increase labour market flexibility is the \u201cflexicurity\u201d system, an approach that facilitates hiring and firing decisions while providing efficient re-employment services, such as intensified job-search assistance, and income support to workers in the event of lay-off. On the other hand policies could entail an employee\u2019s special fund to which the employer makes a contribution and which can be accessed in the event of a lay-off. The fund thereby replaces any other firing costs potentially incurred by the employer.

        "42 \u2013 A Member State has adopted a framework outlining available budgetary resources for health care . Instruments/Guidance from the OECD Ad. 10.1 Active Inclusion The OECD has analyzed poverty and inequality levels across OECD countries extensively (see for example the latest publication - OECD, 2008 42 ). The main recommendations for policies that address poverty and inequality addressed in this the latest publication are: - it is crucial to know the exact goal of poverty reduction pursued by governments as the effects of different policies will depend on the characteristics of the people who are supposed to benefit from them - a national strategy needs to identify whether it aims at a \u201credistribution strategy\u201d using instruments for example like cash transfers and household taxes or a \u201cwork strategy \u201cthat aims at increasing work opportunities across a larger number of households. The latter typically aims at addressing poverty before it occurs. An ideal poverty reduction strategy requires a mix of both policy elements. - it is important to have adequate statistical infrastructure and good indicators to monitor the developments in poverty reduction and to allow for evaluating the impacts of different policies employed; comparative data is needed to assess the influence of common and country-specific factors In an effort to understand the effects of the financial crisis on the most vulnerable groups of society, the OECD organised roundtables and discussion forums in 2009 43 . The work resulted in three major recommendations for policies: 1. Strengthen existing data sources, and avoid compromising reliability for quicker delivery of data Some specific proposals stand out in this respect, in particular that of including in existing surveys specific questions on household income (in ongoing Labour Force Surveys) and on financial conditions and material deprivation (in consumer sentiment surveys). Another proposal was that of redesigning household income surveys so as to allow processing of the data six months after the completion of the fieldwork. 2. Leverage a range of other sources to provide a more timely account of the social impacts of the crises In particular, information from the administrative data (e.g. on programme beneficiaries) should be exploited: while access to these sources remains an issue, and they may need some further development before they can be used, a lot can be learned from practices in other countries. Data from other sources \u2013 such as information collected by providers of social services, and by financial institutions \u2013 could also be exploited. Mobilising these various sources is important also to avoid unsubstantiated claims on the social impacts of the crises by the media. 3. Explore the potential of microsimulation models to assess the impact of the crises on households 42 OECD, 2008. \u201cGrowing Unequal? Income Distribution and Poverty in OECD Countries\u201d, OECD, Paris. http://www.oecd.org/document/4/0,3343,en_2649_33933_41460917_1_1_1_1,00.html 43 OECD, 2009. \u201cIncome Distribution and Poverty\u201d, OECD, Paris. http://www.oecd.org/document/14/0,3746,en_2649_33933_38910286_1_1_1_1,00.html ",
        "43 Several participants noted the role of microsimulation models, available at both the international (e.g. EUROMOD, at the EU level) and national level, to build scenarios describing the potential impact of a number of macro-economic shocks (e.g. higher unemployment, lower pension assets) on people with different characteristics and on welfare programmes. The OECD could play a coordination role in bringing together microsimulation experts and encouraging the production of consistent scenarios. Ad. 10.2 Health To stimulate greater efficiency in health care provision the OECD, in one of its latest publication 44 , promotes: - Greater information sharing to achieve a high-quality, value-for-money health care system - new ICTs can support the timely and accurate collection and exchange of health data that are likely to foster better care, and more efficient use of resources: \u2022 the electronic records of patients\u2019 health history can be made readily available to doctors, allowing to rapidly respond to conditions in an informed way; online access to clinical guidelines or drug databases, monitoring the effects of disease and therapies on the patient over time, and detecting and preventing medication errors could significantly increase patients\u2019 safety \u2022 ICTs can contribute to the reduction of operating costs of clinical services through improvement in the way tasks are performed, by saving time with data processing, and by reducing multiple handling of documents. \u2022 ICTs can reduce administrative costs by for example introduce electronic claim processing To materialise the potential benefits of the introduction of ICT\u2019s policies need to: - Establish robust and coherent privacy protection - Align incentives with health system priorities - Accelerate and steer interoperability efforts - Strengthen monitoring and evaluation Another set of recommendations can be drawn from the Report on \u201cValue for Money in Health Spending\u201d 45 : - large efficiency gains could be made through introducing rational decision making into clinical care, so called Evidence-based medicine (EMP) and health technology assessment (HTA) can be used to inform decision making at the patient level (clinical guidelines) - incentive models that reward quality could be another avenue to increase efficiency \u2013 so called \u201cpay for performance (P4P)\u201d 44 OECD, 2010. \u201cImproving Health Sector Efficiency: The Role of Information and Communication Technologies, OECD Health Policy Studies, OECD, Paris. 45 OECD, 2010. \u201cValue for Money in Health Spending\u201d, OECD, Paris.

The 2005 report of the OECD [1] ( \u201cModernising Government: the way forward\u201d) takes stock of the past two decades of public sector modernisation in OECD countries. It identifies levers for reform to modernise the public sector and defines different policy paths with the common objectives of making the public sector more responsive, transparent, and efficient. The levers of public sector modernisation are : 1/ Open Government; 2/ Enhancing Public Sector Performance; 3/ Modernising Accountability and Control; 4/ Reallocation and Restructuring; 5/ The Use of Market-type Mechanisms to Provide Government Services; 6/ Organising and Motivating Public Servants: Modernising Public Employment This suggests that the criteria listed above to strengthen administrative efficiency should be seen in a complementary manner rather than segmented approach. In a 2010 publication [2] , the OECD included a chapter on public administration reforms, which analyses a number of key challenges for implementing public administration reform, and discusses possible tools to [1] OECD, 2005. \u201cModernising Government: the way forward\u201d, OECD.

Again, this shows the need for promoting a whole-of-government approach to administrative efficiency, and limiting silos approaches. A whole-of-government approach implies a focus on all levels of government, not just the central/national government. The OECD is providing recommendations/guidance to member states for effective multi-level governance systems, in particular for regional development policy. SIGMA , a division of the OECD Public Governance and Territorial Development Directorate, works on public administration reforms in Central and Eastern European countries, as well as Middle East countries, and provides assistance in 4 main areas: 1) Legal Framework, Civil Service, Administrative Justice and Integrity (Administrative Law, Civil Service, Public Integrity); 2) External and Internal Audit and Financial Control (Public Expenditure Management; Public Internal Financial Control; External Audit); 3) Public Procurement ; 4) Policy and Regulatory Systems (Policy-Making and Co-ordination; Regulatory Management; Administrative Environment of Business).

Criteria for Fulfilment: Effective implementation and application of the EU directives on non-discrimination is ensured through: \u2013 institutional arrangements for the implementation, application and supervision of the EU directives on non-discrimination; \u2013 a strategy for training and dissemination of information for staff involved in the implementation of the funds; \u2013 measures to strengthen administrative capacity for implementation and application of the EU directives on non-discrimination. Instruments/Guidance from the OECD We understood that this conditionality relates to the following directives: \u2022 Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin: also called the \"Race Directive\" ( Directive 2000/43/EC on Anti-discrimination ) \u2022 Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation \u2022 Council Directive 2004/113/EC of 13 December 2004 implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services \u2022 Directive 2006/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation (recast) In terms of tackling inequalities with regard to gender please refer to the information listed under General Ex-Ante Conditionalities theme 2 \u201cGender equality\u201d. The OECD has presented a number of studies treating discrimination in an opportunity and employment context. It has stated that although almost all OECD countries have established laws to combat ",
        "50 discrimination on both gender and ethnic grounds, enforcement of these regulations is based on victims\u2019 willingness to claim their rights. The policy recommendations that have been made recently are 46 : - discrimination in labour markets is a crucial facto inflating disparities in employment and quality of job opportunities - advocates structural reforms to improve the employment prospects of under-represented groups by reducing the scope of discriminatory behaviours \u2013 these include: implementing competition-enhancing reforms of product markets that allows better allocation of resources and stronger economic growth boosting labour demand while at the same time reducing market rents stronger competition has weaken ability of employers to cover the costs of their prejudices in hiring and promoting; reduction of expected costs of hiring low-productive workers, relaxation of employment protection legislation and moderation in minimum wage increases and compression of the tax wedge on low-paid workers have potential to weaken discrimination in hiring, if the later is based on prior beliefs or stereotypes about average group performance - along with structural reforms the OECD recommends enforcement of legal prohibition of discrimination \u2013 enforcement relies on the victims\u2019 willingness to assert their claims, leaving many unaware of their rights regarding discrimination in the workplace; countries need to provide adequate institutional support to plaintiffs, specify compensatory damages in the legislation and make available alternative simplified procedures for dispute resolution; - recommends the implementation of anti-discrimination agencies to support the enforcement of discrimination legislation, so that the system is not dependent on individuals filing claims; the agencies need to be effectively empowered to investigate companies, take actions against employers suspected of operating discriminatory practices, and sanction them when evidence is found on discrimination - emphasises the need to fight discrimination not only on the repression of unwanted behaviours, but to promote cultural changes and redefine socially acceptable practices \u2013 promoting codes of conduct to help employers avoid discriminatory actions; governments can develop incentive schemes to elicit virtuous behaviours, such as labels for non-discriminatory practices and financial incentives for specific positive actions 46 OECD, 2008. \u201cEmployment Outlook\u201d, OECD, Paris. ",
        "51 B. Gender equality The existence of a strategy for the promotion of gender equality and a mechanism which ensures its effective implementation. Criteria for Fulfilment: Effective implementation and application of an explicit strategy for the promotion of gender equality is ensured through: - a system for collecting and analysing data and indicators broken down by sex and to develop evidences- based gender policies; - a plan and ex ante criteria for the integration of gender equality objectives through gender standards and guidelines; - implementation mechanisms including involvement of a gender body and the relevant expertise to draft, monitor and evaluate the interventions Instruments/Guidance from the OECD The OECD has issued a declaration 47 on policies for the employment of women stipulating: The following aims should be given priority consideration in the formulation of the relevant policies of Member countries, bearing in mind the possibility of constrained growth of employment opportunities: i)To adopt employment policies which offer men and women equal employment opportunities, independently of the rate of economic growth and conditions in the labour market; ii)To adopt policies to deal with unemployment which do not discriminate either directly or indirectly against women; iii)To implement an integrated set of policies to eliminate segregation in employment and reduce differentials in average earnings between women and men by means of: a)The prohibition by law of direct discrimination; b)Positive action to reduce indirect discrimination in recruitment, training and promotion, and in other terms and conditions of employment; c)The reduction of persistent social biases and negative institutional practices which limit the range and level of occupations open to girls and women; and d)The implementation of equal pay for work of equal value[1]; iv)To give attention to the special problems of minority women in the relevant items herein; 47 OECD, 1980. \u201cDeclaration on Policies for the Employment of Women\u201d, The High Level Conference on the Employment of Women of OECD Member Countries, OECD, Paris.

That the achievement of equal opportunity in employment and the elimination of wage differentials between women and men are dependent not only on government measures but on the concerted efforts of employers and trade unions. That the pursuit of these aims by Member countries will be facilitated by strengthened co-operation through the competent bodies of the OECD, in particular by studies of women's employment in the context of emerging economic and social conditions, and by periodic assessments and evaluations of the implementation of equal opportunity and wage equality policies for women.

        "53 The Gender Initiative at the OECD was created in 2011 to support governments in the promotion of gender equality especially in education, employment and entrepreneurship 48 . In its first report 49 the initiative recommends: - to engage in increasing the share of women in the labour market because it will increase labour productivity, widen the base of taxpayers and contributions to social protection systems and will further help promote innovation and competitiveness in business. - a key recommendation with respect to education equality is to adopt policies that address stereotyping in education and training choices and to enhance the quality of education and efficient management of resources to improve outcomes of girls (and boys) - a key recommendation with respect o employment equality is to provide strong financial incentives to both parents to participate in paid work, to expand fathers\u2019 parental leave entitlement and to combat active discrimination - a key recommendation with respect to equality in entrepreneurship is to support innovation for women- owned enterprises; design better evidence-based policies, improve data collection and analysis; and provide an accurate and systematic description of gender differences in business demographics For further information: With the OECDs Governance directorate there is an ongoing process of synthesizing recently conducted studies on gender among OECD countries, whose results will be published both in official reports and more specific guidance documents. 48 http://www.oecd.org/document/31/0,3746,en_2649_34819_47860895_1_1_1_1,00.html 49 OECD, 2011. \u201cReport on the Gender Initiative: Gender Equality in Education, Employment and Entrepreneurship\u201d, OECD, Paris. http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/7/5/48111145.pdf ",
        "54 C. Disability The existence of a mechanism which ensures effective implementation and application of the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities. Criteria for Fulfilment: Effective implementation and application of the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities is ensured through: \u2013 Implementation of measures in line with Article 9 of the UN Convention to identify and eliminate obstacles and barriers to accessibility of persons with disabilities to, inter alia, - Buildings, roads, transportation and other indoor and outdoor facilities, including schools, housing, medical facilities and workplaces; information, communications and other services, including electronic services and emergency services. \u2013 institutional arrangements for the implementation and supervision of the UN Convention in line with Article 33 of the Convention \u2013 a plan for training and dissemination of information for staff involved in the implementation of the funds; \u2013 measures to strengthen administrative capacity for implementation and application of the UN Convention Instruments/Guidance from the OECD In terms of disability, the OECD\u2019s focus of work centres around the integration of disabled people in the work environment. The OECD has worked on policies that promote work and income security for disabled people (OECD, 2003a 50 ) as well as access of disabled people to higher education (OECD, 2003b 51 ). In its latest publication (OECD, 2010 52 ) the OECD underlines the continued need to break labour market barriers for disabled people and to reduce the dependence on benefits and exclusion since, among other advantages, higher employment promotes social inclusion and reduces risks of falling into poverty. A key instrument to know whether and what type of policy instruments work best is rigorous evaluation. Currently the OECD identifies a lack of evidence that needs to be addressed by investing more in collecting data and evaluation outcomes. An important barrier to improving labour market access for disabled people is the political environment. Cutting benefit entitlements and forcing disabled people to undergo training or seek work is unpopular and not fair for some groups. However, the slow-moving reform approach is not good enough for those people who can and want to work and who are too often excluded and living in poverty. 50 OECD, 2003a. \u201cTransforming Disability into Ability \u2013 Policies to promote work and income security for disabled people\u201d, OECD, Paris. http://www.oecd.org/document/14/0,3746,en_2649_34747_35290126_1_1_1_1,00.html 51 OECD, 2003b. \u201cDisability in Higher Education\u201d, OECD, Paris. http://www.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/display.asp?lang=fr&sf1=DI&st1=5LMQCR2K1C8T 52 OECD, 2010. \u201cSickness, Disability and Work.

This means promoting transparency and accountability from the definition of needs throughout the bidding until the contract management and payment. Recommendation of the Council on Enhancing Integrity in Public Procurement 16 October 2008 - C(2008)105 THE COUNCIL, HAVING REGARD to articles 1, 2 a), 3 and 5 b) of the Convention on the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development of 14 December 1960; HAVING REGARD to the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions adopted on 21 November 1997, the Revised Recommendation of the Council on Combating Bribery in International Business Transactions adopted on 23 May 1997 and the related Recommendation on Anti- corruption Proposals for Bilateral Aid Procurement endorsed by the Development Assistance Committee on 7 May 1996; NOTING that legislation in a number of Member countries also reflects other international legal instruments on public procurement and anti-corruption developed within the framework of the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation or the European Union; 53 For details of the recommendation: http://acts.oecd.org/Instruments/ShowInstrumentView.aspx?InstrumentID=131&Lang=en&Book=False ",
        "56 RECOGNISING that public procurement is a key economic activity of governments that is particularly vulnerable to mismanagement, fraud and corruption; RECOGNISING that efforts to enhance good governance and integrity in public procurement contribute to an efficient and effective management of public resources and therefore of tax payer's money; NOTING that international efforts to support public procurement reforms have in the past mainly focused on the promotion of competitive tendering with a view to ensuring a level playing field in the selection of suppliers; RECOGNISING that Member countries share a common interest in preventing risks to integrity throughout the entire public procurement cycle, starting from needs assessment until contract management and payment; On the proposal of the Public Governance Committee: I. RECOMMENDS: 1. That Member countries take appropriate steps to develop and implement an adequate policy framework for enhancing integrity throughout the entire public procurement cycle, from needs assessment to contract management and payment; 2. That, in developing policies for enhancing integrity in public procurement, Member countries take into account the Principles which are contained in the Annex to this Recommendation of which it forms an integral part; 3. That Member countries also disseminate the Principles to the private sector, which plays a key role in the delivery of goods and services for the public service. II. INVITES the Secretary General to disseminate the Principles to non-member economies and to encourage them to take the Principles into account in the promotion of public governance, aid effectiveness, the fight against international bribery and competition. III. INSTRUCTS the Public Governance Committee to report to the Council on progress made in implementing this Recommendation within three years of its adoption and regularly thereafter, in consultation with other relevant Committees. PRINCIPLES FOR ENHANCING INTEGRITY IN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT I. Objective and Scope 1. The Recommendation provides policy makers with Principles for enhancing integrity throughout the entire public procurement cycle, taking into account international laws, as well as national laws and organisational structures of Member countries. 2. The Recommendation is primarily directed at policy makers in governments at the national level but also offers general guidance for sub-national government and state-owned enterprises. II. Definitions Public Procurement Cycle 3. In the context of the present Recommendation, the public procurement cycle is defined as a sequence of related activities, from needs assessment, to the award stage, up until the contract management and final payment. Integrity ",
        "57 4. The Recommendation aims to address a variety of risks to integrity in the public procurement cycle. Integrity can be defined as the use of funds, resources, assets, and authority, according to the intended official purposes and in line with public interest. A 'negative' approach to define integrity is also useful to determine an effective strategy for preventing 'integrity violations' in the field of public procurement. Integrity violations include: \u2022 Corruption including bribery, 'kickbacks', nepotism, cronyism and clientelism; \u2022 Fraud and theft of resources, for example through product substitution in the delivery which results in lower quality materials; \u2022 Conflict of interest in the public service and in post-public employment; \u2022 Collusion; \u2022 Abuse and manipulation of information; \u2022 Discriminatory treatment in the public procurement process; and \u2022 The waste and abuse of organisational resources. III. Principles 5. The following ten Principles are based on applying good governance elements to enhance integrity in public procurement. These include elements of transparency, good management, prevention of misconduct, as well as accountability and control. An important aspect of integrity in public procurement is an overarching obligation to treat potential suppliers and contractors on an equitable basis. A. Transparency 1. Member countries should provide an adequate degree of transparency in the entire public procurement cycle in order to promote fair and equitable treatment for potential suppliers. 6. Governments should provide potential suppliers and contractors with clear and consistent information so that the public procurement process is well understood and applied as equitably as possible. Governments should promote transparency for potential suppliers and other relevant stakeholders, such as oversight institutions, not only regarding the formation of contracts but in the entire public procurement cycle. Governments should adapt the degree of transparency according to the recipient of information and the stage of the cycle. In particular, governments should protect confidential information to ensure a level playing field for potential suppliers and avoid collusion. They should also ensure that public procurement rules require a degree of transparency that enhances corruption control while not creating 'red tape' to ensure the effectiveness of the system. 2. Member countries should maximise transparency in competitive tendering and take precautionary measures to enhance integrity, in particular for exceptions to competitive tendering. 7. To ensure sound competitive processes, governments should provide clear rules, and possibly guidance, on the choice of the procurement method and on exceptions to competitive tendering. Although the procurement method could be adapted to the type of procurement concerned, governments should, in all cases, maximise transparency in competitive tendering. Governments should consider setting up procedures to mitigate possible risks to integrity through enhanced transparency, guidance and control, in particular for exceptions to competitive tendering such as extreme urgency or national security. B. Good Management 3. Member countries should ensure that public funds are used in public procurement according to the purposes intended. ",
        "58 8. Procurement planning and related expenditures are key to reflecting a long-term and strategic view of government needs. Governments should link public procurement with public financial management systems to foster transparency and accountability as well as to improve value for money. Oversight institutions such as internal control and internal audit bodies, supreme audit institutions or parliamentary committees should monitor the management of public funds to verify that needs are adequately estimated and public funds are used according to the purposes intended. 4. Member countries should ensure that procurement officials meet high professional standards of knowledge, skills and integrity. 9. Recognising officials who work in the area of public procurement as a profession is critical to enhancing resistance to mismanagement, waste and corruption. Governments should invest in public procurement accordingly and provide adequate incentives to attract highly qualified officials. They should also update officials' knowledge and skills on a regular basis to reflect regulatory, management and technological evolutions. Public officials should be aware of integrity standards and be able to identify potential conflict between their private interests and public duties that could influence public decision making. C. Prevention of Misconduct, Compliance and Monitoring 5. Member countries should put mechanisms in place to prevent risks to integrity in public procurement. 10. Governments should provide institutional or procedural frameworks that help protect officials in public procurement against undue influence from politicians or higher level officials. Governments should ensure that the selection and appointment of officials involved in public procurement are based on values and principles, in particular integrity and merit. In addition, they should identify risks to integrity for job positions, activities, or projects that are potentially vulnerable. Governments should prevent these risks through preventative mechanisms that foster a culture of integrity in the public service such as integrity training, asset declarations, as well as the disclosure and management of conflict of interest. 6. Member countries should encourage close co-operation between government and the private sector to maintain high standards of integrity, particularly in contract management. 11. Governments should set clear integrity standards and ensure compliance in the entire procurement cycle, particularly in contract management. Governments should record feedback on experience with individual suppliers to help public officials in making decisions in the future. Potential suppliers should also be encouraged to take voluntary steps to reinforce integrity in their relationship with the government. Governments should maintain a dialogue with suppliers' organisations to keep up-to-date with market evolutions, reduce information asymmetry and improve value for money, in particular for high-value procurements. 7. Member countries should provide specific mechanisms to monitor public procurement as well as to detect misconduct and apply sanctions accordingly. 12. Governments should set up mechanisms to track decisions and enable the identification of irregularities and potential corruption in public procurement. Officials in charge of control should be aware of the techniques and actors involved in corruption to facilitate the detection of misconduct in public procurement. In order to facilitate this, governments should also consider establishing procedures for reporting misconduct and for protecting officials from reprisal. Governments should not only define sanctions by law but also provide the means for them to be applied in case of breach in an effective, proportional and timely manner. D. Accountability and Control 8. Member countries should establish a clear chain of responsibility together with effective control mechanisms. 13. Governments should establish a clear chain of responsibility by defining the authority for approval, based on an appropriate segregation of duties, as well as the obligations for internal reporting. In addition, the regularity and ",
        "59 thoroughness of controls should be proportionate to the risks involved. Internal and external controls should complement each other and be carefully co-ordinated to avoid gaps or loopholes and ensure that the information produced by controls is as complete and useful as possible. 9. Member countries should handle complaints from potential suppliers in a fair and timely manner. 14. Governments should ensure that potential suppliers have effective and timely access to review systems of procurement decisions and that these complaints are promptly resolved. To ensure an impartial review, a body with enforcement capacity that is independent of the respective procuring entities should rule on procurement decisions and provide adequate remedies. Governments should also consider establishing alternative dispute settlement mechanisms to reduce the time for solving complaints. Governments should analyse the use of review systems to identify patterns where individual firms could be using reviews to unduly interrupt or influence tenders. This analysis of review systems should also help identify opportunities for management improvement in key areas of public procurement. 10. Member countries should empower civil society organisations, media and the wider public to scrutinise public procurement. 15. Governments should disclose public information on the key terms of major contracts to civil society organisations, media and the wider public. The reports of oversight institutions should also be made widely available to enhance public scrutiny. To complement these traditional accountability mechanisms, governments should consider involving representatives from civil society organisations and the wider public in monitoring high- value or complex procurements that entail significant risks of mismanagement and corruption. In 2011 a report is being presented to the OECD council on the extent to which the principles adopted in the recommendation have been implemented and the next steps proposed to further the development of the principles. The OECD also provides an on-line Toolkit with examples of good practices to help governments put policy into practice 54 . The OECD\u2019s principles on integrity in public procurement are: Transparency -Provide an adequate degree of transparency in the entire procurement cycle in order to promote fair and equitable treatment for suppliers/bidders. -Maximise transparency in competitive tendering and take precautionary measures to enhance integrity, in particular for exceptions to competitive tendering. Good Management -Ensure that public funds are used in procurement according to the purposes intended. -Ensure that procurement practitioners meet high professional standards of knowledge, skills and integrity. Prevention of misconduct, compliance and monitoring -Put mechanisms in place to prevent risks to integrity in public procurement. 54 The Toolkit can be accessed at: www.oecd.org/governance/procurement/toolbox ",
        "60 -Encourage close co-operation between government and the private sector to maintain high standards of integrity, particularly in contract management. -Provide specific mechanisms to monitor public procurement as well as detect misconduct and apply sanctions accordingly. Accountability and control -Establish a clear chain of responsibility together with effective control mechanisms. -Handle complaints from suppliers/bidders in a fair and timely manner. -Empower civil society organisations, media and the wider public to scrutinise public procurement.

To provide tailored policy advice to countries in enhancing transparency, safeguarding integrity and preventing risks of waste and corruption in the public procurement cycle, the OECD has carried out peer reviews of procurement systems in member countries (e.g. Mexico and the United States) and non member countries (e.g. Brazil, Iraq, Morocco, Yemen). The OECD also analyses public procurement systems from competition, anti-bribery and aid effectiveness perspectives. In particular it promotes suspension/debarment of companies that bribed foreign public officials as part of the Convention on Criminalising Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions 56 . Moreover, the Guidelines for Fighting Bid Rigging in Public Procurement 57 assist procurement officials to reduce the risks of bid rigging through careful design of the procurement process as well as to detect bid rigging conspiracies during the procurement process. 55 Comparative data is available in the 2009 and 2011 editions of Government at a Glance: http://www.oecd.org/gov/indicators/govataglance. 56 The convention from 1997 and some updated recommendations from 2009 can be found at http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/4/18/38028044.pdf 57 The guidelines can be found online: http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/27/19/42851044.pdf ",
        "61 As part of its aid effectiveness agenda, the OECD has developed a Recommendation on aid- funded procurement 58 and a self-assessment methodology and is assisting in collaboration with World Bank developing countries in modernizing their country procurement systems. The recommendations of the OECD\u2019s Anti-Bribery Convention and the progress of G20 countries in adopting and implementing it, was outlined in the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group to G20 Leaders on \u201cIndividual and Collective Progress made by G20 Countries in the Implementation of the Seoul Action Plan\u201d.

        "63 F. Statistical systems The existence of a statistical system necessary to undertake evaluations to assess the effectiveness and impact of the programmes. Criteria for Fulfilment: A multi-annual plan for timely collection and aggregation of data is in place that includes: \u2013 the identification of sources and mechanisms to ensure statistical validation; - arrangements for publication and public availability. Instruments/Guidance from the OECD The determination of whether a statistical system is of good quality, adequate or acceptable is judged along a set of criteria in the OECD. This set of criteria is for example applied if new countries wish to become members of the OECD. The benchmarks that need to be achieved for these accession countries are based on: \u2022 The UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics 60 : Preamble The Statistical Commission, - Bearing in mind that official statistical information is an essential basis for development in the economic, demographic, social and environmental fields and for mutual knowledge and trade among the States and peoples of the world. - Bearing in mind that the essential trust of the public in official statistical information depends to a large extent on respect for the fundamental values and principles which are the basis of any society which seeks to understand itself and to respect the rights of its members. - Bearing in mind that the quality of official statistics, and thus the quality of the information available to the Government, the economy and the public depends largely on the cooperation of citizens, enterprises, and other respondents in providing appropriate and reliable data needed for necessary statistical compilations and on the cooperation between users and producers of statistics in order to meet users' needs. - Recalling the efforts of governmental and non-governmental organisations active in statistics to establish standards and concepts to allow comparisons among countries, - Recalling also the International Statistical Institute Declaration of Professional Ethics, - Having expressed the opinion that resolution C (47), adopted by the Economic Commission for Europe on 15 April 1992, is of universal significance, 60 http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/statorg/FP-English.htm ",
        "64 - Noting that, at its eighth session, held in Bangkok in November 1993, the Working Group of Statistical Experts, assigned by the Committee on Statistics of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific to examine the Fundamental Principles, had agreed in principle to the ECE version and had emphasised that those principles were applicable to all nations, - Noting also that, at its eighth session, held at Addis Ababa in March 1994, the Joint Conference of African Planners, Statisticians and Demographers, considered that the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics are of universal significance, Adopts the present principles of official statistics: Principle 1. Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society, serving the Government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation. To this end, official statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honour citizens' entitlement to public information. Principle 2. To retain trust in official statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly professional considerations, including scientific principles and professional ethics, on the methods and procedures for the collection, processing, storage and presentation of statistical data. Principle 3. To facilitate a correct interpretation of the data, the statistical agencies are to present information according to scientific standards on the sources, methods and procedures of the statistics. Principle 4. The statistical agencies are entitled to comment on erroneous interpretation and misuse of statistics. Principle 5. Data for statistical purposes may be drawn from all types of sources, be they statistical surveys or administrative records. Statistical agencies are to choose the source with regard to quality, timeliness, costs and the burden on respondents. Principle 6. Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical compilation, whether they refer to natural or legal persons, are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes. Principle 7. The laws, regulations and measures under which the statistical systems operate are to be made public. Principle 8. Coordination among statistical agencies within countries is essential to achieve consistency and efficiency in the statistical system. Principle 9. The use by statistical agencies in each country of international concepts, classifications and methods promotes the consistency and efficiency of statistical systems at all official levels. Principle 10. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation in statistics contributes to the improvement of systems of official statistics in all countries. For the OECD examination of countries a very comprehensive template, based on the fundamental principles, guides the collection of detailed information on the laws and practices followed by the country\u2019s statistical system. ",
        "65 \u2022 An additional framework is provided by the Quality Framework for OECD Statistical Activities 61 , which is itself based on standards established by numerous member countries. The OECD Quality Framework outlined in this document focuses on improving the quality of data collected, compiled and disseminated by the OECD through an improvement in the Organisation\u2019s internal statistical processes and management, though there will also be a positive spill-over effect on the quality of data compiled at the national level. Thus, in a sense, the OECD quality initiative is similar to those developed by Statistics Canada and other NSOs, which also encompass statistical managerial and technical processes. The OECD Quality Framework has four elements: \u2022 a definition of quality and its dimensions; \u2022 a procedure for assuring the quality of proposed new statistical activities; \u2022 a procedure for evaluating the quality of existing statistical activities on a regular basis; \u2022 a set of broad principles on which OECD statistical activities are to be conducted and quality guidelines covering all phases of the statistical production process. Further references The European Commission\u2019s own Code of Practice 62 and the related guidelines on Peer Reviews provide an excellent and detailed framework for evaluation of the statistical system and statistics. 61 http://www.oecd.org/document/43/0,3746,en_2649_33715_21571947_1_1_1_1,00.html and http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/26/42/21688835.pdf 62 http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/quality/code_of_practice "
